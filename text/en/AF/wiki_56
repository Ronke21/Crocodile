<text>Stanley Kubrick (; July 26, 1928 – March 7, 1999) was an American film director, screenwriter, producer, and photographer. Widely considered one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, his films were nearly all adaptations of novels or short stories, spanning a number of genres and gaining recognition for their intense attention to detail, innovative cinematography, extensive set design, and dark humor.

Born in New York City, Kubrick was an average school student but displayed a keen interest in literature, photography, and film from a young age; he began to teach himself film producing and directing after graduating from high school. After working as a photographer for &quot;Look&quot; magazine in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he began making low-budget short films and made his first major Hollywood film, &quot;The Killing&quot;, for United Artists in 1956. This was followed by two collaborations with Kirk Douglas: the anti-war film &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957) and the historical epic film &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960).

In 1961, Kubrick left the United States due to concerns about crime in the country, as well as a growing dislike for how Hollywood operated and creative differences with Douglas and the film studios. He settled in England, which he would leave only a handful of times for the rest of his life. In 1978, he made his home at Childwickbury Manor with his wife Christiane, and it became his workplace where he centralized the writing, research, editing, and management of his productions. This permitted him almost complete artistic control over his films, with the rare advantage of financial support from major Hollywood studios. His first productions in England were two films with Peter Sellers: an adaptation of &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962) and the Cold War black comedy &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964).

A perfectionist who assumed direct control over most aspects of his filmmaking, Kubrick cultivated an expertise in writing, editing, color grading, promotion, and exhibition. He was famous for the painstaking care taken in researching his films and staging scenes, performed in close coordination with his actors, crew, and other collaborators. He frequently asked for several dozen retakes of the same shot in a film, often confusing and frustrating his actors. Despite the notoriety this provoked, many of Kubrick&#x27;s films broke new cinematic ground and are now considered landmarks. The scientific realism and innovative special effects in his science fiction epic &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) were a first in cinema history, and the film earned him his only Academy Award (for Best Visual Effects). Filmmaker Steven Spielberg has referred to &quot;2001&quot; as his generation&#x27;s &quot;big bang&quot; and it is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.

While many of Kubrick&#x27;s films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release—particularly the brutal &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971), which Kubrick withdrew from circulation in the UK following a media frenzy—most were nominated for Academy Awards, Golden Globes, or BAFTA Awards, and underwent critical re-evaluations. For the 18th-century period film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975), Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Carl Zeiss for NASA to film scenes by candlelight. With the horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), he became one of the first directors to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots, a technology vital to his Vietnam War film &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987). A few days after hosting a screening for his family and the stars of his final film, the erotic drama &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999), he died at the age of 70.

== Early life ==

Kubrick was born to a Jewish family in the Lying-In Hospital in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan borough on July 26, 1928. He was the first of two children of Jacob Leonard Kubrick, known as Jack or Jacques, and his wife Sadie Gertrude Kubrick (née Perveler), known as Gert. His sister Barbara Mary Kubrick was born in May 1934. Jack, whose parents and paternal grandparents were of Polish-Jewish and Romanian-Jewish origin, was a homeopathic doctor, graduating from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1927, the same year he married Kubrick&#x27;s mother, who was the child of Austrian-Jewish immigrants. On December 27, 1899, Kubrick&#x27;s great-grandfather Hersh Kubrick arrived at Ellis Island via Liverpool by ship at the age of 47, leaving behind his wife and two grown children (one of whom was Stanley&#x27;s grandfather Elias) to start a new life with a younger woman. Elias followed in 1902. At Stanley&#x27;s birth, the Kubricks lived in the Bronx. His parents married in a Jewish ceremony, but Kubrick was not raised religious and later professed an atheistic view. His father was a physician and, by the standards of the West Bronx, the family was fairly wealthy.

Soon after his sister&#x27;s birth, Kubrick began schooling in Public School 3 in the Bronx and moved to Public School 90 in June 1938. His IQ was above average but his attendance was poor. He displayed an interest in literature from a young age and began reading Greek and Roman myths and the fables of the Brothers Grimm, which &quot;instilled in him a lifelong affinity with Europe&quot;. He spent most Saturdays during the summer watching the New York Yankees and later photographed two boys watching the game in an assignment for &quot;Look&quot; magazine to emulate his own childhood excitement with baseball. When Kubrick was 12, his father Jack taught him chess. The game remained a lifelong interest of Kubrick&#x27;s, appearing in many of his films. Kubrick, who later became a member of the United States Chess Federation, explained that chess helped him develop &quot;patience and discipline&quot; in making decisions. When Kubrick was 13, his father bought him a Graflex camera, triggering a fascination with still photography. He befriended a neighbor, Marvin Traub, who shared his passion for photography. Traub had his own darkroom where he and the young Kubrick would spend many hours perusing photographs and watching the chemicals &quot;magically make images on photographic paper&quot;. The two indulged in numerous photographic projects for which they roamed the streets looking for interesting subjects to capture and spent time in local cinemas studying films. Freelance photographer Weegee (Arthur Fellig) had a considerable influence on Kubrick&#x27;s development as a photographer; Kubrick later hired Fellig as the special stills photographer for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964). As a teenager, Kubrick was also interested in jazz and briefly attempted a career as a drummer.

Kubrick attended William Howard Taft High School from 1941 to 1945. He joined the school&#x27;s photography club, which permitted him to photograph the school&#x27;s events in their magazine. He was a mediocre student, with a 67/D+ grade average. Introverted and shy, Kubrick had a low attendance record and often skipped school to watch double-feature films. He graduated in 1945 but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from World War II, eliminated any hope of higher education. Later in life Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of American schooling as a whole, maintaining that schools were ineffective in stimulating critical thinking and student interest. His father was disappointed in his son&#x27;s failure to achieve the excellence in school of which he knew Stanley was fully capable. Jack also encouraged Stanley to read from the family library at home, while permitting Stanley to take up photography as a serious hobby.

== Photographic career ==

While in high school, Kubrick was chosen as an official school photographer. In the mid-1940s, since he was unable to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the City College of New York, which had open admissions. Eventually, he sold a photographic series to &quot;Look&quot; magazine, which was printed on June 26, 1945. Kubrick supplemented his income by playing chess &quot;for quarters&quot; in Washington Square Park and various Manhattan chess clubs.

In 1946, he became an apprentice photographer for &quot;Look&quot; and later a full-time staff photographer. G. Warren Schloat Jr., another new photographer for the magazine at the time, recalled that he thought Kubrick lacked the personality to make it as a director in Hollywood, remarking, &quot;Stanley was a quiet fellow. He didn&#x27;t say much. He was thin, skinny, and kind of poor—like we all were.&quot; Kubrick quickly became known for his story-telling in photographs. His first, published on April 16, 1946, was titled &quot;A Short Story from a Movie Balcony&quot; and staged a fracas between a man and a woman, during which the man is slapped in the face, caught genuinely by surprise. In another assignment, Kubrick took 18 pictures of various people waiting in a dental office. It has been said retrospectively that this project demonstrated an early interest of Kubrick in capturing individuals and their feelings in mundane environments. In 1948, he was sent to Portugal to document a travel piece, and later that year covered the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus in Sarasota, Florida.
A boxing enthusiast, Kubrick eventually began photographing boxing matches for the magazine. His earliest, &quot;Prizefighter&quot;, was published on January 18, 1949, and captured a boxing match and the events leading up to it, featuring American middleweight Walter Cartier. On April 2, 1949, he published photo essay &quot;Chicago-City of Extremes&quot; in &quot;Look&quot;, which displayed his talent early on for creating atmosphere with imagery. The following year, in July 1950, the magazine published his photo essay, &quot;Working Debutante – Betsy von Furstenberg&quot;, which featured a Pablo Picasso portrait of Angel F. de Soto in the background. Kubrick was also assigned to photograph numerous jazz musicians, from Frank Sinatra and Erroll Garner to George Lewis, Eddie Condon, Phil Napoleon, Papa Celestin, Alphonse Picou, Muggsy Spanier, Sharkey Bonano, and others.

Kubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz on May 28, 1948. They lived together in a small apartment at 36 West 16th Street, off Sixth Avenue just north of Greenwich Village. During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the Museum of Modern Art and New York City cinemas. He was inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of French director Max Ophüls, whose films influenced Kubrick&#x27;s visual style, and by director Elia Kazan, whom he described as America&#x27;s &quot;best director&quot; at that time, with his ability of &quot;performing miracles&quot; with his actors. Friends began to notice Kubrick had become obsessed with the art of filmmaking—one friend, David Vaughan, observed that Kubrick would scrutinize the film at the cinema when it went silent, and would go back to reading his paper when people started talking. He spent many hours reading books on film theory and writing notes. He was particularly inspired by Sergei Eisenstein and Arthur Rothstein, the photographic technical director of &quot;Look&quot; magazine.

== Film career ==

=== Short films (1951–1953) ===
Kubrick shared a love of film with his school friend Alexander Singer, who after graduating from high school had the intention of directing a film version of Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. Through Singer, who worked in the offices of the newsreel production company, &quot;The March of Time&quot;, Kubrick learned it could cost $40,000 to make a proper short film, a sum he could not afford. He had $1500 in savings and produced a few short documentaries fueled by encouragement from Singer. He began learning all he could about filmmaking on his own, calling film suppliers, laboratories, and equipment rental houses.

Kubrick decided to make a short film documentary about boxer Walter Cartier, whom he had photographed and written about for &quot;Look&quot; magazine a year earlier. He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, &quot;Day of the Fight&quot;. Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. He had considered asking Montgomery Clift to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for &quot;Look&quot;, but settled on CBS news veteran Douglas Edwards. According to Paul Duncan the film was &quot;remarkably accomplished for a first film&quot;, and used a backward tracking shot to film a scene in which Cartier and his brother walk towards the camera, a device which later became one of Kubrick&#x27;s characteristic camera movements. Vincent Cartier, Walter&#x27;s brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming. He said, &quot;Stanley was a very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts. He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way. Whatever he wanted, you complied, he just captivated you. Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted&quot;. After a score was added by Singer&#x27;s friend Gerald Fried, Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Pathé for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time. Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work, and he later declared that the &quot;best education in film is to make one&quot;.
Inspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at &quot;Look&quot; and visited professional filmmakers in New York City, asking many detailed questions about the technical aspects of filmmaking. He stated that he was given the confidence during this period to become a filmmaker because of the number of bad films he had seen, remarking, &quot;I don&#x27;t know a goddamn thing about movies, but I know I can make a better film than that&quot;. He began making &quot;Flying Padre&quot; (1951), a film which documents Reverend Fred Stadtmueller, who travels some 4,000 miles to visit his 11 churches. The film was originally going to be called &quot;Sky Pilot&quot;, a pun on the slang term for a priest. During the course of the film, the priest performs a burial service, confronts a boy bullying a girl, and makes an emergency flight to aid a sick mother and baby into an ambulance. Several of the views from and of the plane in &quot;Flying Padre&quot; are later echoed in &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) with the footage of the spacecraft, and a series of close-ups on the faces of people attending the funeral were most likely inspired by Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot; (1925) and &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot; (1944/1958).

&quot;Flying Padre&quot; was followed by &quot;The Seafarers&quot; (1953), Kubrick&#x27;s first color film, which was shot for the Seafarers International Union in June 1953. It depicted the logistics of a democratic union and focused more on the amenities of seafaring other than the act. For the cafeteria scene in the film, Kubrick chose a dolly shot to establish the life of the seafarer&#x27;s community; this kind of shot would later become a signature technique. The sequence of Paul Hall, secretary-treasurer of the SIU Atlantic and gulf district, speaking to members of the union echoes scenes from Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Strike&quot; (1925) and &quot;&quot; (1928). &quot;Day of the Fight&quot;, &quot;Flying Padre&quot; and &quot;The Seafarers&quot; constitute Kubrick&#x27;s only surviving documentary works; some historians believe he made others.

=== Early feature work (1953–1955) ===

After raising $1000 showing his short films to friends and family, Kubrick found the finances to begin making his first feature film, &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; (1953), originally running with the title &quot;The Trap&quot;, written by his friend Howard Sackler. Kubrick&#x27;s uncle, Martin Perveler, a Los Angeles pharmacy owner, invested a further $9000 on condition that he be credited as executive producer of the film. Kubrick assembled several actors and a small crew totaling fourteen people (five actors, five crewmen, and four others to help transport the equipment) and flew to the San Gabriel Mountains in California for a five-week, low-budget shoot. Later renamed &quot;The Shape of Fear&quot; before finally being named &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;, it is a fictional allegory about a team of soldiers who survive a plane crash and are caught behind enemy lines in a war. During the course of the film, one of the soldiers becomes infatuated with an attractive girl in the woods and binds her to a tree. This scene and others are noted for their rapid close-ups on the faces of the cast. Kubrick had intended for &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; to be a silent picture in order to ensure low production costs; the added sounds, effects, and music ultimately brought production costs to around $53,000, exceeding the budget. He was bailed out by producer Richard de Rochemont on the condition that he help in de Rochemont&#x27;s production of a five-part television series about Abraham Lincoln on location in Hodgenville, Kentucky.

&quot;Fear and Desire&quot; was a commercial failure, but garnered several positive reviews upon release. Critics such as the reviewer from &quot;The New York Times&quot; believed that Kubrick&#x27;s professionalism as a photographer shone through in the picture, and that he &quot;artistically caught glimpses of the grotesque attitudes of death, the wolfishness of hungry men, as well as their bestiality, and in one scene, the wracking effect of lust on a pitifully juvenile soldier and the pinioned girl he is guarding&quot;. Columbia University scholar Mark Van Doren was highly impressed by the scenes with the girl bound to the tree, remarking that it would live on as a &quot;beautiful, terrifying and weird&quot; sequence which illustrated Kubrick&#x27;s immense talent and guaranteed his future success. Kubrick himself later expressed embarrassment with &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;, and attempted over the years to disown it, keeping prints of the film out of circulation. During the production of the film, Kubrick accidentally almost killed his cast with poisonous gasses.

Following &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;, Kubrick began working on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the commercial failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title &quot;Kiss Me, Kill Me&quot;, and then &quot;The Nymph and the Maniac&quot;, &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer&#x27;s involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like &quot;Fear and Desire&quot;, it was privately funded by Kubrick&#x27;s family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working on the sound.
Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Blackmail&quot; (1929) directly influenced the film with the painting laughing at a character, and Martin Scorsese has, in turn, cited Kubrick&#x27;s innovative shooting angles and atmospheric shots in &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot; as an influence on &quot;Raging Bull&quot; (1980). Actress Irene Kane, the star of &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot;, observed: &quot;Stanley&#x27;s a fascinating character. He thinks movies should move, with a minimum of dialogue, and he&#x27;s all for sex and sadism&quot;. &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot; met with limited commercial success and made very little money in comparison with its production budget of $75,000. Critics have praised the film&#x27;s camerawork, but its acting and story are generally considered mediocre.

=== Hollywood success and beyond (1955–1962) ===
While playing chess in Washington Square, Kubrick met producer James B. Harris, who considered Kubrick &quot;the most intelligent, most creative person I have ever come in contact with.&quot; The two formed the Harris-Kubrick Pictures Corporation in 1955. Harris purchased the rights to Lionel White&#x27;s novel &quot;Clean Break&quot; for $10,000 and Kubrick wrote the script, but at Kubrick&#x27;s suggestion, they hired film noir novelist Jim Thompson to write the dialog for the film—which became &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956)—about a meticulously planned racetrack robbery gone wrong. The film starred Sterling Hayden, who had impressed Kubrick with his performance in &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950).

Kubrick and Harris moved to Los Angeles and signed with the Jaffe Agency to shoot the picture, which became Kubrick&#x27;s first full-length feature film shot with a professional cast and crew. The Union in Hollywood stated that Kubrick would not be permitted to be both the director and the cinematographer, resulting in the hiring of veteran cinematographer Lucien Ballard. Kubrick agreed to waive his fee for the production, which was shot in 24 days on a budget of $330,000. He clashed with Ballard during the shooting, and on one occasion Kubrick threatened to fire Ballard following a camera dispute, despite being aged only 27 and 20 years Ballard&#x27;s junior. Hayden recalled Kubrick was &quot;cold and detached. Very mechanical, always confident. I&#x27;ve worked with few directors who are that good&quot;.

&quot;The Killing&quot; failed to secure a proper release across the United States; the film made little money, and was promoted only at the last minute, as a second feature to the Western movie &quot;Bandido!&quot; (1956). Several contemporary critics lauded the film, with a reviewer for &quot;Time&quot; comparing its camerawork to that of Orson Welles. Today, critics generally consider &quot;The Killing&quot; to be among the best films of Kubrick&#x27;s early career; its nonlinear narrative and clinical execution also had a major influence on later directors of crime films, including Quentin Tarantino. Dore Schary of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was highly impressed as well, and offered Kubrick and Harris $75,000 to write, direct, and produce a film, which ultimately became &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957).
&quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, set during World War I, is based on Humphrey Cobb&#x27;s 1935 antiwar novel of the same name. Schary was familiar with the novel, but stated that MGM would not finance another war picture, given their backing of the anti-war film &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; (1951). After Schary was fired by MGM in a major shake-up, Kubrick and Harris managed to interest Kirk Douglas in playing Colonel Dax. Douglas, in turn, signed Harris-Kubrick Pictures to a three-picture co-production deal with his film production company, Bryna Productions, which secured a financing and distribution deal for &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; and two subsequent films with United Artists. The film, shot in Munich, from March 1957, follows a French army unit ordered on an impossible mission, and follows with a war trial of three soldiers, arbitrarily chosen, for misconduct. Dax is assigned to defend the men at Court Martial. For the battle scene, Kubrick meticulously lined up six cameras one after the other along the boundary of no-man&#x27;s land, with each camera capturing a specific field and numbered, and gave each of the hundreds of extras a number for the zone in which they would die. Kubrick operated an Arriflex camera for the battle, zooming in on Douglas. &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; became Kubrick&#x27;s first significant commercial success, and established him as an up-and-coming young filmmaker. Critics praised the film&#x27;s unsentimental, spare, and unvarnished combat scenes and its raw, black-and-white cinematography. Despite the praise, the Christmas release date was criticized, and the subject was controversial in Europe. The film was banned in France until 1974 for its &quot;unflattering&quot; depiction of the French military, and was censored by the Swiss Army until 1970.

In October 1957, after &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; had its world premiere in Germany, Bryna Productions optioned Canadian church minister-turned-master-safecracker Herbert Emerson Wilsons&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;I Stole $16,000,000&quot;, especially for Stanley Kubrick and James B. Harris. The picture was to be the second in the co-production deal between Bryna Productions and Harris-Kubrick Pictures, which Kubrick was to write and direct, Harris to co-produce and Douglas to co-produce and star. In November 1957, Gavin Lambert was signed as story editor for &quot;I Stole $16,000,000&quot;, and with Kubrick, finished a script titled &quot;God Fearing Man&quot;, but the picture was never filmed.

Marlon Brando contacted Kubrick, asking him to direct a film adaptation of the Charles Neider western novel, &quot;The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones&quot;, featuring Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. Brando was impressed, saying &quot;Stanley is unusually perceptive, and delicately attuned to people. He has an adroit intellect, and is a creative thinker—not a repeater, not a fact-gatherer. He digests what he learns and brings to a new project an original point of view and a reserved passion&quot;. The two worked on a script for six months, begun by a then unknown Sam Peckinpah. Many disputes broke out over the project, and in the end, Kubrick distanced himself from what would become &quot;One-Eyed Jacks&quot; (1961).
In February 1959, Kubrick received a phone call from Kirk Douglas asking him to direct &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), based on the historical Spartacus and the Third Servile War. Douglas had acquired the rights to the novel by Howard Fast and blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo began penning the script. It was produced by Douglas, who also starred as Spartacus, and cast Laurence Olivier as his foe, the Roman general and politician Marcus Licinius Crassus. Douglas hired Kubrick for a reported $150,000 fee to take over direction soon after he fired director Anthony Mann. Kubrick had, at 31, already directed four feature films, and this became his largest by far, with a cast of over 10,000 and a budget of $6 million. At the time, this was the most expensive film ever made in America, and Kubrick became the youngest director in Hollywood history to make an epic. It was the first time that Kubrick filmed using the anamorphic 35 mm horizontal Super Technirama process to achieve ultra-high definition, which allowed him to capture large panoramic scenes, including one with 8,000 trained soldiers from Spain representing the Roman army.

Disputes broke out during the filming of &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Kubrick complained about not having full creative control over the artistic aspects, insisting on improvising extensively during the production. Kubrick and Douglas were also at odds over the script, with Kubrick angering Douglas when he cut all but two of his lines from the opening 30 minutes. Despite the on-set troubles, &quot;Spartacus&quot; took $14.6 million at the box office in its first run. The film established Kubrick as a major director, receiving six Academy Award nominations and winning four; it ultimately convinced him that if so much could be made of such a problematic production, he could achieve anything. &quot;Spartacus&quot; also marked the end of the working relationship between Kubrick and Douglas.

=== Collaboration with Peter Sellers (1962–1964) ===
==== &quot;Lolita&quot; ====

Kubrick and Harris decided to start production of Kubrick&#x27;s next film &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962) in England, due to clauses placed on the contract by producers Warner Bros. that gave them complete control over the film, and the fact that the Eady plan permitted producers to write off the costs if 80% of the crew were British. Instead, they signed a $1 million deal with Eliot Hyman&#x27;s Associated Artists Productions, and a clause which gave them the artistic freedom that they desired. &quot;Lolita&quot;, Kubrick&#x27;s first attempt at black comedy, was an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Vladimir Nabokov, the story of a middle-aged college professor becoming infatuated with a 12-year-old girl. Stylistically, &quot;Lolita&quot;, starring Peter Sellers, James Mason, Shelley Winters, and Sue Lyon, was a transitional film for Kubrick, &quot;marking the turning point from a naturalistic cinema ... to the surrealism of the later films&quot;, according to film critic Gene Youngblood. Kubrick was impressed by the range of actor Peter Sellers and gave him one of his first opportunities to improvise wildly during shooting, while filming him with three cameras.

Kubrick shot &quot;Lolita&quot; over 88 days on a $2 million budget at Elstree Studios, between October 1960 and March 1961. Kubrick often clashed with Shelley Winters, whom he found &quot;very difficult&quot; and demanding, and nearly fired at one point. Because of its provocative story, &quot;Lolita&quot; was Kubrick&#x27;s first film to generate controversy; he was ultimately forced to comply with censors and remove much of the erotic element of the relationship between Mason&#x27;s Humbert and Lyon&#x27;s Lolita which had been evident in Nabokov&#x27;s novel. The film was not a major critical or commercial success, earning $3.7 million at the box office on its opening run. &quot;Lolita&quot; has since become critically acclaimed.

==== &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; ====

Kubrick&#x27;s next project was &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; (1964), another satirical black comedy. Kubrick became preoccupied with the issue of nuclear war as the Cold War unfolded in the 1950s, and even considered moving to Australia because he feared that New York City might be a likely target for the Russians. He studied over 40 military and political research books on the subject and eventually reached the conclusion that &quot;nobody really knew anything and the whole situation was absurd&quot;.

After buying the rights to the novel &quot;Red Alert&quot;, Kubrick collaborated with its author, Peter George, on the script. It was originally written as a serious political thriller, but Kubrick decided that a &quot;serious treatment&quot; of the subject would not be believable, and thought that some of its most salient points would be fodder for comedy. Kubrick&#x27;s longtime producer and friend, James B. Harris, thought the film should be serious, and the two parted ways, amicably, over this disagreement—Harris going on to produce and direct the serious cold-war thriller &quot;The Bedford Incident.&quot; Kubrick and &quot;Red Alert&quot; author George then reworked the script as a satire (provisionally titled &quot;The Delicate Balance of Terror&quot;) in which the plot of &quot;Red Alert&quot; was situated as a film-within-a-film made by an alien intelligence, but this idea was also abandoned, and Kubrick decided to make the film as &quot;an outrageous black comedy&quot;.

Just before filming began, Kubrick hired noted journalist and satirical author Terry Southern to transform the script into its final form, a black comedy, loaded with sexual innuendo, becoming a film which showed Kubrick&#x27;s talents as a &quot;unique kind of absurdist&quot; according to the film scholar Abrams. Southern made major contributions to the final script, and was co-credited (above Peter George) in the film&#x27;s opening titles; his perceived role in the writing later led to a public rift between Kubrick and Peter George, who subsequently complained in a letter to &quot;Life&quot; magazine that Southern&#x27;s intense but relatively brief (November 16 to December 28, 1962) involvement with the project was being given undue prominence in the media, while his own role as the author of the film&#x27;s source novel, and his ten-month stint as the script&#x27;s co-writer, were being downplayed – a perception Kubrick evidently did little to address.

Kubrick found that &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, a $2 million production which employed what became the &quot;first important visual effects crew in the world&quot;, would be impossible to make in the U.S. for various technical and political reasons, forcing him to move production to England. It was shot in 15 weeks, ending in April 1963, after which Kubrick spent eight months editing it. Peter Sellers again agreed to work with Kubrick, and ended up playing three different roles in the film.

Upon release, the film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions. &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther worried that it was a &quot;discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment ... the most shattering sick joke I&#x27;ve ever come across&quot;, while Robert Brustein of &quot;Out of This World&quot; in a February 1970 article called it a &quot;juvenalian satire&quot;. Kubrick responded to the criticism, stating: &quot;A satirist is someone who has a very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make some sort of a joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be&quot;. Today, the film is considered to be one of the sharpest comedy films ever made, and holds a near-perfect 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 91 reviews . It was named the 39th-greatest American film and third-greatest American comedy film of all time by the American Film Institute, and in 2010, it was named the sixth-best comedy film of all time by &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

=== Science fiction (1965–1971) ===
==== &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; ====
Kubrick spent five years developing his next film, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), having been highly impressed with science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s novel &quot;Childhood&#x27;s End&quot;, about a superior alien race who assist mankind in eliminating their old selves. After meeting Clarke in New York City in April 1964, Kubrick made the suggestion to work on his 1948 short story &quot;The Sentinel&quot;, in which a monolith found on the Moon alerts aliens of mankind. That year, Clarke began writing the novel &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and collaborated with Kubrick on a screenplay. The film&#x27;s theme, the birthing of one intelligence by another, is developed in two parallel intersecting stories on two different time scales. One depicts evolutionary transitions between various stages of man, from ape to &quot;star child&quot;, as man is reborn into a new existence, each step shepherded by an enigmatic alien intelligence seen only in its artifacts: a series of seemingly indestructible eons-old black monoliths. In space, the enemy is a supercomputer known as HAL who runs the spaceship, a character which novelist Clancy Sigal described as being &quot;far, far more human, more humorous and conceivably decent than anything else that may emerge from this far-seeing enterprise&quot;.

Kubrick intensively researched for the film, paying particular attention to accuracy and detail in what the future might look like. He was granted permission by NASA to observe the spacecraft being used in the Ranger 9 mission for accuracy. Filming commenced on December 29, 1965, with the excavation of the monolith on the moon, and footage was shot in Namib Desert in early 1967, with the ape scenes completed later that year. The special effects team continued working until the end of the year to complete the film, taking the cost to $10.5 million. &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was conceived as a Cinerama spectacle and was photographed in Super Panavision 70, giving the viewer a &quot;dazzling mix of imagination and science&quot; through ground-breaking effects, which earned Kubrick his only personal Oscar, an Academy Award for Visual Effects. Kubrick said of the concept of the film in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;On the deepest psychological level, the film&#x27;s plot symbolized the search for God, and finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God. The film revolves around this metaphysical conception, and the realistic hardware and the documentary feelings about everything were necessary in order to undermine your built-in resistance to the poetical concept&quot;.

Upon release in 1968, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was not an immediate hit among critics, who faulted its lack of dialog, slow pacing, and seemingly impenetrable storyline. The film appeared to defy genre convention, much unlike any science-fiction movie before it, and clearly different from any of Kubrick&#x27;s earlier works. Kubrick was particularly outraged by a scathing review from Pauline Kael, who called it &quot;the biggest amateur movie of them all&quot;, with Kubrick doing &quot;really every dumb thing he ever wanted to do&quot;. Despite mixed contemporary critical reviews, &quot;2001&quot; gradually gained popularity and earned $31 million worldwide by the end of 1972. Today, it is widely considered to be one of the greatest and most influential films ever made and is a staple on All Time Top 10 lists. Baxter describes the film as &quot;one of the most admired and discussed creations in the history of cinema&quot;, and Steven Spielberg has referred to it as &quot;the big bang of his film making generation&quot;. For biographer Vincent LoBrutto it &quot;positioned Stanley Kubrick as a pure artist ranked among the masters of cinema&quot;. The film marked Kubrick&#x27;s first use of classical music. Roger Ebert writes: &quot;Although Kubrick originally commissioned an original score from Alex North, he used classical recordings as a temporary track while editing the film, and they worked so well that he kept them. This was a crucial decision. North&#x27;s score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for &quot;2001&quot; because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action -- to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals&quot;, citing Kubrick&#x27;s use of Johann Strauss II&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Danube&quot; and Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot;.
==== &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; ====
After completing &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Kubrick searched for a project that he could film quickly on a more modest budget. He settled on &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (1971) at the end of 1969, an exploration of violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities, based around the character of Alex (portrayed by Malcolm McDowell). Kubrick had received a copy of Anthony Burgess&#x27;s novel of the same name from Terry Southern while they were working on &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, but had rejected it on the grounds that Nadsat, a street language for young teenagers, was too difficult to comprehend. The decision to make a film about the degeneration of youth reflected contemporary concerns in 1969; the New Hollywood movement was creating a great number of films that depicted the sexuality and rebelliousness of young people. &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; was shot over 1970–1971 on a budget of £2 million. Kubrick abandoned his use of CinemaScope in filming, deciding that the 1.66:1 widescreen format was, in the words of Baxter, an &quot;acceptable compromise between spectacle and intimacy&quot;, and favored his &quot;rigorously symmetrical framing&quot;, which &quot;increased the beauty of his compositions&quot;. The film heavily features &quot;pop erotica&quot; of the period, including a large white plastic set of male genitals, decor which Kubrick had intended to give it a &quot;slightly futuristic&quot; look. McDowell&#x27;s role in Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;if...&quot; (1968) was crucial to his casting as Alex, and Kubrick professed that he probably would not have made the film if McDowell had been unavailable. The film marked Kubrick&#x27;s first collaboration with Wendy Carlos, who provided electronic renditions of Henry Purcell&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;.
Because of its depiction of teenage violence, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; became one of the most controversial films of its time, and part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema. It received an X rating, or certificate, in both the UK and US, on its release just before Christmas 1971, though many critics saw much of the violence depicted in the film as satirical, and less violent than &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, which had been released a month earlier. Kubrick personally pulled the film from release in the United Kingdom after receiving death threats following a series of copycat crimes based on the film; it was thus completely unavailable legally in the UK until after Kubrick&#x27;s death, and not re-released until 2000. John Trevelyan, the censor of the film, personally considered &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; to be &quot;perhaps the most brilliant piece of cinematic art I&#x27;ve ever seen,&quot; and believed it to present an &quot;intellectual argument rather than a sadistic spectacle&quot; in its depiction of violence, but acknowledged that many would not agree. Negative media hype over the film notwithstanding, &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; received four Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Editing, and was named by the New York Film Critics Circle as the Best Film of 1971. After William Friedkin won Best Director for &quot;The French Connection&quot; that year, he told the press: &quot;Speaking personally, I think Stanley Kubrick is the best American film-maker of the year. In fact, not just this year, but the best, period.&quot;

=== Period and horror filming (1972–1980) ===
==== &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; ====
&quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; (1975) is an adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon&quot;, a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. John Calley of Warner Bros. agreed in 1972 to invest $2.5 million into the film, on condition that Kubrick approach major Hollywood stars, to ensure success. Like previous films, Kubrick and his art department conducted an enormous amount of research on the 18th century. Extensive photographs were taken of locations and artwork in particular, and paintings were meticulously replicated from works of the great masters of the period in the film. The film was shot on location in Ireland, beginning in the autumn of 1973, at a cost of $11 million with a cast and crew of 170. The decision to shoot in Ireland stemmed from the fact that it still retained many buildings from the 18th century period which England lacked. The production was problematic from the start, plagued with heavy rain and political strife involving Northern Ireland at the time. After Kubrick received death threats from the IRA in 1974 due to the shooting scenes with English soldiers, he fled Ireland with his family on a ferry from Dún Laoghaire under an assumed identity and resumed filming in England.

Baxter notes that &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; was the film which made Kubrick notorious for paying scrupulous attention to detail, often demanding twenty or thirty retakes of the same scene to perfect his art. Often considered to be his most authentic-looking picture, the cinematography and lighting techniques that Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott used in &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; were highly innovative. Interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 Zeiss camera lens originally developed for NASA to be used in satellite photography. The lenses allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional, diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings. Cinematographer Allen Daviau states that the method gives the audience a way of seeing the characters and scenes as they would have been seen by people at the time. Many of the fight scenes were shot with a hand-held camera to produce a &quot;sense of documentary realism and immediacy&quot;.

&quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; found a great audience in France, but was a box office failure, grossing just $9.5 million in the American market, not even close to the $30 million Warner Bros. needed to generate a profit. The pace and length of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; at three hours put off many American critics and audiences, but the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won four, including Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, and Best Musical Score, more than any other Kubrick film. As with most of Kubrick&#x27;s films, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;&#x27;s reputation has grown through the years and it is now considered to be one of his best, particularly among filmmakers and critics. Numerous polls, such as &quot;The Village Voice&quot; (1999), &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; (2002), and &quot;Time&quot; (2005), have rated it as one of the greatest films ever made. , it has a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 64 reviews. Ebert referred to it as &quot;one of the most beautiful films ever made ... certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, remorseless in its doubt of human goodness&quot;.

==== &quot;The Shining&quot; ====

&quot;The Shining&quot;, released in 1980, was adapted from the novel of the same name by Stephen King. The film stars Jack Nicholson as a writer who takes a job as a winter caretaker of an isolated hotel in the Rocky Mountains. He spends the winter there with his wife, played by Shelley Duvall, and their young son, who displays paranormal abilities. During their stay, they confront both Jack&#x27;s descent into madness and apparent supernatural horrors lurking in the hotel. Kubrick gave his actors freedom to extend the script and even improvise on occasion, and as a result, Nicholson was responsible for the &#x27;Here&#x27;s Johnny!&#x27; line and the scene in which he&#x27;s sitting at the typewriter and unleashes his anger upon his wife. Kubrick often demanded up to 70 or 80 retakes of the same scene. Duvall, whom Kubrick intentionally isolated and argued with, was forced to perform the exhausting baseball bat scene 127 times. The bar scene with the ghostly bartender was shot 36 times, while the kitchen scene between the characters of Danny (Danny Lloyd) and Halloran (Scatman Crothers) ran to 148 takes. The aerial shots of the Overlook Hotel were shot at Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon, while the interiors of the hotel were shot at Elstree Studios in England between May 1978 and April 1979. Cardboard models were made of all of the sets of the film, and the lighting of them was a massive undertaking, which took four months of electrical wiring. Kubrick made extensive use of the newly invented Steadicam, a weight-balanced camera support, which allowed for smooth hand-held camera movement in scenes where a conventional camera track was impractical. According to Garrett Brown, Steadicam&#x27;s inventor, it was the first picture to use its full potential. &quot;The Shining&quot; was not the only horror film to which Kubrick had been linked; he had turned down the directing of both &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973) and &quot;Exorcist II: The Heretic&quot; (1977), despite once saying in 1966 to a friend that he had long desired to &quot;make the world&#x27;s scariest movie, involving a series of episodes that would play upon the nightmare fears of the audience&quot;. Kubrick worked again with Carlos, who provided an electronic version of the &quot;Dies Irae&quot; segment from Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot;.

Five days after release on May 23, 1980, Kubrick ordered the deletion of a final scene, in which the hotel manager Ullman (Barry Nelson) visits Wendy (Shelley Duvall) in hospital, believing it unnecessary after witnessing the audience excitement in cinemas at the film&#x27;s climax. &quot;The Shining&quot; opened to strong box office takings, earning $1 million on the first weekend and earning $30.9 million in America by the end of the year. The original critical response was mixed, and King detested the film and disliked Kubrick. &quot;The Shining&quot; is now considered to be a horror classic, and the American Film Institute ranked it as the 29th greatest thriller film of all time in 2001.

=== Later work and final years (1981–1999) ===
==== &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; ====
Kubrick met author Michael Herr through mutual friend David Cornwell (novelist John le Carré) in 1980, and became interested in his book &quot;Dispatches&quot;, about the Vietnam War. Herr had recently written Martin Sheen&#x27;s narration for &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979). Kubrick was also intrigued by Gustav Hasford&#x27;s Vietnam War novel &quot;The Short-Timers.&quot; With the vision in mind to shoot what would become &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; (1987), Kubrick began working with both Herr and Hasford separately on a script. He eventually found Hasford&#x27;s novel to be &quot;brutally honest&quot; and decided to shoot a film which closely follows the novel. All of the film was shot at a cost of $17 million within a 30-mile radius of his house between August 1985 and September 1986, later than scheduled as Kubrick shut down production for five months following a near-fatal accident with a jeep involving Lee Ermey. A derelict gasworks in Beckton in the London Docklands area posed as the ruined city of Huế, which makes the film visually very different from other Vietnam War films. Around 200 palm trees were imported via 40-foot trailers by road from North Africa, at a cost of £1000 a tree, and thousands of plastic plants were ordered from Hong Kong to provide foliage for the film. Kubrick explained he made the film look realistic by using natural light, and achieved a &quot;newsreel effect&quot; by making the Steadicam shots less steady, which reviewers and commentators thought contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film.

According to critic Michel Ciment, the film contained some of Kubrick&#x27;s trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, portrayals of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail to achieve realism. In a later scene, United States Marines patrol the ruins of an abandoned and destroyed city singing the theme song to the Mickey Mouse Club as a sardonic counterpoint. The film opened strongly in June 1987, taking over $30 million in the first 50 days alone, but critically it was overshadowed by the success of Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Platoon&quot;, released a year earlier. Co-star Matthew Modine stated one of Kubrick&#x27;s favorite reviews read: &quot;The first half of &quot;FMJ&quot; is brilliant. Then the film degenerates into a masterpiece.&quot; Ebert was not particularly impressed with it, awarding it a mediocre 2.5 out of 4. He concluded: &quot;Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; is more like a book of short stories than a novel&quot;, a &quot;strangely shapeless film from the man whose work usually imposes a ferociously consistent vision on his material&quot;.

==== &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; ====

Kubrick&#x27;s final film was &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; (1999), starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey. Tom Cruise portrays a doctor who witnesses a bizarre masked quasireligious orgiastic ritual at a country mansion, a discovery which later threatens his life. The story is based on Arthur Schnitzler&#x27;s 1926 Freudian novella &quot;Traumnovelle&quot; (&quot;Dream Story&quot; in English), which Kubrick relocated from turn-of-the-century Vienna to New York City in the 1990s. Kubrick said of the novel: &quot;A difficult book to describe—what good book isn&#x27;t. It explores the sexual ambivalence of a happy marriage and tries to equate the importance of sexual dreams and might-have-beens with reality. All of Schnitzler&#x27;s work is psychologically brilliant&quot;. Kubrick was almost 70, but worked relentlessly for 15 months to get the film out by its planned release date of July 16, 1999. He commenced a script with Frederic Raphael, and worked 18 hours a day, while maintaining complete confidentiality about the film.

&quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, like &quot;Lolita&quot; and &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; before it, faced censorship before release. Kubrick sent an unfinished preview copy to the stars and producers a few months before release, but his sudden death on March 7, 1999, came a few days after he finished editing. He never saw the final version released to the public, but he did see the preview of the film with Warner Bros., Cruise, and Kidman, and had reportedly told Warner executive Julian Senior that it was his &quot;best film ever&quot;. At the time, critical opinion of the film was mixed, and it was viewed less favorably than most of Kubrick&#x27;s films. Ebert awarded it 3.5 out of 4 stars, comparing the structure to a thriller and writing that it is &quot;like an erotic daydream about chances missed and opportunities avoided&quot;, and thought that Kubrick&#x27;s use of lighting at Christmas made the film &quot;all a little garish, like an urban sideshow&quot;. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; disliked the film, writing that it &quot;is actually sad, rather than bad. It feels creaky, ancient, hopelessly out of touch, infatuated with the hot taboos of his youth and unable to connect with that twisty thing contemporary sexuality has become.&quot;

=== Unfinished and unrealized projects ===
==== &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; ====
Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Kubrick collaborated with Brian Aldiss on expanding his short story &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot; into a three-act film. It was a futuristic fairy tale about a robot that resembles and behaves as a child, and his efforts to become a &#x27;real boy&#x27; in a manner similar to Pinocchio. Kubrick approached Steven Spielberg in 1995 with the AI script with the possibility of Steven Spielberg directing it and Kubrick producing it. Kubrick reportedly held long telephone discussions with Spielberg regarding the film, and, according to Spielberg, at one point stated that the subject matter was closer to Spielberg&#x27;s sensibilities than his.

Following Kubrick&#x27;s sudden death in 1999, Spielberg took the drafts and notes left by Kubrick and his writers and composed a new screenplay based on an earlier 90-page story treatment by Ian Watson written under Kubrick&#x27;s supervision and specifications. In association with what remained of Kubrick&#x27;s production unit, he directed the film &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001) which was produced by Kubrick&#x27;s longtime producer (and brother-in-law) Jan Harlan. Sets, costumes, and art direction were based on the works of conceptual artist Chris Baker, who had also done much of his work under Kubrick&#x27;s supervision.

Spielberg was able to function autonomously in Kubrick&#x27;s absence, but said he felt &quot;inhibited to honor him&quot;, and followed Kubrick&#x27;s visual schema with as much fidelity as he could. Spielberg, who once referred to Kubrick as &quot;the greatest master I ever served&quot;, now with production underway, admitted, &quot;I felt like I was being coached by a ghost.&quot; The film was released in June 2001. It contains a posthumous production credit for Stanley Kubrick at the beginning and the brief dedication &quot;For Stanley Kubrick&quot; at the end. John Williams&#x27;s score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films.

==== &quot;Napoleon&quot; ====

Following &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, Kubrick planned to make a film about the life of Napoleon. Fascinated by the French leader&#x27;s life and &quot;self-destruction&quot;, Kubrick spent a great deal of time planning the film&#x27;s development and conducted about two years of research into Napoleon&#x27;s life, reading several hundred books and gaining access to his personal memoirs and commentaries. He tried to see every film about Napoleon and found none of them appealing, including Abel Gance&#x27;s 1927 film which is generally considered to be a masterpiece, but for Kubrick, a &quot;really terrible&quot; movie. LoBrutto states that Napoleon was an ideal subject for Kubrick, embracing Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;passion for control, power, obsession, strategy, and the military&quot;, while Napoleon&#x27;s psychological intensity and depth, logistical genius and war, sex, and the evil nature of man were all ingredients which deeply appealed to Kubrick.

Kubrick drafted a screenplay in 1961, and envisaged making a &quot;grandiose&quot; epic, with up to 40,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry. He intended hiring the armed forces of an entire country to make the film, as he considered Napoleonic battles to be &quot;so beautiful, like vast lethal ballets&quot;, with an &quot;aesthetic brilliance that doesn&#x27;t require a military mind to appreciate&quot;. He wanted them replicated as authentically as possible on screen. Kubrick sent research teams to scout for locations across Europe, and commissioned screenwriter and director Andrew Birkin, one of his young assistants on &quot;2001&quot;, to the Isle of Elba, Austerlitz, and Waterloo, taking thousands of pictures for his later perusal. Kubrick approached numerous stars to play leading roles, including Audrey Hepburn for Empress Josephine, a part which she could not accept due to semiretirement.
British actors David Hemmings and Ian Holm were considered for the lead role of Napoleon, before Jack Nicholson was cast. The film was well into preproduction and ready to begin filming in 1969 when MGM canceled the project. Numerous reasons have been cited for the abandonment of the project, including its projected cost, a change of ownership at MGM, and the poor reception that the 1970 Soviet film about Napoleon, &quot;Waterloo&quot;, received. In 2011, Taschen published the book &quot;Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s Napoleon: The Greatest Movie Never Made&quot;, a large volume compilation of literature and source documents from Kubrick, such as scene photo ideas and copies of letters Kubrick wrote and received. In March 2013, Steven Spielberg, who previously collaborated with Kubrick on &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; and is a passionate admirer of his work, announced that he would be developing &quot;Napoleon&quot; as a TV miniseries based on Kubrick&#x27;s original screenplay.

==== Other projects ====
In the 1950s, Kubrick and Harris developed a sitcom starring Ernie Kovacs and a film adaption of the book &quot;I Stole $16,000,000&quot;, but nothing came of them. Tony Frewin, an assistant who worked with the director for a long period of time, revealed in a 2013 &quot;Atlantic&quot; article: &quot;[Kubrick] was limitlessly interested in anything to do with Nazis and desperately wanted to make a film on the subject.&quot; Kubrick had intended to make a film about , a Nazi officer who used the pen name &quot;Dr. Jazz&quot; to write reviews of German music scenes during the Nazi era. Kubrick had been given a copy of the Mike Zwerin book &quot;Swing Under the Nazis&quot; after he had finished production on &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, the front cover of which featured a photograph of Schulz-Köhn. A screenplay was never completed and Kubrick&#x27;s adaptation was never initiated. The unfinished &quot;Aryan Papers&quot;, based on Louis Begley&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Wartime Lies&quot;, was a factor in the abandonment of the project. Work on &quot;Aryan Papers&quot; depressed Kubrick enormously, and he eventually decided that Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) covered much of the same material.

According to biographer John Baxter, Kubrick had shown an interest in directing a pornographic film based on a satirical novel written by Terry Southern, titled &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, about a director who makes Hollywood&#x27;s first big-budget porn film. Baxter claims that Kubrick concluded he did not have the patience or temperament to become involved in the porn industry, and Southern stated that Kubrick was &quot;too ultra conservative&quot; towards sexuality to have gone ahead with it, but liked the idea. Kubrick was unable to direct a film of Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;Foucault&#x27;s Pendulum&quot; as Eco had given his publisher instructions to never sell the film rights to any of his books after his dissatisfaction with the film version of &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. Also, when the film rights to Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were sold to United Artists, the Beatles approached Kubrick to direct them in a film adaptation, but Kubrick was unwilling to produce a film based on a very popular book.

== Career influences ==


As a young man, Kubrick was fascinated by the films of Soviet filmmakers such as Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin. Kubrick read Pudovkin&#x27;s seminal theoretical work, &quot;Film Technique,&quot; which argues that editing makes film a unique art form, and it needs to be employed to manipulate the medium to its fullest. Kubrick recommended this work to others for many years. Thomas Nelson describes this book as &quot;the greatest influence of any single written work on the evolution of [Kubrick&#x27;s] private aesthetics&quot;. Kubrick also found the ideas of Konstantin Stanislavski to be essential to his understanding the basics of directing, and gave himself a crash course to learn his methods.

Kubrick&#x27;s family and many critics felt that his Jewish ancestry may have contributed to his worldview and aspects of his films. After his death, both his daughter and wife stated that he was not religious, but &quot;did not deny his Jewishness, not at all&quot;. His daughter noted that he wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, the &quot;Aryan Papers&quot;, having spent years researching the subject. Most of Kubrick&#x27;s friends and early photography and film collaborators were Jewish, and his first two marriages were to daughters of recent Jewish immigrants from Europe. British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who worked closely with Kubrick in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick&#x27;s films was partly because he &quot;had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars&quot;. He declared that it was &quot;absurd to try to understand Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality&quot;.
Walker notes that Kubrick was influenced by the tracking and &quot;fluid camera&quot; styles of director Max Ophüls, and used them in many of his films, including &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Kubrick noted how in Ophüls&#x27; films &quot;the camera went through every wall and every floor&quot;. He once named Ophüls&#x27; &quot;Le Plaisir&quot; (1952) as his favorite film. According to film historian John Wakeman, Ophüls himself learned the technique from director Anatole Litvak in the 1930s, when he was his assistant, and whose work was &quot;replete with the camera trackings, pans and swoops which later became the trademark of Max Ophüls&quot;. Geoffrey Cocks believes that Kubrick was also influenced by Ophüls&#x27; stories of thwarted love and a preoccupation with predatory men, while Herr notes that Kubrick was deeply inspired by G. W. Pabst, who earlier tried, but was unable to adapt Schnitzler&#x27;s &quot;Traumnovelle&quot;, the basis of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. Film historian/critic Robert Kolker sees the influence of Orson Welles&#x27; moving camera shots on Kubrick&#x27;s style. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick identified with Welles and that this influenced the making of &quot;The Killing&quot;, with its &quot;multiple points of view, extreme angles, and deep focus&quot;.

Kubrick admired the work of Ingmar Bergman and expressed it in personal letter: &quot;Your vision of life has moved me deeply, much more deeply than I have ever been moved by any films. I believe you are the greatest film-maker at work today [...], unsurpassed by anyone in the creation of mood and atmosphere, the subtlety of performance, the avoidance of the obvious, the truthfulness and completeness of characterization. To this one must also add everything else that goes into the making of a film; [...] and I shall look forward with eagerness to each of your films.&quot;

When the American magazine &quot;Cinema&quot; asked Kubrick in 1963 to name his favorite films, he listed Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;I Vitelloni&quot; as number one in his Top 10 list.

=== Philosophy ===

Kubrick&#x27;s films typically involve expressions of an inner struggle, examined from different perspectives.
He was very careful not to present his own views of the meaning of his films and to leave them open to interpretation. He explained in a 1960 interview with Robert Emmett Ginna:
&quot;One of the things I always find extremely difficult, when a picture&#x27;s finished, is when a writer or a film reviewer asks, &#x27;Now, what is it that you were trying to say in that picture?&#x27; And without being thought too presumptuous for using this analogy, I like to remember what T. S. Eliot said to someone who had asked him—I believe it was &quot;The Waste Land&quot;—what he meant by the poem. He replied, &#x27;I meant what I said.&#x27; If I could have said it any differently, I would have&quot;.

Kubrick likened the understanding of his films to popular music, in that whatever the background or intellect of the individual, a Beatles record, for instance, can be appreciated both by the Alabama truck driver and the young Cambridge intellectual, because their &quot;emotions and subconscious are far more similar than their intellects&quot;. He believed that the subconscious emotional reaction experienced by audiences was far more powerful in the film medium than in any other traditional verbal form, and this was one of the reasons why he often relied on long periods in his films without dialogue, placing emphasis on images and sound. In a 1975 &quot;Time&quot; magazine interview, Kubrick further stated: &quot;The essence of a dramatic form is to let an idea come over people without it being plainly stated. When you say something directly, it is simply not as potent as it is when you allow people to discover it for themselves.&quot; He also said: &quot;Realism is probably the best way to dramatize argument and ideas. Fantasy may deal best with themes which lie primarily in the unconscious&quot;.
Diane Johnson, who co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Shining&quot; with Kubrick, notes that he &quot;always said that it was better to adapt a book rather than write an original screenplay, and that you should choose a work that isn&#x27;t a masterpiece so you can improve on it. Which is what he&#x27;s always done, except with &quot;Lolita&quot;&quot;. When deciding on a subject for a film, there were many aspects that he looked for, and he always made films which would &quot;appeal to every sort of viewer, whatever their expectation of film&quot;. According to his co-producer Jan Harlan, Kubrick mostly &quot;wanted to make films about things that mattered, that not only had form, but substance&quot;. Kubrick believed that audiences quite often were attracted to &quot;enigmas and allegories&quot; and did not like films in which everything was spelled out clearly.

Sexuality in Kubrick&#x27;s films is usually depicted outside matrimonial relationships in hostile situations. Baxter states that Kubrick explores the &quot;furtive and violent side alleys of the sexual experience: voyeurism, domination, bondage and rape&quot; in his films. He further points out that films like &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; are &quot;powerfully homoerotic&quot;, from Alex walking about his parents&#x27; flat in his Y-fronts, one eye being &quot;made up with doll-like false eyelashes&quot;, to his innocent acceptance of the sexual advances of his post-corrective adviser Deltroid (Aubrey Morris).
Indeed, the film is thought to have been strongly influenced by Kubrick&#x27;s many viewings of Matsumoto Toshio&#x27;s 1969 landmark in queer cinema, &quot;Funeral Parade of Roses&quot;. Film critic Adrian Turner notes that Kubrick&#x27;s films appear to be &quot;preoccupied with questions of universal and inherited evil&quot;, and Malcolm McDowell referred to his humor as &quot;black as coal&quot;, questioning his outlook on humanity. A few of his pictures were obvious satires and black comedies, such as &quot;Lolita&quot; and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;; many of his other films also contained less visible elements of satire or irony. His films are unpredictable, examining &quot;the duality and contradictions that exist in all of us&quot;. Ciment notes how Kubrick often tried to confound audience expectations by establishing radically different moods from one film to the next, remarking that he was almost &quot;obsessed with contradicting himself, with making each work a critique of the previous one&quot;.
Kubrick stated that &quot;there is no deliberate pattern to the stories that I have chosen to make into films. About the only factor at work each time is that I try not to repeat myself&quot;. As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon the release of a film—for &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;.

=== Writing and staging scenes ===

Film author Patrick Webster considers Kubrick&#x27;s methods of writing and developing scenes to fit with the classical auteur theory of directing, allowing collaboration and improvisation with the actors during filming. Malcolm McDowell recalled Kubrick&#x27;s collaborative emphasis during their discussions and his willingness to allow him to improvise a scene, stating that &quot;there was a script and we followed it, but when it didn&#x27;t work he knew it, and we had to keep rehearsing endlessly until we were bored with it&quot;.
Once Kubrick was confident in the overall staging of a scene, and felt the actors were prepared, he would then develop the visual aspects, including camera and lighting placement. Walker believes that Kubrick was one of &quot;very few film directors competent to instruct their lighting photographers in the precise effect they want&quot;. Baxter believes that Kubrick was heavily influenced by his ancestry and always possessed a European perspective to filmmaking, particularly the Austro-Hungarian empire and his admiration for Max Ophuls and Richard Strauss.

Gilbert Adair, writing in a review for &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, commented that &quot;Kubrick&#x27;s approach to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression&quot;. Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a &quot;visual filmmaker&quot;, he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it &quot;more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals&quot; as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: &quot;I think you have to view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell up there on that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it&#x27;s only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing&quot;. Kubrick also said: &quot;I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience&#x27;s skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don&#x27;t have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools.&quot;

In terms of Kubrick&#x27;s screenwriting and narratives, posthumous analysis of his films often highlight a pervasive &quot;misanthropy&quot;, an unsentimental style, and being less interested in the specific emotions or personality traits of his characters. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino describes the manner in which Kubrick writes characters and films as &quot;cold&quot; and detached.

=== Directing style ===
==== Multiple takes ====
Kubrick was notorious for filming far more takes than is common during feature production and his relentless approach often placed large demands on his actors. Jack Nicholson remarked that Kubrick would frequently require up to fifty takes of a scene before the director felt justice had been done to the material. Nicole Kidman explained that the dozens of takes he often required had the effect of suppressing an actor&#x27;s conscious thoughts about technique, diffusing the concentration Kubrick said he could see in the eyes of an actor who was not yet performing at the peak of their ability and helping them to enter a &quot;deeper place&quot;. Kubrick echoed this sentiment, saying, &quot;[a]ctors are essentially emotion-producing instruments, and some are always tuned and ready while others will reach a fantastic pitch on one take and never equal it again, no matter how hard they try&quot;.

While Kubrick&#x27;s high take ratio was considered by some critics to be irrational he firmly believed that actors were at their best during filming, as opposed to in rehearsals, saying, &quot;[w]hen you make a movie, it takes a few days just to get used to the crew, because it is like getting undressed in front of fifty people. Once you&#x27;re accustomed to them, the presence of even one other person on set is discordant and tends to produce self-consciousness in the actors, and certainly in itself&quot;.

In 1987, when Kubrick was asked about his reputation for excessive takes by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he replied that it was exaggerated but that when it was true, &quot;[i]t happens when actors are unprepared. You cannot act without knowing dialogue. If actors have to think about the words, they can&#x27;t work on the emotion. So you end up doing thirty takes of something. And still you can see the concentration in their eyes; they don&#x27;t know their lines. So you just shoot it and shoot it and hope you can get something out of it in pieces.&quot; He likewise told biographer Michel Ciment that, &quot;[a]n actor can only do one thing at a time, and when he learned his lines only well enough to say them while he&#x27;s thinking about them, he will always have trouble as soon as he has to work on the emotions of the scene or find camera marks. In a strong emotional scene, it is always best to be able to shoot in complete takes to allow the actor a continuity of emotion, and it is rare for most actors to reach their peak more than once or twice. There are, occasionally, scenes which benefit from extra takes, but even then, I&#x27;m not sure that the early takes aren&#x27;t just glorified rehearsals with the adding adrenaline of film running through the camera.&quot;

Matthew Modine, who played Joker in &quot;Full Metal Jacket,&quot; echoes these assessments of even a world-renowned actor&#x27;s delivery on a Kubrick film. In an oral history gathered by Peter Bogdanovich after the director&#x27;s death Modine recalled that, &quot;I once asked [Kubrick] why he so often did a lot of takes. [...] And he talked about Jack Nicholson [saying] &quot;Jack would come in during the blocking and he kind of fumbled through the lines. He&#x27;d be learning them while he was there. And then you&#x27;d start shooting and after take 3 or take 4 or take 5 you&#x27;d get the Jack Nicholson that everybody knows and most directors would be happy with. And then you&#x27;d go up to 10 or 15 and he&#x27;d be really awful and then he&#x27;d start to understand what the lines were, what the lines meant, and then he&#x27;d become unconscious about what he was saying. So by take 30 or take 40 the lines became something else.&quot;

By contrast, during the filming of &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; the former Marine Corps drill instructor R. Lee Ermey often satisfied Kubrick in as few as two or three takes. The director praised Ermey as an excellent performer, later saying to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Ermey&#x27;s intense familiarity with the role had perfected his delivery and fluency of improvisation to a level he could not have hoped to discover in a professional actor, no matter how many takes they were given. Kubrick repeated his praise to the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, saying he had, &quot;always found that some people can act and some can&#x27;t, whether or not they&#x27;ve had training. And I suspect that being a drill instructor is, in a sense, being an actor. Because they&#x27;re saying the same things every eight weeks, to new guys, like they&#x27;re saying it for the first time – and that&#x27;s acting.&quot;

==== Discussions with actors ====
On set, Kubrick would devote his personal breaks to lengthy discussions with his actors. Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of &quot;Spartacus&quot;, who said Kubrick was his favorite director, adding, &quot;his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors.&quot; He further added, &quot;Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He wanted to see the actor&#x27;s faces. He didn&#x27;t want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style.&quot; Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which is what made Kubrick &quot;such a great director&quot;. Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to &quot;break the rules&quot;, particularly with Peter Sellers in &quot;Lolita&quot;, which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage.
During an interview, Ryan O&#x27;Neal recalled Kubrick&#x27;s directing style: &quot;God, he works you hard. He moves you, pushes you, helps you, gets cross with you, but above all he teaches you the value of a good director. Stanley brought out aspects of my personality and acting instincts that had been dormant ... My strong suspicion [was] that I was involved in something great&quot;. He further added that working with Kubrick was &quot;a stunning experience&quot; and that he never recovered from working with somebody of such magnificence.

=== Cinematography ===

Kubrick credited the ease with which he filmed scenes to his early years as a photographer. He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. Even when deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, activities the director likened to being &quot;a detective&quot;. Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography on &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, remarked that Kubrick &quot;questions everything&quot;, and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the &quot;nearest thing to genius I&#x27;ve ever worked with, with all the problems of a genius&quot;.
Among Kubrick&#x27;s innovations in cinematography are his use of special effects, as in &quot;2001&quot;, where he used both slit-scan photography and front-screen projection, which won Kubrick his only Oscar for special effects. Some reviewers have described and illustrated with video clips Kubrick&#x27;s use of &quot;one-point perspective&quot;, which leads the viewer&#x27;s eye towards a central vanishing point. The technique relies on creating a complex visual symmetry using parallel lines in a scene which all converge on that single point, leading away from the viewer. Combined with camera motion it could produce an effect that one writer describes as &quot;hypnotic and thrilling&quot;. &quot;The Shining&quot; was among the first half-dozen features to use the then-revolutionary Steadicam (after the 1976 films &quot;Bound for Glory&quot;, &quot;Marathon Man&quot; and &quot;Rocky&quot;). Kubrick used it to its fullest potential, which gave the audience smooth, stabilized, motion-tracking by the camera. Kubrick described Steadicam as being like a &quot;magic carpet&quot;, allowing &quot;fast, flowing, camera movements&quot; in the maze in &quot;The Shining&quot; which otherwise would have been impossible.

Kubrick was among the first directors to use video assist during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was considered cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of &quot;2001&quot;, he was able to view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. On some films, such as &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick&#x27;s technical knowledge about lenses &quot;dazzled the manufacturer&#x27;s engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers&quot;. For &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using &quot;pure candlelight&quot;, and in doing so Kubrick &quot;made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting ... You almost posed like for portraits.&quot; LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;magic lens&quot; and that he became a &quot;legend&quot; among cameramen around the world.

=== Editing and music ===

Kubrick spent extensive hours editing, often working seven days a week, and more hours a day as he got closer to deadlines. For Kubrick, written dialogue was one element to be put in balance with mise en scène (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by Pudovkin&#x27;s treatise on film editing, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often &quot;re-direct&quot; a film, and he remarked: &quot;I love editing. I think I like it more than any other phase of filmmaking ... Editing is the only unique aspect of filmmaking which does not resemble any other art form—a point so important it cannot be overstressed ... It can make or break a film&quot;. Biographer John Baxter stated that &quot;Instead of finding the intellectual spine of a film in the script before starting work, Kubrick felt his way towards the final version of a film by shooting each scene from many angles and demanding scores of takes on each line. Then over months ... he arranged and rearranged the tens of thousands of scraps of film to fit a vision that really only began to emerge during editing&quot;.

Kubrick&#x27;s attention to music was an aspect of what many referred to as his &quot;perfectionism&quot; and extreme attention to minute details, which his wife Christiane attributed to an addiction to music. In his last six films, Kubrick usually chose music from existing sources, especially classical compositions. He preferred selecting recorded music over having it composed for a film, believing that no hired composer could do as well as the public domain classical composers. He also felt that building scenes from great music often created the &quot;most memorable scenes&quot; in the best films. In one instance, for a scene in &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; which was written into the screenplay as merely, &quot;Barry duels with Lord Bullingdon&quot;, he spent forty-two working days in the editing phase. During that period, he listened to what LoBrutto describes as &quot;every available recording of seventeenth-and eighteenth- century music, acquiring thousands of records to find Handel&#x27;s sarabande used to score the scene&quot;. Nicholson likewise observed his attention to music, stating that Kubrick &quot;listened constantly to music until he discovered something he felt was right or that excited him&quot;.

Kubrick is credited with introducing Hungarian composer György Ligeti to a broad Western audience by including his music in &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot; and &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. According to Baxter, the music in &quot;2001&quot; was &quot;at the forefront of Kubrick&#x27;s mind&quot; when he conceived the film. During earlier screening he played music by Mendelssohn and Vaughan Williams, and Kubrick and writer Clarke had listened to Carl Orff&#x27;s transcription of &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;, consisting of 13th century sacred and secular songs. Ligeti&#x27;s music employed the new style of micropolyphony, which used sustained dissonant chords that shift slowly over time, a style he originated. Its inclusion in the film became a &quot;boon for the relatively unknown composer&quot; partly because it was introduced alongside background by Johann Strauss and Richard Strauss.

In addition to Ligeti, Kubrick enjoyed a collaboration with composer Wendy Carlos, whose 1968 album &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;—which re-interpreted baroque music through the use of a Moog synthesizer—caught his attention. In 1971, Carlos composed and recorded music for the soundtrack of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Additional music not used in the film was released in 1972 as &quot;Wendy Carlos&#x27;s Clockwork Orange&quot;. Kubrick later collaborated with Carlos on &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980). The opening of the film employs Carlos&#x27; rendering of &quot;Dies Irae&quot; (Day of Wrath) from Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Kubrick married his high-school sweetheart Toba Metz, a caricaturist, on May 29, 1948, when he was 19 years old. The couple lived together in Greenwich Village and divorced three years later in 1951. He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer Ruth Sobotka, in 1952. They lived together in New York City&#x27;s East Village beginning in 1952, married in January 1955 and moved to Hollywood in July 1955, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick&#x27;s film &quot;Killer&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1955). The following year, she was art director for his film &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956). They divorced in 1957.

During the production of &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; in Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958 and the couple remained together for 40 years, until his death in 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009) and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). In 1959, they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in Beverly Hills with Harlan&#x27;s daughter, Katherina, aged six. They also lived in New York City, during which time Christiane studied art at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make &quot;Lolita&quot;, and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York City.
In 1965, the Kubricks bought Abbots Mead on Barnet Lane, just south-west of the Elstree/Borehamwood studio complex in England. Kubrick worked almost exclusively from this home for 14 years where, he researched, invented special effects techniques, designed ultra-low light lenses for specially modified cameras, pre-produced, edited, post-produced, advertised, distributed and carefully managed all aspects of four of his films. In 1978, Kubrick moved into Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire, a mainly 18th-century stately home, which was once owned by a wealthy racehorse owner, about north of London and a 10-minute drive from his previous home at Abbotts Mead. His new home became a workplace for Kubrick and his wife, &quot;a perfect family factory&quot; as Christiane called it, and Kubrick converted the stables into extra production rooms besides ones within the home that he used for editing and storage.

A workaholic, Kubrick rarely took a vacation or left England during the forty years before his death. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick&#x27;s confined way of living and desire for privacy has led to spurious stories about his reclusiveness, similar to those of Greta Garbo, Howard Hughes and J. D. Salinger. Michael Herr, Kubrick&#x27;s co-screenwriter on &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot;, who knew him well, considers his &quot;reclusiveness&quot; to be myth: &quot;[He] was in fact a complete failure as a recluse, unless you believe that a recluse is simply someone who seldom leaves his house. Stanley saw a lot of people ... he was one of the most gregarious men I ever knew and it didn&#x27;t change anything that most of this conviviality went on over the phone.&quot; LoBrutto states that one of the reasons he acquired a reputation as a recluse was that he insisted in remaining near his home but the reason for this was that for Kubrick there were only three places on the planet he could make high quality films with the necessary technical expertise and equipment: Los Angeles, New York City or around London. He disliked living in Los Angeles and thought London a superior film production center to New York City.

As a person, Kubrick was described by Norman Lloyd as &quot;a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious&quot;. Marisa Berenson, who starred in &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, fondly recalled: &quot;There was great tenderness in him and he was passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence but he also had a great sense of humor. He was a very shy person and self-protective but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day.&quot; Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that &quot;Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants&quot;. Kubrick had obtained a pilot&#x27;s license in August 1947 and some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague was killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Paul Duncan, traumatized him for life. Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine.

== Death ==
On March 7, 1999, six days after screening a final cut of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; for his family and the film&#x27;s stars, Kubrick unexpectedly died of a heart attack in his sleep at the age of 70. His funeral was held five days later at Childwickbury Manor, with only close friends and family in attendance, totaling about 100 people. The media were kept a mile away outside the entrance gate. Alexander Walker, who attended the funeral, described it as a &quot;family farewell, ... almost like an English picnic&quot; with cellists, clarinetists, and singers providing music from many of Kubrick&#x27;s favorite classical compositions. &quot;Kaddish&quot;, the Jewish prayer typically said by mourners and in other contexts, was recited. A few of his obituaries mentioned his Jewish background. Among those who gave eulogies were his brother-in-law Jan Harlan, Terry Semel, Steven Spielberg, Nicole Kidman, and Tom Cruise. He was buried next to his favorite tree on the estate. In her book dedicated to him, his wife Christiane included one of his favorite quotations of Oscar Wilde: &quot;The tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young.&quot;

=== Cultural impact ===

Part of the New Hollywood film-making wave, Kubrick&#x27;s films are considered by film historian Michel Ciment to be &quot;among the most important contributions to world cinema in the twentieth century&quot;, and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest and most influential directors in the history of cinema. According to film historian and Kubrick scholar Robert Kolker, Kubrick&#x27;s films were &quot;more intellectually rigorous than the work of any other American filmmaker.&quot; Leading directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Wes Anderson, George Lucas, James Cameron, Terry Gilliam, the Coen brothers, Ridley Scott, and George A. Romero, have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and additionally in the case of Spielberg and Scott, collaboration. On the DVD of &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, Steven Spielberg comments that the way Kubrick &quot;tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories&quot; and that &quot;nobody could shoot a picture better in history&quot;. Orson Welles, one of Kubrick&#x27;s greatest personal influences and favorite directors, said that: &quot;Among those whom I would call &#x27;younger generation&#x27;, Kubrick appears to me to be a giant.&quot;

Kubrick continues to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including Christopher Nolan, Todd Field, David Fincher, Guillermo del Toro, David Lynch, Lars von Trier, Tim Burton, Michael Mann, and Gaspar Noé. Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick&#x27;s inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing, as well as his use of music, including Frank Darabont.

Artists in fields other than film have also expressed admiration for Kubrick. English musician and poet PJ Harvey, in an interview about her 2011 album &quot;Let England Shake&quot;, argued that &quot;something about [...] what is not said in his films...there&#x27;s so much space, so many things that are silent – and somehow, in that space and silence everything becomes clear. With every film, he seems to capture the essence of life itself, particularly in films like &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;...those are some of my favorites.&quot; The music video for Kanye West&#x27;s 2010 song &quot;Runaway&quot; was inspired by &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;. Pop singer Lady Gaga&#x27;s concert shows have included the use of dialogue, costumes, and music from &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.

=== Tributes ===

In 2000, BAFTA renamed their Britannia lifetime achievement award the &quot;Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award&quot;, joining the likes of D. W. Griffith, Laurence Olivier, Cecil B. DeMille, and Irving Thalberg, all of whom have annual awards named after them. Kubrick won this award in 1999, and subsequent recipients have included George Lucas, Warren Beatty, Tom Cruise, Robert De Niro, Clint Eastwood, and Daniel Day-Lewis. Many people who worked with Kubrick on his films created the 2001 documentary &quot;Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures&quot;, produced and directed by Kubrick&#x27;s brother-in-law, Jan Harlan, who had executive produced Kubrick&#x27;s last four films.

The first public exhibition of material from Kubrick&#x27;s personal archives was presented jointly in 2004 by the Deutsches Filmmuseum and Deutsches Architekturmuseum in Frankfurt, Germany, in cooperation with Christiane Kubrick and Jan Harlan / The Stanley Kubrick Estate. In 2009, an exhibition of paintings and photos inspired by Kubrick&#x27;s films was held in Dublin, Ireland, entitled &quot;Stanley Kubrick: Taming Light&quot;. On October 30, 2012, an exhibition devoted to Kubrick opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and concluded in June 2013. Exhibits include a wide collection of documents, photographs and on-set material assembled from 800 boxes of personal archives that were stored in Kubrick&#x27;s home-workplace in the UK. Many celebrities attended and spoke at the museum&#x27;s pre-opening gala, including Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and Jack Nicholson, while Kubrick&#x27;s widow, Christiane, appeared at the pre-gala press review. In October 2013, the Brazil São Paulo International Film Festival paid tribute to Kubrick, staging an exhibit of his work and a retrospective of his films. The exhibit opened at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in late 2014 and ended in January 2015.

Kubrick is widely referenced in popular culture; for example, the TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is said to contain more references to Kubrick films than any other pop culture phenomenon. When the Directors Guild of Great Britain gave Kubrick a lifetime achievement award, they included a cut-together sequence of all the homages from the show. Several works have been created that related to Kubrick&#x27;s life, including the made-for-TV mockumentary &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (2002), which is a parody of the pervasive conspiracy theory that Kubrick had been involved with the faked footage of the NASA Moon landings during the filming of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. &quot;Colour Me Kubrick&quot; (2005) was authorized by Kubrick&#x27;s family and starred John Malkovich as Alan Conway, a con artist who had assumed Kubrick&#x27;s identity in the 1990s. In the 2004 film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;, Kubrick was portrayed by Stanley Tucci; the film documents the filming of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.

In April 2018, the month that marked the 50th anniversary of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;, the International Astronomical Union named the largest mountain of Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon after Kubrick.

From October 2019 to March 2020, the Skirball Cultural Center hosted an exhibition called &quot;Through a Different Lens: Stanley Kubrick Photographs&quot;, a show focusing on Kubrick&#x27;s early career.

<text>Statistics (from German: &quot;&quot;, &quot;description of a state, a country&quot;) is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. In applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. Populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as &quot;all people living in a country&quot; or &quot;every atom composing a crystal&quot;. Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.

When census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.

Two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). Descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a &quot;distribution&quot; (sample or population): &quot;central tendency&quot; (or &quot;location&quot;) seeks to characterize the distribution&#x27;s central or typical value, while &quot;dispersion&quot; (or &quot;variability&quot;) characterizes the extent to which members of the distribution depart from its center and each other. Inferences made using mathematical statistics employ the framework of probability theory, which deals with the analysis of random phenomena.

A standard statistical procedure involves the collection of data leading to a test of the relationship between two statistical data sets, or a data set and synthetic data drawn from an idealized model. A hypothesis is proposed for the statistical relationship between the two data sets, an alternative to an idealized null hypothesis of no relationship between two data sets. Rejecting or disproving the null hypothesis is done using statistical tests that quantify the sense in which the null can be proven false, given the data that are used in the test. Working from a null hypothesis, two basic forms of error are recognized: Type I errors (null hypothesis is rejected when it is in fact true, giving a &quot;false positive&quot;) and Type II errors (null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is in fact false, giving a &quot;false negative&quot;). Multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.

Statistical measurement processes are also prone to error in regards to the data that they generate. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also occur. The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

== Introduction ==

&quot;Statistics is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data.&quot; - featured in the International Encyclopedia of Statistical Science.Statistics is the discipline that deals with data, facts and figures with which meaningful information is inferred. Data may represent a numerical value, in form of quantitative data, or a label, as with qualitative data. Data may be collected, presented and summarised, in one of two methods called descriptive statistics. Two elementary summaries of data, singularly called a statistic, are the mean and dispersion. Whereas inferential statistics interprets data from a population sample to induce statements and predictions about a population.

Statistics is regarded as a body of science or a branch of mathematics. It is based on probability, a branch of mathematics that studies random events. Statistics is considered the science of uncertainty. This arises from the ways to cope with measurement and sampling error as well as dealing with uncertanties in modelling. Although probability and statistics was once paired together as a single subject, they are conceptually distinct from one another. The former is based on deducing answers to specific situations from a general theory of probability, meanwhile statistics induces statements about a population based on a data set. Statistics serves to bridge the gap between probability and applied mathematical fields.

Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics. While many scientific investigations make use of data, statistics is generally concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty. Statistics is indexed at 62, a subclass of probability theory and stochastic processes, in the Mathematics Subject Classification. Mathematical statistics is covered in the range 276-280 of subclass QA (science &gt; mathematics) in the Library of Congress Classification.

The word statistics ultimately comes from the Latin word Status, meaning &quot;situation&quot; or &quot;condition&quot; in society, which in late Latin adopted the meaning &quot;state&quot;. Derived from this, political scientist Gottfried Achenwall, coined the German word statistik (a summary of how things stand). In 1770, the term entered the English language through German and referred to the study of political arrangements. The term gained its modern meaning in the 1790s in John Sinclair&#x27;s works. In modern German, the term statistik is synonymous with mathematical statistics. The term statistic, in singular form, is used to describe a function that returns its value of the same name.

==Statistical data==
=== Data collection ===
====Sampling====
When full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. Statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models.

To use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.

Sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory. Probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more generally, the properties of statistical procedures. The use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method. The difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples. Statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite direction—inductively inferring from samples to the parameters of a larger or total population.

====Experimental and observational studies====
A common goal for a statistical research project is to investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion on the effect of changes in the values of predictors or independent variables on dependent variables. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or variables) on the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective. An experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements with different levels using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. In contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation. Instead, data are gathered and correlations between predictors and response are investigated. While the tools of data analysis work best on data from randomized studies, they are also applied to other kinds of data—like natural experiments and observational studies—for which a statistician would use a modified, more structured estimation method (e.g., difference in differences estimation and instrumental variables, among many others) that produce consistent estimators.

=====Experiments=====
The basic steps of a statistical experiment are:

# Planning the research, including finding the number of replicates of the study, using the following information: preliminary estimates regarding the size of treatment effects, alternative hypotheses, and the estimated experimental variability. Consideration of the selection of experimental subjects and the ethics of research is necessary. Statisticians recommend that experiments compare (at least) one new treatment with a standard treatment or control, to allow an unbiased estimate of the difference in treatment effects.
# Design of experiments, using blocking to reduce the influence of confounding variables, and randomized assignment of treatments to subjects to allow unbiased estimates of treatment effects and experimental error. At this stage, the experimenters and statisticians write the &quot;experimental protocol&quot; that will guide the performance of the experiment and which specifies the&quot; primary analysis&quot; of the experimental data.
# Performing the experiment following the experimental protocol and analyzing the data following the experimental protocol.
# Further examining the data set in secondary analyses, to suggest new hypotheses for future study.
# Documenting and presenting the results of the study.

Experiments on human behavior have special concerns. The famous Hawthorne study examined changes to the working environment at the Hawthorne plant of the Western Electric Company. The researchers were interested in determining whether increased illumination would increase the productivity of the assembly line workers. The researchers first measured the productivity in the plant, then modified the illumination in an area of the plant and checked if the changes in illumination affected productivity. It turned out that productivity indeed improved (under the experimental conditions). However, the study is heavily criticized today for errors in experimental procedures, specifically for the lack of a control group and blindness. The Hawthorne effect refers to finding that an outcome (in this case, worker productivity) changed due to observation itself. Those in the Hawthorne study became more productive not because the lighting was changed but because they were being observed.

=====Observational study=====
An example of an observational study is one that explores the association between smoking and lung cancer. This type of study typically uses a survey to collect observations about the area of interest and then performs statistical analysis. In this case, the researchers would collect observations of both smokers and non-smokers, perhaps through a cohort study, and then look for the number of cases of lung cancer in each group. A case-control study is another type of observational study in which people with and without the outcome of interest (e.g. lung cancer) are invited to participate and their exposure histories are collected.

===Types of data===
Various attempts have been made to produce a taxonomy of levels of measurement. The psychophysicist Stanley Smith Stevens defined nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio scales. Nominal measurements do not have meaningful rank order among values, and permit any one-to-one (injective) transformation. Ordinal measurements have imprecise differences between consecutive values, but have a meaningful order to those values, and permit any order-preserving transformation. Interval measurements have meaningful distances between measurements defined, but the zero value is arbitrary (as in the case with longitude and temperature measurements in Celsius or Fahrenheit), and permit any linear transformation. Ratio measurements have both a meaningful zero value and the distances between different measurements defined, and permit any rescaling transformation.

Because variables conforming only to nominal or ordinal measurements cannot be reasonably measured numerically, sometimes they are grouped together as categorical variables, whereas ratio and interval measurements are grouped together as quantitative variables, which can be either discrete or continuous, due to their numerical nature. Such distinctions can often be loosely correlated with data type in computer science, in that dichotomous categorical variables may be represented with the Boolean data type, polytomous categorical variables with arbitrarily assigned integers in the integral data type, and continuous variables with the real data type involving floating-point arithmetic. But the mapping of computer science data types to statistical data types depends on which categorization of the latter is being implemented.

Other categorizations have been proposed. For example, Mosteller and Tukey (1977) distinguished grades, ranks, counted fractions, counts, amounts, and balances. Nelder (1990) described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. (See also: Chrisman (1998), van den Berg (1991).)

The issue of whether or not it is appropriate to apply different kinds of statistical methods to data obtained from different kinds of measurement procedures is complicated by issues concerning the transformation of variables and the precise interpretation of research questions. &quot;The relationship between the data and what they describe merely reflects the fact that certain kinds of statistical statements may have truth values which are not invariant under some transformations. Whether or not a transformation is sensible to contemplate depends on the question one is trying to answer.&quot;

== Methods ==
=== Descriptive statistics ===
A descriptive statistic (in the count noun sense) is a summary statistic that quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information, while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics. Descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics (or inductive statistics), in that descriptive statistics aims to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent.

=== Inferential statistics ===
Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.

====Terminology and theory of inferential statistics====
=====Statistics, estimators and pivotal quantities=====
Consider independent identically distributed (IID) random variables with a given probability distribution: standard statistical inference and estimation theory defines a random sample as the random vector given by the column vector of these IID variables. The population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.

A statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but . The probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters. Consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function. Commonly used estimators include sample mean, unbiased sample variance and sample covariance.

A random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution &quot;does not depend on the unknown parameter&quot; is called a pivotal quantity or pivot. Widely used pivots include the z-score, the chi square statistic and Student&#x27;s t-value.

Between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient. Furthermore, an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter.

Other desirable properties for estimators include: UMVUE estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated (this is usually an easier property to verify than efficiency) and consistent estimators which converges in probability to the true value of such parameter.

This still leaves the question of how to obtain estimators in a given situation and carry the computation, several methods have been proposed: the method of moments, the maximum likelihood method, the least squares method and the more recent method of estimating equations.

=====Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis=====
Interpretation of statistical information can often involve the development of a null hypothesis which is usually (but not necessarily) that no relationship exists among variables or that no change occurred over time.

The best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. The null hypothesis, H0, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, H1, asserts that the defendant is guilty. The indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. The H0 (status quo) stands in opposition to H1 and is maintained unless H1 is supported by evidence &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot;. However, &quot;failure to reject H0&quot; in this case does not imply innocence, but merely that the evidence was insufficient to convict. So the jury does not necessarily &quot;accept&quot; H0 but &quot;fails to reject&quot; H0. While one can not &quot;prove&quot; a null hypothesis, one can test how close it is to being true with a power test, which tests for type II errors.

What statisticians call an alternative hypothesis is simply a hypothesis that contradicts the null hypothesis.

=====Error=====
Working from a null hypothesis, two broad categories of error are recognized:

* Type I errors where the null hypothesis is falsely rejected, giving a &quot;false positive&quot;.
* Type II errors where the null hypothesis fails to be rejected and an actual difference between populations is missed, giving a &quot;false negative&quot;.

Standard deviation refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean, while Standard error refers to an estimate of difference between sample mean and population mean.

A statistical error is the amount by which an observation differs from its expected value. A residual is the amount an observation differs from the value the estimator of the expected value assumes on a given sample (also called prediction).

Mean squared error is used for obtaining efficient estimators, a widely used class of estimators. Root mean square error is simply the square root of mean squared error.

Many statistical methods seek to minimize the residual sum of squares, and these are called &quot;methods of least squares&quot; in contrast to Least absolute deviations. The latter gives equal weight to small and big errors, while the former gives more weight to large errors. Residual sum of squares is also differentiable, which provides a handy property for doing regression. Least squares applied to linear regression is called ordinary least squares method and least squares applied to nonlinear regression is called non-linear least squares. Also in a linear regression model the non deterministic part of the model is called error term, disturbance or more simply noise. Both linear regression and non-linear regression are addressed in polynomial least squares, which also describes the variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (y axis) as a function of the independent variable (x axis) and the deviations (errors, noise, disturbances) from the estimated (fitted) curve.

Measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. Many of these errors are classified as random (noise) or systematic (bias), but other types of errors (e.g., blunder, such as when an analyst reports incorrect units) can also be important. The presence of missing data or censoring may result in biased estimates and specific techniques have been developed to address these problems.

=====Interval estimation=====


Most studies only sample part of a population, so results do not fully represent the whole population. Any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. Confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. Often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. Formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions (yielding a different dataset), the interval would include the true (population) value in 95% of all possible cases. This does &quot;not&quot; imply that the probability that the true value is in the confidence interval is 95%. From the frequentist perspective, such a claim does not even make sense, as the true value is not a random variable. Either the true value is or is not within the given interval. However, it is true that, before any data are sampled and given a plan for how to construct the confidence interval, the probability is 95% that the yet-to-be-calculated interval will cover the true value: at this point, the limits of the interval are yet-to-be-observed random variables. One approach that does yield an interval that can be interpreted as having a given probability of containing the true value is to use a credible interval from Bayesian statistics: this approach depends on a different way of interpreting what is meant by &quot;probability&quot;, that is as a Bayesian probability.

In principle confidence intervals can be symmetrical or asymmetrical. An interval can be asymmetrical because it works as lower or upper bound for a parameter (left-sided interval or right sided interval), but it can also be asymmetrical because the two sided interval is built violating symmetry around the estimate. Sometimes the bounds for a confidence interval are reached asymptotically and these are used to approximate the true bounds.

=====Significance=====
Statistics rarely give a simple Yes/No type answer to the question under analysis. Interpretation often comes down to the level of statistical significance applied to the numbers and often refers to the probability of a value accurately rejecting the null hypothesis (sometimes referred to as the p-value).

The standard approach is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. A critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. The probability of type I error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true (statistical significance) and the probability of type II error is the probability that the estimator does not belong to the critical region given that the alternative hypothesis is true. The statistical power of a test is the probability that it correctly rejects the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.

Referring to statistical significance does not necessarily mean that the overall result is significant in real world terms. For example, in a large study of a drug it may be shown that the drug has a statistically significant but very small beneficial effect, such that the drug is unlikely to help the patient noticeably.

Although in principle the acceptable level of statistical significance may be subject to debate, the significance level is the largest p-value that allows the test to reject the null hypothesis. This test is logically equivalent to saying that the p-value is the probability, assuming the null hypothesis is true, of observing a result at least as extreme as the test statistic. Therefore, the smaller the significance level, the lower the probability of committing type I error.

Some problems are usually associated with this framework (See criticism of hypothesis testing):

* A difference that is highly statistically significant can still be of no practical significance, but it is possible to properly formulate tests to account for this. One response involves going beyond reporting only the significance level to include the &quot;p&quot;-value when reporting whether a hypothesis is rejected or accepted. The p-value, however, does not indicate the size or importance of the observed effect and can also seem to exaggerate the importance of minor differences in large studies. A better and increasingly common approach is to report confidence intervals. Although these are produced from the same calculations as those of hypothesis tests or &quot;p&quot;-values, they describe both the size of the effect and the uncertainty surrounding it.
* Fallacy of the transposed conditional, aka prosecutor&#x27;s fallacy: criticisms arise because the hypothesis testing approach forces one hypothesis (the null hypothesis) to be favored, since what is being evaluated is the probability of the observed result given the null hypothesis and not probability of the null hypothesis given the observed result. An alternative to this approach is offered by Bayesian inference, although it requires establishing a prior probability.
* Rejecting the null hypothesis does not automatically prove the alternative hypothesis.
* As everything in inferential statistics it relies on sample size, and therefore under fat tails p-values may be seriously mis-computed.

=====Examples=====
Some well-known statistical tests and procedures are:

===Exploratory data analysis===
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

=== Mathematical statistics ===

Mathematical statistics is the application of mathematics to statistics. Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure-theoretic probability theory. All statistical analyses make use of at least some mathematics, and mathematical statistics can therefore be regarded as a fundamental component of general statistics.

== History ==

Formal discussions on inference date back to the mathematicians and cryptographers of the Islamic Golden Age between the 8th and 13th centuries. Al-Khalil (717–786) wrote the &quot;Book of Cryptographic Messages&quot;, which contains one of the first uses of permutations and combinations, to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels. Al-Kindi&#x27;s &quot;Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages&quot; gave a detailed description of how to use frequency analysis to decipher encrypted messages, providing an early example of statistical inference for decoding. Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) later made an important contribution on the use of sample size in frequency analysis.

Although the term &quot;statistic&quot; was introduced by the Italian scholar Girolamo Ghilini in 1589 with reference to a collection of facts and information about a state, it was the German Gottfried Achenwall in 1749 who started using the term as a collection of quantitative information, in the modern use for this science. The earliest writing containing statistics in Europe dates back to 1663, with the publication of &quot;Natural and Political Observations upon the Bills of Mortality&quot; by John Graunt. Early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its &quot;stat-&quot; etymology. The scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. Today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.

The mathematical foundations of statistics developed from discussions concerning games of chance among mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano, Blaise Pascal, Pierre de Fermat, and Christiaan Huygens. Although the idea of probability was already examined in ancient and medieval law and philosophy (such as the work of Juan Caramuel), probability theory as a mathematical discipline only took shape at the very end of the 17th century, particularly in Jacob Bernoulli&#x27;s posthumous work &quot;&quot;. This was the first book where the realm of games of chance and the realm of the probable (which concerned opinion, evidence, and argument) were combined and submitted to mathematical analysis. The method of least squares was first described by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1805, though Carl Friedrich Gauss presumably made use of it a decade earlier in 1795.

The modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages. The first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton&#x27;s contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics—height, weight and eyelash length among others. Pearson developed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, defined as a product-moment, the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things. Galton and Pearson founded &quot;Biometrika&quot; as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called &quot;biometry&quot;), and the latter founded the world&#x27;s first university statistics department at University College London.

The second wave of the 1910s and 20s was initiated by William Sealy Gosset, and reached its culmination in the insights of Ronald Fisher, who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. Fisher&#x27;s most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper &quot;The Correlation between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance&quot; (which was the first to use the statistical term, variance), his classic 1925 work &quot;Statistical Methods for Research Workers&quot; and his 1935 &quot;The Design of Experiments&quot;, where he developed rigorous design of experiments models. He originated the concepts of sufficiency, ancillary statistics, Fisher&#x27;s linear discriminator and Fisher information. He also coined the term null hypothesis during the Lady tasting tea experiment, which &quot;is never proved or established, but is possibly disproved, in the course of experimentation&quot;. In his 1930 book &quot;The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection&quot;, he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as Fisher&#x27;s principle (which A. W. F. Edwards called &quot;probably the most celebrated argument in evolutionary biology&quot;) and Fisherian runaway, a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway effect found in evolution.

The final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between Egon Pearson and Jerzy Neyman in the 1930s. They introduced the concepts of &quot;Type II&quot; error, power of a test and confidence intervals. Jerzy Neyman in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive (quota) sampling.

Today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. The use of modern computers has expedited large-scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. Statistics continues to be an area of active research, for example on the problem of how to analyze big data.

==Applications==
===Applied statistics, theoretical statistics and mathematical statistics===
&quot;Applied statistics,&quot; sometimes referred to as &quot;Statistical science,&quot; comprises descriptive statistics and the application of inferential statistics. &quot;Theoretical statistics&quot; concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference, as well as encompassing &quot;mathematical statistics&quot;. Mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments.

Statistical consultants can help organizations and companies that do not have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.

===Machine learning and data mining===
Machine learning models are statistical and probabilistic models that capture patterns in the data through use of computational algorithms.

===Statistics in academia===
Statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, including natural and social sciences, government, and business. Business statistics applies statistical methods in econometrics, auditing and production and operations, including services improvement and marketing research. A study of two journals in tropical biology found that the 12 most frequent statistical tests are: analysis of variance (ANOVA), chi-squared test, Student&#x27;s t-test, linear regression, Pearson&#x27;s correlation coefficient, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Shannon&#x27;s diversity index, Tukey&#x27;s range test, cluster analysis, Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient and principal component analysis.

A typical statistics course covers descriptive statistics, probability, binomial and normal distributions, test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, linear regression, and correlation. Modern fundamental statistical courses for undergraduate students focus on correct test selection, results interpretation, and use of free statistics software.

===Statistical computing===

The rapid and sustained increases in computing power starting from the second half of the 20th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. Early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical algorithms, caused an increased interest in nonlinear models (such as neural networks) as well as the creation of new types, such as generalized linear models and multilevel models.

Increased computing power has also led to the growing popularity of computationally intensive methods based on resampling, such as permutation tests and the bootstrap, while techniques such as Gibbs sampling have made use of Bayesian models more feasible. The computer revolution has implications for the future of statistics with a new emphasis on &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;empirical&quot; statistics. A large number of both general and special purpose statistical software are now available. Examples of available software capable of complex statistical computation include programs such as Mathematica, SAS, SPSS, and R.

===Business statistics===
In business, &quot;statistics&quot; is a widely used management- and decision support tool. It is particularly applied in financial management, marketing management, and production, services and operations management. Statistics is also heavily used in management accounting and auditing. The discipline of Management Science formalizes the use of statistics, and other mathematics, in business. (Econometrics is the application of statistical methods to economic data in order to give empirical content to economic relationships.)

A typical &quot;Business Statistics&quot; course is intended for business majors, and covers descriptive statistics (collection, description, analysis, and summary of data), probability (typically the binomial and normal distributions), test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, linear regression, and correlation; (follow-on) courses may include forecasting, time series, decision trees, multiple linear regression, and other topics from business analytics more generally. Professional certification programs, such as the CFA, often include topics in statistics.

== Specialized disciplines ==
Statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: biostatistics, computational biology, computational sociology, network biology, social science, sociology and social research. Some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have specialized terminology. These disciplines include:

In addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:

Statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. It is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in statistical process control or SPC), for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions.

== Misuse ==
Misuse of statistics can produce subtle but serious errors in description and interpretation—subtle in the sense that even experienced professionals make such errors, and serious in the sense that they can lead to devastating decision errors. For instance, social policy, medical practice, and the reliability of structures like bridges all rely on the proper use of statistics.

Even when statistical techniques are correctly applied, the results can be difficult to interpret for those lacking expertise. The statistical significance of a trend in the data—which measures the extent to which a trend could be caused by random variation in the sample—may or may not agree with an intuitive sense of its significance. The set of basic statistical skills (and skepticism) that people need to deal with information in their everyday lives properly is referred to as statistical literacy.

There is a general perception that statistical knowledge is all-too-frequently intentionally misused by finding ways to interpret only the data that are favorable to the presenter. A mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, &quot;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics&quot;. Misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book &quot;How to Lie with Statistics&quot;, by Darrell Huff, outlines a range of considerations. In an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted (e.g. Warne, Lazo, Ramos, and Ritter (2012)).

Ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias. Misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias. Bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs. Most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. Thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented. To make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole. According to Huff, &quot;The dependability of a sample can be destroyed by [bias]... allow yourself some degree of skepticism.&quot;

To assist in the understanding of statistics Huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case:

* Who says so? (Does he/she have an axe to grind?)
* How does he/she know? (Does he/she have the resources to know the facts?)
* What&#x27;s missing? (Does he/she give us a complete picture?)
* Did someone change the subject? (Does he/she offer us the right answer to the wrong problem?)
* Does it make sense? (Is his/her conclusion logical and consistent with what we already know?)

===Misinterpretation: correlation===

The concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. Statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables (properties) of the population under consideration tend to vary together, as if they were connected. For example, a study of annual income that also looks at age of death, might find that poor people tend to have shorter lives than affluent people. The two variables are said to be correlated; however, they may or may not be the cause of one another. The correlation phenomena could be caused by a third, previously unconsidered phenomenon, called a lurking variable or confounding variable. For this reason, there is no way to immediately infer the existence of a causal relationship between the two variables.

<doc id="26689" wikidata="Q9027" url="?curid=26689" title="Swedish language">
<text>Swedish ( ) is a North Germanic language from the Indo-European language family, spoken predominantly in Sweden and parts of Finland. It has at least 10 million native speakers, making it the fourth most spoken Germanic language, and the first among its type in the Nordic countries overall.

Swedish, like the other Nordic languages, is a descendant of Old Norse, the common language of the Germanic peoples living in Scandinavia during the Viking Age. It is largely mutually intelligible with Norwegian and Danish, although the degree of mutual intelligibility is dependent on the dialect and accent of the speaker.

Standard Swedish, spoken by most Swedes, is the national language that evolved from the Central Swedish dialects in the 19th century, and was well established by the beginning of the 20th century. While distinct regional varieties and rural dialects still exist, the written language is uniform and standardized. Swedish is the most widely spoken second language in Finland where its status is co-official language.

Swedish was long spoken in parts of Estonia, although the current status of the Estonian Swedish speakers is almost extinct. It is also used in the Swedish diaspora, most notably in Oslo, Norway, with more than 50,000 Swedish residents.

==Classification==
Swedish is an Indo-European language belonging to the North Germanic branch of the Germanic languages. In the established classification, it belongs to the East Scandinavian languages, together with Danish, separating it from the West Scandinavian languages, consisting of Faroese, Icelandic, and Norwegian. However, more recent analyses divide the North Germanic languages into two groups: &quot;Insular Scandinavian&quot; (Faroese and Icelandic), and &quot;Continental Scandinavian&quot; (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), based on mutual intelligibility due to heavy influence of East Scandinavian (particularly Danish) on Norwegian during the last millennium and divergence from both Faroese and Icelandic.

By many general criteria of mutual intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages could very well be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland, and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.

Swedish pronunciations also vary greatly from one region to another, a legacy of the vast geographic distances and historical isolation. Even so, the vocabulary is standardized to a level that make dialects within Sweden virtually fully mutually intelligible.

==History==
===Old Norse===
In the 8th century, the common Germanic language of Scandinavia, Proto-Norse, evolved into Old Norse. This language underwent more changes that did not spread to all of Scandinavia, which resulted in the appearance of two similar dialects: &quot;Old West Norse&quot; (Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland) and &quot;Old East Norse&quot; (Denmark and Sweden). The dialects of Old East Norse spoken in Sweden are called &quot;Runic Swedish&quot;, while the dialects of Denmark are referred to as &quot;Runic Danish&quot;. The dialects are described as &quot;runic&quot; because the main body of text appears in the runic alphabet. Unlike Proto-Norse, which was written with the Elder Futhark alphabet, Old Norse was written with the Younger Futhark alphabet, which had only 16 letters. Because the number of runes was limited, some runes were used for a range of phonemes, such as the rune for the vowel &quot;u&quot;, which was also used for the vowels &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ø&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, and the rune for &quot;i&quot;, also used for &quot;e&quot;.

From 1200 onwards, the dialects in Denmark began to diverge from those of Sweden. The innovations spread unevenly from Denmark, creating a series of minor dialectal boundaries, or isoglosses, ranging from Zealand in the south to Norrland, Österbotten and northwestern Finland in the north.

An early change that separated Runic Danish from the other dialects of Old East Norse was the change of the diphthong &quot;æi&quot; to the monophthong &quot;é&quot;, as in &quot;stæinn&quot; to &quot;sténn&quot; &quot;stone&quot;. This is reflected in runic inscriptions where the older read &quot;stain&quot; and the later &quot;stin&quot;. There was also a change of &quot;au&quot; as in &quot;dauðr&quot; into a long open &quot;ø&quot; as in &quot;døðr&quot; &quot;dead&quot;. This change is shown in runic inscriptions as a change from &quot;tauþr&quot; into &quot;tuþr&quot;. Moreover, the &quot;øy&quot; diphthong changed into a long, close &quot;ø&quot;, as in the Old Norse word for &quot;island&quot;. By the end of the period, these innovations had affected most of the Runic Swedish-speaking area as well, with the exception of the dialects spoken north and east of Mälardalen where the diphthongs still exist in remote areas.

===Old Swedish===
Old Swedish (Swedish: &quot;fornsvenska&quot;) is the term used for the medieval Swedish language. The start date is usually set to 1225 since this is the year that &quot;Västgötalagen&quot; (&quot;the Västgöta Law&quot;) is believed to have been compiled for the first time. It is among the most important documents of the period written in Latin script and the oldest Swedish law codes. Old Swedish is divided into &quot;äldre fornsvenska&quot; (1225–1375) and &quot;yngre fornsvenska&quot; (1375–1526), &quot;older&quot; and &quot;younger&quot; Old Swedish. Important outside influences during this time came with the firm establishment of the Christian church and various monastic orders, introducing many Greek and Latin loanwords. With the rise of Hanseatic power in the late 13th and early 14th century, Middle Low German became very influential. The Hanseatic league provided Swedish commerce and administration with a large number of Low German-speaking immigrants. Many became quite influential members of Swedish medieval society, and brought terms from their native languages into the vocabulary. Besides a great number of loanwords for such areas as warfare, trade and administration, general grammatical suffixes and even conjunctions were imported. The League also brought a certain measure of influence from Danish (at the time Swedish and Danish were much more similar than today).

Early Old Swedish was markedly different from the modern language in that it had a more complex case structure and also retained the original Germanic three-gender system. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns and certain numerals were inflected in four cases; besides the extant nominative, there were also the genitive (later possessive), dative and accusative. The gender system resembled that of modern German, having masculine, feminine and neuter genders. The masculine and feminine genders were later merged into a &quot;common gender&quot; with the definite suffix &quot;-en&quot; and the definite article &quot;den&quot;, in contrast with the neuter gender equivalents &quot;-et&quot; and &quot;det&quot;. The verb system was also more complex: it included subjunctive and imperative moods and verbs were conjugated according to person as well as number. By the 16th century, the case and gender systems of the colloquial spoken language and the profane literature had been largely reduced to the two cases and two genders of modern Swedish.

A transitional change of the Latin script in the Nordic countries was to spell the letter combination &quot;ae&quot; as æ – and sometimes as a&#x27; – though it varied between persons and regions. The combination &quot;ao&quot; was similarly rendered ao, and &quot;oe&quot; became oe. These three were later to evolve into the separate letters ä, å and ö. The first time the new letters were used in print was in &quot;Aff dyäffwlsens frästilse&quot; (&quot;By the Devil&#x27;s temptation&quot;) published by Johan Gerson in 1495.

===Modern Swedish===
Modern Swedish (Swedish: &quot;nysvenska&quot;) begins with the advent of the printing press and the European Reformation. After assuming power, the new monarch Gustav Vasa ordered a Swedish translation of the Bible. The New Testament was published in 1526, followed by a full Bible translation in 1541, usually referred to as the &quot;Gustav Vasa Bible&quot;, a translation deemed so successful and influential that, with revisions incorporated in successive editions, it remained the most common Bible translation until 1917. The main translators were Laurentius Andreæ and the brothers Laurentius and Olaus Petri.

The Vasa Bible is often considered to be a reasonable compromise between old and new; while not adhering to the colloquial spoken language of its day, it was not overly conservative in its use of archaic forms. It was a major step towards a more consistent Swedish orthography. It established the use of the vowels &quot;å&quot;, &quot;ä&quot;, and &quot;ö&quot;, and the spelling &quot;ck&quot; in place of &quot;kk&quot;, distinguishing it clearly from the Danish Bible, perhaps intentionally, given the ongoing rivalry between the countries. All three translators came from central Sweden, which is generally seen as adding specific Central Swedish features to the new Bible.

Though it might seem as if the Bible translation set a very powerful precedent for orthographic standards, spelling actually became more inconsistent during the remainder of the century. It was not until the 17th century that spelling began to be discussed, around the time when the first grammars were written. Capitalization during this time was not standardized. It depended on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface that was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with a Latin typeface (often Antiqua).

Some important changes in sound during the Modern Swedish period were the gradual assimilation of several different consonant clusters into the fricative and later into . There was also the gradual softening of and into and the fricative before front vowels. The velar fricative was also transformed into the corresponding plosive .

===Contemporary Swedish===

The period that includes Swedish as it is spoken today is termed (lit., &quot;Now-Swedish&quot;) in linguistics, and started in the last decades of the 19th century. It saw a democratization of the language with a less formal written form that approached the spoken one. The growth of a state school system also led to the evolution of so-called (literally, &quot;book Swedish&quot;), especially among the working classes, where spelling to some extent influenced pronunciation, particularly in official contexts. With the industrialization and urbanization of Sweden well under way by the last decades of the 19th century, a new breed of authors made their mark on Swedish literature. Many scholars, politicians and other public figures had a great influence on the emerging national language, among them prolific authors like the poet Gustaf Fröding, Nobel laureate Selma Lagerlöf and radical writer and playwright August Strindberg.

It was during the 20th century that a common, standardized national language became available to all Swedes. The orthography finally stabilized and became almost completely uniform, with some minor deviations, by the time of the spelling reform of 1906. With the exception of plural forms of verbs and a slightly different syntax, particularly in the written language, the language was the same as the Swedish of today. The plural verb forms appeared decreasingly in formal writing into the 1950s, when their use was removed from all official recommendations.

A very significant change in Swedish occurred in the late 1960s with the so-called . Previously the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. The use of (&quot;Mr&quot; or &quot;Sir&quot;), (&quot;Mrs&quot; or &quot;Ma&#x27;am&quot;) or (&quot;Miss&quot;) was considered the only acceptable way to begin conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. The fact that the listener should preferably be referred to in the third person tended to further complicate spoken communication between members of society. In the early 20th century an unsuccessful attempt was made to replace the insistence on titles with —the standard second person plural pronoun)—analogous to the French (see T-V distinction). wound up being used as a slightly less familiar form of , the second person singular pronoun, used to address people of lower social status. With the liberalization and radicalization of Swedish society in the 1950s and 1960s, these class distinctions became less important and became the standard, even in formal and official contexts. Though the reform was not an act of any centralized political decree but rather the result of sweeping change in social attitudes, it was completed in just a few years, from the late 1960s to early 1970s. The use of as a polite form of address is sometimes encountered today in both the written and spoken language, particularly among older speakers.

==Geographic distribution==
Swedish is the sole official national language of Sweden, and one of two in Finland (alongside Finnish). As of 2006, it was the sole native language of 83% of Swedish residents. In 2007, around 5.5% (c. 290,000) of the population of Finland were native speakers of Swedish, partially due to a decline following the Russian annexation of Finland after the Finnish War 1808–1809. The Fenno-Swedish-speaking minority is concentrated in the coastal areas and archipelagos of southern and western Finland. In some of these areas, Swedish is the predominant language; in 19 municipalities, 16 of which are located in Åland, Swedish is the sole official language. Åland county is an autonomous region of Finland.

According to a rough estimation, as of 2010 there were up to 300,000 Swedish-speakers living outside Sweden and Finland. The largest populations were in the United States (up to 100,000), the UK, Spain and Germany (c. 30,000 each) and a large proportion of the remaining 100,000 in the Scandinavian countries, France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia. Over three million people speak Swedish as a second language, with about 2,410,000 of those in Finland. According to a survey by the European Commission, 44% of respondents from Finland who did not have Swedish as a native language considered themselves to be proficient enough in Swedish to hold a conversation. Due to the close relation between the Scandinavian languages, a considerable proportion of speakers of Danish and especially Norwegian are able to understand Swedish.

There is considerable migration between the Nordic countries, but owing to the similarity between the cultures and languages (with the exception of Finnish), expatriates generally assimilate quickly and do not stand out as a group. According to the 2000 United States Census, some 67,000 people over the age of five were reported as Swedish speakers, though without any information on the degree of language proficiency. Similarly, there were 16,915 reported Swedish speakers in Canada from the 2001 census. Although there are no certain numbers, some 40,000 Swedes are estimated to live in the London area in the United Kingdom. Outside Sweden and Finland, there are about 40,000 active learners enrolled in Swedish language courses.

In the United States, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a significant Swedish-speaking immigrant population. This was notably true in states like Minnesota, where many Swedish immigrants settled. By 1940, approximately 6% of Minnesota&#x27;s population spoke Swedish. Although the use of Swedish has significantly declined, it is not uncommon to find older generations and communities that still retain some use and knowledge of the language, particularly in rural communities like Lindström and Scandia.

===Official status===

Swedish is the official main language of Sweden. Swedish is also one of two official languages of Finland. In Sweden, it has long been used in local and state government, and most of the educational system, but remained only a &quot;de facto&quot; primary language with no official status in law until 2009. A bill was proposed in 2005 that would have made Swedish an official language, but failed to pass by the narrowest possible margin (145–147) due to a pairing-off failure. A proposal for a broader language law, designating Swedish as the main language of the country and bolstering the status of the minority languages, was submitted by an expert committee to the Swedish Ministry of Culture in March 2008. It was subsequently enacted by the Riksdag, and entered into effect on 1 July 2009.

Swedish is the sole official language of Åland (an autonomous province under the sovereignty of Finland), where the vast majority of the 26,000 inhabitants speak Swedish as a first language. In Finland as a whole, Swedish is one of the two &quot;national&quot; languages, with the same official status as Finnish (spoken by the majority) at the state level and an official language in some municipalities.

Swedish is one of the official languages of the European Union, and one of the working languages of the Nordic Council. Under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic countries speaking Swedish have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable for interpretation or translation costs.

===Regulatory bodies===
The Swedish Language Council (&quot;Språkrådet&quot;) is the regulator of Swedish in Sweden but does not attempt to enforce control of the language, as for instance the does for French. However, many organizations and agencies require the use of the council&#x27;s publication &quot;Svenska skrivregler&quot; in official contexts, with it otherwise being regarded as a &quot;de facto&quot; orthographic standard. Among the many organizations that make up the Swedish Language Council, the Swedish Academy (established 1786) is arguably the most influential. Its primary instruments are the spelling dictionary &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordlista&quot; (&quot;SAOL&quot;, currently in its 14th edition) and the dictionary &quot;Svenska Akademiens Ordbok&quot;, in addition to various books on grammar, spelling and manuals of style. Although the dictionaries have a prescriptive element, they mainly describe current usage.

In Finland, a special branch of the Research Institute for the Languages of Finland has official status as the regulatory body for Swedish in Finland. Among its highest priorities is to maintain intelligibility with the language spoken in Sweden. It has published &quot;Finlandssvensk ordbok&quot;, a dictionary about the differences between Swedish in Finland and Sweden.

===Language minorities in Estonia and Ukraine===
From the 13th to 20th century, there were Swedish-speaking communities in Estonia, particularly on the islands (e. g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as &quot;Dagö&quot;, &quot;Ormsö&quot;, &quot;Runö&quot;, respectively) along the coast of the Baltic, communities that today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, &quot;Gammalsvenskby&quot; (&quot;Old Swedish Village&quot;). A few elderly people in the village still speak a Swedish dialect and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although their dialect is most likely facing extinction.

From 1918 to 1940, when Estonia was independent, the small Swedish community was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative language and Swedish-Estonian culture saw an upswing. However, most Swedish-speaking people fled to Sweden before the end of World War II, that is before the invasion of Estonia by the Soviet army in 1944. Only a handful of speakers remain.

==Phonology==


Swedish dialects have either 17 or 18 vowel phonemes, 9 long and 9 short. As in the other Germanic languages, including English, most long vowels are phonetically paired with one of the short vowels, and the pairs are such that the two vowels are of similar quality, but with the short vowel being slightly lower and slightly centralized. In contrast to e.g. Danish, which has only tense vowels, the short vowels are slightly more lax, but the tense vs. lax contrast is not nearly as pronounced as in English, German or Dutch. In many dialects, the short vowel sound pronounced or has merged with the short (transcribed in the chart below).

There are 18 consonant phonemes, two of which, and , vary considerably in pronunciation depending on the dialect and social status of the speaker. In many dialects, sequences of (pronounced alveolarly) with a dental consonant result in retroflex consonants; alveolarity of the pronunciation of is a precondition for this retroflexion. has a guttural or &quot;French R&quot; pronunciation in the South Swedish dialects; consequently, these dialects lack retroflex consonants.

Swedish is a stress-timed language, where the time intervals between stressed syllables are equal. However, when casually spoken, it tends to be syllable-timed. Any stressed syllable carries one of two tones, which gives Swedish much of its characteristic sound. Prosody is often one of the most noticeable differences between dialects.

==Grammar==

The standard word order is, as in most Germanic languages, V2, which means that the finite verb (V) appears in the second position (2) of a declarative main clause. Swedish morphology is similar to English; that is, words have comparatively few inflections. Swedish has two genders and is generally seen to have two grammatical cases – nominative and genitive (except for pronouns that, as in English, also are inflected in the object form) – although it is debated if the genitive in Swedish should be seen as a genitive case or just the nominative plus the so-called genitive &quot;s&quot;, then seen as a clitic. Swedish has two grammatical numbers – plural and singular. Adjectives have discrete comparative and superlative forms and are also inflected according to gender, number and definiteness. The definiteness of nouns is marked primarily through suffixes (endings), complemented with separate definite and indefinite articles. The prosody features both stress and in most dialects tonal qualities. The language has a comparatively large vowel inventory. Swedish is also notable for the voiceless dorso-palatal velar fricative, a highly variable consonant phoneme.

Swedish nouns and adjectives are declined in genders as well as number. Nouns are of common gender (&quot;en&quot; form) or neuter gender (&quot;ett&quot; form). The gender determines the declension of the adjectives. For example, the word &quot;fisk&quot; (&quot;fish&quot;) is a noun of common gender (&quot;en fisk&quot;) and can have the following forms:

The definite singular form of a noun is created by adding a suffix (&quot;-en&quot;, &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-et&quot; or &quot;-t&quot;), depending on its gender and if the noun ends in a vowel or not. The definite articles &quot;den&quot;, &quot;det&quot;, and &quot;de&quot; are used for variations to the definitiveness of a noun. They can double as demonstrative pronouns or demonstrative determiners when used with adverbs such as &quot;här&quot; (&quot;here&quot;) or &quot;där&quot; (&quot;there&quot;) to form &quot;den/det här (can also be &quot;denna/detta&quot;)&quot; (&quot;this&quot;), &quot;de här (can also be &quot;dessa&quot;)&quot; (&quot;these&quot;), &quot;den/det där&quot; (&quot;that&quot;), and &quot;de där&quot; (&quot;those&quot;). For example, &quot;den där fisken&quot; means &quot;that fish&quot; and refers to a specific fish; &quot;den fisken&quot; is less definite and means &quot;that fish&quot; in a more abstract sense, such as that set of fish; while &quot;fisken&quot; means &quot;the fish&quot;. In certain cases, the definite form indicates possession, e. g., &quot;jag måste tvätta håret&quot; (&quot;I must wash &quot;my&quot; hair&quot;).

Adjectives are inflected in two declensions – indefinite and definite – and they must match the noun they modify in gender and number. The indefinite neuter and plural forms of an adjective are usually created by adding a suffix (&quot;-t&quot; or &quot;-a&quot;) to the common form of the adjective, e. g., &quot;en grön stol&quot; (a green chair), &quot;ett grönt hus&quot; (a green house), and &quot;gröna stolar&quot; (&quot;green chairs&quot;). The definite form of an adjective is identical to the indefinite plural form, e. g., &quot;den gröna stolen&quot; (&quot;the green chair&quot;), &quot;det gröna huset&quot; (&quot;the green house&quot;), and &quot;de gröna stolarna&quot; (&quot;the green chairs&quot;).

Swedish pronouns are similar to those of English. Besides the two natural genders &quot;han&quot; and &quot;hon&quot; (&quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;), there are also the two grammatical genders &quot;den&quot; and &quot;det&quot;, usually termed common and neuter. In recent years, a gender-neutral pronoun &quot;hen&quot; has been introduced, particularly in literary Swedish. Unlike the nouns, pronouns have an additional object form, derived from the old dative form. &quot;Hon&quot;, for example, has the following nominative, possessive, and object forms:

:&quot;hon&quot; – &quot;hennes&quot; – &quot;henne&quot;

Swedish also uses third-person possessive reflexive pronouns that refer to the subject in a clause, a trait that is restricted to North Germanic languages:

:&quot;Anna gav Maria sin bok.&quot;; &quot;Anna gave Maria her [Anna&#x27;s] book.&quot; (reflexive)
:&quot;Anna gav Maria hennes bok.&quot;; &quot;Anna gave Maria her [Maria&#x27;s] book.&quot; (not reflexive)

Swedish used to have a genitive that was placed at the end of the head of a noun phrase. In modern Swedish, it has become an enclitic &quot;-s&quot;, which attaches to the end of the noun phrase, rather than the noun itself.

:&quot;hästen&quot;; &quot;the horse&quot; – &quot;hästens&quot; &quot;the horse&#x27;s&quot;
:&quot;hästen på den blommande ängens svarta man&quot;; &quot;the horse in the flowering meadow&#x27;s black mane&quot;

In formal written language, it used to be considered correct to place the genitive &quot;-s&quot; after the head of the noun phrase (&quot;hästen&quot;), though this is today considered dated, and different grammatical constructions are often used.

Verbs are conjugated according to tense. One group of verbs (the ones ending in &quot;-er&quot; in present tense) has a special imperative form (generally the verb stem), but with most verbs the imperative is identical to the infinitive form. Perfect and present participles as adjectival verbs are very common:

:Perfect participle: &quot;en stekt fisk&quot;; &quot;a fried fish&quot; (steka = to fry)
:Present participle: &quot;en stinkande fisk&quot;; &quot;a stinking fish&quot; (stinka = to stink)

In contrast to English and many other languages, Swedish does not use the perfect participle to form the present perfect and past perfect. Rather, the auxiliary verb &quot;har&quot; (&quot;have&quot;), &quot;hade&quot; (&quot;had&quot;) is followed by a special form, called the supine, used solely for this purpose (although often identical to the neuter form of the perfect participle):

:Perfect participle: &quot;målad&quot;, &quot;painted&quot; – supine &quot;målat&quot;, present perfect &quot;har målat&quot;; &quot;have painted&quot;
:Perfect participle: &quot;stekt&quot;, &quot;fried&quot; – supine &quot;stekt&quot;, present perfect &quot;har stekt&quot;; &quot;have fried&quot;
:Perfect participle: &quot;skriven&quot;, &quot;written&quot; – supine &quot;skrivit&quot;, present perfect &quot;har skrivit&quot;; &quot;have written&quot;

When building the compound passive voice using the verb &quot;att bli&quot;, the past participle is used:

:&quot;den blir målad&quot;; &quot;it&#x27;s being painted&quot;
:&quot;den blev målad&quot;; &quot;it was painted&quot;

There exists also an inflected passive voice formed by adding &quot;-s&quot;, replacing the final &quot;r&quot; in the present tense:

:&quot;den målas&quot;; &quot;it&#x27;s being painted&quot;
:&quot;den målades&quot;; &quot;it was painted&quot;

In a subordinate clause, the auxiliary &quot;har&quot; is optional and often omitted, particularly in written Swedish.

:&quot;Jag ser att han (har) stekt fisken&quot;; &quot;I see that he has fried the fish&quot;

Subjunctive mood is occasionally used for some verbs, but its use is in sharp decline and few speakers perceive the handful of commonly used verbs (as for instance: &quot;vore, månne&quot;) as separate conjugations, most of them remaining only as set of idiomatic expressions.

Where other languages may use grammatical cases, Swedish uses numerous prepositions, similar to those found in English. As in modern German, prepositions formerly determined case in Swedish, but this feature can only be found in certain idiomatic expressions like &quot;till fots&quot; (&quot;on foot&quot;, genitive).

As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows similarities to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs and adverbial phrases, and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually placed at the beginning of a main clause that is at the head of a sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify. Verb-second (inverted) word order is also used for questions.

==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary of Swedish is mainly Germanic, either through common Germanic heritage or through loans from German, Middle Low German, and to some extent, English. Examples of Germanic words in Swedish are &quot;mus&quot; (&quot;mouse&quot;), &quot;kung&quot; (&quot;king&quot;), and &quot;gås&quot; (&quot;goose&quot;). A significant part of the religious and scientific vocabulary is of Latin or Greek origin, often borrowed from French and, lately, English. Some 1–200 words are also borrowed from Scandoromani or Romani, often as slang varieties; a commonly used word from Romani is &quot;tjej&quot; (&quot;girl&quot;).

A large number of French words were imported into Sweden around the 18th century. These words have been transcribed to the Swedish spelling system and are therefore pronounced recognizably to a French-speaker. Most of them are distinguished by a &quot;French accent&quot;, characterized by emphasis on the last syllable. For example, &quot;nivå&quot; (fr. &quot;niveau&quot;, &quot;level&quot;), &quot;fåtölj&quot; (fr. &quot;fauteuil&quot;, &quot;armchair&quot;) and &quot;affär&quot; (&quot;shop; affair&quot;), etc. Cross-borrowing from other Germanic languages has also been common, at first from Middle Low German, the lingua franca of the Hanseatic league and later from Standard German. Some compounds are translations of the elements (calques) of German original compounds into Swedish, like &#x27; from German &#x27; (&quot;cotton&quot;; literally, &quot;tree-wool&quot;).

As with many Germanic languages, new words can be formed by compounding, e. g., nouns like &#x27; (&quot;nail polish remover&quot;) or verbs like &#x27; (&quot;to eavesdrop&quot;). Compound nouns take their gender from the head, which in Swedish is always the last morpheme. New words can also be coined by derivation from other established words, such as the verbification of nouns by the adding of the suffix &quot;-a&quot;, as in &#x27; (&quot;car&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;travel (recreationally) by car&quot;). The opposite, making nouns of verbs, is also possible, as in &#x27; (&quot;way of thinking; concept&quot;) from &#x27; (&quot;to think&quot;).

==Writing system==

The Swedish alphabet is a 29-letter alphabet, using the 26-letter ISO basic Latin alphabet plus the three additional letters , , and constructed in the 16th century by writing and on top of an , and an on top of an . Though these combinations are historically modified versions of and according to the English range of usage for the term diacritic, these three characters are not considered to be diacritics within the Swedish application, but rather separate letters, and are independent letters following . Before the release of the 13th edition of in April 2006, was treated as merely a variant of used only in names (such as &quot;Wallenberg&quot;) and foreign words (&quot;bowling&quot;), and so was both sorted and pronounced as a . Other diacritics (to use the broader English term usage referenced here) are unusual in Swedish; is sometimes used to indicate that the stress falls on a terminal syllable containing , especially when the stress changes the meaning ( vs. , &quot;winter lair&quot; vs. &quot;idea&quot;) as well as in some names, like ; occasionally other acute accents and, less often, grave accents can be seen in names and some foreign words. The letter is used to refer to unit cost (a loan from the French), equivalent to the at sign () in English.

The German is treated as a variant of and sometimes retained in foreign names and words, e. g., (&quot;muesli/granola&quot;). A proper diaeresis may very exceptionally be seen in elaborated style (for instance: &quot;Aïda&quot;). The German convention of writing and as and if the characters are unavailable is an unusual convention for speakers of modern Swedish. Despite the availability of all these characters in the Swedish national top-level Internet domain and other such domains, Swedish sites are frequently labelled using and , based on visual similarity, though Swedish domains could be registered using the characters , , and from 2003.

In Swedish orthography, the colon is used in a similar manner as in English, with some exceptions: the colon is used for some abbreviations, such as for (&quot;third&quot;) and for (&quot;Saint&quot;), and for all types of endings that can be added to numbers, letters and abbreviations, such as (&quot;the a&quot;) and (&quot;the CD&quot;), or the genitive form (&quot;USA&#x27;s&quot;).

==Dialects==
According to a traditional division of Swedish dialects, there are six main groups of dialects:
* Norrland dialects
* Finland Swedish
* Svealand dialects
* Gotland dialects
* Götaland dialects
* South Swedish dialects

The traditional definition of a Swedish dialect has been a local variant that has not been heavily influenced by the standard language and that can trace a separate development all the way back to Old Norse. Many of the genuine rural dialects, such as those of Orsa in Dalarna or Närpes in Österbotten, have very distinct phonetic and grammatical features, such as plural forms of verbs or archaic case inflections. These dialects can be near-incomprehensible to a majority of Swedes, and most of their speakers are also fluent in Standard Swedish. The different dialects are often so localized that they are limited to individual parishes and are referred to by Swedish linguists as &quot;sockenmål&quot; (lit., &quot;parish speech&quot;). They are generally separated into six major groups, with common characteristics of prosody, grammar and vocabulary. One or several examples from each group are given here. Though each example is intended to be also representative of the nearby dialects, the actual number of dialects is several hundred if each individual community is considered separately.

This type of classification, however, is based on a somewhat romanticized nationalist view of ethnicity and language. The idea that only rural variants of Swedish should be considered &quot;genuine&quot; is not generally accepted by modern scholars. No dialects, no matter how remote or obscure, remained unchanged or undisturbed by a minimum of influences from surrounding dialects or the standard language, especially not from the late 19th century onwards with the advent of mass media and advanced forms of transport. The differences are today more accurately described by a scale that runs from &quot;standard language&quot; to &quot;rural dialect&quot; where the speech even of the same person may vary from one extreme to the other depending on the situation. All Swedish dialects with the exception of the highly diverging forms of speech in Dalarna, Norrbotten and, to some extent, Gotland can be considered to be part of a common, mutually intelligible dialect continuum. This continuum may also include Norwegian and some Danish dialects.

===Standard Swedish===
Standard Swedish is the language used by virtually all Swedes and most Swedish-speaking Finns. It is called &quot;rikssvenska&quot; or &quot;standardsvenska&quot; (&quot;Standard Swedish&quot;) in Sweden. In Finland, &quot;högsvenska&quot; (&quot;High Swedish&quot;) is used for the Finnish variant of standard Swedish and &quot;rikssvenska&quot; refers to Swedish as spoken in Sweden in general.

In a poll conducted in 2005 by the Swedish Retail Institute (&quot;Handelns Utredningsinstitut&quot;), the attitudes of Swedes to the use of certain dialects by salesmen revealed that 54% believed that &quot;rikssvenska&quot; was the variety they would prefer to hear when speaking with salesmen over the phone, even though dialects such as &quot;gotländska&quot; or &quot;skånska&quot; were provided as alternatives in the poll.

===Finland Swedish===

Finland was a part of Sweden from the 13th century until the loss of the Finnish territories to Russia in 1809. Swedish was the sole administrative language until 1902 as well as the dominant language of culture and education until Finnish independence in 1917. The percentage of Swedish speakers in Finland has steadily decreased since then. The Swedish-speaking population is mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Ostrobothnia, Southwest Finland and Nyland where the percentage of Finland Swedes partly is high, with Swedish being spoken by more than 90% of the population in several municipalities, and on Åland, where Swedish is spoken by a vast majority of the population and is the only official language. Swedish is an official language also in the rest of Finland, though, with the same official status as Finnish. The country&#x27;s public broadcaster, Yle, provides two Swedish-language radio stations, Yle Vega and Yle X3M, as well a TV channel, Yle Fem.

===Immigrant variants===
Rinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, a suburb of northern Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken by young people of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.

New linguistic practices in multilingual urban contexts in fiction and hip-hop culture and rap lyrics have been introduced that go beyond traditional socio-linguistic domains. See also Källström (Chapter 12) and Knudsen (Chapter 13).

<text>In mathematics, a set is a collection of different things; these things are called &quot;elements&quot; or &quot;members&quot; of the set and are typically mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets. A set may be finite or infinite, depending whether the number of its elements is finite or not. There is a unique set with no elements, called the empty set; a set with a single element is a singleton. 

Sets are ubiquitous in modern mathematics. Indeed, set theory, more specifically Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, has been the standard way to provide rigorous foundations for all branches of mathematics since the first half of the 20th century.

==Context==
Before the end of the 19th century, sets were not studied specifically, and were not clearly distinguished from sequences. Most mathematicians considered infinity as potentialmeaning that it is the result of an endless processand were reluctant to consider infinite sets, that is sets whose number of members is not a natural number. In particular, a line was not considered as the set of its points, but as a locus where points may be located. 

The mathematical study of sets began with Georg Cantor (1845–1918). This provided some counterintuitive facts and paradoxes. For example, the number line has an infinite number of elements that is strictly larger than the infinite number of natural numbers, and any line segment has the same number of elements as the whole space. Also, Russell&#x27;s paradox implies that the phrase &quot;the set of all sets&quot; is self-contradictory.

Together with other counterintuitive results, this led to the foundational crisis of mathematics, which was eventually resolved with the general adoption of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory as a robust foundation of set theory and all mathematics. 

Meanwhile, sets started to be widely used in all mathematics. In particular, algebraic structures and mathematical spaces are typically defined in terms of sets. Also, many older mathematical results are restated in terms of sets. For example, Euclid&#x27;s theorem is often stated as &quot;the &quot;set&quot; of the prime numbers is infinite&quot;. This wide use of sets in mathematics was prophesied by David Hilbert when saying: &quot;No one will drive us from the paradise which Cantor created for us.&quot;

Generally, the common usage of sets in mathematics does not requires the full power of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. In mathematical practice, sets can be manipulated independently of the logical framework of this theory.

The object of this article is to summarize the manipulation rules and properties of sets that are commonly used in mathematics, without reference to any logical framework.

==Definitions==

In mathematics, a set is a collection of different things. These things are called &quot;elements&quot; or &quot;members&quot; of the set and are typically mathematical objects of any kind such as numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, functions, or even other sets. A set may also be called a &quot;collection&quot; or family, especially when its elements are themselves sets; this may avoid the confusion between the set and its members, and may make reading easier. A set may be specified either by listing its elements or by a property that characterizes its elements, such as for the set of the prime numbers or the set of all students in a given class.

If is an element of a set , one says that &quot;belongs&quot; to or &quot;is in&quot; , and this is written as . The statement &quot; is not in &quot; is written as , which can also be read as &quot;&quot;y&quot; is not in &quot;B&quot;&quot;. For example, if is the set of the integers, one has and . Each set is uniquely characterized by its elements. In particular, two sets that have precisely the same elements are equal (they are the same set). This property, called extensionality, can be written in formula as
formula_1This implies that there is only one set with no element, the &quot;empty set&quot; (or &quot;null set&quot;) that is denoted , or A &quot;singleton&quot; is a set with exactly one element. If is this element, the singleton is denoted If is itself a set, it must not be confused with For example, is a set with no elements, while is a singleton with as its unique element.

A set is &quot;finite&quot; if there exists a natural number such that the first natural numbers can be put in one to one correspondence with the elements of the set. In this case, one says that is the number of elements of the set. A set is &quot;infinite&quot; if such an does not exists. The &quot;empty set&quot; is a finite set with elements. The natural numbers form an infinite set, commonly denoted .

== Specifying a set ==
Extentionality implies that for specifying a set, one has either to list its elements or to provide a property that uniquely characterizes the set elements. 

===Roster notation===
&quot;Roster&quot; or &quot;enumeration notation&quot; is a notation introduced by Ernst Zermelo in 1908. that specifies a set by listing its elements between braces, separated by commas. For example, one knows that 
formula_2
and
formula_3
denote sets and not tuples because of the enclosing braces.

Above notations and for the empty set and for a singleton are examples of roster notation.

For a set, all that matters is whether each element is in it or not; so, the set is not changed if one changes the order or repeat some elements. So, one has, for example,
formula_4

When there is a clear pattern for generating all set elements, one can use ellipses for abbreviating the notation, such as in 
formula_5
for the positive integers not greater than .

Ellipses allow also expanding roster notation to some infinite sets. For example, the set of all integers can be denoted as
formula_6
or
formula_7

===Set-builder notation===
Set-builder notation specifies a set as being the set of all elements that satisfy some logical formula. More precisely, if is a logical formula depending on a variable , which evaluates to &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; depending on the value of , then 
formula_8
or
formula_9
denotes the set of all for which is true. For example, a set can be specified as follows:
formula_10
In this notation, the vertical bar &quot;|&quot; is read as &quot;such that&quot;, and the whole formula can be read as &quot; is the set of all such that is an integer in the range from 0 to 19 inclusive&quot;.

Some logical formulas, such as or cannot be used in set-builder notation because there is no set for which the elements are characterized by the formula. There are several ways for avoiding the problem. One may prove that the formula defines a set; this is often almost immediate, but may be very difficult. 

One may also introduce a larger set that must contain all elements of the specified set, and write the notation as
formula_11
or
formula_12

One may also define once for all and take the convention that every variable that appears on the left of the vertical bat of the notation represents an element of . This amounts to say that is implicit in set-builder notation. In this case, is often called &quot;the domain of discourse&quot; or a &quot;universe&quot;.

For example, with the convention that a lower case Latin letter may represent a real number and nothing else, the expression
formula_13
is an abbreviation of 
formula_14
which defines the irrational numbers.

==Subsets==

A &quot;subset&quot; of a set is a set such that every element of is also an element of . If is a subset of , one says commonly that is &quot;contained&quot; in , &quot;contains&quot; , or is a &quot;superset&quot; of . This denoted and . However many authors use and instead. The definition of a subset can be expressed in notation as
formula_15

A set is a &quot;proper subset&quot; of a set if and . This is denoted and . When is used for the subset relation, or in case of possible ambiguity, one uses commonly and .

The relationship between sets established by ⊆ is called &quot;inclusion&quot; or &quot;containment&quot;. Equality between sets can be expressed in terms of subsets. Two sets are equal if and only if they contain each other: that is, and is equivalent to &quot;A&quot; = &quot;B&quot;. The empty set is a subset of every set: .

Examples:
* The set of all humans is a proper subset of the set of all mammals.
* 

== Basic operations ==

There are several standard operations that produce new sets from given sets, in the same way as addition and multiplication produce new numbers from given numbers. The operations that are considered in this section are those such that all elements of the produced sets belong to a previously defined set. These operations are commonly illustrated with Venn diagrams.

The main basic operations on sets are the following ones.

===Intersection===

The &quot;intersection&quot; of two sets and is a set denoted whose elements are those elements that belong to both and . That is,
formula_16
where denotes the logical and. 

Intersection is associative and commutative; this means that for proceeding a sequence of intersections, one may proceed in any order, without the need of parentheses for specifying the order of operations. Intersection has no general identity element. However, if one restricts intersection to the subsets of a given set , intersection has as identity element.

If is a nonempty set of sets, its intersection, denoted 
formula_17 
is the set whose elements are those elements that belong to all sets in . That is,
formula_18

These two definitions of the intersection coincide when has two elements. 

===Union===

The &quot;union&quot; of two sets and is a set denoted whose elements are those elements that belong to or , or both. That is,
formula_19
where denotes the logical or. 

Union is associative and commutative; this means that for proceeding a sequence of intersections, one may proceed in any order, without the need of parentheses for specifying the order of operations. The empty set is an identity element for the union operation.

If is a set of sets, its union, denoted 
formula_20 
is the set whose elements are those elements that belong to at least one set in . That is,
formula_21

These two definitions of the union coincide when has two elements. 

===Set difference===

The &quot;set difference&quot; of two sets and , is a set, denoted or , whose elements are those elements that belong to , but not to . That is,
formula_22
where denotes the logical and. 
When the difference is also called the &quot;complement&quot; of in . When all sets that are considered are subsets of a fixed &quot;unversal set&quot; , the complement is often called the &quot;absolute complement&quot; of .
The &quot;symmetric difference&quot; of two sets and , denoted , is the set of those elements that belong to or but not to both:
formula_23

===Algebra of subsets===

The set of all subsets of a set is called the powerset of , often denoted . The powerset is an algebraic structure whose main operations are union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference and absolute complement (complement in ).

The powerset is a Boolean ring that has the symmetric difference as addition, the intersection as multiplication, the emptyset as additive identity, as multiplicative identity, and complement as additive inverse.

The powerset is also a Boolean algebra for which the &quot;join&quot; is the union , the &quot;meet&quot; is the intersection , and the negation is the set complement. 

As every Boolean algebra, the power set is also a partially ordered set for set inclusion. It is also a complete lattice.

The axioms of these structures induce many identities relating subsets, which are detailed in the linked articles.

==Applications==
Sets are ubiquitous in modern mathematics. For example, structures in abstract algebra, such as groups, fields and rings, are sets closed under one or more operations.

One of the main applications of naive set theory is in the construction of relations. A relation from a domain to a codomain is a subset of the Cartesian product . For example, considering the set of shapes in the game of the same name, the relation &quot;beats&quot; from to is the set ; thus beats in the game if the pair is a member of . Another example is the set of all pairs , where is real. This relation is a subset of , because the set of all squares is subset of the set of all real numbers. Since for every in , one and only one pair is found in , it is called a function. In functional notation, this relation can be written as .
==Euler and Venn diagrams==

An Euler diagram is a graphical representation of a collection of sets; each set is depicted as a planar region enclosed by a loop, with its elements inside. If is a subset of , then the region representing is completely inside the region representing . If two sets have no elements in common, the regions do not overlap. 

A Venn diagram, in contrast, is a graphical representation of sets in which the loops divide the plane into zones such that for each way of selecting some of the sets (possibly all or none), there is a zone for the elements that belong to all the selected sets and none of the others. For example, if the sets are , , and , there should be a zone for the elements that are inside and and outside (even if such elements do not exist).

==Special sets of numbers in mathematics==
There are sets of such mathematical importance, to which mathematicians refer so frequently, that they have acquired special names and notational conventions to identify them. 

Many of these important sets are represented in mathematical texts using bold (e.g. formula_24) or blackboard bold (e.g. formula_25) typeface. These include
* formula_26 or formula_27, the set of all natural numbers: formula_28 (often, authors exclude );
* formula_24 or formula_25, the set of all integers (whether positive, negative or zero): formula_31;
* formula_32 or formula_33, the set of all rational numbers (that is, the set of all proper and improper fractions): formula_34. For example, and ;
* formula_35 or formula_36, the set of all real numbers, including all rational numbers and all irrational numbers (which include algebraic numbers such as formula_37 that cannot be rewritten as fractions, as well as transcendental numbers such as  and );
* formula_38 or formula_39, the set of all complex numbers: , for example, .

Each of the above sets of numbers has an infinite number of elements. Each is a subset of the sets listed below it. 

Sets of positive or negative numbers are sometimes denoted by superscript plus and minus signs, respectively. For example, formula_40 represents the set of positive rational numbers.

==Functions==
A &quot;function&quot; (or &quot;mapping&quot;) from a set to a set is a rule that assigns to each &quot;input&quot; element of an &quot;output&quot; that is an element of ; more formally, a function is a special kind of relation, one that relates each element of to &quot;exactly one&quot; element of . A function is called
* injective (or one-to-one) if it maps any two different elements of to &quot;different&quot; elements of ,
* surjective (or onto) if for every element of , there is at least one element of that maps to it, and
* bijective (or a one-to-one correspondence) if the function is both injective and surjective — in this case, each element of is paired with a unique element of , and each element of is paired with a unique element of , so that there are no unpaired elements.
An injective function is called an &quot;injection&quot;, a surjective function is called a &quot;surjection&quot;, and a bijective function is called a &quot;bijection&quot; or &quot;one-to-one correspondence&quot;.

==Cardinality==
The cardinality of a set , denoted , is the number of members of . For example, if , then . Repeated members in roster notation are not counted, so , too.

More formally, two sets share the same cardinality if there exists a bijection between them.

The cardinality of the empty set is zero.

===Infinite sets and infinite cardinality===
The list of elements of some sets is endless, or &quot;infinite&quot;. For example, the set formula_41 of natural numbers is infinite. In fact, all the special sets of numbers mentioned in the section above are infinite. Infinite sets have &quot;infinite cardinality&quot;. 

Some infinite cardinalities are greater than others. Arguably one of the most significant results from set theory is that the set of real numbers has greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers. Sets with cardinality less than or equal to that of formula_41 are called &quot;countable sets&quot;; these are either finite sets or &quot;countably infinite sets&quot; (sets of the same cardinality as ); some authors use &quot;countable&quot; to mean &quot;countably infinite&quot;. Sets with cardinality strictly greater than that of formula_41 are called &quot;uncountable sets&quot;.

However, it can be shown that the cardinality of a straight line (i.e., the number of points on a line) is the same as the cardinality of any segment of that line, of the entire plane, and indeed of any finite-dimensional Euclidean space.

===The continuum hypothesis===

The continuum hypothesis, formulated by Georg Cantor in 1878, is the statement that there is no set with cardinality strictly between the cardinality of the natural numbers and the cardinality of a straight line. In 1963, Paul Cohen proved that the continuum hypothesis is independent of the axiom system ZFC consisting of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. (ZFC is the most widely-studied version of axiomatic set theory.)

==Power sets==

The power set of a set is the set of all subsets of . The empty set and itself are elements of the power set of , because these are both subsets of . For example, the power set of is . The power set of a set is commonly written as or .

If has elements, then has elements. For example, has three elements, and its power set has elements, as shown above.

If is infinite (whether countable or uncountable), then is uncountable. Moreover, the power set is always strictly &quot;bigger&quot; than the original set, in the sense that any attempt to pair up the elements of with the elements of will leave some elements of unpaired. (There is never a bijection from onto .)

==Partitions==
A partition of a set &quot;S&quot; is a set of nonempty subsets of &quot;S&quot;, such that every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot; is in exactly one of these subsets. That is, the subsets are pairwise disjoint (meaning any two sets of the partition contain no element in common), and the union of all the subsets of the partition is &quot;S&quot;.

==Principle of inclusion and exclusion==

The inclusion–exclusion principle is a technique for counting the elements in a union of two finite sets in terms of the sizes of the two sets and their intersection. It can be expressed symbolically as
formula_44

A more general form of the principle gives the cardinality of any finite union of finite sets:
formula_45

==History==

The concept of a set emerged in mathematics at the end of the 19th century. The German word for set, &quot;Menge&quot;, was coined by Bernard Bolzano in his work &quot;Paradoxes of the Infinite&quot;. Georg Cantor, one of the founders of set theory, gave the following definition at the beginning of his &quot;Beiträge zur Begründung der transfiniten Mengenlehre&quot;:

Bertrand Russell introduced the distinction between a set and a class (a set is a class, but some classes, such as the class of all sets, are not sets; see Russell&#x27;s paradox): 

===Naive set theory===

The foremost property of a set is that it can have elements, also called &quot;members&quot;. Two sets are equal when they have the same elements. More precisely, sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equal if every element of &quot;A&quot; is an element of &quot;B&quot;, and every element of &quot;B&quot; is an element of &quot;A&quot;; this property is called the &quot;extensionality of sets&quot;. As a consequence, e.g. and represent the same set. Unlike sets, multisets can be distinguished by the number of occurrences of an element; e.g. and represent different multisets, while and are equal. Tuples can even be distinguished by element order; e.g. and represent different tuples.

The simple concept of a set has proved enormously useful in mathematics, but paradoxes arise if no restrictions are placed on how sets can be constructed:
* Russell&#x27;s paradox shows that the &quot;set of all sets that &quot;do not contain themselves&quot;&quot;, i.e., , cannot exist.
* Cantor&#x27;s paradox shows that &quot;the set of all sets&quot; cannot exist.

Naïve set theory defines a set as any &quot;well-defined&quot; collection of distinct elements, but problems arise from the vagueness of the term &quot;well-defined&quot;.

===Axiomatic set theory===
In subsequent efforts to resolve these paradoxes since the time of the original formulation of naïve set theory, the properties of sets have been defined by axioms. Axiomatic set theory takes the concept of a set as a primitive notion. The purpose of the axioms is to provide a basic framework from which to deduce the truth or falsity of particular mathematical propositions (statements) about sets, using first-order logic. According to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems however, it is not possible to use first-order logic to prove any such particular axiomatic set theory is free from paradox.

<text>Science is a systematic discipline that builds and organises knowledge in the form of testable hypotheses and predictions about the universe. Modern science is typically divided into two or three major branches: the natural sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology), which study the physical world; and the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies. Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as engineering and medicine. While sometimes referred to as the formal sciences, the study of logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science (which study formal systems governed by axioms and rules) are typically regarded as separate because they rely on deductive reasoning instead of the scientific method or empirical evidence as their main methodology. 

The history of science spans the majority of the historical record, with the earliest identifiable predecessors to modern science dating to the Bronze Age in Egypt and Mesopotamia (). Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped the Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes, while further advancements, including the introduction of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, were made during the Golden Age of India. Scientific research deteriorated in these regions after the fall of the Western Roman Empire during the Early Middle Ages (400–1000 CE), but in the Medieval renaissances (Carolingian Renaissance, Ottonian Renaissance and the Renaissance of the 12th century) scholarship flourished again. Some Greek manuscripts lost in Western Europe were preserved and expanded upon in the Middle East during the Islamic Golden Age, along with the later efforts of Byzantine Greek scholars who brought Greek manuscripts from the dying Byzantine Empire to Western Europe at the start of the Renaissance.

The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th centuries revived natural philosophy, which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions. The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape, along with the changing of &quot;natural philosophy&quot; to &quot;natural science&quot;.

New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems. Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done by teams in academic and research institutions, government agencies, and companies. The practical impact of their work has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritising the ethical and moral development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;science&quot; has been used in Middle English since the 14th century in the sense of &quot;the state of knowing&quot;. The word was borrowed from the Anglo-Norman language as the suffix , which was borrowed from the Latin word , meaning &quot;knowledge, awareness, understanding&quot;, a noun derivative of meaning &quot;knowing&quot;, itself the present active participle of , &quot;to know&quot;.

There are many hypotheses for &quot;science&quot;″s ultimate word origin. According to Michiel de Vaan, Dutch linguist and Indo-Europeanist, may have its origin in the Proto-Italic language as or meaning &quot;to know&quot;, which may originate from Proto-Indo-European language as &quot;, &quot;, meaning &quot;to incise&quot;. The &quot;Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben&quot; proposed is a back-formation of , meaning &quot;to not know, be unfamiliar with&quot;, which may derive from Proto-Indo-European &#x27; in Latin , or &#x27;, from &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;to cut&quot;.

In the past, science was a synonym for &quot;knowledge&quot; or &quot;study&quot;, in keeping with its Latin origin. A person who conducted scientific research was called a &quot;natural philosopher&quot; or &quot;man of science&quot;. In 1834, William Whewell introduced the term &quot;scientist&quot; in a review of Mary Somerville&#x27;s book &quot;On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences&quot;, crediting it to &quot;some ingenious gentleman&quot; (possibly himself).

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Science has no single origin. Rather, scientific thinking emerged gradually over the course of tens of thousands of years, taking different forms around the world, and few details are known about the very earliest developments. Women likely played a central role in prehistoric science, as did religious rituals. Some scholars use the term &quot;protoscience&quot; to label activities in the past that resemble modern science in some but not all features; however, this label has also been criticised as denigrating, or too suggestive of presentism, thinking about those activities only in relation to modern categories.

Direct evidence for scientific processes becomes clearer with the advent of writing systems in the Bronze Age civilisations of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia (), creating the earliest written records in the history of science. Although the words and concepts of &quot;science&quot; and &quot;nature&quot; were not part of the conceptual landscape at the time, the ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians made contributions that would later find a place in Greek and medieval science: mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. From the 3rd millennium BCE, the ancient Egyptians developed a non-positional decimal numbering system, solved practical problems using geometry, and developed a calendar. Their healing therapies involved drug treatments and the supernatural, such as prayers, incantations, and rituals.

The ancient Mesopotamians used knowledge about the properties of various natural chemicals for manufacturing pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime plaster, and waterproofing. They studied animal physiology, anatomy, behaviour, and astrology for divinatory purposes. The Mesopotamians had an intense interest in medicine and the earliest medical prescriptions appeared in Sumerian during the Third Dynasty of Ur. They seem to have studied scientific subjects which had practical or religious applications and had little interest in satisfying curiosity.

=== Classical antiquity ===
In classical antiquity, there is no real ancient analogue of a modern scientist. Instead, well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time. Before the invention or discovery of the concept of &quot;phusis&quot; or nature by the pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural &quot;way&quot; in which a plant grows, and the &quot;way&quot; in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason, it is claimed that these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense and the first to clearly distinguish &quot;nature&quot; and &quot;convention&quot;.

The early Greek philosophers of the Milesian school, which was founded by Thales of Miletus and later continued by his successors Anaximander and Anaximenes, were the first to attempt to explain natural phenomena without relying on the supernatural. The Pythagoreans developed a complex number philosophy and contributed significantly to the development of mathematical science. The theory of atoms was developed by the Greek philosopher Leucippus and his student Democritus. Later, Epicurus would develop a full natural cosmology based on atomism, and would adopt a &quot;canon&quot; (ruler, standard) which established physical criteria or standards of scientific truth. The Greek doctor Hippocrates established the tradition of systematic medical science and is known as &quot;The Father of Medicine&quot;.

A turning point in the history of early philosophical science was Socrates&#x27; example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. The Socratic method as documented by Plato&#x27;s dialogues is a dialectic method of hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. The Socratic method searches for general commonly-held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinises them for consistency. Socrates criticised the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism.

In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle created a systematic programme of teleological philosophy. In the 3rd century BCE, Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first to propose a heliocentric model of the universe, with the Sun at the centre and all the planets orbiting it. Aristarchus&#x27;s model was widely rejected because it was believed to violate the laws of physics, while Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, which contains a geocentric description of the Solar System, was accepted through the early Renaissance instead. The inventor and mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse made major contributions to the beginnings of calculus. Pliny the Elder was a Roman writer and polymath, who wrote the seminal encyclopaedia &quot;Natural History&quot;.

Positional notation for representing numbers likely emerged between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE along Indian trade routes. This numeral system made efficient arithmetic operations more accessible and would eventually become standard for mathematics worldwide.

=== Middle Ages ===

Due to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the 5th century saw an intellectual decline, with knowledge of classical Greek conceptions of the world deteriorating in Western Europe. Latin encyclopaedists of the period such as Isidore of Seville preserved the majority of general ancient knowledge. In contrast, because the Byzantine Empire resisted attacks from invaders, they were able to preserve and improve prior learning. John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar in the 6th century, started to question Aristotle&#x27;s teaching of physics, introducing the theory of impetus. His criticism served as an inspiration to medieval scholars and Galileo Galilei, who extensively cited his works ten centuries later.

During late antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, natural phenomena were mainly examined via the Aristotelian approach. The approach includes Aristotle&#x27;s four causes: material, formal, moving, and final cause. Many Greek classical texts were preserved by the Byzantine Empire and Arabic translations were done by groups such as the Nestorians and the Monophysites. Under the Abbasids, these Arabic translations were later improved and developed by Arabic scientists. By the 6th and 7th centuries, the neighbouring Sasanian Empire established the medical Academy of Gondishapur, which was considered by Greek, Syriac, and Persian physicians as the most important medical hub of the ancient world.

Islamic study of Aristotelianism flourished in the House of Wisdom established in the Abbasid capital of Baghdad, Iraq and the flourished until the Mongol invasions in the 13th century. Ibn al-Haytham, better known as Alhazen, used controlled experiments in his optical study. Avicenna&#x27;s compilation of &quot;The Canon of Medicine&quot;, a medical encyclopaedia, is considered to be one of the most important publications in medicine and was used until the 18th century.

By the 11th century most of Europe had become Christian, and in 1088, the University of Bologna emerged as the first university in Europe. As such, demand for Latin translation of ancient and scientific texts grew, a major contributor to the Renaissance of the 12th century. Renaissance scholasticism in western Europe flourished, with experiments done by observing, describing, and classifying subjects in nature. In the 13th century, medical teachers and students at Bologna began opening human bodies, leading to the first anatomy textbook based on human dissection by Mondino de Luzzi.

=== Renaissance ===
New developments in optics played a role in the inception of the Renaissance, both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on perception, as well as by contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the camera obscura and the telescope. At the start of the Renaissance, Roger Bacon, Vitello, and John Peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle. A model of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance. This theory uses only three of Aristotle&#x27;s four causes: formal, material, and final.

In the 16th century, Nicolaus Copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the Solar System, stating that the planets revolve around the Sun, instead of the geocentric model where the planets and the Sun revolve around the Earth. This was based on a theorem that the orbital periods of the planets are longer as their orbs are farther from the centre of motion, which he found not to agree with Ptolemy&#x27;s model.

Johannes Kepler and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is perception, and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the propagation of light. Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric model through the discovery of Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics and described his work as a search for the Harmony of the Spheres. Galileo had made significant contributions to astronomy, physics and engineering. However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII sentenced him for writing about the heliocentric model.

The printing press was widely used to publish scholarly arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. Francis Bacon and René Descartes published philosophical arguments in favour of a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Bacon emphasised the importance of experiment over contemplation, questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal and final cause, promoted the idea that science should study the laws of nature and the improvement of all human life. Descartes emphasised individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used to study nature.

=== Age of Enlightenment ===
At the start of the Age of Enlightenment, Isaac Newton formed the foundation of classical mechanics by his &quot;, greatly influencing future physicists. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, now used in a new non-teleological way. This implied a shift in the view of objects: objects were now considered as having no innate goals. Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes.

During this time the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and inventions that would improve human lives, in the materialistic sense of having more food, clothing, and other things. In Bacon&#x27;s words, &quot;the real and legitimate goal of sciences &quot;, and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible philosophical or spiritual ideas, which he believed contributed little to human happiness beyond &quot;the fume of subtle, sublime or pleasing [speculation]&quot;.

Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies and academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific research and development. Societies and academies were the backbones of the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was the popularisation of science among an increasingly literate population. Enlightenment philosophers turned to a few of their scientific predecessors – Galileo, Kepler, Boyle, and Newton principally – as the guides to every physical and social field of the day.

The 18th century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine and physics; the development of biological taxonomy by Carl Linnaeus; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline. Ideas on human nature, society, and economics evolved during the Enlightenment. Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed &quot;A Treatise of Human Nature&quot;, which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement. In 1776, Adam Smith published &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, which is often considered the first work on modern economics.

=== 19th century ===

During the 19th century, many distinguishing characteristics of contemporary modern science began to take shape. These included the transformation of the life and physical sciences; the frequent use of precision instruments; the emergence of terms such as &quot;biologist&quot;, &quot;physicist&quot;, and &quot;scientist&quot;; an increased professionalisation of those studying nature; scientists gaining cultural authority over many dimensions of society; the industrialisation of numerous countries; the thriving of popular science writings; and the emergence of science journals. During the late 19th century, psychology emerged as a separate discipline from philosophy when Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory for psychological research in 1879.

During the mid-19th century Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace independently proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection in 1858, which explained how different plants and animals originated and evolved. Their theory was set out in detail in Darwin&#x27;s book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, published in 1859. Separately, Gregor Mendel presented his paper, &quot;Experiments on Plant Hybridisation&quot; in 1865, which outlined the principles of biological inheritance, serving as the basis for modern genetics.

Early in the 19th century John Dalton suggested the modern atomic theory, based on Democritus&#x27;s original idea of indivisible particles called &quot;atoms&quot;. The laws of conservation of energy, conservation of momentum and conservation of mass suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources. However, with the advent of the steam engine and the Industrial Revolution there was an increased understanding that not all forms of energy have the same energy qualities, the ease of conversion to useful work or to another form of energy. This realisation led to the development of the laws of thermodynamics, in which the free energy of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the entropy of a closed universe increases over time.

The electromagnetic theory was established in the 19th century by the works of Hans Christian Ørsted, André-Marie Ampère, Michael Faraday, James Clerk Maxwell, Oliver Heaviside, and Heinrich Hertz. The new theory raised questions that could not easily be answered using Newton&#x27;s framework. The discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel and Marie Curie in 1896, Marie Curie then became the first person to win two Nobel Prizes. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron.

=== 20th century ===
In the first half of the century the development of antibiotics and artificial fertilisers improved human living standards globally. Harmful environmental issues such as ozone depletion, ocean acidification, eutrophication, and climate change came to the public&#x27;s attention and caused the onset of environmental studies.

During this period scientific experimentation became increasingly larger in scale and funding. The extensive technological innovation stimulated by World War I, World War II, and the Cold War led to competitions between global powers, such as the Space Race and nuclear arms race. Substantial international collaborations were also made, despite armed conflicts.

In the late 20th century active recruitment of women and elimination of sex discrimination greatly increased the number of women scientists, but large gender disparities remained in some fields. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964 led to a rejection of the steady-state model of the universe in favour of the Big Bang theory of Georges Lemaître.

The century saw fundamental changes within science disciplines. Evolution became a unified theory in the early 20th-century when the modern synthesis reconciled Darwinian evolution with classical genetics. Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics complement classical mechanics to describe physics in extreme length, time and gravity. Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including smartphones. The need for mass systematisation of long, intertwined causal chains and large amounts of data led to the rise of the fields of systems theory and computer-assisted scientific modelling.

=== 21st century ===
The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003 by identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome. The first induced pluripotent human stem cells were made in 2006, allowing adult cells to be transformed into stem cells and turn into any cell type found in the body. With the affirmation of the Higgs boson discovery in 2013, the last particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics was found. In 2015, gravitational waves, predicted by general relativity a century before, were first observed. In 2019, the international collaboration Event Horizon Telescope presented the first direct image of a black hole&#x27;s accretion disc.

==Branches==

Modern science is commonly divided into three major branches: natural science, social science, and formal science. Each of these branches comprises various specialised yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise. Both natural and social sciences are empirical sciences, as their knowledge is based on empirical observations and is capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions.

=== Natural science ===
Natural science is the study of the physical world. It can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science. These two branches may be further divided into more specialised disciplines. For example, physical science can be subdivided into physics, chemistry, astronomy, and earth science. Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches that were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science. Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and other biotic beings. Today, &quot;natural history&quot; suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.

=== Social science ===

Social science is the study of human behaviour and the functioning of societies. It has many disciplines that include, but are not limited to anthropology, economics, history, human geography, political science, psychology, and sociology. In the social sciences, there are many competing theoretical perspectives, many of which are extended through competing research programmes such as the functionalists, conflict theorists, and interactionists in sociology. Due to the limitations of conducting controlled experiments involving large groups of individuals or complex situations, social scientists may adopt other research methods such as the historical method, case studies, and cross-cultural studies. Moreover, if quantitative information is available, social scientists may rely on statistical approaches to better understand social relationships and processes.

=== Formal science ===
Formal science is an area of study that generates knowledge using formal systems. A formal system is an abstract structure used for inferring theorems from axioms according to a set of rules. It includes mathematics, systems theory, and theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts. The formal sciences are therefore &quot;a priori&quot; disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they constitute a science. Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics. Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, chemistry, biology, finance, and economics.

=== Applied science ===
Applied science is the use of the scientific method and knowledge to attain practical goals and includes a broad range of disciplines such as engineering and medicine. Engineering is the use of scientific principles to invent, design and build machines, structures and technologies. Science may contribute to the development of new technologies. Medicine is the practice of caring for patients by maintaining and restoring health through the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injury or disease. The applied sciences are often contrasted with the basic sciences, which are focused on advancing scientific theories and laws that explain and predict events in the natural world.

Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve. The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence is becoming a central feature of computational contributions to science, for example in agent-based computational economics, random forests, topic modeling and various forms of prediction. However, machines alone rarely advance knowledge as they require human guidance and capacity to reason; and they can introduce bias against certain social groups or sometimes underperform against humans.

=== Interdisciplinary science ===
Interdisciplinary science involves the combination of two or more disciplines into one, such as bioinformatics, a combination of biology and computer science or cognitive sciences. The concept has existed since the ancient Greek period and it became popular again in the 20th century.

== Scientific research ==
Scientific research can be labelled as either basic or applied research. Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Most understanding comes from basic research, though sometimes applied research targets specific practical problems. This leads to technological advances that were not previously imaginable.

=== Scientific method ===
Scientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks to objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way. Scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method: there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers; this objective reality is governed by natural laws; these laws were discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation. Mathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and laws, because it is used extensively in quantitative modelling, observing, and collecting measurements. Statistics is used to summarise and analyse data, which allows scientists to assess the reliability of experimental results.

In the scientific method an explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as an explanation using parsimony principles and is expected to seek consilience – fitting with other accepted facts related to an observation or scientific question. This tentative explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions, which are typically posted before being tested by experimentation. Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress. Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships to avoid the correlation fallacy, though in some sciences such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might be more appropriate.

When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory it is modified or discarded. If the hypothesis survives testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a validly reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behaviour of certain natural events. A theory typically describes the behaviour of much broader sets of observations than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory. Thus, a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses. Scientists may generate a model, an attempt to describe or depict an observation in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical representation, and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested by experimentation.

While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another. Eliminating the bias can be achieved through transparency, careful experimental design, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results and conclusions. After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be. Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimising the effects of subjective and confirmation bias. Intersubjective verifiability, the ability to reach a consensus and reproduce results, is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge.

=== Scientific literature ===
Scientific research is published in a range of literature. Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals, followed by &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, began publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500.

Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider population.

=== Challenges ===
The replication crisis is an ongoing methodological crisis that affects parts of the social and life sciences. In subsequent investigations, the results of many scientific studies have been proven to be unrepeatable. The crisis has long-standing roots; the phrase was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem. The replication crisis represents an important body of research in metascience, which aims to improve the quality of all scientific research while reducing waste.

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science. Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term &quot;cargo cult science&quot; for cases in which researchers believe, and at a glance, look like they are doing science but lack the honesty to allow their results to be rigorously evaluated. Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories. Science has been described as &quot;the most important tool&quot; for separating valid claims from invalid ones.

There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterised as &quot;bad science&quot;, research that may be well-intended but is incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term &quot;scientific misconduct&quot; refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person.

== Philosophy of science ==
There are different schools of thought in the philosophy of science. The most popular position is empiricism, which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation; scientific theories generalise observations. Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that explains how general theories can be made from the finite amount of empirical evidence available. Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method.

Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation. Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories, and that the only way theory A can be affected by observation is after theory A were to conflict with observation, but theory B were to survive the observation.
Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories, replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method. Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error, covering all products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and art.

Another approach, instrumentalism, emphasises the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena. It views scientific theories as black boxes, with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be things that should be ignored. Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true.

Thomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent &quot;portrait&quot; of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterised &quot;normal science&quot; as the process of observation and &quot;puzzle solving&quot;, which takes place within a paradigm, whereas &quot;revolutionary science&quot; occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more &quot;portraits&quot; against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process. Kuhn&#x27;s position, however, is not one of relativism.

Another approach often cited in debates of scientific scepticism against controversial movements like &quot;creation science&quot; is methodological naturalism. Naturalists maintain that a difference should be made between natural and supernatural, and science should be restricted to natural explanations. Methodological naturalism maintains that science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification.

== Scientific community ==
The scientific community is a network of interacting scientists who conduct scientific research. The community consists of smaller groups working in scientific fields. By having peer review, through discussion and debate within journals and conferences, scientists maintain the quality of research methodology and objectivity when interpreting results.

=== Scientists ===

Scientists are individuals who conduct scientific research to advance knowledge in an area of interest. Scientists may exhibit a strong curiosity about reality and a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of public health, nations, the environment, or industries; other motivations include recognition by peers and prestige. In modern times, many scientists study within specific areas of science in academic institutions, often obtaining advanced degrees in the process. Many scientists pursue careers in various fields such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit organisations.

Science has historically been a male-dominated field, with notable exceptions. Women have faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they have in other areas of male-dominated societies. For example, women were frequently passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work. The achievements of women in science have been attributed to the defiance of their traditional role as labourers within the domestic sphere.

=== Learned societies ===

Learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance. Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines. Membership may either be open to all, require possession of scientific credentials, or conferred by election. Most scientific societies are nonprofit organisations, and many are professional associations. Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline. Some societies act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest, or the collective interest of the membership.

The professionalisation of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly enabled by the creation of national distinguished academies of sciences such as the Italian in 1603, the British Royal Society in 1660, the French Academy of Sciences in 1666, the American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm Society in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1949. International scientific organisations, such as the International Science Council, are devoted to international cooperation for science advancement.

=== Awards ===
Science awards are usually given to individuals or organisations that have made significant contributions to a discipline. They are often given by prestigious institutions; thus, it is considered a great honour for a scientist receiving them. Since the early Renaissance, scientists have often been awarded medals, money, and titles. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award, is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, and chemistry.

== Society ==
=== Funding and policies ===

Scientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP. In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10%, respectively, by universities and government. The government funding proportion in certain fields is higher, and it dominates research in social science and the humanities. In less developed nations, the government provides the bulk of the funds for their basic scientific research.

Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research, such as the National Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia, National Centre for Scientific Research in France, the Max Planck Society in Germany, and National Research Council in Spain. In commercial research and development, all but the most research-orientated corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities than research driven by curiosity.

Science policy is concerned with policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care, and environmental monitoring. Science policy sometimes refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies. In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy&#x27;s goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public. Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organisations that fund research.

=== Education and awareness ===
Science education for the general public is embedded in the school curriculum, and is supplemented by online pedagogical content (for example, YouTube and Khan Academy), museums, and science magazines and blogs. Major organisations of scientists such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) consider the sciences to be a part of the liberal arts traditions of learning, along with philosophy and history. Scientific literacy is chiefly concerned with an understanding of the scientific method, units and methods of measurement, empiricism, a basic understanding of statistics (correlations, qualitative versus quantitative observations, aggregate statistics), and a basic understanding of core scientific fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, ecology, geology, and computation. As a student advances into higher stages of formal education, the curriculum becomes more in depth. Traditional subjects usually included in the curriculum are natural and formal sciences, although recent movements include social and applied science as well.

The mass media face pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter. Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who are knowledgeable about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover.

Science magazines such as &quot;New Scientist&quot;, &quot;Science &amp; Vie&quot;, and &quot;Scientific American&quot; cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. The science fiction genre, primarily speculative fiction, can transmit the ideas and methods of science to the general public. Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines, such as literature or poetry, include the &quot;Creative Writing Science&quot; resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund.

=== Anti-science attitudes ===

While the scientific method is broadly accepted in the scientific community, some fractions of society reject certain scientific positions or are sceptical about science. Examples are the common notion that COVID-19 is not a major health threat to the US (held by 39% of Americans in August 2021) or the belief that climate change is not a major threat to the US (also held by 40% of Americans, in late 2019 and early 2020). Psychologists have pointed to four factors driving rejection of scientific results:
* Scientific authorities are sometimes seen as inexpert, untrustworthy, or biased.
* Some marginalised social groups hold anti-science attitudes, in part because these groups have often been exploited in unethical experiments.
* Messages from scientists may contradict deeply held existing beliefs or morals.
* The delivery of a scientific message may not be appropriately targeted to a recipient&#x27;s learning style.
Anti-science attitudes often seem to be caused by fear of rejection in social groups. For instance, climate change is perceived as a threat by only 22% of Americans on the right side of the political spectrum, but by 85% on the left. That is, if someone on the left would not consider climate change as a threat, this person may face contempt and be rejected in that social group. In fact, people may rather deny a scientifically accepted fact than lose or jeopardise their social status.

=== Politics ===
Attitudes towards science are often determined by political opinions and goals. Government, business and advocacy groups have been known to use legal and economic pressure to influence scientific researchers. Many factors can act as facets of the politicisation of science such as anti-intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, and fear for business interests. Politicisation of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasises the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence. Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and capitalising on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence. Examples of issues that have involved the politicisation of science include the global warming controversy, health effects of pesticides, and health effects of tobacco.

<text>A statistic (singular) or sample statistic is any quantity computed from values in a sample which is considered for a statistical purpose. Statistical purposes include estimating a population parameter, describing a sample, or evaluating a hypothesis. The average (or mean) of sample values is a statistic. The term statistic is used both for the function (e.g., a calculation method of the average) and for the value of the function on a given sample (e.g., the result of the average calculation). When a statistic is being used for a specific purpose, it may be referred to by a name indicating its purpose.

When a statistic is used for estimating a population parameter, the statistic is called an &quot;estimator&quot;. A population parameter is any characteristic of a population under study, but when it is not feasible to directly measure the value of a population parameter, statistical methods are used to infer the likely value of the parameter on the basis of a statistic computed from a sample taken from the population. For example, the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean. This means that the expected value of the sample mean equals the true population mean.

A &quot;descriptive statistic&quot; is used to summarize the sample data. A &quot;test statistic&quot; is used in statistical hypothesis testing. A single statistic can be used for multiple purposesfor example, the sample mean can be used to estimate the population mean, to describe a sample data set, or to test a hypothesis.

==Examples==
Some examples of statistics are:
* &quot;In a recent survey of Americans, 52% of women say global warming is happening.&quot;

In this case, &quot;52%&quot; is a statistic, namely the percentage of women in the survey sample who believe in global warming. The population is the set of all women in the United States, and the population parameter being estimated is the percentage of &quot;all&quot; women in the United States, not just those surveyed, who believe in global warming.

* &quot;The manager of a large hotel located near Disney World indicated that 20 selected guests had a mean length of stay equal to 5.6 days.&quot;

In this example, &quot;5.6 days&quot; is a statistic, namely the mean length of stay for our sample of 20 hotel guests. The population is the set of all guests of this hotel, and the population parameter being estimated is the mean length of stay for &quot;all&quot; guests. Whether the estimator is unbiased in this case depends upon the sample selection process; see the inspection paradox.

There are a variety of functions that are used to calculate statistics. Some include:
* Sample mean, sample median, and sample mode
* Sample variance and sample standard deviation
* Sample quantiles besides the median, e.g., quartiles and percentiles
* Test statistics, such as t-statistic, chi-squared statistic, f statistic
* Order statistics, including sample maximum and minimum
* Sample moments and functions thereof, including kurtosis and skewness
* Various functionals of the empirical distribution function

==Properties==
===Observability===
Statisticians often contemplate a parameterized family of probability distributions, any member of which could be the distribution of some measurable aspect of each member of a population, from which a sample is drawn randomly. For example, the parameter may be the average height of 25-year-old men in North America. The height of the members of a sample of 100 such men are measured; the average of those 100 numbers is a statistic. The average of the heights of all members of the population is not a statistic unless that has somehow also been ascertained (such as by measuring every member of the population). The average height that would be calculated using &quot;all&quot; of the individual heights of &quot;all&quot; 25-year-old North American men is a parameter, and not a statistic.

===Statistical properties===
Important potential properties of statistics include completeness, consistency, sufficiency, unbiasedness, minimum mean square error, low variance, robustness, and computational convenience.

===Information of a statistic===
Information of a statistic on model parameters can be defined in several ways. The most common is the Fisher information, which is defined on the statistic model induced by the statistic. Kullback information measure can also be used.

<doc id="26709" wikidata="Q4573" url="?curid=26709" title="Sean Connery">
<text>Sir Thomas Sean Connery (25 August 1930 – 31 October 2020) was a Scottish actor. He was the first actor to portray fictional British secret agent James Bond in motion pictures, starring in seven Bond films between 1962 and 1983. Connery originated the role in &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) and continued starring as Bond in the Eon Productions films &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; (1963), &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964), &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965), &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1967) and &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot; (1971). Connery made his final appearance in the franchise in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; (1983), a non-Eon-produced Bond film.

Connery is also known for his notable collaborations with directors such as Alfred Hitchcock, Sidney Lumet and John Huston. Their films in which Connery appeared included &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964), &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965), &quot;The Offence&quot; (1973), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975). He also acted in &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976), &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;Highlander&quot; (1986), &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989), &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), &quot;Dragonheart&quot; (1996), &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996) and &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; (2000). His final on-screen role was as Allan Quatermain in &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003).

Connery received numerous accolades. For his role in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (1987), he received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the first Scottish actor to win the achievement, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture, and in the same year he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for his role in &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986). He also received honorary awards such as the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1987, the BAFTA Fellowship in 1998 and the Kennedy Center Honors in 1999. 
Connery was made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters in France and a knight by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to drama in 2000.

== Early life and education ==
Thomas Sean Connery was born at the Royal Maternity Hospital in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 25 August 1930; he was named after his paternal grandfather. He was brought up at No. 176 Fountainbridge, a block which has since been demolished. His mother, Euphemia McBain &quot;Effie&quot; McLean, was a cleaning woman. The daughter of Neil McLean and Helen Forbes Ross, she was named after her father&#x27;s mother, Euphemia McBain, wife of John McLean and daughter of William McBain from Ceres in Fife. Connery&#x27;s father, Joseph Connery, was a factory worker and lorry driver.

Two of his paternal great-grandparents emigrated to Scotland from Wexford, Ireland, in the mid-19th century, with his great-grandfather James Connery being an Irish Traveller. The remainder of his family was of Scottish descent, and his maternal great-grandparents were native Scottish Gaelic speakers from Fife and Uig on Skye. His father was a Roman Catholic, and his mother was a Protestant. Connery had a younger brother Neil and was generally referred to in his youth as &quot;Tommy&quot;. Although he was small in primary school, he grew rapidly around the age of 12, reaching his full adult height of at 18. Connery was known during his teen years as &quot;Big Tam&quot;, and he said that he lost his virginity to an adult woman in an ATS uniform at the age of 14. He had an Irish childhood friend named Séamus; when the two were together, those who knew them both called Connery by his middle name Sean, emphasising the alliteration of the two names. Since then Connery preferred to use his middle name.

Connery&#x27;s first job was as a milkman in Edinburgh with St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Co-operative Society. In 2009, Connery recalled a conversation in a taxi:
In 1946, at the age of 16, Connery joined the Royal Navy, during which time he acquired two tattoos. Connery&#x27;s official website says &quot;unlike many tattoos, his were not frivolous – his tattoos reflect two of his lifelong commitments: his family and Scotland. ... One tattoo is a tribute to his parents and reads &#x27;Mum and Dad&#x27;, and the other is self-explanatory, &#x27;Scotland Forever&#x27;&quot;. He trained in Portsmouth at the naval gunnery school and in an anti-aircraft crew. He was later assigned as an Able Seaman on HMS &quot;Formidable&quot;. Connery was discharged from the navy at the age of 19 on medical grounds because of a duodenal ulcer, a condition that affected most of the males in previous generations of his family.

Afterwards, he returned to the co-op and worked as a lorry driver, a lifeguard at Portobello swimming baths, a labourer, an artist&#x27;s model for the Edinburgh College of Art, and after a suggestion by former Mr. Scotland Archie Brennan, as a coffin polisher, among other jobs. The modelling earned him 15 shillings an hour. Artist Richard Demarco, at the time a student who painted several early pictures of Connery, described him as &quot;very straight, slightly shy, too, too beautiful for words, a virtual Adonis&quot;.

Connery began bodybuilding at the age of 18, and from 1951 trained heavily with Ellington, a former gym instructor in the British Army. While his official website states he was third in the 1950 Mr. Universe contest, most sources place him in the 1953 competition, either third in the Junior class or failing to place in the Tall Man classification. Connery said he was soon deterred from bodybuilding when he found that Americans frequently beat him in competitions because of sheer muscle size and, unlike Connery, refused to participate in athletic activity which could make them lose muscle mass.

Connery was a keen footballer, having played for Bonnyrigg Rose in his younger days. He was offered a trial with East Fife. While on tour with &quot;South Pacific&quot;, Connery played in a football match against a local team that Matt Busby, manager of Manchester United, happened to be scouting. According to reports, Busby was impressed with his physical prowess and offered Connery a contract worth £25 a week () immediately after the game. Connery said he was tempted to accept, but he recalls, &quot;I realised that a top-class footballer could be over the hill by the age of 30, and I was already 23. I decided to become an actor and it turned out to be one of my more intelligent moves&quot;.

== Career ==
=== 1951–1959: Career beginnings ===
Seeking to supplement his income, Connery helped out backstage at the King&#x27;s Theatre in late 1951. During a bodybuilding competition held in London in 1953, one of the competitors mentioned that auditions were being held for a production of &quot;South Pacific&quot;, and Connery landed a small part as one of the Seabees chorus boys. By the time the production reached Edinburgh, he had been given the part of Marine Cpl. Hamilton Steeves and was understudying two of the juvenile leads, and his salary was raised from £12 to £14–10s a week. The production returned the following year, out of popular demand, and Connery was promoted to the featured role of Lieutenant Buzz Adams, which Larry Hagman had portrayed in the West End.

While in Edinburgh, Connery was targeted by the Valdor gang, one of the most violent in the city. He was first approached by them in a billiard hall where he prevented them from stealing his jacket and was later followed by six gang members to a 15-foot-high (4.6 m) balcony at the Palais de Danse. There, Connery singlehandedly launched an attack against the gang members, grabbing one by the throat and another by the biceps and cracking their heads together. From then on, he was treated with great respect by the gang and gained a reputation as a &quot;hard man&quot;.

Connery first met Michael Caine at a party during the production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; in 1954, and the two later became close friends. During this production at the Opera House, Manchester, over the Christmas period of 1954, Connery developed a serious interest in the theatre through American actor Robert Henderson, who lent him copies of the Ibsen works &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot;, &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, and &quot;When We Dead Awaken&quot;, and later listed works by the likes of Proust, Tolstoy, Turgenev, Bernard Shaw, Joyce, and Shakespeare for him to digest. Henderson urged him to take elocution lessons and got him parts at the Maida Vale Theatre in London. He had already begun a film career, having been an extra in Herbert Wilcox&#x27;s 1954 musical &quot;Lilacs in the Spring&quot; alongside Errol Flynn and Anna Neagle.

Although Connery had secured several roles as an extra, he was struggling to make ends meet and was forced to accept a part-time job as a babysitter for journalist Peter Noble and his actress wife Marianne, which earned him 10 shillings a night. He met Hollywood actress Shelley Winters one night at Noble&#x27;s house, who described Connery as &quot;one of the tallest and most charming and masculine Scotsmen&quot; she had ever seen, and later spent many evenings with the Connery brothers drinking beer. Around this time, Connery was residing at TV presenter Llew Gardner&#x27;s house. Henderson landed Connery a role in a £6 a week Q Theatre production of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, during which he met and became friends with fellow Scot Ian Bannen. This role was followed by &quot;Point of Departure&quot; and &quot;A Witch in Time&quot; at Kew, a role as Pentheus opposite Yvonne Mitchell in &quot;The Bacchae&quot; at the Oxford Playhouse, and a role opposite Jill Bennett in Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s play &quot;Anna Christie&quot;.

During his time at the Oxford Theatre, Connery won a brief part as a boxer in the TV series &quot;The Square Ring&quot;, before being spotted by Canadian director Alvin Rakoff, who gave him multiple roles in &quot;The Condemned&quot;, shot on location in Dover in Kent. In 1956, Connery appeared in the theatrical production of &quot;Epitaph&quot;, and played a minor role as a hoodlum in the &quot;Ladies of the Manor&quot; episode of the BBC Television police series &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;. This was followed by small television parts in &quot;Sailor of Fortune&quot; and &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; (in a special episode filmed in Europe).

In early 1957, Connery hired agent Richard Hatton, who got him his first film role, as Spike, a minor gangster with a speech impediment in Montgomery Tully&#x27;s &quot;No Road Back&quot;, alongside Skip Homeier, Paul Carpenter, Patricia Dainton, and Norman Wooland. In April 1957, Rakoffafter being disappointed by Jack Palancedecided to give the young actor his first chance in a leading role, and cast Connery as Mountain McLintock in BBC Television&#x27;s production of &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;, which also starred Warren Mitchell and Jacqueline Hill. He then played a rogue lorry driver, Johnny Yates, in Cy Endfield&#x27;s &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (1957) alongside Stanley Baker, Herbert Lom, Peggy Cummins, and Patrick McGoohan. Later in 1957, Connery appeared in Terence Young&#x27;s poorly received MGM action picture &quot;Action of the Tiger&quot;, opposite Van Johnson, Martine Carol, Herbert Lom, and Gustavo Rojo; the film was shot on location in southern Spain. He also had a minor role in Gerald Thomas&#x27;s thriller &quot;Time Lock&quot; (1957) as a welder, appearing alongside Robert Beatty, Lee Patterson, Betty McDowall, and Vincent Winter; this commenced filming on 1 December 1956 at Beaconsfield Studios.

Connery had a major role in the melodrama &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot; (1958) as a British reporter named Mark Trevor, caught in a love affair opposite Lana Turner and Barry Sullivan. During filming, Turner&#x27;s possessive gangster boyfriend, Johnny Stompanato, who was visiting from Los Angeles, believed she was having an affair with Connery. Connery and Turner had attended West End shows and London restaurants together. Stompanato stormed onto the film set and pointed a gun at Connery, only to have Connery disarm him and knock him flat on his back. Stompanato was banned from the set. Two Scotland Yard detectives advised Stompanato to leave and escorted him to the airport, where he boarded a plane back to the United States. Connery later recounted that he had to lie low for a while after receiving threats from men linked to Stompanato&#x27;s boss, Mickey Cohen.

In 1959, Connery landed a leading role in director Robert Stevenson&#x27;s Walt Disney Productions film &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot; (1959), alongside Albert Sharpe, Janet Munro, and Jimmy O&#x27;Dea. The film is a tale about a wily Irishman and his battle of wits with leprechauns. Upon the film&#x27;s initial release, A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the cast (save Connery whom he described as &quot;merely tall, dark, and handsome&quot;) and thought the film an &quot;overpoweringly charming concoction of standard Gaelic tall stories, fantasy and romance&quot;. He also had prominent television roles in Rudolph Cartier&#x27;s 1961 productions of &quot;Adventure Story&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; for BBC Television, co-starring with Claire Bloom in the latter. Also in 1961 he portrayed the title role in a CBC television film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with Australian actress Zoe Caldwell cast as Lady Macbeth.

=== 1962–1983: James Bond and stardom ===
Connery&#x27;s breakthrough came in the role of British secret agent James Bond. He was initially reluctant to commit to a film series, but understood that if the franchise succeeded, his film career would greatly benefit. Between 1962 and 1967, Connery played 007 in &quot;Dr. No&quot;, &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, &quot;Thunderball&quot;, and &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, the first five Bond films produced by Eon Productions. After departing from the role, Connery returned for the seventh film, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, in 1971. Connery made his final appearance as Bond in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, a 1983 remake of &quot;Thunderball&quot; produced by Jack Schwartzman&#x27;s Taliafilm. All seven films were commercially successful. James Bond, as portrayed by Connery, was selected as the third-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute.

The choice of Connery for the role of James Bond owed a lot to Dana Broccoli, wife of producer Albert &quot;Cubby&quot; Broccoli, who is reputed to have been instrumental in persuading her husband that Connery was the right man. James Bond&#x27;s creator, Ian Fleming, originally doubted Connery&#x27;s casting, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s not what I envisioned of James Bond looks&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m looking for Commander Bond and not an overgrown stunt-man&quot;, adding that Connery (muscular, 6&#x27;2&quot;, and a Scot) was unrefined. Fleming&#x27;s girlfriend Blanche Blackwell told him Connery had the requisite sexual charisma, and Fleming changed his mind after the successful &quot;Dr. No&quot; première. He was so impressed, he wrote Connery&#x27;s heritage into the character. In his 1964 novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, Fleming wrote that Bond&#x27;s father was Scottish and from Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands.

Connery&#x27;s portrayal of Bond owes much to stylistic tutelage from director Terence Young, who helped polish him while using his physical grace and presence for the action. Lois Maxwell, who played Miss Moneypenny, related that &quot;Terence took Sean under his wing. He took him to dinner, showed him how to walk, how to talk, even how to eat&quot;. The tutoring was successful; Connery received thousands of fan letters a week after &quot;Dr. No&#x27;s&quot; opening, and he became a major sex symbol in film.

Following the release of the film &quot;Dr. No&quot; in 1962, the line &quot;Bond ... James Bond&quot;, became a catch phrase in the lexicon of Western popular culture. Film critic Peter Bradshaw writes, &quot;It is the most famous self-introduction from any character in movie history. Three cool monosyllables, surname first, a little curtly, as befits a former naval commander. And then, as if in afterthought, the first name, followed by the surname again. Connery carried it off with icily disdainful style, in full evening dress with a cigarette hanging from his lips. The introduction was a kind of challenge, or seduction, invariably addressed to an enemy. In the early 60s, Connery&#x27;s James Bond was about as dangerous and sexy as it got on screen&quot;.

During the filming of &quot;Thunderball&quot; in 1965, Connery&#x27;s life was in danger in the sequence with the sharks in Emilio Largo&#x27;s pool. He had been concerned about this threat when he read the script. Connery insisted that Ken Adam build a special Plexiglas partition inside the pool, but this was not a fixed structure, and one of the sharks managed to pass through it. He had to abandon the pool immediately.

=== 1964–1986 ===

Although Bond had made him a star, Connery grew tired of the role and the pressure the franchise put on him, saying &quot;[I am] fed up to here with the whole Bond bit&quot; and &quot;I have always hated that damned James Bond. I&#x27;d like to kill him&quot;. Michael Caine said of the situation, &quot;If you were his friend in these early days you didn&#x27;t raise the subject of Bond. He was, and is, a much better actor than just playing James Bond, but he became synonymous with Bond. He&#x27;d be walking down the street and people would say, &#x27;Look, there&#x27;s James Bond&#x27;. That was particularly upsetting to him&quot;.

While making the Bond films, Connery also starred in other films such as Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Marnie&quot; (1964) and Sidney Lumet&#x27;s &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965), which film critic Peter Bradshaw regards as his two great non-Bond pictures from the 1960s. In &quot;Marnie&quot;, Connery starred opposite Tippi Hedren. Connery had said he wanted to work with Hitchcock, which Eon arranged through their contacts. Connery also shocked many people at the time by asking to see a script, something he did because he was worried about being typecast as a spy and he did not want to do a variation of &quot;North by Northwest&quot; or &quot;Notorious&quot;. When told by Hitchcock&#x27;s agent that Cary Grant had not asked to see even one of Hitchcock&#x27;s scripts, Connery replied: &quot;I&#x27;m not Cary Grant&quot;. Hitchcock and Connery got on well during filming, and Connery said he was happy with the film &quot;with certain reservations&quot;. In &quot;The Hill&quot;, Connery wanted to act in something that wasn&#x27;t Bond related, and he used his leverage as a star to feature in it. While the film wasn&#x27;t a financial success it was a critical one, debuting at the Cannes Film Festival winning Best Screenplay. The first of five films he made with Lumet, Connery considered him to be one of his favourite directors. The respect was mutual, with Lumet saying of Connery&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Hill&quot;, &quot;The thing that was apparent to me – and to most directors – was how much talent and ability it takes to play that kind of character who is based on charm and magnetism. It&#x27;s the equivalent of high comedy and he did it brilliantly.&quot;

In the mid-1960s, Connery played golf with Scottish industrialist Iain Maxwell Stewart, a connection which led to Connery directing and presenting the documentary film &quot;The Bowler and the Bunnet&quot; in 1967. The film described the Fairfield Experiment, a new approach to industrial relations carried out at the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Glasgow, during the 1960s; the experiment was initiated by Stewart and supported by George Brown, the First Secretary in Harold Wilson&#x27;s cabinet, in 1966. The company was facing closure, and Brown agreed to provide £1 million (£13.135 million; US$15.55 million in 2021 terms) to enable trade unions, the management and the shareholders to try out new ways of industrial management.

Having played Bond six times, Connery&#x27;s global popularity was such that he shared a Golden Globe Henrietta Award with Charles Bronson for &quot;World Film FavoriteMale&quot; in 1972. He appeared in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; (1975) opposite Michael Caine. Playing two former British soldiers who set themselves up as kings in Kafiristan, both actors regarded it as their favourite film. The same year, he appeared in &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; opposite Candice Bergen who played Eden Pedecaris (based on the real-life Perdicaris incident), and in 1976 played Robin Hood in &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; opposite Audrey Hepburn, who played Maid Marian. Film critic Roger Ebert, who had praised the double act of Connery and Caine in &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot;, praised Connery&#x27;s chemistry with Hepburn, writing: &quot;Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love&quot;.

During the 1970s, Connery was part of ensemble casts in films such as &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974) with Vanessa Redgrave and John Gielgud, and played a British Army general in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s war film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; (1977), co-starring Dirk Bogarde and Laurence Olivier. In 1974, he starred in John Boorman&#x27;s sci-fi thriller &quot;Zardoz&quot;. Often called one of the &quot;weirdest and worst movies ever made&quot; it featured Connery in a scarlet mankinia revealing costume which generated much controversy for its unBond-like appearance. Despite being panned by critics at the time, the film has developed a cult following since its release. In the audio commentary to the film, Boorman relates how Connery would write poetry in his free time, describing him as &quot;a man of great depth and intelligence&quot; and possessing the &quot;most extraordinary memory&quot;. In 1981, Connery appeared in the film &quot;Time Bandits&quot; as Agamemnon. The casting choice derives from a joke Michael Palin included in the script, which describes the character&#x27;s removing his mask and being &quot;Sean Conneryor someone of equal but cheaper stature&quot;. When shown the script, Connery was happy to play the supporting role. In 1981 he portrayed Marshal William T. O&#x27;Niel in the science fiction thriller &quot;Outland&quot;. In 1982, Connery narrated &quot;G&#x27;olé!&quot;, the official film of the 1982 FIFA World Cup. That same year, he was offered the role of Daddy Warbucks in &quot;Annie&quot;, going as far as taking voice lessons for the John Huston musical before turning down the part.

Connery agreed to reprise Bond as an ageing agent 007 in &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, released in October 1983. The title, contributed by his wife, refers to his earlier statement that he would &quot;never again&quot; return to the role. Although the film performed well at the box office, it was plagued with production problems: strife between the director and producer, financial problems, the Fleming estate trustees&#x27; attempts to halt the film, and Connery&#x27;s wrist being broken by the fight choreographer, Steven Seagal. As a result of his negative experiences during filming, Connery became unhappy with the major studios and did not make any films for two years. Following the successful European production &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot; (1986), for which he won a BAFTA Award for Best Actor, Connery&#x27;s interest in more commercial material was revived. That same year, a supporting role in &quot;Highlander&quot; showcased his ability to play older mentors to younger leads, which became a recurring role in many of his later films.

=== 1987–2006 ===
In 1987, Connery starred in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, where he played a hard-nosed Irish-American cop alongside Kevin Costner&#x27;s Eliot Ness. The film also starred Charles Martin Smith, Patricia Clarkson, Andy Garcia, and Robert De Niro as Al Capone. The film was a critical and box-office success. Many critics praised Connery for his performance, including Roger Ebert, who wrote: &quot;The best performance in the movie is Connery... [he] brings a human element to his character; he seems to have had an existence apart from the legend of the Untouchables, and when he&#x27;s onscreen we can believe, briefly, that the Prohibition Era was inhabited by people, not caricatures&quot;. For his performance, Connery received a BAFTA nomination and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Connery starred in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; (1989), playing Henry Jones Sr., the title character&#x27;s father, and received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations. Harrison Ford said Connery&#x27;s contributions at the writing stage enhanced the film. &quot;It was amazing for me in how far he got into the script and went after exploiting opportunities for character. His suggestions to George [Lucas] at the writing stage really gave the character and the picture a lot more complexity and value than it had in the original screenplay&quot;. His subsequent box-office hits included &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), &quot;The Russia House&quot; (1990), &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996), and &quot;Entrapment&quot; (1999). In 1996, he voiced the role of Draco the dragon in the film &quot;Dragonheart&quot;. He also appeared in a brief cameo as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (1991). In 1998, Connery received the BAFTA Fellowship, a lifetime achievement award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

Connery&#x27;s later films included several box-office and critical disappointments such as &quot;First Knight&quot; (1995), &quot;Just Cause&quot; (1995), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1998), and &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (2003); however, he received positive reviews for his performance in &quot;Finding Forrester&quot; (2000). He also received a Crystal Globe for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema. In a 2003 UK poll conducted by Channel 4, Connery was ranked eighth on their list of the 100 Greatest Movie Stars. The failure of &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; was especially frustrating for Connery. He sensed during shooting that the production was &quot;going off the rails&quot;, and announced that the director, Stephen Norrington should be &quot;locked up for insanity&quot;. Connery spent considerable effort in trying to salvage the film through the editing process, ultimately deciding to retire from acting rather than go through such stress ever again.

Connery turned down the role of Gandalf in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; films, saying he did not understand the script. He was reportedly offered US$30 million along with 15% of the worldwide box office receipts, which would have earned him US$450 million. He also turned down the opportunity to appear as Albus Dumbledore in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series and the Architect in &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy. In 2005, he recorded voiceovers for the &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; video game with recording producer Terry Manning in the Bahamas, and provided his likeness. Connery said he was happy the producers, Electronic Arts, had approached him to voice Bond.

== Retirement ==
When Connery received the American Film Institute&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award on 8 June 2006, he confirmed his retirement from acting. Connery&#x27;s disillusionment with the &quot;idiots now making films in Hollywood&quot; was cited as a reason for his decision to retire. On 7 June 2007, he denied rumours that he would appear in the fourth &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film, saying &quot;retirement is just too much damned fun&quot;. In 2010, a bronze bust sculpture of Connery was placed in Tallinn, Estonia, outside The Scottish Club, whose membership includes Estonian Scotophiles and a handful of expatriate Scots. In 2012, Connery briefly came out of retirement to voice the title character in the Scottish animated film &quot;Sir Billi&quot;. Connery served as executive producer for an expanded 80-minute version.

== Personal life ==
During the production of &quot;South Pacific&quot; in the mid-1950s, Connery dated a Jewish &quot;dark-haired beauty with a ballerina&#x27;s figure&quot;, Carol Sopel, but was warned off by her family. He then dated Julie Hamilton, daughter of documentary filmmaker and feminist Jill Craigie. Given Connery&#x27;s rugged appearance and rough charm, Hamilton initially thought he was an appalling person and was not attracted to him until she saw him in a kilt, declaring him to be the most beautiful thing she had ever seen in her life. He also shared a mutual attraction with jazz singer Maxine Daniels, whom he met while working in theatre. He made a pass at her, but she told him she was already happily married with a daughter.

Connery was married to actress Diane Cilento from 1962 to 1974, though they separated in 1971. They had a son, actor Jason Joseph. Connery illustrated the cover of Cilento&#x27;s 1967 novel: The Manipulator. Connery was separated in the early 1970s when he dated Dyan Cannon, Jill St. John, Lana Wood, Carole Mallory, and Magda Konopka. In her 2006 autobiography, Cilento alleged that he had abused her mentally and physically during their relationship. Connery cancelled an appearance at the Scottish Parliament in 2006 because of controversy over his alleged support of abuse of women. He denied claims he told &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in 1965, &quot;I don&#x27;t think there is anything particularly wrong in hitting a woman, though I don&#x27;t recommend you do it in the same way you hit a man&quot;. He was also reported to have stated to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1993, &quot;There are women who take it to the wire. That&#x27;s what they are looking for, the ultimate confrontation. They want a smack&quot;. In 2006, Connery told &quot;The Times&quot; of London, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that any level of abuse of women is ever justified under any circumstances. Full stop&quot;.

Connery was married to French-Moroccan painter Micheline Roquebrune (born 4 April 1929) from 1975 until his death. The marriage survived a well-documented affair Connery had in the late 1980s with the singer and songwriter Lynsey de Paul, which she later regretted due to his views concerning domestic violence.

Connery owned the Domaine de Terre Blanche in the South of France from 1979. He sold it to German billionaire Dietmar Hopp in 1999. He was awarded an honorary rank of &quot;Shodan&quot; (1st dan) in Kyokushin karate. Connery relocated to the Bahamas in the 1990s; he owned a mansion in Lyford Cay on New Providence.

Connery was knighted by the Queen at an investiture ceremony at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh on 5 July 2000. He had been nominated for a knighthood in 1997 and 1998, but these nominations were reportedly vetoed by Donald Dewar owing to Connery&#x27;s political views. Connery had a villa in Kranidi, Greece. His neighbour was King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands, with whom he shared a helicopter platform. Michael Caine (who co-starred with Connery in &quot;The Man Who Would Be King&quot; in 1975) was among Connery&#x27;s closest friends.

Growing up, Connery supported the Scottish football club Celtic F.C., having been introduced to the club by his father who was a lifelong fan of the team. Later in life, Connery switched his loyalty to Celtic&#x27;s bitter rival, Rangers F.C., after he became close friends with the team&#x27;s chairman, David Murray. He was a keen golfer, introduced to the game by his friend Iain Stewart. English professional golfer Peter Alliss gave Connery golf lessons before the filming of the 1964 James Bond film &quot;Goldfinger&quot;, which involved a scene where Connery, as Bond, played golf against gold magnate Auric Goldfinger at Stoke Park Golf Club in Buckinghamshire. The golf scene saw him wear a Slazenger v-neck sweater, a brand which Connery became associated with while playing golf in his free time, with a light grey marl being a favoured colour. Record major championship winner and golf course designer Jack Nicklaus said, &quot;He loved the game of golfSean was a pretty darn good golfer!and we played together several times. In May 1993, Sean and legendary driver Jackie Stewart helped me open our design of the PGA Centenary Course at Gleneagles in Scotland&quot;.

=== Political views ===
Connery&#x27;s Scottish roots and his experiences in filming in Glasgow&#x27;s shipyards in 1966 inspired him to become a member of the centre-left Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence from the United Kingdom (in 2011, Connery said &quot;&quot;The Bowler and the Bunnet&quot; was just the beginning of a journey that would lead to my long association with the Scottish National Party&quot;). Connery supported the party both financially and through personal appearances. In 1967, he wrote to George Leslie, the SNP candidate in the 1967 Glasgow Pollok by-election, saying, &quot;I am convinced that with our resources and skills we are more than capable of building a prosperous, vigorous and modern self-governing Scotland in which we can all take pride and which will deserve the respect of other nations.&quot; His funding of the SNP ceased in 2001, when the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed legislation prohibiting overseas funding of political activities in the United Kingdom.

=== Tax status ===
In response to accusations that he was a tax exile, Connery released documents in 2003 showing he had paid £3.7 million in UK taxes between 1997 and 1998 and between 2002 and 2003; critics pointed out that had he been continuously residing in the UK for tax purposes, his tax rate would have been far higher. In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Connery&#x27;s brother Neil said Connery would not come to Scotland to rally independence supporters, since his tax exile status greatly limited the number of days he could spend in the country.

After Connery sold his Marbella villa in 1999, Spanish authorities launched a tax evasion investigation, alleging that the Spanish treasury had been defrauded of £5.5 million. Connery was subsequently cleared by officials, but his wife and 16 others were charged with attempting to defraud the Spanish treasury.

== Death and legacy ==
Connery died in his sleep on 31 October 2020, aged 90, at his home in the Lyford Cay community of Nassau in the Bahamas. His death was announced by his family and Eon Productions; although they did not disclose the cause of death, his son Jason said he had been unwell for some time. A day later, his widow revealed he had dementia in his final years. Connery&#x27;s death certificate was obtained by TMZ a month after his death, showing the cause of death was pneumonia and respiratory failure, and the time of death was listed as 1:30 am. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered in Scotland at undisclosed locations in 2022.

Following the announcement of his death, many co-stars and figures from the entertainment industry paid tribute to Connery, including Sam Neill, Nicolas Cage, Robert De Niro, Michael Bay, Tippi Hedren, Alec Baldwin, Hugh Jackman, George Lucas, Shirley Bassey, Kevin Costner, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Barbra Streisand, John Cleese, Jane Seymour and Harrison Ford, as well as former Bond stars George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig, including the family of late former Bond actor Roger Moore. Connery&#x27;s longtime friend Michael Caine called him a &quot;great star, brilliant actor and a wonderful friend&quot;. James Bond producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli released a statement saying Connery had &quot;revolutionized the world with his gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent. He is undoubtedly largely responsible for the success of the film series and we shall be forever grateful to him&quot;.

In 2004, a poll in the UK &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; recognised Connery as &quot;The Greatest Living Scot&quot; and a 2011 EuroMillions survey named him &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Greatest Living National Treasure&quot;. He was voted by &quot;People&quot; magazine as the &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; in 1989 and the &quot;Sexiest Man of the Century&quot; in 1999. If the non-Eon Bond movie &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; is included, Connery shares the record for the most portrayals as James Bond with Roger Moore (with seven apiece). In June 1965, &quot;Time&quot; magazine observed &quot;James Bond has developed into the biggest mass-cult hero of the decade&quot;.

In 2024, the Edinburgh International Film Festival established an annual award in Connery&#x27;s honour. The &quot;Sean Connery Prize for Feature Filmmaking Excellence&quot; is a prize of £50,000 given to the makers of a film chosen by audience vote from a short-list of ten feature films that receive their world premières at the festival each year.

<text>Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. Sculpture is the three-dimensional art work which is physically presented in the dimensions of height, width and depth. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or moulded or cast.

Sculpture in stone survives far better than works of art in perishable materials, and often represents the majority of the surviving works (other than pottery) from ancient cultures, though conversely traditions of sculpture in wood may have vanished almost entirely. In addition, most ancient sculpture was brightly painted, and this has been lost.

Sculpture has been central in religious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries, large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of religion or politics. Those cultures whose sculptures have survived in quantities include the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean, India and China, as well as many in Central and South America and Africa.

The Western tradition of sculpture began in ancient Greece, and Greece is widely seen as producing great masterpieces in the classical period. During the Middle Ages, Gothic sculpture represented the agonies and passions of the Christian faith. The revival of classical models in the Renaissance produced famous sculptures such as Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of &quot;David&quot;. Modernist sculpture moved away from traditional processes and the emphasis on the depiction of the human body, with the making of constructed sculpture, and the presentation of found objects as finished artworks.

==Types==

A distinction exists between sculpture &quot;in the round&quot;, free-standing sculpture such as statues, not attached except possibly at the base to any other surface, and the various types of relief, which are at least partly attached to a background surface. Relief is often classified by the degree of projection from the wall into low or bas-relief, high relief, and sometimes an intermediate mid-relief. Sunk-relief is a technique restricted to ancient Egypt. Relief is the usual sculptural medium for large figure groups and narrative subjects, which are difficult to accomplish in the round, and is the typical technique used both for architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings, and for small-scale sculpture decorating other objects, as in much pottery, metalwork and jewellery. Relief sculpture may also decorate steles, upright slabs, usually of stone, often also containing inscriptions.

Another basic distinction is between subtractive carving techniques, which remove material from an existing block or lump, for example of stone or wood, and modelling techniques which shape or build up the work from the material. Techniques such as casting, stamping and moulding use an intermediate matrix containing the design to produce the work; many of these allow the production of several copies.

The term &quot;sculpture&quot; is often used mainly to describe large works, which are sometimes called monumental sculpture, meaning either or both of sculpture that is large, or that is attached to a building. But the term properly covers many types of small works in three dimensions using the same techniques, including coins and medals, hardstone carvings, a term for small carvings in stone that can take detailed work.

The very large or &quot;colossal&quot; statue has had an enduring appeal since antiquity; the largest on record at is the 2018 Indian Statue of Unity. Another grand form of portrait sculpture is the equestrian statue of a rider on horse, which has become rare in recent decades. The smallest forms of life-size portrait sculpture are the &quot;head&quot;, showing just that, or the bust, a representation of a person from the chest up. Small forms of sculpture include the figurine, normally a statue that is no more than tall, and for reliefs the plaquette, medal or coin.

Modern and contemporary art have added a number of non-traditional forms of sculpture, including sound sculpture, light sculpture, environmental art, environmental sculpture, street art sculpture, kinetic sculpture (involving aspects of physical motion), land art, and site-specific art. Sculpture is an important form of public art. A collection of sculpture in a garden setting can be called a sculpture garden. There is also a view that buildings are a type of sculpture, with Constantin Brâncuși describing architecture as &quot;inhabited sculpture&quot;. 

==Purposes and subjects==
One of the most common purposes of sculpture is in some form of association with religion. Cult images are common in many cultures, though they are often not the colossal statues of deities which characterized ancient Greek art, like the Statue of Zeus at Olympia. The actual cult images in the innermost sanctuaries of Egyptian temples, of which none have survived, were evidently rather small, even in the largest temples. The same is often true in Hinduism, where the very simple and ancient form of the lingam is the most common. Buddhism brought the sculpture of religious figures to East Asia, where there seems to have been no earlier equivalent tradition, though again simple shapes like the &quot;bi&quot; and &quot;cong&quot; probably had religious significance.

Small sculptures as personal possessions go back to the earliest prehistoric art, and the use of very large sculpture as public art, especially to impress the viewer with the power of a ruler, goes back at least to the Great Sphinx of some 4,500 years ago. In archaeology and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of large or monumental sculpture in a culture is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;

The totem pole is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology. The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization. Recent unexpected discoveries of ancient Chinese Bronze Age figures at Sanxingdui, some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.

Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the Indus Valley civilization, appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals. The Mississippian culture seems to have been progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed. Other cultures, such as ancient Egypt and the Easter Island culture, seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage.

The collecting of sculpture, including that of earlier periods, goes back some 2,000 years in Greece, China and Mesoamerica, and many collections were available on semi-public display long before the modern museum was invented. From the 20th century the relatively restricted range of subjects found in large sculpture expanded greatly, with abstract subjects and the use or representation of any type of subject now common. Today much sculpture is made for intermittent display in galleries and museums, and the ability to transport and store the increasingly large works is a factor in their construction.

Small decorative figurines, most often in ceramics, are as popular today (though strangely neglected by modern and Contemporary art) as they were in the Rococo, or in ancient Greece when Tanagra figurines were a major industry, or in East Asian and Pre-Columbian art. Small sculpted fittings for furniture and other objects go well back into antiquity, as in the Nimrud ivories, Begram ivories and finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun.

Portrait sculpture began in Egypt, where the Narmer Palette shows a ruler of the 32nd century BCE, and Mesopotamia, where we have 27 surviving statues of Gudea, who ruled Lagash c. 2144–2124 BCE. In ancient Greece and Rome, the erection of a portrait statue in a public place was almost the highest mark of honour, and the ambition of the elite, who might also be depicted on a coin.

In other cultures such as Egypt and the Near East public statues were almost exclusively the preserve of the ruler, with other wealthy people only being portrayed in their tombs. Rulers are typically the only people given portraits in Pre-Columbian cultures, beginning with the Olmec colossal heads of about 3,000 years ago. East Asian portrait sculpture was entirely religious, with leading clergy being commemorated with statues, especially the founders of monasteries, but not rulers, or ancestors. The Mediterranean tradition revived, initially only for tomb effigies and coins, in the Middle Ages, but expanded greatly in the Renaissance, which invented new forms such as the personal portrait medal.

Animals are, with the human figure, the earliest subject for sculpture, and have always been popular, sometimes realistic, but often imaginary monsters; in China animals and monsters are almost the only traditional subjects for stone sculpture outside tombs and temples. The kingdom of plants is important only in jewellery and decorative reliefs, but these form almost all the large sculpture of Byzantine art and Islamic art, and are very important in most Eurasian traditions, where motifs such as the palmette and vine scroll have passed east and west for over two millennia.

One form of sculpture found in many prehistoric cultures around the world is specially enlarged versions of ordinary tools, weapons or vessels created in impractical precious materials, for either some form of ceremonial use or display or as offerings. Jade or other types of greenstone were used in China, Olmec Mexico, and Neolithic Europe, and in early Mesopotamia large pottery shapes were produced in stone. Bronze was used in Europe and China for large axes and blades, like the Oxborough Dirk.

==Materials and techniques==

The materials used in sculpture are diverse, changing throughout history. The classic materials, with outstanding durability, are metal, especially bronze, stone and pottery, with wood, bone and antler less durable but cheaper options. Precious materials such as gold, silver, jade, and ivory are often used for small luxury works, and sometimes in larger ones, as in chryselephantine statues. More common and less expensive materials were used for sculpture for wider consumption, including hardwoods (such as oak, box/boxwood, and lime/linden); terracotta and other ceramics, wax (a very common material for models for casting, and receiving the impressions of cylinder seals and engraved gems), and cast metals such as pewter and zinc (spelter). But a vast number of other materials have been used as part of sculptures, in ethnographic and ancient works as much as modern ones.

Sculptures are often painted, but commonly lose their paint to time, or restorers. Many different painting techniques have been used in making sculpture, including tempera, oil painting, gilding, house paint, aerosol, enamel and sandblasting.

Many sculptors seek new ways and materials to make art. One of Pablo Picasso&#x27;s most famous sculptures included bicycle parts. Alexander Calder and other modernists made spectacular use of painted steel. Since the 1960s, acrylics and other plastics have been used as well. Andy Goldsworthy makes his unusually ephemeral sculptures from almost entirely natural materials in natural settings. Some sculpture, such as ice sculpture, sand sculpture, and gas sculpture, is deliberately short-lived. Recent sculptors have used stained glass, tools, machine parts, hardware and consumer packaging to fashion their works. Sculptors sometimes use found objects, and Chinese scholar&#x27;s rocks have been appreciated for many centuries.

===Stone===

Stone sculpture is an ancient activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged in some form of stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains &quot;in situ&quot;, by incising, pecking, carving, and abrading. Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way. Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, originally used as seal rings.

The copying of an original statue in stone, which was very important for ancient Greek statues, which are nearly all known from copies, was traditionally achieved by &quot;pointing&quot;, along with more freehand methods. Pointing involved setting up a grid of string squares on a wooden frame surrounding the original, and then measuring the position on the grid and the distance between grid and statue of a series of individual points, and then using this information to carve into the block from which the copy is made.

===Metal===

Bronze and related copper alloys are the oldest and still the most popular metals for cast metal sculptures; a cast bronze sculpture is often called simply a &quot;bronze&quot;. Common bronze alloys have the unusual and desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling the finest details of a mould. Their strength and lack of brittleness (ductility) is an advantage when figures in action are to be created, especially when compared to various ceramic or stone materials (see marble sculpture for several examples). Gold is the softest and most precious metal, and very important in jewellery; with silver it is soft enough to be worked with hammers and other tools as well as cast; repoussé and chasing are among the techniques used in gold and silversmithing.

Casting is a group of manufacturing processes by which a liquid material (bronze, copper, glass, aluminum, iron) is (usually) poured into a mould, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solid casting is then ejected or broken out to complete the process, although a final stage of &quot;cold work&quot; may follow on the finished cast. Casting may be used to form hot liquid metals or various materials that &quot;cold set&quot; after mixing of components (such as epoxies, concrete, plaster and clay). Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods. The oldest surviving casting is a copper Mesopotamian frog from 3200 BCE. Specific techniques include lost-wax casting, plaster mould casting, and sand casting.

Welding is a process where different pieces of metal are fused together to create different shapes and designs. There are many different forms of welding, such as Oxy-fuel welding, Stick welding, MIG welding, and TIG welding. Oxy-fuel is probably the most common method of welding when it comes to creating steel sculptures because it is the easiest to use for shaping the steel as well as making clean and less noticeable joins of the steel. The key to Oxy-fuel welding is heating each piece of metal to be joined evenly until all are red and have a shine to them. Once that shine is on each piece, that shine will soon become a &#x27;pool&#x27; where the metal is liquified and the welder must get the pools to join, fusing the metal. Once cooled off, the location where the pools joined are now one continuous piece of metal. Also used heavily in Oxy-fuel sculpture creation is forging. Forging is the process of heating metal to a certain point to soften it enough to be shaped into different forms. One very common example is heating the end of a steel rod and hitting the red heated tip with a hammer while on an anvil to form a point. In between hammer swings, the forger rotates the rod and gradually forms a sharpened point from the blunt end of a steel rod.

===Glass===
Glass may be used for sculpture through a wide range of working techniques, though the use of it for large works is a recent development. It can be carved, though with considerable difficulty; the Roman Lycurgus Cup is all but unique. There are various ways of moulding glass: hot casting can be done by ladling molten glass into moulds that have been created by pressing shapes into sand, carved graphite or detailed plaster/silica moulds. Kiln casting glass involves heating chunks of glass in a kiln until they are liquid and flow into a waiting mould below it in the kiln. Hot glass can also be blown and/or hot sculpted with hand tools either as a solid mass or as part of a blown object. More recent techniques involve chiseling and bonding plate glass with polymer silicates and UV light.

===Pottery===

Pottery is one of the oldest materials for sculpture, as well as clay being the medium in which many sculptures cast in metal are originally modelled for casting. Sculptors often build small preliminary works called maquettes of ephemeral materials such as plaster of Paris, wax, unfired clay, or plasticine. Many cultures have produced pottery which combines a function as a vessel with a sculptural form, and small figurines have often been as popular as they are in modern Western culture. Stamps and moulds were used by most ancient civilizations, from ancient Rome and Mesopotamia to China.

===Wood carving===

Wood carving has been extremely widely practiced, but survives much less well than the other main materials, being vulnerable to decay, insect damage, and fire. It therefore forms an important hidden element in the art history of many cultures. Outdoor wood sculpture does not last long in most parts of the world, so that we have little idea how the totem pole tradition developed. Many of the most important sculptures of China and Japan in particular are in wood, and the great majority of African sculpture and that of Oceania and other regions.

Wood is light, so suitable for masks and other sculpture intended to be carried, and can take very fine detail. It is also much easier to work than stone. It has been very often painted after carving, but the paint wears less well than the wood, and is often missing in surviving pieces. Painted wood is often technically described as &quot;wood and polychrome&quot;. Typically a layer of gesso or plaster is applied to the wood, and then the paint is applied to that.

=== Soft materials ===
Three dimensional work incorporating unconventional materials such as cloth, fur, plastics, rubber and nylon, that can thus be stuffed, sewn, hung, draped or woven, are known as soft sculptures. Well known creators of soft sculptures include Claes Oldenburg, Yayoi Kusama, Eva Hesse, Sarah Lucas and Magdalena Abakanowicz. Soft sculptures challenge the traditional rigidity of sculpture by introducing pliable, often ephemeral materials that create a sense of fluidity and movement. These works can evoke a wide range of emotions, from playfulness to vulnerability, depending on the materials and forms used. By utilizing fabric, foam, and other soft elements, artists can manipulate scale and texture in ways that traditional materials like stone or metal do not allow. Additionally, soft sculptures often blur the boundaries between fine art, craft, and design, engaging with themes of the body, domesticity, and consumer culture. This versatility has made soft sculpture a significant medium for contemporary artists exploring new dimensions of materiality and meaning in three-dimensional art.

==Social status of sculptors==

Worldwide, sculptors have usually been tradespeople whose work is unsigned; in some traditions, for example China, where sculpture did not share the prestige of literati painting, this has affected the status of sculpture itself. Even in ancient Greece, where sculptors such as Phidias became famous, they appear to have retained much the same social status as other artisans, and perhaps not much greater financial rewards, although some signed their works. In the Middle Ages artists such as the 12th-century Gislebertus sometimes signed their work, and were sought after by different cities, especially from the Trecento onwards in Italy, with figures such as Arnolfo di Cambio, and Nicola Pisano and his son Giovanni. Goldsmiths and jewellers, dealing with precious materials and often doubling as bankers, belonged to powerful guilds and had considerable status, often holding civic office. Many sculptors also practised in other arts; Andrea del Verrocchio also painted, and Giovanni Pisano, Michelangelo, and Jacopo Sansovino were architects. Some sculptors maintained large workshops. Even in the Renaissance the physical nature of the work was perceived by Leonardo da Vinci and others as pulling down the status of sculpture in the arts, though the reputation of Michelangelo perhaps put this long-held idea to rest.

From the High Renaissance artists such as Michelangelo, Leone Leoni and Giambologna could become wealthy, and ennobled, and enter the circle of princes, after a period of sharp argument over the relative status of sculpture and painting. Much decorative sculpture on buildings remained a trade, but sculptors producing individual pieces were recognised on a level with painters. From the 18th century or earlier sculpture also attracted middle-class students, although it was slower to do so than painting. Women sculptors took longer to appear than women painters, and were less prominent until the 20th century.

==Anti-sculpture movements==
Aniconism originated with Judaism, which did not accept figurative sculpture until the 19th century, before expanding to Christianity, which initially accepted large sculptures. In Christianity and Buddhism, sculpture became very significant. Christian Eastern Orthodoxy has never accepted monumental sculpture, and Islam has consistently rejected nearly all figurative sculpture, except for very small figures in reliefs and some animal figures that fulfill a useful function, like the famous lions supporting a fountain in the Alhambra. Many forms of Protestantism also do not approve of religious sculpture. There has been much iconoclasm of sculpture for religious motives, from the Early Christians and the Beeldenstorm of the Protestant Reformation to the 2001 destruction of the Buddhas of Bamyan by the Taliban.

==History==
=== Prehistoric periods ===
====Europe====
The earliest undisputed examples of sculpture belong to the Aurignacian culture, which was located in Europe and southwest Asia and active at the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic. As well as producing some of the earliest known cave art, the people of this culture developed finely-crafted stone tools, manufacturing pendants, bracelets, ivory beads, and bone-flutes, as well as three-dimensional figurines.

The 30 cm tall Löwenmensch found in the Hohlenstein Stadel area of Germany is an anthropomorphic lion-human figure carved from woolly mammoth ivory. It has been dated to about 35–40,000BP, making it, along with the Venus of Hohle Fels, the oldest known uncontested examples of sculpture.

Much surviving prehistoric art is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female Venus figurines such as the Venus of Willendorf (24–26,000BP) found across central Europe. The Swimming Reindeer of about 13,000 years ago is one of the finest of a number of Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in the art of the Upper Paleolithic, although they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture. Two of the largest prehistoric sculptures can be found at the Tuc d&#x27;Audobert caves in France, where around 12–17,000 years ago a masterful sculptor used a spatula-like stone tool and fingers to model a pair of large bison in clay against a limestone rock.

With the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced, and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot.

====Ancient Near East====
From the ancient Near East, the over-life sized stone Urfa Man from modern Turkey comes from about 9,000 BCE, and the &#x27;Ain Ghazal Statues from around 7200 and 6500 BCE. These are from modern Jordan, made of lime plaster and reeds, and about half life-size; there are 15 statues, some with two heads side by side, and 15 busts. Small clay figures of people and animals are found at many sites across the Near East from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic, and represent the start of a more-or-less continuous tradition in the region.

=== Ancient Near East ===
The Protoliterate period in Mesopotamia, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals. The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000–2800 BCE, part human and part lioness. A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived. Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men. Many masterpieces have also been found at the Royal Cemetery at Ur (c. 2650 BCE), including the two figures of a &quot;Ram in a Thicket&quot;, the &quot;Copper Bull&quot; and a bull&#x27;s head on one of the Lyres of Ur.

From the many subsequent periods before the ascendency of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the 10th century BCE, Mesopotamian art survives in a number of forms: cylinder seals, relatively small figures in the round, and reliefs of various sizes, including cheap plaques of moulded pottery for the home, some religious and some apparently not. The Burney Relief is an unusually elaborate and relatively large (20 x 15 inches, 50 x 37 cm) terracotta plaque of a naked winged goddess with the feet of a bird of prey, and attendant owls and lions. It comes from the 18th or 19th century BCE, and may also be moulded. Stone stelae, votive offerings, or ones probably commemorating victories and showing feasts, are also found from temples, which unlike more official ones lack inscriptions that would explain them; the fragmentary Stele of the Vultures is an early example of the inscribed type, and the Assyrian Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser III a large and solid late one.

The conquest of the whole of Mesopotamia and much surrounding territory by the Assyrians created a larger and wealthier state than the region had known before, and very grandiose art in palaces and public places, no doubt partly intended to match the splendour of the art of the neighbouring Egyptian empire. Unlike earlier states, the Assyrians could use easily carved stone from northern Iraq, and did so in great quantity. The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection, including the &quot;Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal&quot; and the Lachish reliefs showing a campaign. They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures of the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete). Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.

===Ancient Egypt===
The monumental sculpture of ancient Egypt is world-famous, but refined and delicate small works exist in much greater numbers. The Egyptians used the distinctive technique of sunk relief, which is well suited to very bright sunlight. The main figures in reliefs adhere to the same figure convention as in painting, with parted legs (where not seated) and head shown from the side, but the torso from the front, and a standard set of proportions making up the figure, using 18 &quot;fists&quot; to go from the ground to the hair-line on the forehead. This appears as early as the Narmer Palette from Dynasty I. However, there as elsewhere the convention is not used for minor figures shown engaged in some activity, such as the captives and corpses. Other conventions make statues of males darker than females ones. Very conventionalized portrait statues appear from as early as Dynasty II, before 2,780 BCE, and with the exception of the art of the Amarna period of Ahkenaten, and some other periods such as Dynasty XII, the idealized features of rulers, like other Egyptian artistic conventions, changed little until after the Greek conquest.

Egyptian pharaohs were always regarded as deities, but other deities are much less common in large statues, except when they represent the pharaoh &quot;as&quot; another deity; however the other deities are frequently shown in paintings and reliefs. The famous row of four colossal statues outside the main temple at Abu Simbel each show Rameses II, a typical scheme, though here exceptionally large. Small figures of deities, or their animal personifications, are very common, and found in popular materials such as pottery. Most larger sculpture survives from Egyptian temples or tombs; by Dynasty IV (2680–2565 BCE) at the latest the idea of the Ka statue was firmly established. These were put in tombs as a resting place for the &quot;ka&quot; portion of the soul, and so we have a good number of less conventionalized statues of well-off administrators and their wives, many in wood as Egypt is one of the few places in the world where the climate allows wood to survive over millennia. The so-called reserve heads, plain hairless heads, are especially naturalistic. Early tombs also contained small models of the slaves, animals, buildings and objects such as boats necessary for the deceased to continue his lifestyle in the afterworld, and later &quot;Ushabti&quot; figures.

===Europe===

====Ancient Greece====
The first distinctive style of ancient Greek sculpture developed in the Early Bronze Age Cycladic period (3rd millennium BCE), where marble figures, usually female and small, are represented in an elegantly simplified geometrical style. Most typical is a standing pose with arms crossed in front, but other figures are shown in different poses, including a complicated figure of a harpist seated on a chair.

The subsequent Minoan and Mycenaean cultures developed sculpture further, under influence from Syria and elsewhere, but it is in the later Archaic period from around 650 BCE that the kouros developed. These are large standing statues of naked youths, found in temples and tombs, with the kore as the clothed female equivalent, with elaborately dressed hair; both have the &quot;archaic smile&quot;. They seem to have served a number of functions, perhaps sometimes representing deities and sometimes the person buried in a grave, as with the Kroisos Kouros. They are clearly influenced by Egyptian and Syrian styles, but the Greek artists were much more ready to experiment within the style.

During the 6th century Greek sculpture developed rapidly, becoming more naturalistic, and with much more active and varied figure poses in narrative scenes, though still within idealized conventions. Sculptured pediments were added to temples, including the Parthenon in Athens, where the remains of the pediment of around 520 using figures in the round were fortunately used as infill for new buildings after the Persian sack in 480 BCE, and recovered from the 1880s on in fresh unweathered condition. Other significant remains of architectural sculpture come from Paestum in Italy, Corfu, Delphi and the Temple of Aphaea in Aegina (much now in Munich). Most Greek sculpture originally included at least some colour; the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark, has done extensive research and recreation of the original colours.


=====Classical=====

There are fewer original remains from the first phase of the Classical period, often called the Severe style; free-standing statues were now mostly made in bronze, which always had value as scrap. The Severe style lasted from around 500 in reliefs, and soon after 480 in statues, to about 450. The relatively rigid poses of figures relaxed, and asymmetrical turning positions and oblique views became common, and deliberately sought. This was combined with a better understanding of anatomy and the harmonious structure of sculpted figures, and the pursuit of naturalistic representation as an aim, which had not been present before. Excavations at the Temple of Zeus, Olympia since 1829 have revealed the largest group of remains, from about 460, of which many are in the Louvre.

The &quot;High Classical&quot; period lasted only a few decades from about 450 to 400, but has had a momentous influence on art, and retains a special prestige, despite a very restricted number of original survivals. The best known works are the Parthenon Marbles, traditionally (since Plutarch) executed by a team led by the most famous ancient Greek sculptor Phidias, active from about 465–425, who was in his own day more famous for his colossal chryselephantine Statue of Zeus at Olympia (c. 432), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, his &quot;Athena Parthenos&quot; (438), the cult image of the Parthenon, and &quot;Athena Promachos&quot;, a colossal bronze figure that stood next to the Parthenon; all of these are lost but are known from many representations. He is also credited as the creator of some life-size bronze statues known only from later copies whose identification is controversial, including the &quot;Ludovisi Hermes&quot;.

The High Classical style continued to develop realism and sophistication in the human figure, and improved the depiction of drapery (clothes), using it to add to the impact of active poses. Facial expressions were usually very restrained, even in combat scenes. The composition of groups of figures in reliefs and on pediments combined complexity and harmony in a way that had a permanent influence on Western art. Relief could be very high indeed, as in the Parthenon illustration below, where most of the leg of the warrior is completely detached from the background, as were the missing parts; relief this high made sculptures more subject to damage. The Late Classical style developed the free-standing female nude statue, supposedly an innovation of Praxiteles, and developed increasingly complex and subtle poses that were interesting when viewed from a number of angles, as well as more expressive faces; both trends were to be taken much further in the Hellenistic period.

=====Hellenistic=====
The Hellenistic period is conventionally dated from the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, and ending either with the final conquest of the Greek heartlands by Rome in 146 BCE or with the final defeat of the last remaining successor-state to Alexander&#x27;s empire after the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE, which also marks the end of Republican Rome. It is thus much longer than the previous periods, and includes at least two major phases: a &quot;Pergamene&quot; style of experimentation, exuberance and some sentimentality and vulgarity, and in the 2nd century BCE a classicising return to a more austere simplicity and elegance; beyond such generalizations dating is typically very uncertain, especially when only later copies are known, as is usually the case. The initial Pergamene style was not especially associated with Pergamon, from which it takes its name, but the very wealthy kings of that state were among the first to collect and also copy Classical sculpture, and also commissioned much new work, including the famous Pergamon Altar whose sculpture is now mostly in Berlin and which exemplifies the new style, as do the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus (another of the Seven Wonders), the famous &quot;Laocoön and his Sons&quot; in the Vatican Museums, a late example, and the bronze original of &quot;The Dying Gaul&quot; (illustrated at top), which we know was part of a group actually commissioned for Pergamon in about 228 BCE, from which the Ludovisi Gaul was also a copy. The group called the Farnese Bull, possibly a 2nd-century marble original, is still larger and more complex,

Hellenistic sculpture greatly expanded the range of subjects represented, partly as a result of greater general prosperity, and the emergence of a very wealthy class who had large houses decorated with sculpture, although we know that some examples of subjects that seem best suited to the home, such as children with animals, were in fact placed in temples or other public places. For a much more popular home decoration market there were Tanagra figurines, and those from other centres where small pottery figures were produced on an industrial scale, some religious but others showing animals and elegantly dressed ladies. Sculptors became more technically skilled in representing facial expressions conveying a wide variety of emotions and the portraiture of individuals, as well representing different ages and races. The reliefs from the Mausoleum are rather atypical in that respect; most work was free-standing, and group compositions with several figures to be seen in the round, like the &quot;Laocoon&quot; and the Pergamon group celebrating victory over the Gauls became popular, having been rare before. The Barberini Faun, showing a satyr sprawled asleep, presumably after drink, is an example of the moral relaxation of the period, and the readiness to create large and expensive sculptures of subjects that fall short of the heroic.

After the conquests of Alexander Hellenistic culture was dominant in the courts of most of the Near East, and some of Central Asia, and increasingly being adopted by European elites, especially in Italy, where Greek colonies initially controlled most of the South. Hellenistic art, and artists, spread very widely, and was especially influential in the expanding Roman Republic and when it encountered Buddhism in the easternmost extensions of the Hellenistic area. The massive so-called Alexander Sarcophagus found in Sidon in modern Lebanon, was probably made there at the start of the period by expatriate Greek artists for a Hellenized Persian governor. The wealth of the period led to a greatly increased production of luxury forms of small sculpture, including engraved gems and cameos, jewellery, and gold and silverware.

====Europe after the Greeks====
=====Roman sculpture=====

Early Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring Etruscans, themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in terracotta, usually lying on top of a sarcophagus lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding Roman Republic began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the Parthian far east, official and patrician sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period. By the 2nd century BCE, &quot;most of the sculptors working at Rome&quot; were Greek, often enslaved in conquests such as that of Corinth (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.

A native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments, which very often featured portrait busts, of prosperous middle-class Romans, and portraiture is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the Tomb of the Scipios or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous bronze head supposedly of Lucius Junius Brutus is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze. Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen on coins of the Late Republic, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the basilicas of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even Londinium had a near-colossal statue of Nero, though far smaller than the 30-metre-high Colossus of Nero in Rome, now lost.

The Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in relief, culminating in the great Roman triumphal columns with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating Trajan (CE 113) and Marcus Aurelius (by 193) survive in Rome, where the (&quot;Altar of Peace&quot;, 13 BCE) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined. Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the Arch of Constantine and the base of the Column of Antoninus Pius (161), Campana reliefs were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus. All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver Warren Cup, glass Lycurgus Cup, and large cameos like the Gemma Augustea, Gonzaga Cameo and the &quot;Great Cameo of France&quot;. For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of pottery vessels and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.

After moving through a late 2nd-century &quot;baroque&quot; phase, in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace. The contrast is famously illustrated in the Arch of Constantine of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with roundels in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the &quot;Four Tetrarchs&quot; () from the new capital of Constantinople, now in Venice. Ernst Kitzinger found in both monuments the same &quot;stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity—in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition&quot;.

This revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which Christianity was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors. However, rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the consular diptych.

=====Early Medieval and Byzantine=====
The Early Christians were opposed to monumental religious sculpture, though Roman traditions continued in portrait busts and sarcophagus reliefs, as well as smaller objects such as the consular diptych. Such objects, often in valuable materials, were also the main sculptural traditions (as far as is known) of the civilizations of the Migration period, as seen in the objects found in the 6th-century burial treasure at Sutton Hoo, and the jewellery of Scythian art and the hybrid Christian and animal style productions of Insular art. Following the continuing Byzantine tradition, Carolingian art revived ivory carving in the West, often in panels for the treasure bindings of grand illuminated manuscripts, as well as crozier heads and other small fittings.

Byzantine art, though producing superb ivory reliefs and architectural decorative carving, never returned to monumental sculpture, or even much small sculpture in the round. However, in the West during the Carolingian and Ottonian periods there was the beginnings of a production of monumental statues, in courts and major churches. This gradually spread; by the late 10th and 11th century there are records of several apparently life-size sculptures in Anglo-Saxon churches, probably of precious metal around a wooden frame, like the Golden Madonna of Essen. No Anglo-Saxon example has survived, and survivals of large non-architectural sculpture from before the year 1000 are exceptionally rare. Much the finest is the Gero Cross, of 965–970, which is a crucifix, which was evidently the commonest type of sculpture; Charlemagne had set one up in the Palatine Chapel in Aachen around 800. These continued to grow in popularity, especially in Germany and Italy. The runestones of the Nordic world, the Pictish stones of Scotland and possibly the high cross reliefs of Christian Great Britain, were northern sculptural traditions that bridged the period of Christianization.

=====Romanesque=====

Beginning in roughly 1000 A.D., there was a rebirth of artistic production in all Europe, led by general economic growth in production and commerce, and the new style of Romanesque art was the first medieval style to be used in the whole of Western Europe. The new cathedrals and pilgrim&#x27;s churches were increasingly decorated with architectural stone reliefs, and new focuses for sculpture developed, such as the tympanum over church doors in the 12th century, and the inhabited capital with figures and often narrative scenes. Outstanding abbey churches with sculpture include in France Vézelay and Moissac and in Spain Silos.

Romanesque art was characterised by a very vigorous style in both sculpture and painting. The capitals of columns were never more exciting than in this period, when they were often carved with complete scenes with several figures. The large wooden crucifix was a German innovation right at the start of the period, as were free-standing statues of the enthroned Madonna, but the high relief was above all the sculptural mode of the period. Compositions usually had little depth, and needed to be flexible to squeeze themselves into the shapes of capitals, and church typanums; the tension between a tightly enclosing frame, from which the composition sometimes escapes, is a recurrent theme in Romanesque art. Figures still often varied in size in relation to their importance portraiture hardly existed.

Objects in precious materials such as ivory and metal had a very high status in the period, much more so than monumental sculpture — we know the names of more makers of these than painters, illuminators or architect-masons. Metalwork, including decoration in enamel, became very sophisticated, and many spectacular shrines made to hold relics have survived, of which the best known is the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral by Nicholas of Verdun. The bronze Gloucester candlestick and the brass font of 1108–17 now in Liège are superb examples, very different in style, of metal casting, the former highly intricate and energetic, drawing on manuscript painting, while the font shows the Mosan style at its most classical and majestic. The bronze doors, a triumphal column and other fittings at Hildesheim Cathedral, the Gniezno Doors, and the doors of the Basilica di San Zeno in Verona are other substantial survivals. The aquamanile, a container for water to wash with, appears to have been introduced to Europe in the 11th century, and often took fantastic zoomorphic forms; surviving examples are mostly in brass. Many wax impressions from impressive seals survive on charters and documents, although Romanesque coins are generally not of great aesthetic interest.

The Cloisters Cross is an unusually large ivory crucifix, with complex carving including many figures of prophets and others, which has been attributed to one of the relatively few artists whose name is known, Master Hugo, who also illuminated manuscripts. Like many pieces it was originally partly coloured. The Lewis chessmen are well-preserved examples of small ivories, of which many pieces or fragments remain from croziers, plaques, pectoral crosses and similar objects.

===== Gothic =====
The Gothic period is essentially defined by Gothic architecture, and does not entirely fit with the development of style in sculpture in either its start or finish. The facades of large churches, especially around doors, continued to have large typanums, but also rows of sculpted figures spreading around them. The statues on the Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral () show an elegant but exaggerated columnar elongation, but those on the south transept portal, from 1215 to 1220, show a more naturalistic style and increasing detachment from the wall behind, and some awareness of the classical tradition. These trends were continued in the west portal at Reims Cathedral of a few years later, where the figures are almost in the round, as became usual as Gothic spread across Europe.

In Italy Nicola Pisano (1258–1278) and his son Giovanni developed a style that is often called Proto-Renaissance, with unmistakable influence from Roman sarcophagi and sophisticated and crowded compositions, including a sympathetic handling of nudity, in relief panels on their Siena Cathedral Pulpit (1265–68), Pulpit in the Pisa Baptistery (1260), the Fontana Maggiore in Perugia, and Giovanni&#x27;s pulpit in Pistoia of 1301. Another revival of classical style is seen in the International Gothic work of Claus Sluter and his followers in Burgundy and Flanders around 1400. Late Gothic sculpture continued in the North, with a fashion for very large wooden sculpted altarpieces with increasingly virtuoso carving and large numbers agitated expressive figures; most surviving examples are in Germany, after much iconoclasm elsewhere. Tilman Riemenschneider, Veit Stoss and others continued the style well into the 16th century, gradually absorbing Italian Renaissance influences.

Life-size tomb effigies in stone or alabaster became popular for the wealthy, and grand multi-level tombs evolved, with the Scaliger Tombs of Verona so large they had to be moved outside the church. By the 15th century there was an industry exporting Nottingham alabaster altar reliefs in groups of panels over much of Europe for economical parishes who could not afford stone retables. Small carvings, for a mainly lay and often female market, became a considerable industry in Paris and some other centres. Types of ivories included small devotional polyptychs, single figures, especially of the Virgin, mirror-cases, combs, and elaborate caskets with scenes from Romances, used as engagement presents. The very wealthy collected extravagantly elaborate jewelled and enamelled metalwork, both secular and religious, like the Duc de Berry&#x27;s Holy Thorn Reliquary, until they ran short of money, when they were melted down again for cash.

====Renaissance====
Renaissance sculpture proper is often taken to begin with the famous competition for the doors of the Florence Baptistry in 1403, from which the trial models submitted by the winner, Lorenzo Ghiberti, and Filippo Brunelleschi survive. Ghiberti&#x27;s doors are still in place, but were undoubtedly eclipsed by his second pair for the other entrance, the so-called &quot;Gates of Paradise&quot;, which took him from 1425 to 1452, and are dazzlingly confident classicizing compositions with varied depths of relief allowing extensive backgrounds. The intervening years had seen Ghiberti&#x27;s early assistant Donatello develop with seminal statues including his &quot;Davids&quot; in marble (1408–09) and bronze (1440s), and his Equestrian statue of Gattamelata, as well as reliefs. A leading figure in the later period was Andrea del Verrocchio, best known for his equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice; his pupil Leonardo da Vinci designed an equine sculpture in 1482 &quot;The Horse&quot; for Milan, but only succeeded in making a clay model which was destroyed by French archers in 1499, and his other ambitious sculptural plans were never completed.

The period was marked by a great increase in patronage of sculpture by the state for public art and by the wealthy for their homes; especially in Italy, public sculpture remains a crucial element in the appearance of historic city centres. Church sculpture mostly moved inside just as outside public monuments became common. Portrait sculpture, usually in busts, became popular in Italy around 1450, with the Neapolitan Francesco Laurana specializing in young women in meditative poses, while Antonio Rossellino and others more often depicted knobbly-faced men of affairs, but also young children. The portrait medal invented by Pisanello also often depicted women; relief plaquettes were another new small form of sculpture in cast metal.

Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his &quot;David&quot;, &quot;Pietà&quot;, &quot;Moses&quot;, and pieces for the Tomb of Pope Julius II and Medici Chapel could not be ignored by subsequent sculptors. His iconic David (1504) has a &quot;contrapposto&quot; pose, borrowed from classical sculpture. It differs from previous representations of the subject in that David is depicted before his battle with Goliath and not after the giant&#x27;s defeat. Instead of being shown victorious, as Donatello and Verocchio had done, David looks tense and battle ready.

====Mannerist====
As in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the High Renaissance, which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, next to Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;David&quot;. Baccio Bandinelli took over the project of &quot;Hercules and Cacus&quot; from the master himself, but it was little more popular than it is now, and maliciously compared by Benvenuto Cellini to &quot;a sack of melons&quot;, though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the pedestal of statues for the first time. Like other works of his, and other Mannerists, it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done. Cellini&#x27;s bronze &quot;Perseus with the head of Medusa&quot; is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, but is indeed mannered compared to the &quot;David&quot;s of Michelangelo and Donatello. Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel Salt Cellar (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best. As these examples show, the period extended the range of secular subjects for large works beyond portraits, with mythological figures especially favoured; previously these had mostly been found in small works.

Small bronze figures for collector&#x27;s cabinets, often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century, also creating life-size sculptures, of which two joined the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the &quot;figura serpentinata&quot;, often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.

====Baroque and Rococo====
In Baroque sculpture, groups of figures assumed new importance, and there was a dynamic movement and energy of human forms— they spiralled around an empty central vortex, or reached outwards into the surrounding space. Baroque sculpture often had multiple ideal viewing angles, and reflected a general continuation of the Renaissance move away from the relief to sculpture created in the round, and designed to be placed in the middle of a large space—elaborate fountains such as Bernini&#x27;s Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi (Rome, 1651), or those in the Gardens of Versailles were a Baroque speciality. The Baroque style was perfectly suited to sculpture, with Gian Lorenzo Bernini the dominating figure of the age in works such as &quot;The Ecstasy of St Theresa&quot; (1647–1652). Much Baroque sculpture added extra-sculptural elements, for example, concealed lighting, or water fountains, or fused sculpture and architecture to create a transformative experience for the viewer. Artists saw themselves as in the classical tradition, but admired Hellenistic and later Roman sculpture, rather than that of the more &quot;Classical&quot; periods as they are seen today.

The Protestant Reformation brought an almost total stop to religious sculpture in much of Northern Europe, and though secular sculpture, especially for portrait busts and tomb monuments, continued, the Dutch Golden Age has no significant sculptural component outside goldsmithing. Partly in direct reaction, sculpture was as prominent in Roman Catholicism as in the late Middle Ages. Statues of rulers and the nobility became increasingly popular. In the 18th century much sculpture continued on Baroque lines—the Trevi Fountain was only completed in 1762. Rococo style was better suited to smaller works, and arguably found its ideal sculptural form in early European porcelain, and interior decorative schemes in wood or plaster such as those in French domestic interiors and Austrian and Bavarian pilgrimage churches.

====Neo-Classical====
The Neoclassical style that arrived in the late 18th century gave great emphasis to sculpture. Jean-Antoine Houdon exemplifies the penetrating portrait sculpture the style could produce, and Antonio Canova&#x27;s nudes the idealist aspect of the movement. The Neoclassical period was one of the great ages of public sculpture, though its &quot;classical&quot; prototypes were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. In sculpture, the most familiar representatives are the Italian Antonio Canova, the Englishman John Flaxman and the Dane Bertel Thorvaldsen. The European neoclassical manner also took hold in the United States, where its pinnacle occurred somewhat later and is exemplified in the sculptures of Hiram Powers.

===Asia===
==== Greco-Buddhist sculpture and Asia ====
Greco-Buddhist art is the artistic manifestation of Greco-Buddhism, a cultural syncretism between the Classical Greek culture and Buddhism, which developed over a period of close to 1000 years in Central Asia, between the conquests of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, and the Islamic conquests of the 7th century CE. Greco-Buddhist art is characterized by the strong idealistic realism of Hellenistic art and the first representations of the Buddha in human form, which have helped define the artistic (and particularly, sculptural) canon for Buddhist art throughout the Asian continent up to the present. Though dating is uncertain, it appears that strongly Hellenistic styles lingered in the East for several centuries after they had declined around the Mediterranean, as late as the 5th century CE. Some aspects of Greek art were adopted while others did not spread beyond the Greco-Buddhist area; in particular the standing figure, often with a relaxed pose and one leg flexed, and the flying cupids or victories, who became popular across Asia as apsaras. Greek foliage decoration was also influential, with Indian versions of the Corinthian capital appearing.

The origins of Greco-Buddhist art are to be found in the Hellenistic Greco-Bactrian kingdom (250–130 BCE), located in today&#x27;s Afghanistan, from which Hellenistic culture radiated into the Indian subcontinent with the establishment of the small Indo-Greek kingdom (180–10 BCE). Under the Indo-Greeks and then the Kushans, the interaction of Greek and Buddhist culture flourished in the area of Gandhara, in today&#x27;s northern Pakistan, before spreading further into India, influencing the art of Mathura, and then the Hindu art of the Gupta empire, which was to extend to the rest of South-East Asia. The influence of Greco-Buddhist art also spread northward towards Central Asia, strongly affecting the art of the Tarim Basin and the Dunhuang Caves, and ultimately the sculpted figure in China, Korea, and Japan.

====China====
Chinese ritual bronzes from the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties come from a period of over a thousand years from , and have exerted a continuing influence over Chinese art. They are cast with complex patterned and zoomorphic decoration, but avoid the human figure, unlike the huge figures only recently discovered at Sanxingdui. The spectacular Terracotta Army was assembled for the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of a unified China from 221 to 210 BCE, as a grand imperial version of the figures long placed in tombs to enable the deceased to enjoy the same lifestyle in the afterlife as when alive, replacing actual sacrifices of very early periods. Smaller figures in pottery or wood were placed in tombs for many centuries afterwards, reaching a peak of quality in Tang dynasty tomb figures. The tradition of unusually large pottery figures persisted in China, through Tang sancai tomb figures to later Buddhist statues such as the near life-size set of Yixian glazed pottery luohans and later figures for temples and tombs. These came to replace earlier equivalents in wood.

Native Chinese religions do not usually use cult images of deities, or even represent them, and large religious sculpture is nearly all Buddhist, dating mostly from the 4th to the 14th century, and initially using Greco-Buddhist models arriving via the Silk Road. Buddhism is also the context of all large portrait sculpture; in total contrast to some other areas, in medieval China even painted images of the emperor were regarded as private. Imperial tombs have spectacular avenues of approach lined with real and mythological animals on a scale matching Egypt, and smaller versions decorate temples and palaces.

Small Buddhist figures and groups were produced to a very high quality in a range of media, as was relief decoration of all sorts of objects, especially in metalwork and jade. In the earlier periods, large quantities of sculpture were cut from the living rock in pilgrimage cave-complexes, and as outside rock reliefs. These were mostly originally painted. In notable contrast to literati painters, sculptors of all sorts were regarded as artisans and very few names are recorded. From the Ming dynasty onwards, statuettes of religious and secular figures were produced in Chinese porcelain and other media, which became an important export.

====Japan====
Towards the end of the long Neolithic Jōmon period, some pottery vessels were &quot;flame-rimmed&quot; with extravagant extensions to the rim that can only be called sculptural, and very stylized pottery dogū figures were produced, many with the characteristic &quot;snow-goggle&quot; eyes. During the Kofun period of the 3rd to 6th century CE, haniwa terracotta figures of humans and animals in a simplistic style were erected outside important tombs. The arrival of Buddhism in the 6th century brought with it sophisticated traditions in sculpture, Chinese styles mediated via Korea. The 7th-century Hōryū-ji and its contents have survived more intact than any East Asian Buddhist temple of its date, with works including a &quot;Shaka Trinity&quot; of 623 in bronze, showing the historical Buddha flanked by two bodhisattvas and also the Guardian Kings of the Four Directions.

Jōchō is said to be one of the greatest Buddhist sculptors not only in Heian period but also in the history of Buddhist statues in Japan. Jōchō redefined the body shape of Buddha statues by perfecting the technique of &quot;yosegi zukuri&quot; (寄木造り) which is a combination of several woods. The peaceful expression and graceful figure of the Buddha statue that he made completed a Japanese style of sculpture of Buddha statues called &quot;Jōchō yō&quot; (Jōchō style, 定朝様) and determined the style of Japanese Buddhist statues of the later period. His achievement dramatically raised the social status of &quot;busshi&quot; (Buddhist sculptor) in Japan.

In the Kamakura period, the Minamoto clan established the Kamakura shogunate and the samurai class virtually ruled Japan for the first time. Jocho&#x27;s successors, sculptors of the Kei school of Buddhist statues, created realistic and dynamic statues to suit the tastes of samurai, and Japanese Buddhist sculpture reached its peak. Unkei, Kaikei, and Tankei were famous, and they made many new Buddha statues at many temples such as Kofuku-ji, where many Buddha statues had been lost in wars and fires.

Almost all subsequent significant large sculpture in Japan was Buddhist, with some Shinto equivalents, and after Buddhism declined in Japan in the 15th century, monumental sculpture became largely architectural decoration and less significant. However sculptural work in the decorative arts was developed to a remarkable level of technical achievement and refinement in small objects such as inro and netsuke in many materials, and metal &quot;&quot; or Japanese sword mountings. In the 19th century there were export industries of small bronze sculptures of extreme virtuosity, ivory and porcelain figurines, and other types of small sculpture, increasingly emphasizing technical accomplishment.

==== Indian subcontinent ====
The first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley civilization (3300–1700 BCE), found in sites at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in modern-day Pakistan. These include the famous small bronze female dancer and the so-called &quot;Priest-king&quot;. However, such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted. After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) from Daimabad. Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin, relative to other cultures, and the development of Indian civilization, relatively late, with the reign of Asoka from 270 to 232 BCE, and the Pillars of Ashoka he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive. Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all Sanchi; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood that also embraced Hinduism.

The pink sandstone Hindu, Jain and Buddhist sculptures of Mathura from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture. The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the Gupta Empire (–550) which remains a &quot;classical&quot; period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier Ellora Caves, though the Elephanta Caves are probably slightly later. Later large-scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and yakshi often have sensuously curving poses. Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief. The celebrated bronzes of the Chola dynasty (–1250) from south India, many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of Shiva as Nataraja, with the massive granite carvings of Mahabalipuram dating from the previous Pallava dynasty.

====South-East Asia====

The sculpture of the region tends to be characterised by a high degree of ornamentation, as seen in the great monuments of Hindu and Buddhist Khmer sculpture (9th to 13th centuries) at Angkor Wat and elsewhere, the enormous 9th-century Buddhist complex at Borobudur in Java, and the Hindu monuments of Bali. Both of these include many reliefs as well as figures in the round; Borobudur has 2,672 relief panels, 504 Buddha statues, many semi-concealed in openwork stupas, and many large guardian figures.

In Thailand and Laos, sculpture was mainly of Buddha images, often gilded, both large for temples and monasteries, and small figurines for private homes. Traditional sculpture in Myanmar emerged before the Bagan period. As elsewhere in the region, most of the wood sculptures of the Bagan and Ava periods have been lost.

Traditional Anitist sculptures from the Philippines are dominated by Anitist designs mirroring the medium used and the culture involved, while being highlighted by the environments where such sculptures are usually placed on. Christian and Islamic sculptures from the Philippines have different motifs compared to other Christian and Islamic sculptures elsewhere. In later periods Chinese influence predominated in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and more wooden sculpture survives from across the region.

===Islam===

Islam is famously aniconic, so the vast majority of sculpture is arabesque decoration in relief or openwork, based on vegetable motifs, but tending to geometrical abstract forms. In the very early Mshatta Facade (740s), now mostly in Berlin, there are animals within the dense arabesques in high relief, and figures of animals and men in mostly low relief are found in conjunction with decoration on many later pieces in various materials, including metalwork, ivory and ceramics.

Figures of animals in the round were often acceptable for works used in private contexts if the object was clearly practical, so medieval Islamic art contains many metal animals that are aquamaniles, incense burners or supporters for fountains, as in the stone lions supporting the famous one in the Alhambra, culminating in the largest medieval Islamic animal figure known, the Pisa Griffin. In the same way, luxury hardstone carvings such as dagger hilts and cups may be formed as animals, especially in Mughal art. The degree of acceptability of such relaxations of strict Islamic rules varies between periods and regions, with Islamic Spain, Persia and India often leading relaxation, and is typically highest in courtly contexts.

===Africa===
Historically, with the exception of some monumental Egyptian sculpture, most African sculpture was created in wood and other organic materials that have not survived from earlier than a few centuries ago; older pottery figures are found from a number of areas. Masks are important elements in the art of many peoples, along with human figures, often highly stylized. There is a vast variety of styles, often varying within the same context of origin depending on the use of the object, but wide regional trends are apparent; sculpture is most common among &quot;groups of settled cultivators in the areas drained by the Niger and Congo rivers&quot; in West Africa. Direct images of deities are relatively infrequent, but masks in particular are or were often made for religious ceremonies; today many are made for tourists as &quot;airport art&quot;. African masks were an influence on European Modernist art, which was inspired by their lack of concern for naturalistic depiction.

The Nubian Kingdom of Kush in modern Sudan was in close and often hostile contact with Egypt, and produced monumental sculpture mostly derivative of styles to the north. In West Africa, the earliest known sculptures are from the Nok culture which thrived between 500 BCE and 500 CE in modern Nigeria, with clay figures typically with elongated bodies and angular shapes. Later West African cultures developed bronze casting for reliefs to decorate palaces like the famous Benin Bronzes, and very fine naturalistic royal heads from around the Yoruba town of Ife in terracotta and metal from the 12th–14th centuries. Akan goldweights are a form of small metal sculptures produced over the period 1400–1900, some apparently representing proverbs and so with a narrative element rare in African sculpture, and royal regalia included impressive gold sculptured elements.

Many West African figures are used in religious rituals and are often coated with materials placed on them for ceremonial offerings. The Mande-speaking peoples of the same region make pieces of wood with broad, flat surfaces and arms and legs are shaped like cylinders. In Central Africa, however, the main distinguishing characteristics include heart-shaped faces that are curved inward and display patterns of circles and dots.

Populations in the African Great Lakes are not known for their sculpture. However, one style from the region is pole sculptures, carved in human shapes and decorated with geometric forms, while the tops are carved with figures of animals, people, and various objects. These poles are, then, placed next to graves and are associated with death and the ancestral world. The culture known from Great Zimbabwe left more impressive buildings than sculpture but the eight soapstone Zimbabwe Birds appear to have had a special significance and were mounted on monoliths. Modern Zimbabwean sculptors in soapstone have achieved considerable international success. Southern Africa&#x27;s oldest known clay figures date from 400 to 600 CE and have cylindrical heads with a mixture of human and animal features.

====Ethiopia and Eritrea====

The creation of sculptures in Ethiopia and Eritrea can be traced back to its ancient past with the kingdoms of Dʿmt and Aksum. Christian art was established in Ethiopia with the conversion from paganism to Christianity in the 4th century CE, during the reign of king Ezana of Axum. Christian imagery decorated churches during the Asksumite period and later eras. For instance, at Lalibela, life-size saints were carved into the Church of Bet Golgotha; by tradition these were made during the reign of the Zagwe ruler Gebre Mesqel Lalibela in the 12th century, but they were more likely crafted in the 15th century during the Solomonic dynasty. However, the Church of Saint George, Lalibela, one of several examples of rock cut architecture at Lalibela containing intricate carvings, was built in the 10th–13th centuries as proven by archaeology.

====Sudan====

In ancient Sudan, the development of sculpture stretches from the simple pottery of the Kerma culture beginning around 2500 BCE to the monumental statuary and architecture of the Kingdom of Kush, its last phase—the Meroitic period—ending around 350 CE (with its conquest by Ethiopia&#x27;s Aksum). Beyond pottery items, the Kerma culture also made furniture that contained sculptures, such as gold cattle hoofs as the legs of beds. Sculpture during the Kingdom of Kush included full-sized statues (especially of kings and queens), smaller figurines (most commonly depicting royal servants), and reliefs in stone, which were influenced by the contemporary ancient Egyptian sculptural tradition.

===The Americas===

Sculpture in present-day Latin America developed in two separate and distinct areas, Mesoamerica in the north and Peru in the south. In both areas, sculpture was initially of stone, and later of terracotta and metal as the civilizations in these areas became more technologically proficient. The Mesoamerican region produced more monumental sculpture, from the massive block-like works of the Olmec and Toltec cultures, to the superb low reliefs that characterize the Mayan and Aztec cultures. In the Andean region, sculptures were typically small, but often show superb skill.

====Pre-Columbian====
====North America====

In North America, wood was sculpted for totem poles, masks, utensils, War canoes and a variety of other uses, with distinct variation between different cultures and regions. The most developed styles are those of the Pacific Northwest Coast, where a group of elaborate and highly stylized formal styles developed forming the basis of a tradition that continues today. In addition to the famous totem poles, painted and carved house fronts were complemented by carved posts inside and out, as well as mortuary figures and other items. Among the Inuit of the far north, traditional carving styles in ivory and soapstone are still continued.

The arrival of European Catholic culture readily adapted local skills to the prevailing Baroque style, producing enormously elaborate retablos and other mostly church sculptures in a variety of hybrid styles. The most famous of such examples in Canada is the altar area of the Notre Dame Basilica in Montreal, Quebec, which was carved by peasant &quot;habitant&quot; labourers. Later, artists trained in the Western academic tradition followed European styles until in the late 19th century they began to draw again on indigenous influences, notably in the Mexican baroque grotesque style known as Churrigueresque. Aboriginal peoples also adapted church sculpture in variations on Carpenter Gothic; one famous example is the &quot;Church of the Holy Cross&quot; in Skookumchuck Hot Springs, British Columbia.

The history of sculpture in the United States after Europeans&#x27; arrival reflects the country&#x27;s 18th-century foundation in Roman republican civic values and Protestant Christianity. Compared to areas colonized by the Spanish, sculpture got off to an extremely slow start in the British colonies, with next to no place in churches, and was only given impetus by the need to assert nationality after independence. American sculpture of the mid- to late-19th century was often classical, often romantic, but showed a bent for a dramatic, narrative, almost journalistic realism. Public buildings during the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century often provided an architectural setting for sculpture, especially in relief. By the 1930s the International Style of architecture and design and art deco characterized by the work of Paul Manship and Lee Lawrie and others became popular. By the 1950s, traditional sculpture education would almost be completely replaced by a Bauhaus-influenced concern for abstract design. Minimalist sculpture replaced the figure in public settings and architects almost completely stopped using sculpture in or on their designs. Modern sculptors (21st century) use both classical and abstract inspired designs. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a swing back toward figurative public sculpture; by 2000, many of the new public pieces in the United States were figurative in design.

==Moving toward modern art==
=== 19th–early 20th century, early Modernism and continuing realism ===
Modern classicism contrasted in many ways with the classical sculpture of the 19th century which was characterized by commitments to naturalism (Antoine-Louis Barye)—the melodramatic (François Rude) sentimentality (Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux)—or a kind of stately grandiosity (Lord Leighton). Several different directions in the classical tradition were taken as the century turned, but the study of the live model and the post-Renaissance tradition was still fundamental to them.
Auguste Rodin was the most renowned European sculptor of the early 20th century. He is often considered a sculptural Impressionist, as are his students including Camille Claudel, and Hugo Rheinhold, attempting to model of a fleeting moment of ordinary life.
Modern classicism showed a lesser interest in naturalism and a greater interest in formal stylization. Greater attention was paid to the rhythms of volumes and spaces—as well as greater attention to the contrasting qualities of surface (open, closed, planar, broken etc.) while less attention was paid to story-telling and convincing details of anatomy or costume. Greater attention was given to psychological effect than to physical realism, and influences from earlier styles worldwide were used.

Early masters of modern classicism included: Aristide Maillol, Alexander Matveyev, Joseph Bernard, Antoine Bourdelle, Georg Kolbe, Libero Andreotti, Gustav Vigeland, Jan Stursa, Constantin Brâncuși. As the century progressed, modern classicism was adopted as the national style of the two great European totalitarian empires: Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, who co-opted the work of earlier artists such as Kolbe and Wilhelm Lehmbruck in Germany and Matveyev in Russia. Over the 70 years of the USSR, new generations of sculptors were trained and chosen within their system, and a distinct style, socialist realism, developed, that returned to the 19th century&#x27;s emphasis on melodrama and naturalism.

Classical training was rooted out of art education in Western Europe (and the Americas) by 1970 and the classical variants of the 20th century were marginalized in the history of modernism. But classicism continued as the foundation of art education in the Soviet academies until 1990, providing a foundation for expressive figurative art throughout eastern Europe and parts of the Middle East. By 2000, the European classical tradition retains a wide appeal to the public but awaits an educational tradition to revive its contemporary development.

Some of the modern classical became either more decorative/art deco (Paul Manship, Jose de Creeft, Carl Milles) or more abstractly stylized or more expressive (and Gothic) (Anton Hanak, Wilhelm Lehmbruck, Ernst Barlach, Arturo Martini)—or turned more to the Renaissance (Giacomo Manzù, Venanzo Crocetti) or stayed the same (Charles Despiau, Marcel Gimond).

==Modernism==


Modernist sculpture movements include Cubism, Geometric abstraction, De Stijl, Suprematism, Constructivism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Formalism, Abstract expressionism, Pop-Art, Minimalism, Land art, and Installation art among others.

In the beginning of the 20th century, Pablo Picasso revolutionized the art of sculpture when he began creating his constructions fashioned by combining disparate objects and materials into one constructed piece of sculpture; the sculptural equivalent of the collage in two-dimensional art. The advent of Surrealism led to things occasionally being described as &quot;sculpture&quot; that would not have been so previously, such as &quot;involuntary sculpture&quot; in several senses, including coulage. In later years Picasso became a prolific potter, leading, with interest in historic pottery from around the world, to a revival of ceramic art, with figures such as George E. Ohr and subsequently Peter Voulkos, Kenneth Price, and Robert Arneson. Marcel Duchamp originated the use of the &quot;found object&quot; (French: objet trouvé) or &quot;readymade&quot; with pieces such as &quot;Fountain&quot; (1917).

Similarly, the work of Constantin Brâncuși at the beginning of the century paved the way for later abstract sculpture. In revolt against the naturalism of Rodin and his late-19th-century contemporaries, Brâncuși distilled subjects down to their essences as illustrated by the elegantly refined forms of his &quot;Bird in Space&quot; series (1924).

Brâncuși&#x27;s impact, with his vocabulary of reduction and abstraction, is seen throughout the 1930s and 1940s, and exemplified by artists such as Gaston Lachaise, Sir Jacob Epstein, Henry Moore, Alberto Giacometti, Joan Miró, Julio González, Pablo Serrano, Jacques Lipchitz and by the 1940s abstract sculpture was impacted and expanded by Alexander Calder, Len Lye, Jean Tinguely, and Frederick Kiesler who were pioneers of Kinetic art.

Modernist sculptors largely missed out on the huge boom in public art resulting from the demand for war memorials for the two World Wars, but from the 1950s the public and commissioning bodies became more comfortable with Modernist sculpture and large public commissions both abstract and figurative became common. Picasso was commissioned to make a maquette for a huge -high public sculpture, the so-called &quot;Chicago Picasso&quot; (1967). His design was ambiguous and somewhat controversial, and what the figure represents is not clear; it could be a bird, a horse, a woman or a totally abstract shape.

During the late 1950s and the 1960s abstract sculptors began experimenting with a wide array of new materials and different approaches to creating their work. Surrealist imagery, anthropomorphic abstraction, new materials and combinations of new energy sources and varied surfaces and objects became characteristic of much new modernist sculpture. Collaborative projects with landscape designers, architects, and landscape architects expanded the outdoor site and contextual integration. Artists such as Isamu Noguchi, David Smith, Alexander Calder, Jean Tinguely, Richard Lippold, George Rickey, Louise Bourgeois, Philip Pavia and Louise Nevelson came to characterize the look of modern sculpture.

By the 1960s Abstract expressionism, Geometric abstraction and Minimalism, which reduces sculpture to its most essential and fundamental features, predominated. Some works of the period are: the Cubi works of David Smith, and the welded steel works of Sir Anthony Caro, as well as welded sculpture by a large variety of sculptors, the large-scale work of John Chamberlain, and environmental installation scale works by Mark di Suvero. Other Minimalists include Tony Smith, Donald Judd, Robert Morris, Anne Truitt, Giacomo Benevelli, Arnaldo Pomodoro, Richard Serra, Dan Flavin, Carl Andre, and John Safer who added motion and monumentality to the theme of purity of line.

During the 1960s and 1970s figurative sculpture by modernist artists in stylized forms was made by artists such as Leonard Baskin, Ernest Trova, George Segal, Marisol Escobar, Paul Thek, Robert Graham in a classic articulated style, and Fernando Botero bringing his painting&#x27;s &#x27;oversized figures&#x27; into monumental sculptures.

===Contemporary movements===
Site specific and environmental art works are represented by artists: Andy Goldsworthy, Walter De Maria, Richard Long, Richard Serra, Robert Irwin, George Rickey and Christo and Jeanne-Claude led contemporary abstract sculpture in new directions. Artists created environmental sculpture on expansive sites in the &#x27;land art in the American West&#x27; group of projects. These land art or &#x27;earth art&#x27; environmental scale sculpture works exemplified by artists such as Robert Smithson, Michael Heizer, James Turrell (Roden Crater). Eva Hesse, Sol LeWitt, Jackie Winsor, Keith Sonnier, Bruce Nauman and Dennis Oppenheim among others were pioneers of Postminimalist sculpture.

Also during the 1960s and 1970s artists as diverse as Eduardo Paolozzi, Chryssa, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal, Edward Kienholz, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, Duane Hanson, and John DeAndrea explored abstraction, imagery and figuration through video art, environment, light sculpture, and installation art in new ways.

Conceptual art is art in which the concept(s) or idea(s) involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns. Works include &quot;One and Three Chairs&quot;, 1965, is by Joseph Kosuth, and &quot;An Oak Tree&quot; by Michael Craig-Martin, and those of Joseph Beuys, James Turrell and Jacek Tylicki.

===Minimalism===
====Postminimalism====
====Contemporary genres====

Some modern sculpture forms are now practiced outdoors, as environmental art and environmental sculpture, often in full view of spectators. Light sculpture, street art sculpture and site-specific art also often make use of the environment. Ice sculpture is a form of ephemeral sculpture that uses ice as the raw material. It is popular in China, Japan, Canada, Sweden, and Russia. Ice sculptures feature decoratively in some cuisines, especially in Asia. Kinetic sculptures are sculptures that are designed to move, which include mobiles. Snow sculptures are usually carved out of a single block of snow about on each side and weighing about 20–30 tons. The snow is densely packed into a form after having been produced by artificial means or collected from the ground after a snowfall. Sound sculptures take the form of indoor sound installations, outdoor installations such as aeolian harps, automatons, or be more or less near conventional musical instruments. Sound sculpture is often site-specific. Art toys have become another format for contemporary artists since the late 1990s, such as those produced by Takashi Murakami and Kid Robot, designed by Michael Lau, or hand-made by Michael Leavitt (artist).

==Conservation==

Sculptures are sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity and exposure to light and ultraviolet light. Acid rain can also cause damage to certain building materials and historical monuments. This results when sulfuric acid in the rain chemically reacts with the calcium compounds in the stones (limestone, sandstone, marble and granite) to create gypsum, which then flakes off. Severe air pollution also causes damage to historical monuments.

At any time many contemporary sculptures have usually been on display in public places; theft was not a problem as pieces were instantly recognisable. In the early 21st century the value of metal rose to such an extent that theft of massive bronze sculpture for the value of the metal became a problem; sculpture worth millions being stolen and melted down for the relatively low value of the metal, a tiny fraction of the value of the artwork.

<text>Slashdot (sometimes abbreviated as /.) is a social news website that originally billed itself as &quot;News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters&quot;. It features news stories on science, technology, and politics that are submitted and evaluated by site users and editors. Each story has a comments section where users can add online comments. Slashdot also offers a business software comparison directory with over 100,000 software products.

The website was founded in 1997 by Hope College students Rob Malda, also known as &quot;CmdrTaco&quot;, and classmate Jeff Bates, also known as &quot;Hemos&quot;. In 2012, they sold it to DHI Group, Inc. (i.e., Dice Holdings International, which created the Dice.com website for tech job seekers). In January 2016, BIZX acquired both slashdot.org and SourceForge. In December 2019, BIZX rebranded to Slashdot Media.

Summaries of stories and links to news articles are submitted by Slashdot&#x27;s own users, and each story becomes the topic of a threaded discussion among users. Discussion is moderated by a user-based moderation system. Randomly selected moderators are assigned points (typically 5) which they can use to rate a comment. Moderation applies either &quot;−1&quot; or &quot;+1&quot; to the current rating, based on whether the comment is perceived as either &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;offtopic&quot;, &quot;insightful&quot;, &quot;redundant&quot;, &quot;interesting&quot;, or &quot;troll&quot; (among others).

The site&#x27;s comment and moderation system is administered by its own open source content management system, Slash, which is available under the GNU General Public License. In 2012, &quot;Slashdot&quot; had around 3.7 million unique visitors per month and received over 5300 comments per day. The site has won more than 20 awards, including People&#x27;s Voice Awards in 2000 for &quot;Best Community Site&quot; and &quot;Best News Site&quot;. At its peak use, a news story posted to the site with a link could overwhelm some smaller or independent sites. This phenomenon was known as the &quot;Slashdot effect&quot;.

==History==

===1990s===
Slashdot was preceded by Rob Malda&#x27;s personal website &quot;Chips &amp; Dips&quot;, which launched in October 1997, featured a single &quot;rant&quot; each day about something that interested its author – typically something to do with Linux or open source software. At the time, Malda was a student at Hope College in Holland, Michigan, majoring in computer science. The site became &quot;Slashdot&quot; in September 1997 under the slogan &quot;News for Nerds. Stuff that Matters&quot;, and quickly became a hotspot on the Internet for news and information of interest to computer geeks.

The name &quot;Slashdot&quot; came from a somewhat &quot;obnoxious parody of a URL&quot; – when Malda registered the domain, he desired to make a name that was &quot;silly and unpronounceable&quot; – try pronouncing out, &#x27;h-t-t-p-colon-slash-slash-slashdot-dot-org. By June 1998, the site was seeing as many as 100,000 page views per day and advertisers began to take notice. By December 1998, Slashdot had net revenues of $18,000, yet its Internet profile was higher and revenues were expected to increase.

On June 29, 1999, the site was sold to Linux megasite Andover.net for $1.5 million in cash and $7 million in Andover stock at the Initial public offering (IPO) price. Part of the deal was contingent upon the continued employment of Malda and Bates and on the achievement of certain &quot;milestones&quot;. With the acquisition of Slashdot, Andover.net could now advertise itself as &quot;the leading Linux/Open Source destination on the Internet&quot;. Andover.net merged with VA Linux on February 3, 2000, changed its name to SourceForge, Inc. on May 24, 2007, and then became Geeknet, Inc. on November 4, 2009.

===2000s===
Slashdot&#x27;s 10,000th article was posted after two and a half years on February 24, 2000, and the 100,000th article was posted on December 11, 2009, after 12 years online. During the first 12 years, the most active story with the most responses posted was the post-2004 US Presidential Election article &quot;Kerry Concedes Election To Bush&quot; with 5,687 posts. This followed the creation of a new article section, &quot;politics.slashdot.org&quot;, created at the start of the 2004 election on September 7, 2004. Many of the most popular stories are political, with &quot;Strike on Iraq&quot; (March 19, 2003) the second-most-active article and &quot;Barack Obama Wins US Presidency&quot; (November 5, 2008) the third-most-active. The rest of the 10 most active articles are an article announcing the 2005 London bombings, and several articles about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s capture, and &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;. Articles about Microsoft and its Windows Operating System are popular. A thread posted in 2002 titled &quot;What&#x27;s Keeping You On Windows?&quot; was the 10th-most-active story, and an article about Windows 2000/NT4 source-code leaks the most visited article with more than 680,000 hits. Some controversy erupted on March 9, 2001, after an anonymous user posted the full text of Scientology&#x27;s &quot;Operating Thetan Level Three&quot; (OT III) document in a comment attached to a Slashdot article. The Church of Scientology demanded that Slashdot remove the document under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. A week later, in a long article, Slashdot editors explained their decision to remove the page while providing links and information on how to get the document from other sources.

Slashdot Japan was launched on May 28, 2001 (although the first article was published April 5, 2001) and is an official offshoot of the US-based Web site. the site was owned by OSDN-Japan, Inc., and carried some of the US-based Slashdot articles as well as localized stories. An external site, &quot;New Media Services&quot;, has reported the importance of Online Moderation last December 1, 2011. On Valentine&#x27;s Day 2002, founder Rob Malda proposed to longtime girlfriend Kathleen Fent using the front page of Slashdot. They were married on December 8, 2002, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Slashdot implemented a paid subscription service on March 1, 2002. Slashdot&#x27;s subscription model works by allowing users to pay a small fee to be able to view pages without banner ads, starting at a rate of $5 per 1,000 page views – non-subscribers may still view articles and respond to comments, with banner ads in place. On March 6, 2003, subscribers were given the ability to see articles 10 to 20 minutes before they are released to the public. Slashdot altered its threaded discussion forum display software to explicitly show domains for links in articles, as &quot;users made a sport out of tricking unsuspecting readers into visiting [Goatse.cx].&quot;

In observance of April Fools&#x27; Day in 2006, Slashdot temporarily changed its signature teal color theme to a warm palette of bubblegum pink and changed its masthead from the usual, &quot;News for Nerds&quot; motto to, &quot;OMG!!! Ponies!!!&quot; Editors joked that this was done to increase female readership. In another supposed April Fools&#x27; Day joke, User Achievement tags were introduced on April 1, 2009. This system allowed users to be tagged with various achievements, such as &quot;The Tagger&quot; for tagging a story or &quot;Member of the {1,2,3,4,5} Digit UID Club&quot; for having a Slashdot UID consisting of a certain number of digits. While it was posted on April Fools&#x27; Day to allow for certain joke achievements, the system is real. Slashdot unveiled its newly redesigned site on June 4, 2006, following a CSS Redesign Competition. The winner of the competition was Alex Bendiken, who built on the initial CSS framework of the site. The new site looks similar to the old one but is more polished with more rounded curves, collapsible menus, and updated fonts. On November 9 that same year, Malda wrote that Slashdot attained 16,777,215 (or 224 − 1) comments, which broke the database for three hours until the administrators fixed the problem.

===2010s===
On July 11, 2010, SlashDot was the first major media platform where Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was publicized. On January 25, 2011, the site launched its third major redesign in its 13.5-year history, which gutted the HTML and CSS, and updated the graphics. On August 25, 2011, Malda resigned as Editor-in-Chief with immediate effect. He did not mention any plans for the future, other than spending more time with his family, catching up on some reading, and possibly writing a book. His final farewell message received over 1,400 comments within 24 hours on the site. On December 7, 2011, Slashdot announced that it would start to push what the company described as &quot;sponsored&quot; Ask Slashdot questions. On March 28, 2012, Slashdot launched Slashdot TV. Two months later, in May 2012, Slashdot launched SlashBI, SlashCloud, and SlashDataCenter, three websites dedicated to original journalistic content. The websites proved controversial, with longtime Slashdot users commenting that the original content ran counter to the website&#x27;s longtime focus on user-generated submissions. Nick Kolakowski, the editor of the three websites, told The Next Web that the websites were &quot;meant to complement Slashdot with an added layer of insight into a very specific area of technology, without interfering with Slashdot&#x27;s longtime focus on tech-community interaction and discussion.&quot; Despite the debate, articles published on SlashCloud and SlashBI attracted attention from io9, NPR, Nieman Lab, Vanity Fair, and other publications.

In September 2012, Slashdot, SourceForge, and Freecode were acquired by online job site Dice.com for $20 million, and incorporated into a subsidiary known as Slashdot Media. While initially stating that there were no plans for major changes to Slashdot, in October 2013, Slashdot launched a &quot;beta&quot; for a significant redesign of the site, which featured a simpler appearance and commenting system. While initially an opt-in beta, the site automatically began migrating selected users to the new design in February 2014; the rollout led to a negative response from many longtime users, upset by the added visual complexity, and the removal of features, such as comment viewing, that distinguished Slashdot from other news sites. An organized boycott of the site was held from February 10 to 17, 2014. The &quot;beta&quot; site was eventually shelved. In July 2015, Dice announced that it planned to sell Slashdot and SourceForge; in particular, the company stated in a filing that it was unable to &quot;successfully [leverage] the Slashdot user base to further Dice&#x27;s digital recruitment business&quot;.

On January 27, 2016, the two sites were sold to the San Diego–based BizX, LLC for an undisclosed amount.

==Administration==

===Team===

It was run by its founder, Rob &quot;CmdrTaco&quot; Malda, from 1998 until 2011. He shared editorial responsibilities with several other editors including Timothy Lord, Patrick &quot;Scuttlemonkey&quot; McGarry, Jeff &quot;Soulskill&quot; Boehm, Rob &quot;Samzenpus&quot; Rozeboom, and Keith Dawson. Jonathan &quot;cowboyneal&quot; Pater is another popular editor of Slashdot, who came to work for Slashdot as a programmer and systems administrator. His online nickname (handle), CowboyNeal, is inspired by a Grateful Dead tribute to Neal Cassady in their song, &quot;That&#x27;s It for the Other One&quot;. He is best known as the target of the usual comic poll option, a tradition started by Chris DiBona.

===Software===

Slashdot runs on Slash, a content management system available under the GNU General Public License. Early versions of Slash were written by Rob Malda in the spring of 1998. After Andover.net bought Slashdot in June 1999, Several programmers were hired to structure the code and render it scalable, as its users had increased from a few hundred to tens of thousands. This work was done by Brian Aker, Patrick Galbraith, Chris Nandor and others, resulting in version 2 of the software, released in 2001. Slash remains Free software and anyone can contribute to development.

===Peer moderation===
Slashdot&#x27;s editors are primarily responsible for selecting and editing the primary stories that are posted daily by submitters. The editors provide a one-paragraph summary for each story and a link to an external website where the story originated. Each story becomes the topic for a threaded discussion among the site&#x27;s users. A user-based moderation system is employed to filter out abusive or offensive comments. Every comment is initially given a score of &quot;−1&quot; to &quot;+2&quot;, with a default score of &quot;+1&quot; for registered users, &quot;0&quot; for anonymous users (Anonymous Coward), &quot;+2&quot; for users with high &quot;karma&quot;, or &quot;−1&quot; for users with low &quot;karma&quot;. As moderators read comments attached to articles, they click to moderate the comment, either up (&quot;+1&quot;) or down (&quot;−1&quot;). Moderators may choose to attach a particular descriptor to the comments as well, such as &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;offtopic&quot;, &quot;flamebait&quot;, &quot;troll&quot;, &quot;redundant&quot;, &quot;insightful&quot;, &quot;interesting&quot;, &quot;informative&quot;, &quot;funny&quot;, &quot;overrated&quot;, or &quot;underrated&quot;, with each corresponding to a &quot;−1&quot; or &quot;+1&quot; rating. So a comment may be seen to have a rating of &quot;+1 insightful&quot; or &quot;−1 troll&quot;. Comments are very rarely deleted, even if they contain hateful remarks.

Starting in August 2019 anonymous comments and postings have been disabled.

Moderation points add to a user&#x27;s rating, which is known as &quot;karma&quot; on Slashdot. Users with high &quot;karma&quot; are eligible to become moderators themselves. The system does not promote regular users as &quot;moderators&quot; and instead assigns five moderation points at a time to users based on the number of comments they have entered in the system – once a user&#x27;s moderation points are used up, they can no longer moderate articles (though they can be assigned more moderation points at a later date). Paid staff editors have an unlimited number of moderation points. A given comment can have any integer score from &quot;−1&quot; to &quot;+5&quot;, and registered users of Slashdot can set a personal threshold so that no comments with a lesser score are displayed. For instance, a user reading Slashdot at level &quot;+5&quot; will only see the highest rated comments, while a user reading at level &quot;−1&quot; will see a more &quot;unfiltered, anarchic version&quot;. A meta-moderation system was implemented on September 7, 1999, to moderate the moderators and help contain abuses in the moderation system. Meta-moderators are presented with a set of moderations that they may rate as either &quot;fair&quot; or &quot;unfair&quot;. For each moderation, the meta-moderator sees the original comment and the reason assigned by the moderator (e.g. &quot;troll&quot;, &quot;funny&quot;), and the meta-moderator can click to see the context of comments surrounding the one that was moderated.

==Features==
===Tags===
Slashdot uses a system of &quot;tags&quot; where users can categorize a story to group them together and sorting them. Tags are written in all lowercase, with no spaces, and limited to 64 characters. For example, articles could be tagged as being about &quot;security&quot; or &quot;mozilla&quot;. Some articles are tagged with longer tags, such as &quot;whatcouldpossiblygowrong&quot; (expressing the perception of catastrophic risk), &quot;suddenoutbreakofcommonsense&quot; (used when the community feels that the subject has finally figured out something obvious), &quot;correlationnotcausation&quot; (used when scientific articles lack direct evidence; see correlation does not imply causation), or &quot;getyourasstomars&quot; (commonly seen in articles about Mars or space exploration).

Slashdot has discontinued the use of tags, with all tags now saying &#x27;story.&#x27;

==Culture==

As an online community with primarily user-generated content, many in-jokes and internet memes have developed over the course of the site&#x27;s history. A popular meme (based on an unscientific Slashdot user poll) is, &quot;In Soviet Russia, &quot;noun&quot; &quot;verb&quot; you!&quot; This type of joke has its roots in the 1960s or earlier, and is known as a &quot;Russian reversal&quot;. Other popular memes usually pertain to computing or technology, such as &quot;Imagine a Beowulf cluster of these&quot;, &quot;But does it run Linux?&quot;, or &quot;Netcraft now confirms: BSD (or some other software package or item) is dying.&quot; Users will also typically refer to articles referring to data storage and data capacity by inquiring how much it is in units of Libraries of Congress. Sometimes bandwidth speeds are referred to in units of Libraries of Congress per second. When numbers are quoted, people will comment that the number happens to be the &quot;combination to their luggage&quot; (a reference to the Mel Brooks film Spaceballs) and express false anger at the person who revealed it.

Slashdotters often use the abbreviation TFA which stands for &quot;The fucking article&quot; or (&quot;Read the fucking article&quot;), which itself is derived from the abbreviation RTFM. Usage of this abbreviation often exposes comments from posters who have not read the article linked to in the main story. Slashdotters typically like to mock then United States Senator Ted Stevens&#x27; 2006 description of the Internet as a &quot;series of tubes&quot; or former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer&#x27;s chair-throwing incident from 2005. Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a popular target of jokes by Slashdotters, and all stories about Microsoft were once identified with a graphic of Gates looking like a Borg from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Many Slashdotters have long talked about the supposed release of &quot;Duke Nukem Forever&quot;, which was promised in 1997 but was delayed indefinitely (the game was eventually released in 2011). References to the game are commonly brought up in other articles about software packages that are not yet in production even though the announced delivery date has long passed (see vaporware). Having a low Slashdot user identifier (user ID) is highly valued since they are assigned sequentially; having one is a sign that someone has an older account and has contributed to the site longer. For Slashdot&#x27;s 10-year anniversary in 2007, one of the items auctioned off in the charity auction for the Electronic Frontier Foundation was a 3-digit Slashdot user ID.

==Traffic and publicity==

In 2006, Slashdot had approximately 5.5 million users per month.

The primary stories on the site consist of a short synopsis paragraph, a link to the original story, and a lengthy discussion section, all contributed by users. At its peak, discussion on stories could get up to 10,000 posts per day. Slashdot has been considered a pioneer in user-driven content, influencing other sites such as Google News and Wikipedia.
There has been a dip in readership as of 2011, primarily due to the increase of technology-related blogs and Twitter feeds.

In 2002, approximately 50% of Slashdot&#x27;s traffic consisted of people who simply check out the headlines and click through, while others participate in discussion boards and take part in the community. Many links in Slashdot stories caused the linked site to get swamped by heavy traffic and its server to collapse. This was known as the &quot;Slashdot effect&quot;, a term first coined on February 15, 1999, that refers to an article about a &quot;new generation of niche Web portals driving unprecedented amounts of traffic to sites of interest&quot;.

Slashdot has received over twenty awards, including People&#x27;s Voice Awards in 2000 in both of the categories for which it was nominated (&quot;Best Community Site&quot; and &quot;Best News Site&quot;). It was also voted as one of &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s favorite technology Web sites and rated in Yahoo!&#x27;s Top 100 Web sites as the &quot;Best Geek Hangout&quot; (2001). The main antagonists in the 2004 novel &quot;Century Rain&quot;, by Alastair Reynolds – The Slashers – are named after Slashdot users. The site was mentioned briefly in the 2000 novel &quot;Cosmonaut Keep&quot;, written by Ken MacLeod. Several tech celebrities have stated that they either checked the website regularly or participated in its discussion forums using an account. Some of these celebrities include: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, writer and actor Wil Wheaton, and id Software technical director John Carmack.

== Deterioration ==

* Unlike other sites, UTF-8 was never adopted. All text is rendered as ASCII. Including parts of news posts quoted from third party sites.
* The mobile interface, added after Slashdot was sold off, was never finished, and lacks fundamental functionality, like account settings, anonymous posting, choice of markup style (important because of above lack of UTF-8), etc.
* No visible changes to the site have been made since the addition of the mobile interface and rudimentary asynchronous functionality.
* Comment numbers have declined to a tenth compared to its golden age.
* As of late Summer 2023, the registration mechanism for new users is disabled, and manual requests via feedback e-mail must be made.

<doc id="26716" wikidata="Q35715" url="?curid=26716" title="South Australia">
<text>South Australia (commonly abbreviated as SA) is a state in the southern central part of Australia. With a total land area of , it is the fourth-largest of Australia&#x27;s states and territories by area, which includes some of the most arid parts of the continent, and with 1.8 million people. It is the fifth-largest of the states and territories by population. This population is the second-most highly centralised in the nation after Western Australia, with more than 77% of South Australians living in the capital Adelaide or its environs. Other population centres in the state are relatively small; Mount Gambier, the second-largest centre, has a population of 26,878.

South Australia shares borders with all the other mainland states. It is bordered to the west by Western Australia, to the north by the Northern Territory, to the north-east by Queensland, to the east by New South Wales, to the south-east by Victoria, and to the south by the Great Australian Bight. The state comprises less than 8% of the Australian population and ranks fifth in population among the six states and two territories. The majority of its people reside in greater Metropolitan Adelaide. Most of the remainder are settled in fertile areas along the south-eastern coast and River Murray. The state&#x27;s colonial origins are unique in Australia as a freely settled, planned British province, rather than as a convict settlement. Colonial government commenced on 28 December 1836, when the members of the council were sworn in near the Old Gum Tree.

As with the rest of the continent, the region has a long history of human occupation by numerous tribes and languages. The South Australian Company established a temporary settlement at Kingscote, Kangaroo Island, on 26 July 1836, five months before Adelaide was founded. The guiding principle behind settlement was that of &quot;systematic colonisation&quot;, a theory espoused by Edward Gibbon Wakefield that was later employed by the New Zealand Company. The goal was to establish the province as a centre of civilisation for free immigrants, promising civil liberties and religious tolerance. Although its history has been marked by periods of economic hardship, South Australia has remained politically innovative and culturally vibrant. Today, it is known for its fine wine and numerous cultural festivals. The state&#x27;s economy is dominated by the agricultural, manufacturing and mining industries.

==History==

Evidence of human activity in South Australia dates back as far as 20,000 years, with flint mining activity and rock art in the Koonalda Cave on the Nullarbor Plain. In addition wooden spears and tools were made in an area now covered in peat bog in the South East. Kangaroo Island was inhabited long before the island was cut off by rising sea levels. According to mitochondrial DNA research, Aboriginal people reached Eyre Peninsula 49,000-45,000 years ago from both the east (clockwise, along the coast, from northern Australia) and the west (anti-clockwise).

The first recorded European sighting of the South Australian coast was in 1627 when the Dutch ship the &quot;Gulden Zeepaert&quot;, captained by François Thijssen, examined and mapped a section of the coastline as far east as the Nuyts Archipelago. Thijssen named the whole of the country eastward of the Leeuwin &quot;Nuyts Land&quot;, after a distinguished passenger on board; the Hon. Pieter Nuyts, one of the Councillors of India.

The coastline of South Australia was first mapped by Matthew Flinders and Nicolas Baudin in 1802, excepting the inlet later named the Port Adelaide River which was first discovered in 1831 by Captain Collet Barker and later accurately charted in 1836–37 by Colonel William Light, leader of the South Australian Colonization Commissioners&#x27; &#x27;First Expedition&#x27; and first Surveyor-General of South Australia.

The land which now forms the state of South Australia was claimed for Britain in 1788 as part of the colony of New South Wales. Although the new colony included almost two-thirds of the continent, early settlements were all on the eastern coast and only a few intrepid explorers ventured this far west. It took more than forty years before any serious proposal to establish settlements in the south-western portion of New South Wales were put forward.

On 15 August 1834, the British Parliament passed the South Australia Act 1834 (&quot;Foundation Act&quot;), which empowered His Majesty to erect and establish a province or provinces in southern Australia. The act stated that the land between 132° and 141° east longitude and from 26° south latitude to the southern ocean would be allotted to the intended colony, and it would be convict-free.
In contrast to the rest of Australia, &quot;terra nullius&quot; did not apply to the new province. The Letters Patent, which used the enabling provisions of the South Australia Act 1834 to fix the boundaries of the Province of South Australia, provided that &quot;nothing in those our Letters Patent shall affect or be construed to affect the rights of any Aboriginal Natives of the said Province to the actual occupation and enjoyment in their own Persons or in the Persons of their Descendants of any Lands therein now actually occupied or enjoyed by such Natives.&quot; Although the patent guaranteed land rights under force of law for the indigenous inhabitants, it was ignored by the South Australian Company authorities and squatters. Despite strong reference to the rights of the native population in the initial proclamation by the Governor, there were many conflicts and deaths in the Australian Frontier Wars in South Australia.
Survey was required before settlement of the province, and the Colonization Commissioners for South Australia appointed William Light as the leader of its &#x27;First Expedition&#x27;, tasked with examining 1500 miles of the South Australian coastline and selecting the best site for the capital, and with then planning and surveying the site of the city into one-acre Town Sections and its surrounds into 134-acre Country Sections.

Eager to commence the establishment of their whale and seal fisheries, the South Australian Company sought, and obtained, the Commissioners&#x27; permission to send Company ships to South Australia, in advance of the surveys and ahead of the Commissioners&#x27; colonists.

The company&#x27;s settlement of seven vessels and 636 people was temporarily made at Kingscote on Kangaroo Island, until the official site of the capital was selected by William Light, where the City of Adelaide is currently located. The first immigrants arrived at Holdfast Bay (near the present day Glenelg) in November 1836.

The commencement of colonial government was proclaimed on 28 December 1836, now known as Proclamation Day.

South Australia is the only Australian state to have never received British convicts. Another free settlement, Swan River colony was established in 1829 but Western Australia later sought convict labour, and in 1849 Western Australia was formally constituted as a penal colony. Although South Australia was constituted such that convicts could never be transported to the Province, some emancipated or escaped convicts or expirees made their own way there, both prior to 1836, or later, and may have constituted 1–2% of the early population.

The plan for the province was that it would be an experiment in reform, addressing the problems perceived in British society. There was to be religious freedom and no established religion. Sales of land to colonists created an Emigration Fund to pay the costs of transferring a poor young labouring population to South Australia. In early 1838 the colonists became concerned after it was reported that convicts who had escaped from the eastern states may make their way to South Australia. The South Australia Police was formed in April 1838 to protect the community and enforce government regulations. Their principal role was to run the first temporary gaol, a two-room hut.

The current flag of South Australia was adopted on 13 January 1904, and is a British blue ensign defaced with the state badge. The badge is described as a piping shrike with wings outstretched on a yellow disc. The state badge is believed to have been designed by Robert Craig of Adelaide&#x27;s School of Design.

==Geography==

The terrain consists largely of arid and semi-arid rangelands, with several low mountain ranges. The most important (but not tallest) is the Mount Lofty-Flinders Ranges system, which extends north about from Cape Jervis to the northern end of Lake Torrens. The highest point in the state is not in those ranges; Mount Woodroffe () is in the Musgrave Ranges in the extreme northwest of the state.

The south-western portion of the state consists of the sparsely inhabited Nullarbor Plain, fronted by the cliffs of the Great Australian Bight. Features of the coast include Spencer Gulf and the Eyre and Yorke Peninsulas that surround it. The Temperate Grassland of South Australia is situated to the east of Gulf St Vincent.


The principal industries and exports of South Australia are wheat, wine and wool. More than half of Australia&#x27;s wines are produced in the South Australian wine regions which principally include Barossa Valley, Clare Valley, McLaren Vale, Coonawarra, the Riverland and the Adelaide Hills. &quot;See South Australian wine.&quot;

===South Australian boundaries===
South Australia has boundaries with every other Australian mainland state and territory except the Australian Capital Territory and the Jervis Bay Territory. The Western Australia border has a history involving the South Australian government astronomer, G.F. Dodwell, and the Western Australian Government Astronomer, H.B. Curlewis, marking the border on the ground in the 1920s.

In 1863, that part of New South Wales to the north of South Australia was annexed to South Australia, by letters patent, as the &quot;Northern Territory of South Australia&quot;, which became shortened to the Northern Territory on 6 July 1863. The Northern Territory was handed to the federal government in 1911 and became a separate territory.

According to Australian maps, South Australia&#x27;s south coast is flanked by the Southern Ocean, but official international consensus defines the Southern Ocean as extending north from the pole only to 60°S or 55°S, at least 17 degrees of latitude further south than the most southern point of South Australia. Thus the south coast is officially adjacent to the south-most portion of the Indian Ocean. &quot;See Southern Ocean: Existence and definitions&quot;.

===Climate===
The southern part of the state has a Mediterranean climate, while the rest of the state has either an arid or semi-arid climate. South Australia&#x27;s main temperature range is in January and in July. 
The highest maximum temperature ever recorded was at Oodnadatta on 2 January 1960, which is the highest official temperature recorded in Australia. The lowest minimum temperature was at Yongala on 20 July 1976. The region&#x27;s overall dry weather is owed to the Australian High on the Great Australian Bight.
==Economy==


As of 2016, South Australia had 746,105 people employed out of a total workforce of 806,593, giving an unemployment rate of 7.5%. South Australia&#x27;s largest employment sector is health care and social assistance, making up 14.8% of the state&#x27;s total employment, followed by retail (10.7%), education and training (8.6%), manufacturing (8%), and construction (7.6%). South Australia&#x27;s economy relies on exports more than any other state in Australia.

South Australia&#x27;s credit rating was upgraded to AAA by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s in September 2004 and to AAA by Moody&#x27;s in November 2004, the highest credit ratings achievable by any company or sovereign. The state had previously lost these ratings in the State Bank collapse. However, in 2012 Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s downgraded the state&#x27;s credit rating to AA+ due to declining revenues, new spending initiatives and a weaker than expected budgetary outlook.

South Australia receives the least amount of federal funding for its local road network of all states on a per capita and a per kilometre basis.


During 2019-20: South Australia&#x27;s gross state product (GSP) fell 1.4% in chain volume (real) terms (nationally, gross domestic product (GDP) fell 0.3%). South Australia came out of the COVID-19 recession better than the other Australian states, with the economy growing by 3.9% in the 2020–21 financial year. This was the first time since the Australian Bureau of Statistics began collecting data in 1990 that South Australia had outperformed the other states. The recovery was driven in part by growth in the agricultural sector, which increased its production by almost 24% thanks to the end of a drought.

===Agriculture===
==== Cereals, legumes and oilseeds ====
Wheat, barley, oats, rye, peas, beans, chickpeas, lentils and canola are grown in South Australia.

==== Fruit and vegetables ====
Apples, pears, cherries and strawberries are grown in the Adelaide Hills. Tomatoes, capsicums, cucumbers, brassicas, lettuce and carrots are grown on the Northern Adelaide Plains at Virginia. Almonds, citrus and stone fruit are grown in the Riverland. Potatoes, onions and carrots are grown in the Murray Mallee region. Potatoes are grown on Kangaroo Island.

==== Viticulture ====

South Australia produces more than half of all Australian wine, including almost 80% of Australia&#x27;s premium wines.

===Energy===

South Australia has the lead over other Australian states for its commercialisation and commitment to renewable energy. It is now the leading producer of wind power in Australia. Renewable energy is a growing source of electricity in South Australia, and there is potential for growth from this particular industry of the state&#x27;s economy. The Hornsdale Power Reserve is a bank of grid-connected batteries adjacent to the Hornsdale Wind Farm in South Australia&#x27;s Mid-North region. At the time of construction in late 2017, it was billed as the largest lithium-ion battery in the world.

===Mining===

The Olympic Dam mine near Roxby Downs in northern South Australia is the largest deposit of uranium in the world, possessing more than a third of the world&#x27;s low-cost recoverable reserves and 70% of Australia&#x27;s. The mine, owned and operated by BHP, presently accounts for 9% of global uranium production. The Olympic Dam mine is also the world&#x27;s fourth-largest remaining copper deposit, and the world&#x27;s fifth largest gold deposit. There was a proposal to vastly expand the operations of the mine, making it the largest open-cut mine in the world, but in 2012 the BHP Billiton board decided not to go ahead with it at that time due to then lower commodity prices.

The remote town of Coober Pedy produces more opal than anywhere else in the world. Opal was first discovered near the town in 1915, and the town became the site of an opal rush, enticing immigrants from southern and eastern Europe in the aftermath of World War II.

===Education and research===
Higher education and research in Adelaide forms an important part of South Australia&#x27;s economy. The South Australian Government and educational institutions have attempted to position Adelaide as &quot;Australia&#x27;s education hub&quot; and have marketed it as a &quot;Learning City&quot;. The number of international students studying in Adelaide has increased rapidly in recent years to 30,726 in 2015, of which 1,824 were secondary school students. Foreign institutions have been attracted to set up campuses to increase its attractiveness as an education hub. Adelaide is the birthplace of three Nobel laureates, more than any other Australian city: physicist William Lawrence Bragg and pathologists Howard Florey and Robin Warren, all of whom completed secondary and tertiary education at St Peter&#x27;s College and the University of Adelaide.

Adelaide is home to research institutes, including the Royal Institution of Australia, established in 2009 as a counterpart to the two-hundred-year-old Royal Institution of Great Britain. Most of the research organisations are clustered in the Adelaide metropolitan area:
* The east end of North Terrace: SA Pathology; Hanson Institute; National Wine Centre.
* The west end of North Terrace: South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), located next to the Royal Adelaide Hospital.
* The Waite Research Precinct: SARDI Head Office and Plant Research Centre; AWRI; ACPFG; CSIRO research laboratories. SARDI also has establishments at Glenside and West Beach.
* Edinburgh, South Australia: DSTO; BAE Systems (Australia); Lockheed Martin Australia Electronic Systems.
* Technology Park (Mawson Lakes): BAE Systems; Optus; Raytheon; Topcon; Lockheed Martin Australia Electronic Systems.
* Research Park at Thebarton: businesses involved in materials engineering, biotechnology, environmental services, information technology, industrial design, laser/optics technology, health products, engineering services, radar systems, telecommunications and petroleum services.
* Science Park (adjacent to Flinders University): Playford Capital.
* The Basil Hetzel Institute for Translational Health Research in Woodville the research arm of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide
* The Joanna Briggs Institute, a global research collaboration for evidence-based healthcare with its headquarters in North Adelaide.
==Government==

South Australia is a constitutional monarchy with King Charles III as sovereign, and the Governor of South Australia as his
representative. It is a state of the Commonwealth of Australia. The bicameral Parliament of South Australia consists of the lower house known as the House of Assembly and the upper house known as the Legislative Council. General elections are held every four years, the last being the 2022 election.

Initially, the Governor of South Australia held almost total power, derived from the letters patent of the imperial government to create the colony. He was accountable only to the British Colonial Office, and thus democracy did not exist in the colony. A new body was created to advise the governor on the administration of South Australia in 1843 called the Legislative Council. It consisted of three representatives of the British Government and four colonists appointed by the governor. The governor retained total executive power.

In 1851, the Imperial Parliament enacted the Australian Colonies Government Act, which allowed for the election of representatives to each of the colonial legislatures and the drafting of a constitution to properly create representative and responsible government in South Australia. Later that year, propertied male colonists were allowed to vote for 16 members on a new 24 seat Legislative Council. Eight members continued to be appointed by the governor.
The main responsibility of this body was to draft a constitution for South Australia. The body drafted the most democratic constitution ever seen in the British Empire and provided for universal manhood suffrage. It created the bicameral Parliament of South Australia. For the first time in the colony, the executive was elected by the people, and the colony used the Westminster system, where the government is the party or coalition that exerts a majority in the House of Assembly. The Legislative Council remained a predominantly conservative chamber elected by property owners.

Women&#x27;s suffrage in Australia took a leap forward – enacted in 1895 and taking effect from the 1896 colonial election, South Australia was the first government in Australia and only the second in the world after New Zealand to allow women to vote, and the first in the world to allow women to stand for election. In 1897 Catherine Helen Spence was the first woman in Australia to be a candidate for political office when she was nominated to be one of South Australia&#x27;s delegates to the conventions that drafted the constitution. South Australia became an original state of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901.

Although the lower house had universal suffrage, the upper house, the Legislative Council, remained the exclusive domain of property owners until the Labor government of Don Dunstan managed to achieve reform of the chamber in 1973. Property qualifications were removed and the Council became a body elected via proportional representation by a single state-wide electorate.
Since the following 1975 South Australian state election, no one party has had control of the state&#x27;s upper house with the balance of power controlled by a variety of minor parties and independents.

===Local government===
Local government in South Australia is established by the &quot;Constitution Act 1934&quot; (SA), the &quot;Local Government Act 1999&quot; (SA), and the &quot;Local Government (Elections) Act 1999&quot; (SA). South Australia contains 68 councils and 6 Aboriginal and outback communities. Local councils, elected on a four-yearly basis, are responsible for local roads and stormwater management, waste collection, planning and development, fire prevention and hazard management, dog and cat management and control, parking control, public health and food inspections, and other services for their local communities. Councils have the power to raise revenue for their activities, which is mostly achieved through &quot;council rates&quot;, a tax based on property valuations. Council rates make up about 70% of council revenue, but account for less than 4% of total taxes paid by Australians.

==Demographics==


As at December 2021 the population of South Australia was 1,806,599.
A majority of the state&#x27;s population lives within Greater Adelaide&#x27;s metropolitan area which had an estimated population of 
1,333,927 in June 2017. Other significant population centres include Mount Gambier (29,505), Victor Harbor-Goolwa (26,334), Whyalla (21,976), Murray Bridge (18,452), Port Lincoln (16,281), Port Pirie (14,267), and Port Augusta (13,957).

===Ancestry and immigration===
At the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: 
28.9% of the population was born overseas at the 2016 census. The five largest groups of overseas-born were from England (5.8%), India (1.6%), China (1.5%), Italy (1.1%) and Vietnam (0.9%).

2% of the population, or 34,184 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.

===Language===
At the 2016 census, 78.2% of the population spoke only English at home. The other languages most commonly spoken at home were Italian (1.7%), Standard Mandarin (1.7%), Greek (1.4%), Vietnamese (1.1%), and Cantonese (0.6%).

=== Religion ===
At the 2016 census, overall 53.9% of responses identified some variant of Christianity. 9% of respondents chose not to state a religion. The most commonly nominated responses were &#x27;No Religion&#x27; (35.4%), Catholicism (18%), Anglicanism (10%) and Uniting Church (7.1%).

South Australia was the first Australian colony not to have an official state religion, and the colony became attractive to people who had experienced religious discrimination, including Methodists and Unitarians. South Australia also had thousands of Prussian Old Lutheran immigrants, some of whom established their own form of Lutheranism. As a result, the Lutheran Church of Australia remains separate from the German Lutheran church to this day. South Australia was the location of the first Muslim mosque in Australia.

Most of the state&#x27;s original colonists were Christian, but of many denominations, most with their own meeting place in the city square. Adelaide has been known as the &quot;City of Churches&quot; since at least 1868. Some of the oldest remaining buildings in the city are churches.

==Education==
===Primary and secondary===
On 1 January 2009, the school leaving age was raised to 17 (having previously been 15 and then 16). Education is compulsory for all children until age 17, unless they are working or undergoing other training. The majority of students stay on to complete their South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE). School education is the responsibility of the South Australian government, but the public and private education systems are funded jointly by it and the Commonwealth Government.

The South Australian Government provides, to schools on a per student basis, 89% of the total Government funding while the Commonwealth contributes 11%. Since the early 1970s, it has been an ongoing controversy that 68% of Commonwealth funding (increasing to 75% by 2008) goes to private schools that are attended by 32% of the states students. Private schools often counter this by saying that they receive less State Government funding than public schools, and in 2004 the main private school funding came from the Australian government, not the state government.

On 14 June 2013, South Australia became the third Australian state to sign up to the Australian Federal Government&#x27;s Gonski Reform Program. This will see funding for primary and secondary education to South Australia increased by $1.1 billion before 2019.

The academic year in South Australia generally runs from the end of January until mid-December for primary and secondary schools. The SA schools operate on a four-term basis. Schools are closed for the South Australia public holidays.

===Tertiary===
There are three public and four private universities in South Australia. The three public universities are the University of Adelaide (established 1874, third oldest in Australia), Flinders University (est. 1966) and the University of South Australia (est. 1991). The four private universities are Torrens University Australia (est. 2013), Carnegie Mellon University - Australia (est. 2006), University College London&#x27;s School of Energy and Resources (Australia), and Cranfield University. All six have their main campus in the Adelaide metropolitan area: Adelaide and UniSA on North Terrace in the city; CMU, UCL and Cranfield are co-located on Victoria Square in the city, and Flinders at Bedford Park.

The University of Adelaide is part of the Group of Eight, a company of Australia&#x27;s eight leading research universities. As of 2022, it is ranked by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings as one of the top 100 universities in the world. It was the first university in Australia to admit women to academic courses, doing so in 1881. In 2018, the University of Adelaide and the University of South Australia announced plans to merge, but these plans did not come to fruition due in part to disagreements over what to name the new university and which of the university&#x27;s vice-chancellors would become the vice-chancellor of the amalgamated university.

====Vocational education====

Tertiary vocational education is provided by a range of Registered Training Organisations (RTOs) which are regulated at Commonwealth level. The range of RTOs delivering education include public, private and &#x27;enterprise&#x27; providers i.e. employing organisations who run an RTO for their own employees or members.

The largest public provider of vocational education is TAFE South Australia which is made up of colleges throughout the state, many of these in rural areas, providing tertiary education to as many people as possible. In South Australia, TAFE is funded by the state government and run by the South Australian Department of Further Education, Employment, Science and Technology (DFEEST). Each TAFE SA campus provides a range of courses with its own specialisation.

==Transport==


===Historical transport in South Australia===
After settlement, the major form of transport in South Australia was ocean transport. Limited land transport was provided by horses and bullocks. In the mid 19th century, the state began to develop a widespread rail network, although a coastal shipping network continued until the post war period.

Roads began to improve with the introduction of motor transport. By the late 19th century, road transport dominated internal transport in South Australia.

===Railway===
South Australia has four interstate rail connections, to Perth via the Nullarbor Plain, to Darwin through the centre of the continent, to New South Wales through Broken Hill, and to Melbourne–which is the closest capital city to Adelaide.

Rail transport was important for many mines in the north of the state.

The capital Adelaide has a commuter rail network made of electric and diesel electric powered multiple units, with 7 lines between them.

===Roads===

South Australia has extensive road networks linking towns and other states. Roads are also the most common form of transport within the major metropolitan areas with car transport predominating. Public transport in Adelaide is mostly provided by buses and trams with regular services throughout the day.

===Air transport===
Adelaide Airport provides regular flights to other capitals, major South Australian towns and many international locations. The airport also has daily flights to several Asian hub airports. Adelaide Metro buses J1 and J1X connect to the city (approx. 30 minutes travel time), as well as other services to other parts of Adelaide. Standard fares apply and tickets may be purchased from a ticket machine at the airport bus stop. Maximum charge (September 2016) for Metroticket is $5.30; off-peak and seniors discounts may apply.
===River transport===
The River Murray was formerly an important trade route for South Australia, with paddle steamers linking inland areas and the ocean at Goolwa.

===Sea transport===
South Australia has a container port at Port Adelaide. There are also numerous important ports along the coast for minerals and grains.

The passenger terminal at Port Adelaide periodically sees cruise liners.

Kangaroo Island is dependent on the Sea Link ferry service between Cape Jervis and Penneshaw.

==Cultural life==

South Australia has been known as &quot;the Festival State&quot; for many years, for its abundance of arts and gastronomic festivals. While much of the arts scene is concentrated in Adelaide, the state government has supported regional arts actively since the 1990s. One of the manifestations of this was the creation of Country Arts SA, created in 1992.

Diana Laidlaw did much to further the arts in South Australia during her term as Arts Minister from 1993 to 2002, and after Mike Rann assumed government in 2002, he created a strategic plan in 2004 (updated 2007) which included furthering and promoting the arts in South Australia under the topic heading &quot;Objective 4:
Fostering Creativity and Innovation&quot;.

In September 2019, with the arts portfolio now subsumed within the Department of the Premier and Cabinet (DPC) after the election of Steven Marshall as Premier, and the 2004 strategic plan having been deleted from the website in 2018, the &quot;Arts and Culture Plan, South Australia 2019–2024&quot; was created by the department. Marshall said when launching the plan: “The arts sector in South Australia is already very strong but it&#x27;s been operating without a plan for 20 years”. However the plan does not signal any new government support, even after the government&#x27;s cuts to arts funding when Arts South Australia was absorbed into DPC in 2018. Specific proposals within the plan include an “Adelaide in 100 Objects” walking tour, a new shared ticketing system for small to medium arts bodies, a five-year-plan to revitalise regional art centres, creation of an arts-focussed high school, and a new venue for the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra.

South Australia has a public library system, and state library. Some public libraries in South Australia in rural areas are joint school and community libraries.

==Sport==

===Australian rules football===
Australian rules football is the most popular spectator sport in South Australia. In 2006, South Australians had the highest attendance rate for the sport of any state, with 31% of South Australians attending a match in the previous twelve months. South Australia fields two teams in the Australian Football League (AFL): the Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club. The two teams have an intense rivalry called the Showdown. The traditional home of Australian rules football in South Australia was Football Park in the western suburb of West Lakes, which was the home ground of both AFL teams until 2013. Since 2014, both teams have used Adelaide Oval, near the city centre, as their home ground.

The South Australian National Football League (SANFL), which was the premier league in the state before the advent of the Australian Football League, is a popular local league comprising ten teams: Sturt, Port Adelaide, Adelaide, West Adelaide, South Adelaide, North Adelaide, Norwood, Woodville/West Torrens, Glenelg and Central District.

The Adelaide Footy League comprises 68 member clubs playing over 110 matches per week across ten senior divisions and three junior divisions. It is one of Australia&#x27;s largest and strongest Australian rules football associations.

===Cricket===
Cricket has a long history in South Australia, with the first matches being played in 1839. Regular club matches were organised following the establishment of the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) in 1871. Presently, SACA governs the South Australian Premier Cricket competition in addition to all forms of domestic cricket in the state. Cricket is the most popular summer sport in South Australia, with 39,000 club players at both junior and senior levels in 2023.

At the professional level, the West End Redbacks represent the men&#x27;s state team, competing in the Sheffield Shield and the Marsh One-Day Cup. The South Australian Scorpions represent the women&#x27;s team and compete in the Women&#x27;s National Cricket League. South Australia also hosts the Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League and their women&#x27;s team in the Women&#x27;s Big Bash League. Matches are held at Adelaide Oval and Karen Rolton Oval in the Adelaide Parklands.

International cricket is also held in South Australia, with matches being played at Adelaide Oval. The venue was used to host matches in both the men&#x27;s 1992 Cricket World Cup and 2015 Cricket World Cup. Adelaide Oval also saw use during the 2022 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup. Outside of Adelaide, international cricket has also been played in Berri, South Australia with Berri Oval hosting a singular match during the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

===Association football===
Adelaide United represents South Australia in soccer in the men&#x27;s A-League and women&#x27;s W-League. The club&#x27;s home ground is Hindmarsh Stadium (Coopers Stadium), but it occasionally plays games at the Adelaide Oval.

The club was founded in 2003 and are the 2015–16 season champions of the A-League. The club was also premier in the inaugural 2005–06 A-League season, finishing 7 points clear of the rest of the competition, before finishing 3rd in the finals. Adelaide United was also a Grand Finalist in the 2006–07 and 2008–09 seasons. Adelaide is the only A-League club to have progressed past the group stages of the Asian Champions League on more than one occasion.

Adelaide City remains South Australia&#x27;s most successful club, having won three National Soccer League titles and three NSL Cups. City was the first side from South Australia to ever win a continental title when it claimed the 1987 Oceania Club Championship and it has also won a record 17 South Australian championships and 17 Federation Cups.

West Adelaide became the first South Australian club to be crowned Australian champion when it won the 1978 National Soccer League title. Like City, it now competes in the National Premier Leagues South Australia and the two clubs contest the Adelaide derby.

===Basketball===
Basketball also has a big following in South Australia, with the Adelaide 36ers playing in the Adelaide Entertainment Centre. The 36ers have won four championships in the last 20 years in the National Basketball League. The Adelaide Entertainment Centre, located in Hindmarsh, is the home of basketball in the state.

Mount Gambier also has a national basketball team – the Mount Gambier Pioneers. The Pioneers play at the Icehouse (Bern Bruning Basketball Stadium), which seats over 1,000 people and is also home to the Mount Gambier Basketball Association. The Pioneers won the South Conference in 2003 and the Final in 2003; this team was rated second in the top five teams to have ever played in the league. In 2012, the club entered its 25th season, with a roster of 10 senior players (two imports) and three development squad players.

===Motorsport===
Australia&#x27;s premier motorsport series, the Supercars Championship, has visited South Australia each year since 1999. South Australia&#x27;s Supercars event, the Adelaide 500, is staged on the Adelaide Street Circuit, a temporary track laid out through the streets and parklands to the east of the Adelaide city centre. Attendance for the 2022 event totalled 258,200. An earlier version of the Adelaide Street Circuit played host to the Australian Grand Prix, a round of the FIA Formula One World Championship, each year from 1985 to 1995.

Mallala Motor Sport Park, a permanent circuit located near the town of Mallala, 58 km north of Adelaide, caters for both state and national level motor sport throughout the year.

The Bend Motorsport Park, is another permanent circuit, located just outside of Tailem Bend.

===Rugby league===

The state rugby league federation is the South Australian Rugby League. The game traces its roots in the state back to the 1940s, when the Port Adelaide rugby union team split in four, and defected to rugby league.

South Australia&#x27;s only professional rugby league team, the Adelaide Rams, had a short but eventful existence. After debuting in the Super League competition in 1997, in 1998 they were selected to join the 20-team National Rugby League; however they were to be axed from the 1999 season as part of a rationalisation of teams (from 20 to 14) in the competition.

At present however, the South Australian Rugby League still operates a local semi-professional competition consisting of both junior and adult teams from across Adelaide.

Adelaide Oval hosted State of Origin series games in both 2020 and 2023, with the latter drawing a state record rugby league attendance of 48,613.

===Other sports===

Sixty-three percent of South Australian children took part in organised sports in 2002–2003.

The ATP Adelaide was a tennis tournament held from 1972 to 2008 that then moved to Brisbane. Since 2020, South Australia has hosted the Adelaide International tennis tournament. Also, the Royal Adelaide Golf Club has hosted nine editions of the Australian Open, with the most recent being in 1998.

The state has hosted the Tour Down Under cycle race since 1999.

==Places==

==Crime==

Crime in South Australia is managed by the South Australia Police (SAPOL), various state and federal courts in the criminal justice system and the state Department for Correctional Services, which administers the prisons and remand centre.

Crime statistics for all categories of offence in the state are provided on the SAPOL website, in the form of rolling 12-month totals. Crime statistics from the 2017–18 national ABS Crime Victimisation Survey show that between the years 2008–09 and 2017–18, the rate of victimisation in South Australia declined for assault and most household crime types.

In 2013, Adelaide was ranked the safest capital city in Australia.

<text>Slime mold or slime mould is an informal name given to a polyphyletic assemblage of unrelated eukaryotic organisms in the Stramenopiles, Rhizaria, Discoba, Amoebozoa and Holomycota clades. Most are microscopic; those in the Myxogastria form larger plasmodial slime molds visible to the naked eye. 

The slime mold life cycle includes a free-living single-celled stage and the formation of spores. Spores are often produced in macroscopic multicellular or multinucleate fruiting bodies that may be formed through aggregation or fusion; aggregation is driven by chemical signals called acrasins. Slime molds contribute to the decomposition of dead vegetation; some are parasitic.

Most slime molds are terrestrial and free-living, typically in damp shady habitats such as in or on the surface of rotting wood. Some myxogastrians and protostelians are aquatic or semi-aquatic. The phytomyxea are parasitic, living inside their plant hosts. Geographically, slime molds are cosmopolitan in distribution. A small number of species occur in regions as dry as the Atacama Desert and as cold as the Arctic; they are abundant in the tropics, especially in rainforests.

Slime molds have a variety of behaviors otherwise seen in animals with brains. Species such as &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; have been used to simulate traffic networks. Some species have traditionally been eaten in countries such as Ecuador.

== Evolution ==

=== Taxonomic history ===

The first account of slime molds was &#x27;s 1654 discussion of &quot;Lycogala epidendrum&quot;. He called it , &quot;a fast-growing fungus&quot;.

German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary, in 1860 and 1887, classified the Myxomycetes (plasmodial slime molds) and Acrasieae (cellular slime molds) as Mycetozoa, a new class. He also introduced a &quot;Doubtful Mycetozoa&quot; section for &quot;Plasmodiophora&quot; (now in Phytomyxea) and &quot;Labyrinthula&quot;, emphasizing their distinction from plants and fungi. In 1880, the French botanist Philippe van Tieghem analyzed the two groups further. 

In 1868, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel placed the Mycetozoa in a kingdom he named Protista. In 1885, the British zoologist Ray Lankester grouped the Mycetozoa alongside the Proteomyxa as part of the Gymnomyxa in the phylum Protozoa. Arthur and Gulielma Lister published monographs of the group in 1894, 1911, and 1925.

In 1932 and 1960, the American mycologist George Willard Martin argued that the slime molds evolved from fungi. In 1956, the American biologist Herbert Copeland placed the Mycetozoa (the myxomycetes and plasmodiophorids) and the Sarkodina (the labyrinthulids and the cellular slime molds) in a phylum called Protoplasta, which he placed alongside the fungi and the algae in a new kingdom, Protoctista.

In 1969, the taxonomist R. H. Whittaker observed that slime molds were highly conspicuous and distinct within the Fungi, the group to which they were then classified. He concurred with Lindsay S. Olive&#x27;s proposal to reclassify the Gymnomycota, which includes slime molds, as part of the Protista. Whittaker placed three phyla, namely the Myxomycota, Acrasiomycota, and Labyrinthulomycota in a subkingdom Gymnomycota within the Fungi. The same year, Martin and Alexopoulos published their influential textbook &quot;The Myxomycetes&quot;.

In 1975, Olive distinguished the dictyostelids and the acrasids as separate groups. In 1992, David J. Patterson and M. L. Sogin proposed that the dictyostelids diverged before plants, animals, and fungi.

=== Phylogeny ===

Slime molds have little or no fossil history, as might be expected given that they are small and soft-bodied. The grouping is polyphyletic, consisting of multiple clades (emphasised in the phylogenetic tree) widely scattered across the Eukaryotes. Paraphyletic groups are shown in quotation marks:

== Diversity ==

Various estimates of the number of species of slime molds agree that there are around 1000 species, most being Myxogastria. Collection of environmental DNA gives a higher estimate, from 1200 to 1500 species. These are diverse both taxonomically and in appearance, the largest and most familiar species being among the Myxogastria. The growth forms most commonly noticed are the sporangia, the spore-forming bodies, which are often roughly spherical; these may be directly on the surface, such as on rotting wood, or may be on a thin stalk which elevates the spores for release above the surface. Other species have the spores in a large mass, which may be visited by insects for food; they disperse spores when they leave.

=== Macroscopic, plasmodial slime molds: Myxogastria ===

The Myxogastria or plasmodial slime molds are the only macroscopic scale slime molds; they gave the group its informal name, since for part of their life cycle they are slimy to the touch. A myxogastrian consists of a large cell with thousands of nuclei within a single membrane without walls, forming a syncytium. Most are smaller than a few centimeters, but some species may reach sizes up to several square meters, and in the case of &quot;Brefeldia maxima&quot;, a mass of up to .

=== Cellular slime molds: Dictyosteliida ===

The Dictyosteliida or cellular slime molds do not form huge coenocytes like the Myxogastria; their amoebae remain individual for most of their lives as individual unicellular protists, feeding on microorganisms. When food is depleted and they are ready to form sporangia, they form swarms. The amoebae join up into a tiny multicellular slug which crawls to an open lit place and grows into a fruiting body, a sorocarp. Some of the amoebae become spores to begin the next generation, but others sacrifice themselves to become a dead stalk, lifting the spores up into the air.

=== Protosteliida ===

The Protosteliida, a polyphyletic group, have characters intermediate between the previous two groups, but they are much smaller, the fruiting bodies only forming one to a few spores.

=== &quot;Copromyxa&quot; ===

The lobosans, a paraphyletic group of amoebae, include the &quot;Copromyxa&quot; slime molds.

=== Non-amoebozoan slime molds ===

Among the non-amoebozoan slime molds are the Acrasids, which have sluglike amoebae. In locomotion, the amoebae&#x27;s pseudopodia are eruptive, meaning that hemispherical bulges appear at the front. The Phytomyxea are obligate parasites, with hosts among the plants, diatoms, oomycetes, and brown algae. They cause plant diseases like cabbage club root and powdery scab. The Labyrinthulomycetes are marine slime nets, forming labyrinthine networks of tubes in which amoeba without pseudopods can travel. The Fonticulida are cellular slime molds that form a fruiting body in a &quot;volcano&quot; shape.

== Distribution, habitats, and ecology ==

Slime molds, with their small size and moist surface, live mostly in damp habitats including shaded forests, rotting wood, fallen or living leaves, and on bryophytes. Most Myxogastria are terrestrial, though some, like &quot;Didymium aquatilis&quot; are aquatic, and &quot;D. nigripes&quot; is semi-aquatic. Myxogastria are not limited to wet regions; 34 species are known from Saudi Arabia, living on bark, in plant litter, and rotting wood, even in deserts. They occur, too, in Arizona&#x27;s Sonoran Desert (46 species), and in Chile&#x27;s exceptionally dry Atacama Desert (24 species). In contrast, the semi-dry Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Biosphere Reserve has 105 species, and Russia and Kazakhstan&#x27;s Volga river basin has 158 species. In tropical rainforests of Latin America, species such as of &quot;Arcyria&quot; and &quot;Didymium&quot; are commonly epiphyllous, growing on the leaves of liverworts.

The dictyostelids are mostly terrestrial. On Changbai Mountain in China, six species of dictyostelids were found in forest soils at elevations up to , the highest recorded species there being &quot;Dictyostelium mucoroides&quot;.
The protostelids live mainly on dead plant matter, where they consume the spores of bacteria, yeasts, and fungi. They include some aquatic species, which live on dead plant parts submerged in ponds. Cellular slime molds are most numerous in the tropics, decreasing with latitude, but are cosmopolitan in distribution, occurring in soil even in the Arctic and the Antarctic. In the Alaskan tundra, the only slime molds are the dictyostelids &quot;D. mucoroides&quot; and &quot;D. sphaerocephalum&quot;.

The species of &quot;Copromyxa&quot; are , feeding on dung.

Some myxogastrians have their spores dispersed by animals. The slime mold fly &quot;Epicypta testata&quot; lay its eggs within the spore mass of &quot;Enteridium lycoperdon&quot;, which the larvae feed on. These pupate, and the hatching adults carry and disperse spores that have stuck to them. While various insects consume slime molds, Sphindidae slime mold beetles, both larvae and adults, exclusively feed on them.

== Life cycle ==

=== Plasmodial slime molds ===

Plasmodial slime molds begin life as amoeba-like cells. These unicellular amoebae are commonly haploid and feed on small prey such as bacteria, yeast cells, and fungal spores by phagocytosis, engulfing them with its cell membrane. These amoebae can mate if they encounter the correct mating type and form zygotes that then grow into plasmodia. These contain many nuclei without cell membranes between them, and can grow to meters in size. The species &quot;Fuligo septica&quot; is often seen as a slimy yellow network in and on rotting logs. The amoebae and the plasmodia engulf microorganisms. The plasmodium grows into an interconnected network of protoplasmic strands. Within each protoplasmic strand, the cytoplasmic contents rapidly stream, periodically reversing direction. The streaming protoplasm within a plasmodial strand can reach speeds of up to 1.35 mm per second in &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot;, the fastest for any microorganism.

Slime molds are isogamous, which means that their gametes (reproductive cells) are all the same size, unlike the eggs and sperms of animals. &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; has three genes involved in reproduction: &quot;mat&quot;A and &quot;mat&quot;B, with thirteen variants each, and &quot;mat&quot;C with three variants. Each reproductively mature slime mold is diploid, meaning that it contains two copies of each of the three reproductive genes. When &quot;P. polycephalum&quot; is ready to make its reproductive cells, it grows a bulbous extension of its body to contain them. Each cell has a random combination of the genes that the slime mold contains within its genome. Therefore, it can create cells of up to eight different gene types. Released cells then independently seek another compatible cell for fusion. Other individuals of &quot;P. polycephalum&quot; may contain different combinations of the &quot;mat&quot;A, &quot;mat&quot;B, and &quot;mat&quot;C genes, allowing over 500 possible variations. It is advantageous for organisms with this type of reproductive cell to have many mating types because the likelihood of the cells finding a partner is greatly increased, and the risk of inbreeding is drastically reduced.

=== Cellular slime molds ===

The cellular slime molds are a group of approximately 150 described species. They occur primarily in the humus layer of forest soils and feed on bacteria but also are found in animal dung and agricultural fields. They exist as single-celled organisms while food is plentiful. When food is in short supply, many of the single-celled amoebae congregate and start moving as a single body, called a &#x27;slug&#x27;. The ability of the single celled organisms to aggregate into multicellular forms are why they are also called the social amoebae. In this state they are sensitive to airborne chemicals and can detect food sources. They readily change the shape and function of parts, and may form stalks that produce fruiting bodies, releasing countless spores, light enough to be carried on the wind or on passing animals. The cellular slime mold &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; has many different mating types. When this organism has entered the stage of reproduction, it releases a chemical attractant. When it comes time for the cells to fuse, &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; has mating types of its own that dictate which cells are compatible with each other. There are at least eleven mating types; macrocysts form after cell contact between compatible mating types.

==== Chemical signals ====

The chemicals that aggregate cellular slime molds are small molecules called acrasins; motion towards a chemical signal is called chemotaxis. The first acrasin to be discovered was cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP), a common cell signaling molecule, in &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot;. During the aggregation phase of their life cycle, &quot;Dictyostelium discoideum&quot; amoebae communicate with each other using traveling waves of cyclic AMP. There is an amplification of cyclic AMP when they aggregate. Pre-stalk cells move toward cyclic AMP, but pre-spore cells ignore the signal. Other acrasins exist; the acrasin for &quot;Polysphondylium violaceum&quot;, purified in 1983, is the dipeptide glorin. Calcium ions too serve to attract slime mold amoebae, at least at short distances. It has been suggested that acrasins may be taxon-specific, since specificity is required to form an aggregation of genetically similar cells. Many dictyostelid species indeed do not respond to cyclic AMP, but as of 2023 their acrasins remained unknown.

== Study ==

=== Use in research and teaching ===

The practical study of slime molds was facilitated by the introduction of the &quot;moist culture chamber&quot; by H. C. Gilbert and G. W. Martin in 1933. Slime molds can be used to teach convergent evolution, as the habit of forming a stalk with a sporangium that can release spores into the air, off the ground, has evolved repeatedly, such as in myxogastria (eukaryotes) and in myxobacteria (prokaryotes). Further, both the (macroscopic) dictyostelids and the (microscopic) protostelids have a phase with motile amoebae and a phase with a stalk; in the protostelids, the stalk is tiny, supporting just one spore, but the logic of airborne spore dispersal is the same.

O. R. Collins showed that the slime mold &quot;Didymium iridis&quot; had two strains (+ and −) of cells, equivalent to gametes, that these could form immortal cell lines in culture, and that the system was controlled by alleles of a single gene. This made the species a model organism for exploring incompatibility, asexual reproduction, and mating types.

=== Biochemicals ===

Slime molds have been studied for their production of unusual organic compounds, including pigments, antibiotics, and anti-cancer drugs. Pigments include naphthoquinones, physarochrome A, and compounds of tetramic acid. Bisindolylmaleimides produced by &quot;Arcyria denudata&quot; include some phosphorescent compounds. The sporophores (fruiting bodies) of &quot;Arcyria denudata&quot; are colored red by arcyriaflavins A–C, which contain an unusual indolo[2,3-&quot;a&quot;]carbazole alkaloid ring. By 2022, more than 100 pigments had been isolated from slime molds, mostly from sporophores. It has been suggested that the many yellow-to-red pigments might be useful in cosmetics. Some 42% of patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis reacted to myxogastrian spores, so the spores may contribute significantly as airborne allergens.

=== Computation ===

Slime molds share some similarities with neural systems in animals. The membranes of both slime molds and neural cells contain receptor sites, which alter electrical properties of the membrane when it is bound. Therefore, some studies on the early evolution of animal neural systems are inspired by slime molds. When a slime mold mass or mound is physically separated, the cells find their way back to re-unite. Studies on &quot;Physarum polycephalum&quot; have even shown the organism to have an ability to learn and predict periodic unfavorable conditions in laboratory experiments. John Tyler Bonner, a professor of ecology known for his studies of slime molds, argues that they are &quot;no more than a bag of amoebae encased in a thin slime sheath, yet they manage to have various behaviors that are equal to those of animals who possess muscles and nerves with ganglia – that is, simple brains.&quot;

The slime mold algorithm is a meta-heuristic algorithm, based on the behavior of aggregated slime molds as they stream in search of food. It is described as a simple, efficient, and flexible way of solving optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path between nodes in a network. However, it can become trapped in a local optimum.

Toshiyuki Nakagaki and colleagues studied slime molds and their abilities to solve mazes by placing nodes at two points separated by a maze of plastic film. The mold explored all possible paths and solved it for the shortest path.

=== Traffic system inspirations ===

Atsushi Tero and colleagues grew &quot;Physarum&quot; in a flat wet dish, placing the mold in a central position representing Tokyo, and oat flakes surrounding it corresponding to the locations of other major cities in the Greater Tokyo Area. As &quot;Physarum&quot; avoids bright light, light was used to simulate mountains, water and other obstacles in the dish. The mold first densely filled the space with plasmodia, and then thinned the network to focus on efficiently connected branches. The network closely resembled Tokyo&#x27;s rail system. &quot;P. polycephalum&quot; was used in experimental laboratory approximations of motorway networks of 14 geographical areas: Australia, Africa, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Iberia, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, UK and US. The filamentary structure of &quot;P. polycephalum&quot; forming a network to food sources is similar to the large scale galaxy filament structure of the universe. This observation has led astronomers to use simulations based on the behaviour of slime molds to inform their search for dark matter.

=== Used as food ===

In central Mexico, the false puffball &quot;Enteridium lycoperdon&quot; was traditionally used as food; it was one of the species which mushroom-collectors or &quot;hongueros&quot; gathered on trips into the forest in the rainy season. One of its local names is &quot;cheese mushroom&quot;, so called for its texture and flavor when cooked. It was salted, wrapped in a maize leaf, and baked in the ashes of a campfire; or boiled and eaten with maize tortillas. &quot;Fuligo septica&quot; was similarly collected in Mexico, cooked with onions and peppers and eaten in a tortilla. In Ecuador, &quot;Lycogala epidendrum&quot; was called &quot;yakich&quot; and eaten raw as an appetizer.

=== In popular culture ===

Oscar Requejo and N. Floro Andres-Rodriguez suggest that &quot;Fuligo septica&quot; may have inspired Irvin Yeaworth&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;The Blob&quot;, in which a giant amoeba from space sets about engulfing people in a small American town.

<doc id="26737" wikidata="Q1412249" url="?curid=26737" title="Substitution splice">
<text>The substitution splice or stop trick is a cinematic special effect in which filmmakers achieve an appearance, disappearance, or transformation by altering one or more selected aspects of the mise-en-scène between two shots
while maintaining the same framing and other aspects of the scene in both shots. The effect is usually polished by careful editing to establish a seamless cut and optimal moment of change. It has also been referred to as stop motion substitution or stop-action.

The pioneering French filmmaker Georges Méliès claimed to have accidentally developed the stop trick, as he wrote in &quot;Les Vues Cinématographiques&quot; in 1907 (translated from French):
According to the film scholar Jacques Deslandes, it is more likely that Méliès discovered the trick by carefully examining a print of the Edison Manufacturing Company&#x27;s 1895 film &quot;The Execution of Mary Stuart&quot;, in which a primitive version of the trick appears. In any case, the substitution splice was both the first special effect Méliès perfected, and the most important in his body of work.

Film historians such as Richard Abel and Elizabeth Ezra established that much of the effect was the result of Méliès&#x27;s careful frame matching during the editing process, creating a seamless match cut out of two separately staged shots. Indeed, Méliès often used substitution splicing not as an obvious special effect, but as an inconspicuous editing technique, matching and combining short takes into one apparently seamless longer shot. Substitution splicing could become even more seamless when the film was colored by hand, as many of Méliès&#x27;s films were; the addition of painted color acts as a sleight of hand technique allowing the cuts to pass by unnoticed.

The substitution splice was the most popular cinematic special effect in trick films and early film fantasies, especially those that evolved from the stage tradition of the &quot;féerie&quot;. Segundo de Chomón is among the other filmmakers who used substitution splicing to create elaborate fantasy effects. D.W. Griffith&#x27;s 1909 film &quot;The Curtain Pole&quot;, starring Mack Sennett, used substitution splices for comedic effect. The transformations made possible by the substitution splice were so central to early fantasy films that, in France, such films were often described simply as &quot;scènes à transformation&quot;.

This technique is different from the stop motion technique, in which the entire shot is created frame by frame.

<text>Scandinavia is a subregion of northern Europe, with strong historical, cultural, and linguistic ties between its constituent peoples. &quot;Scandinavia&quot; most commonly refers to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. It can sometimes also refer to the Scandinavian Peninsula (which excludes Denmark but includes a part of northern Finland). In English usage, Scandinavia is sometimes used as a synonym for Nordic countries. Iceland and the Faroe Islands are sometimes included in Scandinavia for their ethnolinguistic relations with Sweden, Norway and Denmark. While Finland differs from other Nordic countries in this respect, some authors call it Scandinavian due to its economic and cultural similarities.

The geography of the region is varied, from the Norwegian fjords in the west and Scandinavian mountains covering parts of Norway and Sweden, to the low and flat areas of Denmark in the south, as well as archipelagos and lakes in the east. Most of the population in the region live in the more temperate southern regions, with the northern parts having long, cold winters.

During the Viking Age Scandinavian peoples participated in large-scale raiding, conquest, colonization and trading mostly throughout Europe. They also used their longships for exploration, becoming the first Europeans to reach North America. These exploits saw the establishment of the North Sea Empire which comprised large parts of Scandinavia and Great Britain, though it was relatively short-lived. Scandinavia was eventually Christianized, and the coming centuries saw various unions of Scandinavian nations, most notably the Kalmar Union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, which lasted for over 100 years until the Swedish king Gustav I led Sweden out of the union. Denmark and Norway, as well as Schleswig-Holstein, were then united until 1814 as Denmark–Norway. Numerous wars between the nations followed, which shaped the modern borders and led to the establishment of the Swedish Empire in the 17th and early 18th centuries. The most recent Scandinavian union was the union between Sweden and Norway, which ended in 1905.

In modern times the region has prospered, with the economies of the countries being amongst the strongest in Europe. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Finland all maintain welfare systems considered to be generous, with the economic and social policies of the countries being dubbed the &quot;Nordic model&quot;.

== Geography ==
The geography of Scandinavia is extremely varied. Notable are the Norwegian fjords, the Scandinavian Mountains covering much of Norway and parts of Sweden, the flat, low areas in Denmark and the archipelagos of Finland, Norway and Sweden. Finland and Sweden have many lakes and moraines, legacies of the ice age, which ended about ten millennia ago.

The southern regions of Scandinavia, which are also the most populous regions, have a temperate climate. Scandinavia extends north of the Arctic Circle, but has relatively mild weather for its latitude due to the Gulf Stream. Many of the Scandinavian mountains have an alpine tundra climate.

The climate varies from north to south and from west to east: a marine west coast climate (Cfb) typical of western Europe dominates in Denmark, the southernmost part of Sweden and along the west coast of Norway reaching north to 65°N, with orographic lift giving more mm/year precipitation (&lt;5000 mm) in some areas in western Norway. The central part – from Oslo to Stockholm – has a humid continental climate (Dfb), which gradually gives way to subarctic climate (Dfc) further north and cool marine west coast climate (Cfc) along the northwestern coast. A small area along the northern coast east of the North Cape has tundra climate (Et) as a result of a lack of summer warmth. The Scandinavian Mountains block the mild and moist air coming from the southwest, thus northern Sweden and the Finnmarksvidda plateau in Norway receive little precipitation and have cold winters. Large areas in the Scandinavian mountains have alpine tundra climate.

The warmest temperature ever recorded in Scandinavia is 38.0 °C in Målilla (Sweden). The coldest temperature ever recorded is −52.6 °C in Vuoggatjålme, Arjeplog (Sweden). The coldest month was February 1985 in Vittangi (Sweden) with a mean of −27.2 °C.

Southwesterly winds further warmed by foehn wind can give warm temperatures in narrow Norwegian fjords in winter. Tafjord has recorded 17.9 °C in January and Sunndal 18.9 °C in February.

== Scandinavia as a concept ==

=== Etymology ===

The words &quot;Scandinavia&quot; and &quot;Scania&quot; (&quot;Skåne&quot;, the southernmost province of Sweden) are both thought to go back to the Proto-Germanic compound (the &quot;ð&quot; represented in Latin by or ), which appears later in Old English as and in Old Norse as . The earliest identified source for the name &quot;Scandinavia&quot; is Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot;, dated to the 1st century AD.

Various references to the region can also be found in Pytheas, Pomponius Mela, Tacitus, Ptolemy, Procopius and Jordanes, usually in the form of &quot;Scandza&quot;. It is believed that the name used by Pliny may be of West Germanic origin, originally denoting Scania. According to some scholars, the Germanic stem can be reconstructed as , meaning &quot;danger&quot; or &quot;damage&quot;. The second segment of the name has been reconstructed as , meaning &quot;land on the water&quot; or &quot;island&quot;. The name &quot;Scandinavia&quot; would then mean &quot;dangerous island&quot;, which is considered to refer to the treacherous sandbanks surrounding Scania. Skanör in Scania, with its long Falsterbo reef, has the same stem () combined with -, which means &quot;sandbanks&quot;.

Alternatively, &quot;Sca(n)dinavia&quot; and , along with the Old Norse goddess name , may be related to Proto-Germanic (meaning &quot;shadow&quot;). John McKinnell comments that this etymology suggests that the goddess Skaði may have once been a personification of the geographical region of Scandinavia or associated with the underworld.

Another possibility is that all or part of the segments of the name came from the pre-Germanic Mesolithic people inhabiting the region. In modernity, Scandinavia is a peninsula, but between approximately 10,300 and 9,500 years ago the southern part of Scandinavia was an island separated from the northern peninsula, with water exiting the Baltic Sea through the area where Stockholm is now located.

==== Appearance in medieval Germanic languages ====
The Latin names in Pliny&#x27;s text gave rise to different forms in medieval Germanic texts. In Jordanes&#x27; history of the Goths (AD 551), the form is the name used for their original home, separated by sea from the land of Europe (chapter 1, 4). Where Jordanes meant to locate this quasi-legendary island is still a hotly debated issue, both in scholarly discussions and in the nationalistic discourse of various European countries. The form as the original home of the Langobards appears in Paul the Deacon&#x27; &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot;, but in other versions of &quot;Historia Langobardorum&quot; appear the forms , , and . Frankish sources used and Aethelweard, an Anglo-Saxon historian, used . In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, the forms and are used while the Alfredian translation of Orosius and Wulfstan&#x27;s travel accounts used the Old English .

==== Possible influence on Sámi languages ====
The earliest Sámi joik texts written down refer to the world as in Northern Sámi and in Skolt Sámi, meaning &quot;Skaði&#x27;s island&quot;. Svennung considers the Sámi name to have been introduced as a loanword from the North Germanic languages; &quot;Skaði&quot; is the jötunn stepmother of Freyr and Freyja in Norse mythology. It has been suggested that Skaði to some extent is modelled on a Sámi woman. The name for Skaði&#x27;s father Þjazi is known in Sámi as , &quot;the waterman&quot;; and her son with Odin, Sæmingr, can be interpreted as a descendant of , the Sámi population. Older joik texts give evidence of the old Sámi belief about living on an island and state that the wolf is known as , meaning &quot;the strong one on the island&quot;. The Sámi place name means &quot;the island&#x27;s threshold&quot; and &quot;Suoločielgi&quot; means &quot;the island&#x27;s back&quot;.

In recent substrate studies, Sámi linguists have examined the initial cluster - in words used in the Sámi languages and concluded that - is a phonotactic structure of alien origin.

=== Reintroduction of the term &quot;Scandinavia&quot; in the 18th century ===

Although the term &quot;Scandinavia&quot; used by Pliny the Elder probably originated in the ancient Germanic languages, the modern form &quot;Scandinavia&quot; does not descend directly from the ancient Germanic term. Rather the word was brought into use in Europe by scholars borrowing the term from ancient sources like Pliny, and was used vaguely for Scania and the southern region of the peninsula.

The term was popularised by the linguistic and cultural Scandinavist movement, which asserted the common heritage and cultural unity of the Scandinavian countries and rose to prominence in the 1830s. The popular usage of the term in Sweden, Denmark and Norway as a unifying concept became established in the 19th century through poems such as Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s &quot;I am a Scandinavian&quot; of 1839. After a visit to Sweden, Andersen became a supporter of early political Scandinavism. In a letter describing the poem to a friend, he wrote: &quot;All at once I understood how related the Swedes, the Danes and the Norwegians are, and with this feeling I wrote the poem immediately after my return: &#x27;We are one people, we are called Scandinavians!.

The influence of Scandinavism as a Scandinavist political movement peaked in the middle of the 19th century, between the First Schleswig War (1848–1850) and the Second Schleswig War (1864).

The Swedish king also proposed a unification of Denmark, Norway and Sweden into a single united kingdom. The background for the proposal was the tumultuous events during the Napoleonic Wars in the beginning of the century. This war resulted in Finland (formerly the eastern third of Sweden) becoming the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809 and Norway (&quot;de jure&quot; in union with Denmark since 1387, although &quot;de facto&quot; treated as a province) becoming independent in 1814, but thereafter swiftly forced to accept a personal union with Sweden. The dependent territories Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, historically part of Norway, remained with Denmark in accordance with the Treaty of Kiel. Sweden and Norway were thus united under the Swedish monarch, but Finland&#x27;s inclusion in the Russian Empire excluded any possibility for a political union between Finland and any of the other Nordic countries.

The end of the Scandinavian political movement came when Denmark was denied the military support promised from Sweden and Norway to annex the (Danish) Duchy of Schleswig, which together with the (German) Duchy of Holstein had been in personal union with Denmark. The Second war of Schleswig followed in 1864, a brief but disastrous war between Denmark and Prussia (supported by Austria). Schleswig-Holstein was conquered by Prussia and after Prussia&#x27;s success in the Franco-Prussian War a Prussian-led German Empire was created and a new power-balance in the Baltic region was established. The Scandinavian Monetary Union, established in 1873, lasted until World War I.

=== Use of &quot;Nordic countries&quot; vs. &quot;Scandinavia&quot; ===
The term &quot;Scandinavia&quot; (sometimes specified in English as &quot;Continental Scandinavia&quot; or &quot;mainland Scandinavia&quot;) is ordinarily used locally for Denmark, Norway and Sweden as a subset of the Nordic countries (known in Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish as ; , , ).

However, in English usage, the term &quot;Scandinavia&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym or near-synonym for what are known locally as &quot;Nordic countries&quot;.

Usage in English is different from usage in the Scandinavian languages themselves (which use &quot;Scandinavia&quot; in the narrow meaning), and by the fact that the question of whether a country belongs to Scandinavia is politicised. People from the Nordic world beyond Norway, Denmark and Sweden may be offended at being either included in or excluded from the category of &quot;Scandinavia&quot;.

&quot;Nordic countries&quot; is used unambiguously for Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, including their associated territories Greenland, the Faroe Islands and the Åland Islands.

The geological term &quot;Fennoscandia&quot; (sometimes &quot;Fennoscandinavia&quot;) refers to the Fennoscandian Shield (or &quot;Baltic Shield&quot;), which includes the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland and Karelia, and excludes Denmark and other parts of the wider Nordic world. The terms &quot;Fennoscandia&quot; and &quot;Fennoscandinavia&quot; are sometimes used in a political sense to refer to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland.

==== Different meanings of the term &quot;Scandinavian&quot; ====
The term &quot;Scandinavian&quot; may be used with two principal meanings, in an ethnic or cultural sense and as a modern and more inclusive demonym.

In the ethnic or cultural sense, the term &quot;Scandinavian&quot; traditionally refers to speakers of Scandinavian languages, who are mainly descendants of the peoples historically known as Norsemen, but also to some extent of immigrants and others who have been assimilated into that culture and language. In this sense the term refers primarily to native Danes, Norwegians and Swedes as well as descendants of Scandinavian settlers such as the Icelanders and the Faroese. The term is also used in this ethnic sense, to refer to the modern descendants of the Norse, in studies of linguistics and culture.

Additionally the term Scandinavian is used demonymically to refer to all modern inhabitants or citizens of Scandinavian countries. Within Scandinavia the demonymic term primarily refers to inhabitants or citizens of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In English usage inhabitants or citizens of Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Finland are sometimes included as well. English general dictionaries often define the noun &quot;Scandinavian&quot; demonymically as meaning any inhabitant of Scandinavia (which might be narrowly conceived or broadly conceived).

There is a certain ambiguity and political contestation as to which peoples should be referred to as Scandinavian in this broader sense. Sámi people who live in Norway and Sweden are generally included as Scandinavians in the demonymic sense; the Sámi of Finland may be included in English usage, but usually not in local usage; the Sámi of Russia are not included. However, the use of the term &quot;Scandinavian&quot; with reference to the Sámi is complicated by the historical attempts by Scandinavian majority peoples and governments in Norway and Sweden to assimilate the Sámi people into the Scandinavian culture and languages, making the inclusion of the Sámi as &quot;Scandinavians&quot; controversial among many Sámi. Modern Sámi politicians and organizations often stress the status of the Sámi as a people separate from and equal to the Scandinavians, with their own language and culture, and are apprehensive about being included as &quot;Scandinavians&quot; in light of earlier Scandinavian assimilation policies.

== Languages ==
Two language groups have coexisted on the Scandinavian Peninsula since prehistory—the North Germanic languages (Scandinavian languages) and the Uralic languages, Sámi and Finnish.

Most people in Scandinavia today speak Scandinavian languages that evolved from Old Norse, originally spoken by ancient Germanic tribes in southern Scandinavia. The Continental Scandinavian languages—Danish, Norwegian and Swedish—form a dialect continuum and are considered mutually intelligible. The Insular Scandinavian languages—Faroese and Icelandic—on the other hand, are only partially intelligible to speakers of the continental Scandinavian languages.

The Uralic languages are linguistically unrelated to the Scandinavian languages. Finnish is the majority language in Finland, and a recognized minority language in Sweden. Meänkieli and Kven, sometimes considered as dialects of Finnish, are recognized minority languages in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The Sámi languages are indigenous minority languages in Scandinavia, spoken by the Sámi people in northern Scandinavia.

=== North Germanic languages ===
The North Germanic languages of Scandinavia are traditionally divided into an East Scandinavian branch (Danish and Swedish) and a West Scandinavian branch (Norwegian, Icelandic and Faroese), but because of changes appearing in the languages since 1600 the East Scandinavian and West Scandinavian branches are now usually reconfigured into Insular Scandinavian (/) featuring Icelandic and Faroese and Continental Scandinavian (), comprising Danish, Norwegian and Swedish.

The modern division is based on the degree of mutual comprehensibility between the languages in the two branches. The populations of the Scandinavian countries, with common Scandinavian roots in language, can—at least with some training—understand each other&#x27;s standard languages as they appear in print and are heard on radio and television.

The reason Danish, Swedish and the two official written versions of Norwegian (&quot;Nynorsk&quot; and &quot;Bokmål&quot;) are traditionally viewed as different languages, rather than dialects of one common language, is that each is a well-established standard language in its respective country.

Danish, Swedish and Norwegian have since medieval times been influenced to varying degrees by Middle Low German and standard German. That influence was due not only to proximity, but also to the rule of Denmark—and later Denmark-Norway—over the German-speaking region of Holstein, and to Sweden&#x27;s close trade with the Hanseatic League.

Norwegians are accustomed to variation and may perceive Danish and Swedish only as slightly more distant dialects. This is because they have two official written standards, in addition to the habit of strongly holding on to local dialects. The people of Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark have the greatest difficulty in understanding other Scandinavian languages. In the Faroe Islands and Iceland, learning Danish is mandatory. This causes Faroese people as well as Icelandic people to become bilingual in two very distinct North Germanic languages, making it relatively easy for them to understand the other two Mainland Scandinavian languages.

Although Iceland was under the political control of Denmark until a much later date (1918), very little influence and borrowing from Danish has occurred in the Icelandic language. Icelandic remained the preferred language among the ruling classes in Iceland. Danish was not used for official communications, most of the royal officials were of Icelandic descent and the language of the church and law courts remained Icelandic.

=== Uralic languages ===
==== Finnish ====

The Scandinavian languages are (as a language family) unrelated to Finnish and the Sámi languages, which as Uralic languages are distantly related each other. Owing to the close proximity, there is still a great deal of borrowing from the Swedish and Norwegian languages in Finnish and the Sámi. The long history of linguistic influence of Swedish on Finnish is also due to the fact that Swedish was the dominant language when Finland was part of Sweden. Finnish-speakers had to learn Swedish in order to advance to higher positions. Swedish spoken in today&#x27;s Finland includes a lot of words that are borrowed from Finnish, whereas the written language remains closer to that of Sweden.

Finland is officially bilingual, with Finnish and Swedish having mostly the same status at national level. Finland&#x27;s majority population are Finns, whose mother tongue is either Finnish (approximately 95%), Swedish or both. The Swedish-speakers live mainly on the coastline starting from approximately the city of Porvoo (Sw: Borgå) (in the Gulf of Finland) up to the city of Kokkola (Sw: Karleby) (in the Bay of Bothnia). The Swedish-speaking population is spread out in pockets in this coastal stretch and constitutes approximately 5% of the Finnish population. The coastal province of Ostrobothnia has a Swedish-speaking majority, whereas plenty of areas on this coastline are nearly unilingually Finnish, like the region of Satakunta. Åland, an autonomous province of Finland situated in the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden, are entirely Swedish-speaking. Children are taught the other official language at school: for Swedish-speakers this is Finnish (usually from the 3rd grade), while for Finnish-speakers it is Swedish (usually from the 3rd, 5th or 7th grade).

Finnish speakers constitute a language minority in Sweden and Norway. Meänkieli and Kven are Finnish dialects spoken in Swedish Lapland and Norwegian Lapland.

==== Sámi languages ====
The Sámi languages are indigenous minority languages in Scandinavia. They belong to their own branch of the Uralic language family and are unrelated to the North Germanic languages other than by limited grammatical (particularly lexical) characteristics resulting from prolonged contact. Sámi is divided into several languages or dialects. Consonant gradation is a feature in both Finnish and northern Sámi dialects, but it is not present in southern Sámi, which is considered to have a different language history. According to the Sámi Information Centre of the Sámi Parliament of Sweden, southern Sámi may have originated in an earlier migration from the south into the Scandinavian Peninsula.

=== Other languages ===
German is a recognized minority language in Denmark. Recent migration has added even more languages, apart from Sámi languages and variants of the majority language of a neighboring state, Yiddish, Romani Chib/Romanes, Scandoromani and Karelian are amongst the languages protected in parts of Scandinavia under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

== History ==
=== Ancient descriptions ===
A key ancient description of Scandinavia was provided by Pliny the Elder, though his mentions of and surrounding areas are not always easy to decipher. Writing in the capacity of a Roman admiral, he introduces the northern region by declaring to his Roman readers that there are 23 islands &quot;Romanis armis cognitae&quot; (&quot;known to Roman arms&quot;) in this area. According to Pliny, the &quot;clarissima&quot; (&quot;most famous&quot;) of the region&#x27;s islands is , of unknown size. There live the &quot;Hilleviones&quot;. The belief that Scandinavia was an island became widespread among classical authors during the 1st century and dominated descriptions of Scandinavia in classical texts during the centuries that followed.

Pliny begins his description of the route to by referring to the mountain of Saevo (), the Codanus Bay (&quot;Codanus sinus&quot;) and the Cimbrian promontory. The geographical features have been identified in various ways. By some scholars, is thought to be the mountainous Norwegian coast at the entrance to Skagerrak and the Cimbrian peninsula is thought to be Skagen, the north tip of Jutland, Denmark. As described, and can also be the same place.

Pliny mentions Scandinavia one more time: in Book VIII he says that the animal called (given in the accusative, , which is not Latin) was born on the island of Scandinavia. The animal grazes, has a big upper lip and some mythical attributes.

The name , later used as a synonym for , also appears in Pliny&#x27;s (&quot;Natural History&quot;), but is used for a group of Northern European islands which he locates north of Britannia. thus does not appear to be denoting the island Scadinavia in Pliny&#x27;s text. The idea that may have been one of the islands was instead introduced by Ptolemy (), a mathematician, geographer and astrologer of Roman Egypt. He used the name for the biggest, most easterly of the three islands, which according to him were all located east of Jutland.

=== Viking Age ===

The Viking age in Scandinavia lasted from approximately 793–1066 AD and saw Scandinavians participate in large scale raiding, colonization, conquest and trading throughout Europe and beyond. The period saw a big expansion of Scandinavian-conquered territory and of exploration. Utilizing their advanced longships, they reached as far as North America, being the first Europeans to do so. During this time Scandinavians were drawn to wealthy towns, monasteries and petty kingdoms overseas in places such as the British Isles, Ireland, the Baltic coast and Normandy, all of which made profitable targets for raids. Scandinavians, primarily from modern day Sweden, known as Varangians also ventured east into what is now Russia raiding along river trade routes. During this period unification also took place between different Scandinavian kingdoms culminating in the peak of the North Sea Empire which included large parts of Scandinavia and Great Britain.

This expansion and conquest led to the formation of several kingdoms, earldoms and settlements throughout Europe such as the Kingdom of the Isles, Earldom of Orkney, Scandinavian York, Danelaw, Kingdom of Dublin, the Duchy of Normandy and the Kievan Rus&#x27;. The Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland were also settled by the Scandinavians during this time. The Normans, Rus&#x27; people, Faroe Islanders, Icelanders and Norse-Gaels all emerged from these Scandinavian expansions.

=== The Middle Ages ===
During a period of Christianization and state formation in the 10th–13th centuries, numerous Germanic petty kingdoms and chiefdoms were unified into three kingdoms:

* Denmark, forged from the lands of Denmark (including Jutland, Zealand and Scania (Skåneland) on the Scandinavian Peninsula)
* Sweden, forged from the lands of Sweden on the Scandinavian Peninsula (including most of modern Finland, but excluding the provinces Bohuslän, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Idre and Särna, Halland, Blekinge and Scania of modern-day Sweden)
* Norway (including Bohuslän, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Idre and Särna on the Scandinavian Peninsula and its island colonies Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Shetland, Orkney, Isle of Man and the Hebrides)

According to historian Sverre Bagge, the divisions into three Scandinavian kingdoms (Denmark, Sweden, Norway) makes sense geographically, as forests, mountains, and uninhabited land divided them from one another. Control of Norway was enabled through seapower, whereas control of the great lakes in Sweden enabled control of the kingdom, and control of Jutland was sufficient to control Denmark. The most contested area was the coastline from Oslo to Öresund, where the three kingdoms met.

The three Scandinavian kingdoms joined in 1397 in the Kalmar Union under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. Sweden left the union in 1523 under King Gustav I of Sweden. In the aftermath of Sweden&#x27;s secession from the Kalmar Union, civil war broke out in Denmark and Norway—the Protestant Reformation followed. When things had settled, the Norwegian privy council was abolished—it assembled for the last time in 1537. A personal union, entered into by the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway in 1536, lasted until 1814. Three sovereign successor states have subsequently emerged from this unequal union: Denmark, Norway and Iceland.

The borders between Denmark, Norway and Sweden acquired their present shape in the middle of the 17th century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway ceded the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre and Särna, as well as the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia) to Sweden. The Treaty of Roskilde, signed in 1658, forced Denmark–Norway to cede the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. The 1660 Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to return Bornholm and Trøndelag to Denmark–Norway, and to give up its recent claims to the island Funen.

In the east, Finland was a fully incorporated part of Sweden from medieval times until the Napoleonic wars, when it was ceded to Russia. Despite many wars over the years since the formation of the three kingdoms, Scandinavia has been politically and culturally close.

=== Scandinavian unions ===

Denmark–Norway as a historiographical name refers to the former political union consisting of the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, including the Norwegian dependencies of Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The corresponding adjective and demonym is Dano-Norwegian. During Danish rule, Norway kept its separate laws, coinage and army as well as some institutions such as a royal chancellor. Norway&#x27;s old royal line had died out with the death of Olav IV in 1387, but Norway&#x27;s remaining a hereditary kingdom became an important factor for the Oldenburg dynasty of Denmark–Norway in its struggles to win elections as kings of Denmark.

The Treaty of Kiel (14 January 1814) formally dissolved the Dano-Norwegian union and ceded the territory of Norway proper to the King of Sweden, but Denmark retained Norway&#x27;s overseas possessions. However, widespread Norwegian resistance to the prospect of a union with Sweden induced the governor of Norway, crown prince Christian Frederick (later Christian VIII of Denmark), to call a constituent assembly at Eidsvoll in April 1814. The assembly drew up a liberal constitution and elected Christian Frederick to the throne of Norway. Following a Swedish invasion during the summer, the peace conditions of the Convention of Moss (14 August 1814) specified that king Christian Frederik had to resign, but Norway would keep its independence and its constitution within a personal union with Sweden. Christian Frederik formally abdicated on 10 August 1814 and returned to Denmark. The Norwegian parliament Storting elected king Charles XIII of Sweden as king of Norway on 4 November.

The Storting dissolved the union between Sweden and Norway in 1905, after which the Norwegians elected Prince Charles of Denmark as king of Norway: he reigned as Haakon VII.

== Economy ==

Measured in per capita GDP, the Nordic countries are among the richest in the world. There is a generous welfare system in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

=== Tourism ===
Various promotional agencies of the Nordic countries such as the Norwegian Trekking Association, the Swedish Tourist Association, and in the United States (The American-Scandinavian Foundation established in 1910 by the Danish American industrialist Niels Poulsen) serve to promote market and tourism interests in the region. Today, the five Nordic heads of state act as the organization&#x27;s patrons and according to the official statement by the organization its mission is &quot;to promote the Nordic region as a whole while increasing the visibility of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden in New York City and the United States&quot;. The official tourist boards of Scandinavia sometimes cooperate under one umbrella, such as the Scandinavian Tourist Board. The cooperation was introduced for the Asian market in 1986, when the Swedish national tourist board joined the Danish national tourist board to coordinate intergovernmental promotion of the two countries. Norway&#x27;s government entered one year later. All five Nordic governments participate in the joint promotional efforts in the United States through the Scandinavian Tourist Board of North America.
