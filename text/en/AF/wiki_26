<doc id="25190" wikidata="Q1155440" url="?curid=25190" title="Politics of Qatar">
<text>The political system of Qatar runs under an authoritarian semi-constitutional monarchy with the emir as head of state and chief executive, and the prime minister as the head of government. Under the Constitution of Qatar, the partially-elected Consultative Assembly has a limited ability to reject legislation and dismiss ministers. The second general election was held in 2021; political parties are banned and all candidates have to run as independents.

The current hereditary emir of Qatar, Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, runs the country in an autocratic manner and holds nearly all executive and legislative authority, as well as controlling the judiciary. He appoints the prime minister and cabinet. Political rights are severely limited in Qatar as per Freedom House.

==Legal system==
Sharia law is a main source of Qatari legislation according to Qatar&#x27;s constitution. Sharia, derived from the Arabic term meaning &#x27;the path to follow,&#x27; supposedly constitutes a divine revelation conveyed by God to the Prophet Muhammad, the eminent figure in the establishment of Islam, during the year AD 570. Consequently, Sharia embodies a religious framework characterized by its origins and regulations. This legal system, seemingly unidirectional, emanates from God to the individual. The Islamic Sharia is regarded as the primary foundation, necessitating the formulation of legislative and judicial frameworks grounded in Islamic legal principles to govern transactions within Qatari law. Sharia law is applied to laws pertaining to family law, inheritance, and several criminal acts (including adultery, robbery and murder). In some cases in Sharia-based family courts, a female&#x27;s testimony is worth half a man&#x27;s and in some cases a female witness is not accepted at all. Codified family law was introduced in 2006. In practice, Qatar&#x27;s legal system is a mixture of civil law and Islamic law.

In 2016, Saudi Instagram star and model King Luxy was arrested in Qatar for allegedly being homosexual. He spent 2 months in custody before he was released. Qatari embassy in turn reported that he was arrested before departing from Qatar&#x27;s only civilian international airport for various charges having nothing to do with his sexual preference and counter-alleged him for intruding on the privacy of a Qatari citizen.

Stoning as a legal punishment had been repealed in Qatar. Apostasy is a crime punishable by the death penalty in Qatar. Blasphemy is punishable by up to seven years in prison and proselytizing can be punished by up to 10 years in prison. Homosexuality is a crime punishable by the death penalty for Muslims.

In 2014, Qatar launched a modesty campaign to remind tourists of the modest dress code. Female tourists are advised not to wear leggings, miniskirts, sleeveless dresses and short or tight clothing in public. Men are advised against wearing only shorts and singlets.

The UN Committee Against Torture found that these practices constituted a breach of the obligations imposed by the UN Convention Against Torture. Qatar retains the death penalty, mainly for threats against national security.

Commercial relationships are governed by Qatar&#x27;s Civil Code.

Qatar&#x27;s government has been criticized for arresting and threatening anyone who dares to speak out. In the report published by the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor on 13 September 2020, it was declared that Article 19 in the International Declaration of Human Rights stipulates that &quot;everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference.&quot; Similarly, Article 47 in the Constitution of Qatar stipulates that freedom of expression is guaranteed in accordance with the conditions and circumstances set forth in law.

===Alcohol===
Alcohol consumption is partially legal in Qatar, some five-star luxury hotels are allowed to sell alcohol to their non-Muslim customers. Muslims are not allowed to consume alcohol in Qatar and Muslims caught consuming alcohol are liable to flogging or deportation. Non-Muslim expatriates can obtain a permit to purchase alcohol for personal consumption. The Qatar Distribution Company (a subsidiary of Qatar Airways) is permitted to import alcohol and pork; it operates the one and only liquor store in the country, which also sells pork to holders of liquor licences. Qatari officials had also indicated a willingness to allow alcohol in &quot;fan zones&quot; at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Until recently, restaurants on The Pearl Island (a human-made island near Doha) were allowed to serve alcoholic drinks. In December 2011, however, restaurants on the Pearl were told to stop selling alcohol. No explanation was given for the ban. Speculation about the reason includes the government&#x27;s desire to project a more pious image in advance of the country&#x27;s first election of a royal advisory body and rumours of a financial dispute between the government and the resort&#x27;s developers. Despite the economic consequences of the ban, many believe that it has been a necessary measure in order to ensure the safety and enjoyment of fans at the World Cup. Qatar&#x27;s World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans&#x27; safety. The absence of alcohol has helped to create a more positive and enjoyable atmosphere at the event, with a more family-friendly environment being evident. The lack of alcohol had contributed to a less bawdy atmosphere around the games at the World Cup which led to a safer experience female fans at the tournament

===Workers===
In February 2022, The African Regional Organization of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC-Africa) welcomed the recent announcement by the Qatar government to abolish exit permits for migrant workers. ITUC commended Qatari government for the obvious show of genuine commitment towards meeting their pledge made to the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to effectively reform their labour laws so as to bring in conformity with ILO Conventions and other international statutes.

Cases of ill-treatment of immigrant labour have been observed. The Nepalese ambassador to Qatar, Maya Kumari Sharma, described the emirate as an &quot;open jail&quot;.
Qatar does not have national occupational health standards or guidelines, and workplace injuries are the third highest cause of accidental deaths. In May 2012, Qatari officials declared their intention to allow the establishment of an independent trade union. Qatar also announced it will scrap its sponsor system for foreign labour, which requires that all foreign workers be sponsored by local employers, who in some cases hold workers&#x27; passports and can deny them permission to change jobs.

In August 2022, 60 migrant workers were arrested and deported for protesting against the non-payment by their employer, Al Bandary International Group, a major construction and hospitality firm. Some of the demonstrators were from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Egypt and the Philippines had not been paid for seven months. According to a report published by France 24, those protesters were detained for breaching public security laws and minority of protesters were deported by the order of court who failed to remain peaceful and breached Qatar&#x27;s public security law. Qatar&#x27;s labour ministry said it will pay Al Bandary workers and will take further action against the company which was already under investigation for failing to pay wages.

==Executive branch==
Qatar is ruled by the House of Thani as a semi-constitutional hereditary monarchy. The head of state and chief executive is the emir. There is a prime minister (who serves as the head of government) and a cabinet appointed by the emir. Under the Constitution, the partially-elected Consultative Assembly can block legislation with a simple majority vote, and can dismiss ministers with a two-thirds vote. Two-thirds of the members are popularly elected, and the remainder are appointed by the emir.

Politically, Qatar is evolving from a traditional society into a modern welfare state. Government departments have been established to meet the requirements of social and economic progress. The Basic Law of Qatar 1970 institutionalized local customs rooted in Qatar&#x27;s conservative Islamic heritage, granting the Emir preeminent power. The Emir&#x27;s role is influenced by continuing traditions of consultation, rule by consensus, and the citizen&#x27;s right to appeal personally to the Emir. The Emir, while directly accountable to no one, cannot violate the Sharia (Islamic law) and, in practice, must consider the opinions of leading notables and the religious establishment. Their position was institutionalized in the Advisory Council, an appointed body that assists the Emir in formulating policy.

In February 1972, the heir apparent and Prime Minister, Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani, deposed his cousin, Emir Ahmad, and assumed power. This move was supported by the key members of Al Thani and took place without violence or signs of political unrest,

On 27 June 1995, the heir apparent, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, deposed his father, Emir Khalifa, in another bloodless coup. Emir Hamad and his father reconciled in 1996. Increased freedom of the press followed, and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera television channel (founded late 1996) is widely regarded as an example of an uncensored source of news in Arab countries. However, the network has been met with negative responses by the governments of many Arab states. However in May 2022, Al Jazeera network won the award for the best human rights journalism of the year in the eighth annual Amnesty Media Awards. The network was also claimed to be non-biased network by The Week (Washington DC media house) in November 2022.

On 25 June 2013, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani became the Emir of Qatar after his father Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani handed over power in a televised speech.

==Consultative Assembly==
The Consultative Assembly (&quot;Majlis ash-Shura&quot;) is a 45-member partially-elected legislature made up of 30 elected representatives and 15 appointed by the emir. Majlis ash-shura is the process of gathering community opinions, facilitated by knowledgeable individuals who provide their perspectives and ideas on significant questions, problems, or decisions associated with the social, economic, or political aspects of people&#x27;s lives. Elections were repeatedly delayed after the 2003 constitutional referendum introduced this framework. In 2006, Deputy Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani announced that elections would be held in 2007. However, only municipal elections were held. Due to voting laws, those who did not have family in the country pre-1930 were not allowed to vote. This excluded 75% of the population. The first general election was eventually held in October 2021.

==Political parties and elections==
Qatar held a constitutional referendum in 2003, which was overwhelmingly supported. The first municipal elections with men and women voters and candidates were held in 1999 Central Municipal Council. The first legislative election, for two thirds of the legislative council&#x27;s 45 seats, were planned for 2016 after previously being postponed in 2013. In June 2016 they were effectively postponed to at least 2019. The first general election of members of the Consultative Assembly was held in 2021.

Suffrage is currently limited to municipal elections and two thirds of the seats in the legislative council, with the voting age set at 18. Expatriate residents are excluded, as are the vast number of residents who are prevented from applying for citizenship. The elected Municipal Council has no executive powers but may offer advice to the Minister.
Political parties are banned by law. In 2024, Qatar held a constitutional referendum that introduced amendments to end elections for the Shura Council and allow naturalized citizens to be appointed as members and government ministers by removing the requirement of &quot;original&quot; nationality. The changes were presented as measures to promote national unity and stability while maintaining the Emir’s authority over appointments.

==Administrative divisions==

There are 8 municipalities (&quot;baladiyat&quot; , &quot;baladiyah&quot; ) of Qatar; Ad Dawhah, Al Daayen, Al Khor, Al Wakrah, Al Rayyan, Al-Shahaniya, Al Shamal, and Umm Salal. Each municipality assumes administrative responsibilities over zones (cities and districts) within their boundaries.

==Foreign relations==

Qatar’s core foreign policy objective according to The Middle East Journal is &quot;state survival&quot; and the &quot;desire for international prestige&quot;. Qatar became notable in international politics; and a key figure in the Arab affairs within two decades of its independent foreign policy. It has an &quot;open-door&quot; foreign policy where it maintain ties to all parties and regional players in the region, including with organizations such as Taliban and Hamas.

In May 2006, Qatar pledged more than $100 million to Hurricane Katrina relief to colleges and universities in Louisiana affected by the hurricane. Some of this money was also distributed to families looking to repair damaged homes by Neighborhood Housing Services of New Orleans, Inc.

There were some allegations on Qatar for supporting rebels group in Syria and association with al- Nusra front also persisted in country’s profile for a long time. However, the Public Policy and Democracy studies research think tank recognized the nation for its execution of current peace against conflicts strategies and policy upgrades. Other discoveries from the research claimed that Qatar supported the US against the Assad government. Additionally, the nation supported efforts to mediate a conflict-ending political transition in Syria. In March 2021, Qatar, Russia, and Turkey also started a different track of talks on the Syrian peace process.

The government and royal family of Qatar funds the Al Jazeera television network. The Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalfia provided a loan of QAR 500 million (USD 137 million) to start the channel. The network has been accused of being biased and taking an active role in the affairs of other countries specifically during the Arab Spring in 2011. Numerous countries have complained about allegedly biased reporting in support of Qatar policy. On 11 January 2015, The Week published a report in which,Al jazeera network was revealed to be non biased and non terrorist network.

On July 10, 2017, according to documents obtained by Al Arabiya, Qatar agreed to quit supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. In order to avoid undermining relations with the Gulf, it also removed non-citizens from Qatar and refused to provide shelter to anyone from a GCC nation.

Qatar claims that &quot;since 2017, Qatar feels it has been the victim of a media attack orchestrated by Abu Dhabi, with false documents and fake news.&quot; The Qatari Government stated that they were being &quot;exclusively criticised and attacked&quot; by Belgian authorities and conveyed disappointment that the Belgian government &quot;made no effort to engage with our government to establish the facts&quot;.

In January 2021 the United States, represented by the United States Department of Defense, awarded Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani with the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, one of the highest honors bestowed by the US to officials. The then US National Security Adviser Robert C. O&#x27;Brien gave the medal to the Ambassador of Qatar to the US Sheikh Meshaal bin Hamad Al Thani, on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani.

Davis and Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker before boarding a plane to Washington, D.C.. U.S. President Biden thanked Sheik Tamim and Qatari officials for their role in the mediation as well as establishing a &quot;Humantarian channel&quot; for Iran. The US$6 billion were released to banks in Doha under the condition that Iran could use the funds only for humanitarian purposes.

<doc id="25191" wikidata="Q2092906" url="?curid=25191" title="Economy of Qatar">
<text>The economy of Qatar is one of the highest in the world based on GDP per capita, ranking generally among the top ten richest countries on world rankings for 2015 and 2016 data compiled by the World Bank, the United Nations, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The country&#x27;s economy has grown despite sanctions by its neighbors, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Mainly because the country exports primarily to Japan, South Korea, India and China, making the sanctions effectively redundant as neither Saudi Arabia nor the United Arab Emirates have imposed trading penalties such as tariffs or embargoes on any of these countries for trading with Qatar, or offering incentives such as discounts for their own energy exports to reduce Qatari exports.

Petroleum and natural gas are the cornerstones of Qatar&#x27;s economy and account for more than 70% of total government revenue, more than 60% of gross domestic product, and roughly 85% of export earnings. Qatar has the world&#x27;s third largest proven natural gas reserve and is the third-largest exporter of natural gas.

Qatar’s economy has been shaped by a unique development model that leverages revenues from its natural gas and oil sectors to drive modernization and economic diversification. Through initiatives like Qatar National Vision 2030, the country aims to reduce its reliance on hydrocarbons while promoting sustainability, human development, and private sector growth. This strategy includes significant investment in state-led projects, such as infrastructure development and sovereign wealth funds, which have supported diversification and global competitiveness. Qatar’s approach distinguishes it from traditional resource-dependent states by prioritizing strategic investments and fostering a diversified, knowledge-based economy. This model emphasizes sustainability, innovation, and global competitiveness, reflecting a long-term commitment to development and economic resilience that extends beyond reliance on natural resource wealth.

==Energy sector==

Before the emergence of petrol-based industry, Qatar was a poor pearl diving country. The exploration of oil and gas fields began in 1939. In 1973, oil production and revenues increased dramatically, moving Qatar out of the ranks of the world&#x27;s poorest countries and providing it with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.

Qatar&#x27;s economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) quotas on crude oil production, the lower price for oil, and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government&#x27;s spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from Egypt and South Asia, have grown again.

Oil production will not long remain at peak levels of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m³) per day, as oil fields are projected to be mostly depleted by 2023. However, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar&#x27;s northeast coast. These offshore gas fields also may contain significant oil and condensate reserves. For example, the state owned QatarEnergy corporation found two offshore oil fields in the 1960s. At the time production was too expensive. However, technological development led to production over 30 years later.

The gas condensate can be refined to usual oil products in specialised refineries. The costs are a bit higher but it is normal today for companies to use the gas condensate too. Oil offshore production in 2008 for PS-2 and PS-3 blocks was about 31.1 million barrels (84,995 b/d). Joint Ventures facilities (PS-1, ALK, K &amp; A): Combined oil production from these three joint venture production facilities in 2008 was 57.4 million barrels (156,873 b/d). Like with gas fields there are more offshore blocks which need to be explored and could increase the oil output. So the 500,000 bpd peak and a depletion in 2023 is delayed. With higher oil prices it is expected that the offshore exploration of oil and/or natural gas fields will go on. Oil production in June 2016 seemed to be around 670,000 barrels per day, a bit down from February 2016 production of 692,000 barrels per day. Taking all liquids together Qatar is already far beyond a million barrels per day.

Qatar&#x27;s proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 7000 km3 (250 trillion cubic feet). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.

Qatar&#x27;s heavy industrial projects, all based in Umm Said, include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m³) per day capacity, a fertilizer plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned QatarEnergy corporation (formerly QGPC). The U.S. is the major equipment supplier for Qatar&#x27;s oil and gas industry, and U.S. companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.

Qatar pursues a vigorous program of &quot;Qatarization&quot;, under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the U.S., are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. In order to control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programs over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar&#x27;s strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.

==Industry==
The government considers industry to be an integral part of its plan to diversify the economy and maximize its huge natural gas reserves, which serve as the primary feed stock for the sector. Accordingly, careful planning has gone into industrial development. With an eye towards exports, development has been clustered around the ports of Ras Laffan Industrial City and Mesaieed Industrial Area, which are key centers of energy. The result has seen considerable growth over the years. Industries Qatar (IQ), a producer of petrochemicals, fertilizers and steel, is a regional powerhouse, surpassed only in size by Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC), the Middle East&#x27;s largest chemical producer. In 2007 the manufacturing sector made the third-largest contribution to GDP among non-oil and gas sectors, equivalent to about 7.5% of GDP. Industry in Qatar is regulated by the Ministry of Business and Trade.

Petrochemicals and fertilizers supply make up a large portion of the industrial base, along with steel and other construction materials, through Qatar Steel and Qatar Primary Material Company (QPMC). Indeed, over the past few years, demand for construction materials experienced a major surge as the development boom swept the Persian Gulf region. But the global financial crisis has put a significant dent in demand in the region, as project credit lines dry up and investor sentiment remains cautious. The crisis has in fact impacted the whole of the industrial sector – IQ saw its net profit drop in the fourth quarter of 2008 more than 90% over the same period the previous year. But in relative terms, the sector has fared better than most and IQ still managed to post an annual profit of $2bn. Large profit chunks from years past have been channeled into capital investments, which should help the sector ride out the storm. IQ, for example, is pushing several major expansion projects, worth almost $6bn, ahead. 

=== North Field LNG project ===

On 8 February 2021, the world&#x27;s largest LNG supplier, Qatar Petroleum (now QatarEnergy), signed an EPC-contract with Chiyoda and Technip for the North Field East (NFE) expansion project to increase QE&#x27;s annually LNG output by 40% until 2026. For the $28.7 billion NFE expansion project, QatarEnergy has partnered with five global energy companies that have acquired 25% stake in the project. These include Shell, TotalEnergies and ExxonMobil, each with 6.25%, and Eni and ConocoPhillips, each with 3.125% stakes. In a first phase, LNG export capacity is expected to increase from 77 million tons per year to 110 million tons per year by 2026.

On 20 June 2022, Minister of State for Energy Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi said at a press conference at the QatarEnergy that the expected production increase from this project will be 32.6 million tonnes annually. Ethane produced from the project would be 1.5 million tonnes per year, LPG 4 million tonnes per year, 250.000 barrels of condensate and 5.000 tonnes of helium per day.

In a second phase, the North Field South (NFS) project, Shell and TotalEnergies have each acquired 9.375% and ConocoPhillips 6.25% stakes. QatarEnergy plans to increase LNG production with the NFS project to 126 million tons per year beginning in 2028.

In April 2023, Sinopec acquired a 5% stake in an 8 million tonnes per year LNG train.

==Financial sector==

The Qatari banking sector managed to escape the direct impact of the global subprime fallout, but was not altogether unscathed by its aftershocks. Overall, it was the best performing of the Gulf Cooperation Council markets in the last quarter of 2008 and most banks posted substantial profits for 2008. But the sector is also facing issues of liquidity, declining customer confidence and a forced reluctance to lend. In a bid to strengthen the banks’ positions, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) announced in early 2009 that it was willing to take a 10-20% stake in any interested local listed banks by way of a capital injection, although this was later reduced to 5% stakes and an additional 5% at the end of 2009.

The Qatari government also announced in March 2009 that it was planning to buy the investment portfolio of the banks in the hope this would encourage them to continue lending. Cautious sector sentiment has also been compounded by the Qatar Central Bank&#x27;s (QCB&#x27;s) lending restrictions, which demand a loan-to-deposit ratio of 90%. Given the high level of integration between Qatar&#x27;s economy and the Persian Gulf region, as well as the wider world, a slowdown in business and banking activity seemed inevitable. Nevertheless, Qatar&#x27;s banking sector has been faring relatively well, considering the strife experienced in other countries, and insiders are confident that activity will return to its previous brisk pace in the second half of 2009 as confidence slowly rebuilds around the globe.

The International Monetary Fund in its spring assessment 2019 said that Qatar has &quot;successfully absorbed the shocks&quot; of the blockade imposed in 2017 and the dropped oil prices from 2014 to 2016. S&amp;P Global had marked Qatar&#x27;s outlook to negative in 2017, but changed it to stable in 2019.

In August 2019, Qatar Central Bank stated that the country&#x27;s economic growth will see a boost over the next two years amid expectations of stable oil prices and continued strong exports. The GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 2.8% between 2018 and 2020, with the budget surplus falling to 4.35 billion riyals in 2019, from a surplus of 15.1 billion riyals in 2018.

Qatar&#x27;s GDP is anticipated to scale up to $208 billion in 2024 from $162 billion in 2022, according to a report by FocusEconomics. The World Bank has projected Qatar&#x27;s economy to be the fastest growing in the GCC in 2023 and 2024.

===Islamic finance===

The Islamic finance sector enjoyed increased activity in 2008 and is expected to continue to grow into 2009 as more sophisticated financial instruments spark the interest of investors. In addition to Islamic banks, such as Qatar Islamic Bank (QIB), Qatar International Islamic Bank (QIIB) and newcomer Masraf Al Rayyan, conventional banks have also been entering the sharia-compliant sector and are coming to view an Islamic subsidiary as a virtual necessity in order to maintain market standing. Islamic banks currently take the lion&#x27;s share of sharia-compliant business, though the conventional banks are working hard to take a greater share of market activity. Both Islamic banks and Islamic subsidiaries did remarkably well in the first three quarters of 2008, during which overall financing activity increased by 70.6% compared to the same period in the previous year. The global financial crisis slowed this growth though. Poor market conditions have contributed to a marked slowdown of Islamic bond, or sukuk, activity in 2008 throughout the Persian Gulf. But other segments, such as Islamic insurance, or takaful, have not seen a similar downturn. Overall, challenges to further growth remain, including a lack of qualified staff to meet the growing demand for sharia-compliant banking services.

===Capital market===
The stock market capitalisation of listed companies in Qatar was valued at $95,487 million in 2007 by the World Bank. As 2008 drew to a close, no capital markets around the globe, including Qatar&#x27;s, were immune to the effects of the sub-prime fallout. That said, there is considerable optimism that Qatar&#x27;s bourse, the Doha Securities Market (DSM), will remain relatively resilient to the ongoing international turbulence. It has followed the same peak-trough trajectory as many others around the globe, hitting record highs in mid-2008, before diving in late 2008 and early 2009. Between December 2006 and July 2008 the DSM Index rose about 117% before the global financial crisis wiped out most of these gains. In the first few months of 2009, the DSM lost about 40% of its value. In an effort to stave off further losses, the government announced in February 2009 that it would step in to buy up shares of troubled banks amounting to about 10% of the market&#x27;s capitalisation. The move improved investor optimism and is hoped to prevent the market from falling further. The proposal to create a single unified regulator as early as 2010 to oversee all banking and financial services is viewed as another promising development that will transform the financial sector for the better.

==Travel and tourism==

Under the ambitious five-year development plan of the Qatar Tourism and Exhibitions Authority (QTEA), the government aimed to boost the number of visitors from 964,000 as of 2007 to 1.5m by 2010. The funding required to meet this goal was present in sufficient amounts; in 2008 the state allocated some $17bn for tourism development through 2014, most of which was allocated towards hotels, exhibition space and infrastructure. In order to keep up with a rising number of visitors, the government set a goal of increasing hotel capacity 400% by 2012. In addition to financial support, the government has also worked to ease business regulations in a bid to increase private sector activity. A major aspect of expansion plans is the Hamad International Airport, which has the capacity to handle up to 24m passengers.

Qatar Airways is an airline owned by the Qatar government and was founded in 1993. It travels to over a hundred destinations.

Other niche tourism segments receiving special focus include cultural tourism on the back of the high publicity opening of Doha&#x27;s Museum of Islamic Art, and sports tourism, initially spurred by the Asian Games, to which Qatar played host in 2006. Qatar hosted the 2022 FIFA World cup, 

==Transport==
With a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the Public Works Authority (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.
As driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the Qatar Bahrain Causeway, which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity. Mass-transit options, such as a Doha metro, light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all of the six member states. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers. The New Doha International Airport is one of the largest projects in Qatar today and will boast a capacity of 50m passengers upon completion in 2015. Finally, port infrastructure is seen as an integral part of Qatar&#x27;s economic development as it focuses on LNG and industrial exports. The port at Mesaieed is undergoing expansion. While the financial crisis may present challenges to infrastructure development, once all projects are completed Qatar will have one of the most advanced and modern transport infrastructures in the region.
==Macro-economic trend==
Qatar is now among the richest countries in the world, on a per person basis. Current GDP per capita registered a world record-breaking peak growth of 1,156% in the 70s. This became quickly unsustainable due to the 1980s oil glut, and Qatar&#x27;s current GDP per capita contracted 53% in the 80s. But rising global oil demand helped current GDP per capita to expand 94% in the 90s. Despite efforts to promote the non-hydrocarbon sectors and diversify the economy from hydrocarbons to knowledge-based sectors, the oil and gas sector has consistently contributed to at least 80 percent of the government of Qatar’s total revenues since 2014, as well as 90 percent of Qatar’s total exports.

In 2020 GDP PPP ~260 billion dollars.

This table is of Qatar&#x27;s gross domestic product at market prices as estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Qatari Rials.

For purchasing power parity comparisons only, the US Dollar is exchanged at 3.67 Qatari Riyals. Mean wages were $59.99 per man-hour in 2009.

In February 2012, the International Bank of Qatar reported that GDP grew by 19.9% in 2011, but estimated that 2012 growth would slow to 9.8%

According to the International Monetary Fund, Qatar&#x27;s economic performance improved in 2018 despite the economic embargo. The GDP growth is expected to increase to 2.6% in 2019 from 2.2% in 2018.

The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2024. Inflation below 2% is in green.

==Internet==

As of 2015, there are two ISPs in Qatar: Ooredoo (formerly Q-Tel) and Vodafone Qatar. There were 563,800 internet users in 2009. The country code (top level domain) is QA. ADSL was launched in 2002 in Qatar by Ooredoo. There were 25,000 ADSL users in 2005.

A 2015 report by the UN Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development ranked Qatar in first place among the developing countries by their respective percentage population using internet. The country also ranked second globally for percentage of households with internet. 

=== 5G ===
As of February 2023, 5G coverage in Qatar is at 70%. Ooredoo and Vodafone Qatar, the two major mobile operators in Qatar, have both announced plans to expand their 5G networks to cover the entire country by the end of 2023. The bandwidth of a 5G network in Qatar can be up to 100 MHz in frequency range 1 (FR1: 450 MHz to 6 GHz).

5G is expected to have a major impact on the economy of Qatar. It is expected to boost the country&#x27;s GDP by $16 billion by 2025 and create over 100,000 jobs.

<text>Transport in [[Qatar]] is primarily centered around the Doha Metropolitan Area (DMA), where approximately 2 million people reside and work. Doha, the capital city, serves as the national hub for government, business, and tourism, but significant development occurs outside the city as part of the government&#x27;s diversification strategy.

Qatar has experienced remarkable economic and population growth in recent years, with the population surging from 1.7 million in 2008 to over 2.7 million by 2017, primarily in Greater Doha. Emerging development areas outside Doha, such as Lusail and Al Wakrah, coupled with new Economic and Logistic Zones, reflect the country&#x27;s steady economic growth. To sustain this growth, Qatar is investing in enhancing its transportation system, including constructing expressways and freeways and a comprehensive public transport system comprising the Doha Metro, Lusail Light Rail Transit (LRT), and bus network upgrades.

==Government initiatives==
===Expressway Programme===
The Expressway Programme aims to supply approximately 800 kilometers of secure and efficient roadways by executing over 30 projects dispersed across 46 contracts. Furthermore, the Programme aims to establish an integrated infrastructure network with modern, dependable underground utilities such as stormwater systems, electricity services, and advanced transportation systems. The initiative will also focus on enhancing the aesthetics of roads and providing better amenities for cyclists and pedestrians.

===2008 Transport Master Plan for Qatar (TMPQ)===
In 2008, Qatar introduced its first Transportation Master Plan (TMPQ 2008), outlining a comprehensive strategy for land transportation, encompassing various initiatives and projects to meet current and future transport needs. Recognizing the evolving challenges and opportunities, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) initiated a significant update to the plan in 2017 to align with the objectives of Qatar National Vision 2030.

== Public transport ==

In 2002, the Qatari government launched Mowasalat, a company 100% owned by the government, managed and operated by the state authorities to ensure the smooth provision of integrated ground-transport services for the entire country. Previously, 3,000 privately owned orange taxicabs used to rule the streets of Qatar but the government took them off the roads as they saw them as a threat to the new Mowasalat taxis. There has been much controversy over this move, as it is now very hard to find a taxi in Doha.

Public buses now service over 35 routes covering most locations of Doha with minimal fares making public transport in Qatar an inexpensive solution to the problems of rush hours and parking difficulties.

Mowasalat, under the brand-name Karwa, now operates more than 3,000 new taxi sedans including the recently acquired airport taxis with spacious cabins using 2007 Ford Freestars and more than 120 public buses, school buses, and private-hire coaches. In 2009, the Mowasalat created a world record for the largest parade of buses numbering 300 in all. In addition, its Doha Limousine Service has 100 standard limousines and 200 Jaguar XJ VIP units that are mostly placed at the Doha International Airport and at major hotels. In 2021, &#x27;Karwa&#x27; acquired a fleet of diesel vehicles with Euro 5 standard in order to remove particulate matter from exhausts, reducing it to the equivalent of one gram of sand per kilometer driven.

However, those without personal transportation still face difficulties to move around since the number of taxis is much lower than the actual need of the population. All buses operate only on specific assigned lines based at the Central Bus Stations at Al-Ghanem area of the old city.

The Ministry of Transport and Communications stated that Public bus ridership has increased by 40% between 2015 and 2018.

== Railways ==
In August 2008, Qatari Diar Real Estate Investment created a joint venture with Deutsche Bahn of Germany, Qatar Railway Development Company to plan a railway network in Qatar.
On 22 November 2009, Deutsche Bahn and Qatari signed a memorandum of Agreement to build high-speed railway lines and underground transport networks in Qatar and Bahrain. This agreement has never been executed.
The Qatar Railways Development Company (QRDC) was created in 2011, and soon after it was decided that Qatar Rail would be the sole owner and manager of Qatar&#x27;s rail network and would be responsible for the design, construction, commissioning, operation and maintenance of the entire rail network and systems. However,

Qatar Rail consists of:

* Doha Metro (Contract awarded for civil works, Rolling Stocks and Systems).
* Light rail transit for Lusail (the other LRT systems in Doha, namely for Education City and Hamad International Airport are managed outside Qatar Rail.
* Long Distance.

The total length of the Qatar Rail network consists of approximately: 
* 750 km of track
* 100 stations for both passenger and freight

=== Doha Metro ===
In June 2013, Qatar Rail awarded four design and build contracts worth approximately $8.2 billion for phase one of the Doha metro. The project included four rail lines and an underground section in the center of the capital Doha, and links to stadiums for the 2022 FIFA World Cup soccer tournament. The contracts were for the Red Line North project, the Red Line South project, the Green Line project and another one to design and build the metro&#x27;s major stations. The projects are expected to employ more than 20,000 workers at its peak, construction is scheduled to begin later this year for completion by 2019. Metro construction was originally planned to start in the first quarter of 2010.

Doha Metro&#x27;s Red Line became the first line officially opened to the public on 8 May 2019. This was followed by the launch of the Gold Line on 21 November 2019, and the opening of the Green Line on 10 December 2019.

==Pedestrian infrastructure==

In a bid to improve pedestrian accessibility in congested areas, the Prime Minister of Qatar, Abdullah bin Nasser Al Thani, announced the inauguration of the Pedestrian Crossings Master Plan in 2018. This comprehensive plan details 50 pedestrian crossings to be built throughout Qatar, mainly in Doha, and includes 26 pedestrian bridges and tunnels, and 24 crosswalks.

<text>The Qatar Armed Forces () are the military forces of the State of Qatar. Since 2015, Qatar has implemented mandatory military conscription with an average of 2,000 graduates per year. As of 2010, Qatar&#x27;s defence expenditures added up to a total of $1.913 billion, about 1.5% of the national GDP, according to the SIPRI. Qatar has recently signed defence pacts with the United States in 2002 &amp; 2013, with the United Kingdom in 2020, and with France in 1994.

Qatar plays an active role in the collective defense efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council; the other five members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman. Qatar also hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East and in 2017 inaugurated a military attache office in Washington.

SIPRI states that Qatar&#x27;s plans to transform and significantly enlarge its armed forces have accelerated in 2014, and in 2010-14 Qatar was the 46th largest arms importer in the world. Orders in 2013 for 562 tanks and 75 self-propelled guns from Germany were followed in 2014 by a number of other contracts, including 34 combat helicopters and 3 AEW aircraft from the US, and 6 tanker aircraft from Spain. As of 2016, Qatar maintains advanced anti air and anti ship capabilities with deliveries of Patriot PAC-3 MSE Batteries, Exocet MM40 Block 3 and Marte ER anti-ship missiles.

Reports indicate that between 2014 and 2024, Qatar significantly enhanced its military capabilities, with defense spending rising by 434%. These accounts also suggest that a substantial portion of the arms trade during this period was marred by corruption, including instances of bribery.

On November 8, 2024, for the first time a Nato military committee visited Qatar&#x27;s military education and training facilities.

==History==
The armed forces were founded in 1971 after the country gained independence from the United Kingdom.

With a personnel strength of 11,800, Qatar&#x27;s armed forces are the second-smallest in the Middle East. France has provided approximately 80% of Qatar&#x27;s arms inventory. 
Qatar took part in the Gulf War of 1991, with a battalion at the Battle of Khafji. It also hosted the U.S. 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron and the Canadian Air Task Group with 26 CF-18s both at Doha.

Since the Gulf War, Qatar has pursued a limited program of force modernization. Qatar has spent $12 billion to buy MIM-104 Patriot surface to air missiles. In July 2008, the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency announced Qatar&#x27;s official request for logistics support, training, and associated equipment and services. The total value of the support arrangements could be as high as $400 million.

In March 2011, Qatar announced the participation of its Air Force in the enforcement of the Libyan no-fly zone.

=== Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen ===

According to Aljazeera news, in December 2016, Qatar deployed 1,000 ground troops in Yemen to fight on behalf of the ousted president Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. Qatari soldiers, backed by 200 armoured vehicles and 30 Apache helicopters, headed to Yemen&#x27;s Marib province.

The Armed Forces of Qatar have suffered 4 killed and 2 wounded during their deployment in Yemen.

==Military branches==

===Qatari Emiri Land Force===

The Qatar Emiri Land Force is the largest land service branch of the Qatar Armed Forces.
Initially outfitted with British weaponry, Qatar shifted much of its procurement to France during the 1980s in response to French efforts to develop closer relations. The tank battalion was equipped with French-built AMX-30 main battle tanks, before later being replaced by German Leopard 2A7&#x27;s. Other armored vehicles include French AMX-10P APCs and the French VAB, adopted as the standard wheeled combat vehicle. The artillery unit has a few French 155 mm self-propelled howitzers. The principal antitank weapons are French MILAN and HOT wire-guided missiles.

Qatar had also illicitly acquired a few Stinger shoulder-fired SAMs, possibly from Afghan rebel groups, at a time when the United States was trying to maintain tight controls on Stingers in the Middle East. When Qatar refused to turn over the missiles, the United States Senate in 1988 imposed a ban on the sale of all weapons to Qatar. The ban was repealed in late 1990 when Qatar satisfactorily accounted for its disposition of the Stingers.
Qatari tank battalion fought in the Gulf war in 1991, their AMX-30s took part in the battle of Khafji. Qatari contingent, composed mostly of Pakistani recruits, acquitted itself well during the war.

Qatar signed a contract with the German defence company Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) for the delivery of 24 artillery systems PzH 2000 and 62 LEOPARD 2 main battle tanks.

The US DSCA announces that Qatar wants to join its neighbor the UAE, and field 2 medium-range THAAD batteries of its own.

Their request is worth up to $6.5 billion, and includes up to 12 THAAD Launchers, 150 THAAD missiles, 2 THAAD Fire Control and Communications units, 2 AN/TPY-2 THAAD Radars, and 1 Early Warning Radar (EWR). The USA would also sell them the required trucks, generators, electrical power units, trailers, communications equipment, fire unit test &amp; maintenance equipment, system integration and checkout, repair and return, training, and other support.

===Qatari Emiri Navy===
The Qatari Emiri Navy (QEN), also called the Qatari Emiri Naval Forces (QENF), is the naval branch of the armed forces of the State of Qatar.

===Qatari Emiri Air Force===
The Qatari Emiri Air Force was formed in 1974, three years after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1971. Initially equipped with ex-RAF Hawker Hunters, the air force soon began expansion with six Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets in 1979. Fourteen Dassault Mirage F1 were delivered between 1980 and 1984. After the Gulf War, Qatar&#x27;s air force infrastructure was upgraded by France for $200 million, leading to the order of nine single seat Mirage 2000-5DEA multi-role combat aircraft and three two seat Mirage 2000-5DDA combat trainers in August 1994. Deliveries started in December 1997, and involved the buy back of the remaining 11 Mirage F1s by France that were later sold on to Spain. The current commander of the Qatar Emiri Air Force is Brigadier General Mubarak Mohammed Al Kumait Al Khayarin.

British pilots in Oman remain on duty with the air force, and French specialists are employed in a maintenance capacity. Nevertheless, an increasing number of young Qataris have been trained as pilots and technicians. The past decade saw Qatar increase its air force with 96 planes from three different countries: the F-15 from the US, France&#x27;s Rafale, and the Eurofighter Typhoon from the UK.

Its units include:
* No. 1 Fighter Wing
** No. 7 Air Superiority Squadron – Dassault Mirage 2000 
*** 9 single-seat Mirage 2000-5EDA
*** 3 2000-5DDA trainers
** No. 11 Close Support Squadron – Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet 
* No. 2 Rotary Wing
** No. 6 Close Support Squadron – Eurocopter SA342 
** No. 8 Anti-Surface Vessel Squadron – Westland Sea King Commando Mk 3
** No. 9 Multi-Role Squadron – Westland Sea King Commando Mk 2
* Qatar Amiri Flight – C-17 Globemaster III

== Humanitarian Aid ==
Gaza

Following the start of Israeli military operations in the enclave after the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, a significant number of Palestinians in Gaza, estimated at 2.2 million, are now confronted with the imminent risk of famine. The Qatari Armed Forces have played a significant role in offering assistance to the Palestinians in Gaza. Thus far, a grand total of 91 aircraft have been dispatched, each laden with numerous tons of much-needed assistance. In a significant development, on April 8, 2024, they accomplished the successful evacuation of the 22nd group of injured Palestinians, marking a significant milestone since the commencement of the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Afghanistan

On May 16, 2024, a Qatar Armed Forces aircraft delivered 42 tons of food and shelter from the Qatar Red Crescent Society and Qatar Charity to Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan.Qatar Charity (QC) also sent three aircraft delivering sixty tons of relief goods to Balkh flood victims via the Qatar Emiri Air Force airlift. Additionally, Qatar Red Crescent Society (QRCS) will build 10 health centers in Afghanistan to serve hundreds of thousands of women and children.

Sudan

On August 14, 2024, two Qatari Armed Forces aircraft arrived at Port Sudan Airport, delivering 27 tons of relief aid and shelter supplies to support flood victims in Sudan. The aid was provided by the Qatar Fund for Development (QFFD), Qatar Charity, and the Qatar Red Crescent Society. This is part of Qatar&#x27;s ongoing humanitarian air bridge to Sudan, initiated in May 2023 in response to the country&#x27;s ongoing conflict and natural disasters.

<text>Foreign relations of Qatar is conducted through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Arab states were among the first to recognize Qatar, and the country gained admittance to the United Nations and the Arab League after achieving independence in 1971. The country was an early member of OPEC and a founding member of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Diplomatic missions to Qatar are based in its capital, Doha.

Qatar&#x27;s regional relations and foreign policies are characterized by strategy of balancing and alliance building among regional and great powers. It maintains independent foreign policy and engages in regional balancing to secure its strategic priorities and to have recognition on the regional and international level. As a small state in the gulf, Qatar has an &quot;open-door&quot; foreign policy where Qatar maintain ties to all parties and regional players in the region, including with organizations such as Taliban and Hamas. However, Washington Institute published a report in August 2021 stating Qatar&#x27;s connections with the Taliban have made the country a potential contact for regions seeking negotiations with Afghanistan. Qatar has also been key to negotiating cease-fires between Israel and Hamas that have restored calm after four wars, last seen in 2021.

==Multilateral relations==
Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, the emir of Qatar from 1995 to 2013, helped establish Qatar&#x27;s reputation as an influential player in Middle East politics. The first major move in this regard was the founding of Al Jazeera, a state-owned news media company.

Qatar has also cultivated close relationships with Western powers, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom. Al Udeid Air Base hosts American and British air forces. Qatar has invested extensively in London real estate, and the country has also made donations to prominent research centers in the United States. At the same time, Qatar maintains ties to Western adversaries, including Iran, Hamas, the Muslim Brotherhood, and extremist elements in Syria. Although according to a report by The Economist in December 2021, Qatar has modified its anti-Islamist policies and demanded Brotherhood activists leave.

In an attempt to quell the mounting criticism, Qatar announced sweeping labour reforms in 2019. This included ending &quot;kafala&quot;, the system that made it illegal for migrant workers to change jobs or leave the country without their employer&#x27;s permission, effectively trapping workers who were being exploited and abused. Other reforms included the first minimum wage for migrant workers in the region and harsher penalties for companies that did not comply with the new labour laws. When they came into force in September 2020, the reforms were met with wide acclaim. Fifa called them groundbreaking. The UN said they marked a new era. An international trade union referred to them as a game changer.

It is also one of the few countries in which citizens do not have to pay any taxes. 

On October 16, 2019, the Council of Ministers of the State of Qatar unanimously endorsed end to such practice in the country by abolishment of the Kafala system. 

Qatar is a strategic ally of China, with relationship between the two countries growing stronger. Qatar is a member of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Gulf Cooperation Council, OPEC and the Council of Arab Economic Unity.

===Regional relations===
In September, 2014. QFFD contributed in enhancing stability for Syrian refugees. Qatar Charity facilitated access to quality education through the rehabilitation of 6 Formal schools in Turkey, Gaziantep, Urfa, Kilis, targeting a total number of 13,540 beneficiaries and 12,860 girls and boys.

On July 10, 2017, according to documents obtained by Al Arabiya, Qatar agreed to quit supporting the Muslim Brotherhood. In order to avoid undermining relations with the Gulf, it also removed non-citizens from Qatar and refused to provide shelter to anyone from a GCC nation.

On March 27, 2022, The United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) and Qatar on their fourth high-level strategic discussion, discussed strategic priorities and worked together to ensure that the UN effectively supports member states in their efforts to combat terrorism. Out of a total of 35 other contributors, the state of Qatar is the second greatest contributor to the UN trust fund for counter-terrorism.

Some financial economists have interpreted the 2014 Saudi-Qatari rift as the tangible political sign of a growing economic rivalry between oil and natural gas producers, which could &quot;have deep and long-lasting consequences&quot; beyond the Middle East.

In March 2014 Qatar made overtures to Oman in order to counteract the influence of Saudi Arabia on politics in the region.

In May 2017, an alleged hack of state media led to stories quoting the Emir as enquiring US resentment towards Iran and remarking on Hamas. Doha reported it as false and gave no indication on where it originated. However, news organizations in the region reported the emir&#x27;s comments as fact. This led to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Egypt and Bahrain cutting diplomatic ties with Qatar on 5 June 2017.

Qatar voiced support for the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin. Spokeswoman of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lulwah Rashif Al-Khater said that: &quot;The launching of the Turkish military operation last Saturday was motivated by legitimate concerns related to its national security and the security of its borders, in addition to protecting Syria&#x27;s territorial integrity from the danger of secession. Turkey, a NATO member, has always been a stabilizing factor in the region.&quot;

In mid-March 2024, the Emir of Qatar, HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani and President of the European Council, HE Charles Michel, discussed about enhancing cooperation between Qatar and the European Union, as well as addressing key regional and global issues, with specific focus on the situation in the Gaza Strip and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. 

===Peace brokering and peacekeeping activities===

The onset of the Arab Spring in January 2011 complicated Qatar&#x27;s ability to mediate having forced Gulf leaders to side with revolutionaries or the longstanding autocratic regimes. Sheikh Hamad stated in that Qatar would support the uprisings, a position that clashed with neighboring Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Qatar provided extensive support, in funding and weapons, to Libyan revolutionaries and aided in the removal of Muammar Gaddafi by mobilising Arab support behind NATO airstrikes. In Egypt, Qatar supported President Mohamed Morsi and has suffered from strained relations with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi following Morsi&#x27;s removal.
In Syria, Qatar has provided arms and funding to various opposition groups. Other discoveries from the research claimed that Qatar supported the US against the Assad government. Additionally, the nation supported efforts to mediate a conflict-ending political transition in Syria. In March 2021, Qatar, Russia, and Turkey also started a different track of talks on the Syrian peace process.

According to the Royal United Services Institute, Qatar plays an important role in Syria and Iraq as an interlocutor between Western powers and resistant groups that cannot be engaged directly. This role is consistent with Qatar&#x27;s efforts as an interlocutor with the Taliban in Afghanistan, hosting a small embassy in Doha where US officials are able to meet with the Taliban behind closed doors.

Prior to the abdication of Emir Sheikh Hamad, Qatar&#x27;s mediation was fronted by the Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ahmad Abdullah Al Mahmud. On 4 May 2009, the Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ahmad Abdullah Al Mahmud announced that Chad and Sudan had agreed to end hostilities against each other and to normalize relations during Qatari-mediated talks in Doha; however the agreement quickly broke down. Qatar also brokered an agreement between the Sudanese government and the strongest Darfur rebel group, the Justice and Equality Movement, in Doha in February 2010. The agreement fell apart in May 2010 and the conflict is ongoing.
Qatar hosted a donors conference to help rebuild war-ravaged Darfur in April 2013.

In June 2010, Qatari peacekeeping forces deployed in the disputed Ras Doumeira area on the border between Djibouti and Eritrea after the latter withdrew from the area. The intention was to help start bilateral negotiations and solve the territorial dispute which had turned violent. Qatar withdrew its 450 troops from the Djibouti-Eritrea border in June 2017 after the two countries severed ties with Qatar.

On February 1, 2023, in an interview, Qatar&#x27;s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, stated that his country is actively utilizing its established communication channels with both Washington and Tehran in order to foster a greater alignment of their respective perspectives.

In September 2023, it was reported that Iran expressed its readiness to execute a Qatar-mediated agreement with the United States. The Iranian foreign minister made this announcement on September 14, 2023. According to the terms of the agreement, both Washington and Tehran would release five prisoners, while $6 billion worth of Iranian assets held in South Korea would be released.

The broad outlines of the U.S.-Iran deal, which pertain to the potential release of U.S. citizens detained by Iran, were publicly disclosed on August 10. As part of this agreement, it has been proposed that the funds be transferred to banks in Qatar while simultaneously releasing five Iranians who are currently held in the United States.

In June, it was reported that secret talks took place between Venezuela and the United States, with Qatar serving as the host for these discussions. Qatar has been known for its significant involvement in supporting the United States during delicate negotiations, which notably encompassed a recent prisoner exchange with Iran and facilitated backchannel communications between the U.S. and the Taliban.

On October 7, 2023, Israel and Palestine started an extensive armed conflict. Due to its escalation, On October 9, 2023, Qatari mediators made urgent talks to attempt to arrange the release of 36 Palestinian women and children from Israeli prisons in exchange for the release of Israeli women and children held by the militant group that were being detained in Gaza. Positive progress is being made in the ongoing negotiations, which Qatar has been undertaking in collaboration with the United States. Qatar has played a crucial role in facilitating the release of American and Australian hostages who were stranded in Israel and Palestine.

In October 2023, Qatar&#x27;s mediation efforts led to the reunion of four Ukrainian children with their families. By December 2023, an additional six Ukrainian children were scheduled to be repatriated from Russia to Ukraine under a Qatar-brokered agreement. In February 2024, a third group of 11 children was successfully returned to their Ukrainian families with the assistance of Qatar&#x27;s mediation. On March 21, 2024, a new batch of children exchange between Moscow and Kyiv took place at Qatar&#x27;s Embassy in Moscow, facilitated by Qatar and attended by Ambassador &quot;Sheikh Ahmed bin Nasser bin Jassim Al Thani&quot;, as confirmed by Russian Children&#x27;s Ombudswoman &quot;Maria Lvova-Belova&quot;. Furthermore, the ambassador &quot;Sheikh Ahmed&quot; expressed gratitude to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani for their support throughout this process.

=== Cultural and religious activities ===
Qatar is an Islamic state with multi-religious minorities like most of the Persian Gulf countries with waves of migration over the last 30 years. The official state religion is Wahhabi Sunni Islam. The community is made up of Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Muslims, Christians, Hindus, and small groups of Buddhists and Baha&#x27;is. Muslims form 65.5% of the Qatari population, followed by Hindus at 15.4%, Christians at 14.2%, Buddhists at 3.3% and the rest 1.9% of the population follow other religions or are unaffiliated. Qatar is also home to numerous other religions mostly from the Middle East and Asia.

The country has also hosted numerous interfaith dialogue conferences.

The culture of Qatar is strongly influenced by traditional Bedouin culture, with less acute influence deriving from India, East Africa and elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. The peninsula&#x27;s harsh climatic conditions compelled its inhabitants to turn to the sea for sustenance. Thus, there is a distinct emphasis placed on the sea in local culture. Literature and folklore themes are often related to sea-based activities. Oral arts such as poetry and singing were historically more prevalent than figurative art because of the restrictions placed by Islam on depictions of sentient beings; however, certain visual art disciplines such as calligraphy, architecture and textile arts were widely practiced. Figurative arts were gradually assimilated into the country&#x27;s culture during the oil era.

===Foreign aid===

Qatar&#x27;s international aid program has expanded dramatically since the beginning of 2010, and focuses heavily on the Arab world, most notably in the humanitarian crises in Syria and Gaza.

According to the UN OCHA&#x27;s Financial Tracking Service, Qatar&#x27;s international aid increased from less than $10 million annually in the pre-Arab Spring period to the hundreds of millions following the event.

For example, in 2012, according to the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the country donated more than QAR3 billion (or c. £524 million) through governmental and non-governmental aid to nearly 100 countries across the globe.

Qatari leadership has since pledged publicly to reduce suffering of victims and to achieve and support global partnerships for the achievement of foreign countries&#x27; Millennium Development Goals. The state is engaged in investments in a wide range of humanitarian and developmental sectors. Qatar pledged $50 million in support to United Nations humanitarian response plan as well as the regional refugee plan for Sudan, during a donor conference in Geneva on 19 June 2023. &quot;Based on our fraternal responsibility and our moral and human duty towards our brothers in Sudan, and as a continuation of our continuous humanitarian and development efforts in brotherly Sudan, we announce the State of Qatar&#x27;s pledge of $50 million to support the efforts of the Humanitarian Response Plan and the Regional Refugee Plan,&quot; Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani announced.

On September 24, 2023, Qatar dispatched a significant quantity of humanitarian and relief aid, amounting to 58 tonnes, to assist the city of Derna in Libya, which had been severely impacted by flooding. This recent contribution elevates the total amount of aid provided by Qatar to support those affected by the floods to an impressive 267 tonnes. Aid typically encompasses a range of essential provisions, including but not limited to shelter essentials, electricity generators, food, and medical commodities.

Recently, Qatar Charity (QC) launched the &#x27;Libya Appeal&#x27; campaign, aimed at providing aid to the Libyan population grappling with the consequences of severe floods. These floods have resulted in the loss of numerous lives and the displacement of a significant number of individuals.

Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani also conveyed his heartfelt condolences to the victims affected by the catastrophic floods in Libya through a message posted on the social media platform Twitter.  &quot;I extend to our brothers in Libya my sincere condolences and sympathy for the victims of the catastrophic floods, and we in Qatar declare our complete solidarity with the Libyan people to overcome this painful ordeal, and we ask God to have mercy on the dead, bring back the missing, and heal the wounded,&quot;. He wrote.

<doc id="25198" wikidata="Q26185" url="?curid=25198" title="Quaternary">
<text>The Quaternary ( ) is the current and most recent of the three periods of the Cenozoic Era in the geologic time scale of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), as well as the current and most recent of the twelve periods of the Phanerozoic eon. It follows the Neogene Period and spans from 2.58 million years ago to the present. The Quaternary Period is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene (2.58 million years ago to 11.7 thousand years ago) and the Holocene (11.7 thousand years ago to today); a proposed third epoch, the Anthropocene, was rejected in 2024 by IUGS, the governing body of the ICS.

The Quaternary is typically defined by the Quaternary glaciation, the cyclic growth and decay of continental ice sheets related to the Milankovitch cycles and the associated climate and environmental changes that they caused.

==Research history==

In 1759 Giovanni Arduino proposed that the geological strata of northern Italy could be divided into four successive formations or &quot;orders&quot; (). The term &quot;quaternary&quot; was introduced by Jules Desnoyers in 1829 for sediments of France&#x27;s Seine Basin that clearly seemed to be younger than Tertiary Period rocks.

The Quaternary Period follows the Neogene Period and extends to the present. The Quaternary covers the time span of glaciations classified as the Pleistocene, and includes the present interglacial time-period, the Holocene.

This places the start of the Quaternary at the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation approximately 2.6 million years ago (). Prior to 2009, the Pleistocene was defined to be from 1.805 million years ago to the present, so the current definition of the Pleistocene includes a portion of what was, prior to 2009, defined as the Pliocene.

Quaternary stratigraphers usually worked with regional subdivisions. From the 1970s, the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) tried to make a single geologic time scale based on GSSP&#x27;s, which could be used internationally. The Quaternary subdivisions were defined based on biostratigraphy instead of paleoclimate.

This led to the problem that the proposed base of the Pleistocene was at 1.805 million years ago, long after the start of the major glaciations of the northern hemisphere. The ICS then proposed to abolish use of the name Quaternary altogether, which appeared unacceptable to the International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA).

In 2009, it was decided to make the Quaternary the youngest period of the Cenozoic Era with its base at 2.588 mya and including the Gelasian Stage, which was formerly considered part of the Neogene Period and Pliocene Epoch. This was later revised to 2.58 mya. 

The Anthropocene was proposed as a third epoch as a mark of the anthropogenic impact on the global environment starting with the Industrial Revolution, or about 200 years ago. The Anthropocene was rejected as a geological epoch in 2024 by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS), the governing body of the ICS.

==Geology==
The 2.58 million years of the Quaternary represents the time during which recognisable humans existed. Over this geologically short time period there has been relatively little change in the distribution of the continents due to plate tectonics.

The Quaternary geological record is preserved in greater detail than that for earlier periods.

The major geographical changes during this time period included the emergence of the straits of Bosphorus and Skagerrak during glacial epochs, which respectively turned the Black Sea and Baltic Sea into fresh water lakes, followed by their flooding (and return to salt water) by rising sea level; the periodic filling of the English Channel, forming a land bridge between Britain and the European mainland; the periodic closing of the Bering Strait, forming the land bridge between Asia and North America; and the periodic flash flooding of Scablands of the American Northwest by glacial water.

The current extent of Hudson Bay, the Great Lakes and other major lakes of North America are a consequence of the Canadian Shield&#x27;s readjustment since the last ice age; different shorelines have existed over the course of Quaternary time.

==Climate==
The climate was one of periodic glaciations with continental glaciers moving as far from the poles as 40 degrees latitude. Glaciation took place repeatedly during the Quaternary Ice age – a term coined by Schimper in 1839 that began with the start of the Quaternary about 2.58 Mya and continues to the present day.
In 1821, a Swiss engineer, Ignaz Venetz, presented an article in which he suggested the presence of traces of the passage of a glacier at a considerable distance from the Alps. This idea was initially disputed by another Swiss scientist, Louis Agassiz, but when he undertook to disprove it, he ended up affirming his colleague&#x27;s hypothesis. A year later, Agassiz raised the hypothesis of a great glacial period that would have had long-reaching general effects. This idea gained him international fame and led to the establishment of the Glacial Theory.

In time, thanks to the refinement of geology, it has been demonstrated that there were several periods of glacial advance and retreat and that past temperatures on Earth were very different from today.
In particular, the Milankovitch cycles of Milutin Milankovitch are based on the premise that variations in incoming solar radiation are a fundamental factor controlling Earth&#x27;s climate.

During this time, substantial glaciers advanced and retreated over much of North America and Europe, parts of South America and Asia, and all of Antarctica.

== Flora and fauna ==
There was a major extinction of large mammals globally during the Late Pleistocene Epoch. Many forms such as sabre-toothed cats, mammoths, mastodons, glyptodonts, etc., became extinct worldwide. Others, including horses, camels and American cheetahs became extinct in North America.

The Great Lakes formed and giant mammals thrived in parts of North America and Eurasia not covered in ice. These mammals became extinct when the glacial period ended about 11,700 years ago. Modern humans evolved about 315,000 years ago. During the Quaternary Period, mammals, flowering plants, and insects dominated the land.

<doc id="25199" wikidata="Q206287" url="?curid=25199" title="Quotation">
<text>A quotation or quote is the repetition of a sentence, phrase, or passage from speech or text that someone has said or written. In oral speech, it is the representation of an utterance (i.e. of something that a speaker actually said) that is introduced by a quotative marker, such as a verb of saying. For example: John said: &quot;I saw Mary today&quot;. Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special prosody in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks. Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by citation to their original source; such statements are marked with (punctuated with) quotation marks.

As a form of transcription, direct or quoted speech is spoken or written text that reports speech or thought in its original form phrased by the original speaker. In narrative, it is usually enclosed in quotation marks, but it can be enclosed in guillemets (« ») in some languages. The cited speaker either is mentioned in the tag (or attribution) or is implied. Direct speech is often used as a literary device to represent someone&#x27;s point of view. Quotations are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.

==Comparison between direct, indirect, and free indirect speech==
* Quoted or direct speech:
&quot;Direct speech&quot; and &quot;indirect speech&quot; can also refer to the difference between speech acts where the illocutionary force is conveyed directly and indirectly, respectively. Thus, &quot;What time is it?&quot; is a direct speech act that might also be expressed by the indirect speech act &quot;Do you know what time it is?&quot;

:He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. &quot;And just what pleasure have I found since I came into this world?&quot; he asked.
* Reported or normal indirect speech:

:He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. He asked himself what pleasure he had found since he came into the world.
* Free indirect speech:
:He laid down his bundle and thought of his misfortune. And just what pleasure had he found since he came into this world?

A crucial semantic distinction between direct and indirect speech is that direct speech purports to report the exact words that were said or written, whereas indirect speech is a representation of speech in one&#x27;s own words.

The distinction between indirect speech and free indirect speech is mostly one of style, hence free indirect speech is sometimes described as a free indirect style.

==As a literary device==
A quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a painting, scenes from a movie or sections from a musical composition.

===Reasons for using===
Quotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or author, to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law. Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.

===Common sources===
Famous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries. Of these, &quot;Bartlett&#x27;s Familiar Quotations&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot;, &quot;The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations&quot;, &quot;The Yale Book of Quotations&quot; and &quot;The Macmillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases&quot; are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources. Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines—with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics—have also become commonplace.

===Misquotations===
Many quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are Winston Churchill, to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and Oscar Wilde, to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.

Some quotations commonly believed to be quotations from literature, film, etc. do not actually appear in the source material, but are paraphrases of phrases that do. The &quot;Star Trek&quot; catchphrase &quot;Beam me up, Scotty&quot; did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include &quot;Just the facts, ma&#x27;am&quot; (attributed to Jack Webb&#x27;s character of Joe Friday on &quot;Dragnet&quot;), &quot;Heavy lies the crown&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s Play Henry IV, Part 2, &quot;Elementary, my dear Watson&quot; (attributed to Sherlock Holmes; it was, however, said in the films &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;), &quot;Luke, I am your father&quot; (attributed to Darth Vader in Star Wars), &quot;Play it again, Sam&quot; (attributed to Ilsa in &quot;Casablanca&quot;), &quot;Do you feel lucky, punk?&quot; (attributed to Harry Callahan in &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;) and &quot;We don&#x27;t need no stinkin&#x27; badges!&quot; (attributed to Gold Hat in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot;).

===Quotative inversion===
Quotative inversion occurs in sentences where the direct quotation can occur before a verb of saying or after a verb of saying. It can trigger inversion of the verb and the verb&#x27;s subject. Subject-verb inversion occurs most often in written works, being rare in speech. Quotations may appear before the inverted verb, but can also appear after the subject, such as: &quot;&quot;I am going to follow you all the rest of my life,&quot; declared the man&quot; and &quot;Said the woman: &quot;I see you with both my eyes.&quot;&quot;

Also referred to as inverted quotations, this technique of reversing the sequence of an existing phrase or formulation is commonly found in biblical texts, particularly the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. It serves to evoke various emotional and rhetorical effects, mainly to draw extra attention from the reader or listener. By reversing a previously established sequence, authors can introduce surprise, emphasize key points, or create contrasts that highlight the text&#x27;s significance and its connections to other biblical passages.

====Syntax====
In syntactic terms, these direct quotations can be presented in two forms. The first is as the complement of a quotative verb (e.g. Marie said: &quot;My brother has arrived&quot;), and the second being as a head clause with a quotative adjunct (e.g. &quot;My brother has arrived&quot;, Marie announces). The verb phrase can be further expanded to include a complement, such as: &quot;They&#x27;ll never make it!&quot; cried John &quot;to Mary&quot;. Subjects must precede the complement, otherwise the structure formed will be ungrammatical (e.g. *&quot;They&#x27;ll never make it!&quot; cried &quot;to Mary&quot; John). Quotative inversion is only allowed when the verb is in the simple present or the simple past. The most common pairing is the verb &quot;said&quot; with a nominal subject, such as: &quot;That&#x27;s the whole trouble,&quot; said Gwen. Additionally, noun phrases are not permitted in addition to the subject when inversion takes place. They are allowed only when there is no subject-verb inversion, or when part of a preposition phrase.
:: a. &quot;Why?&quot; Gabrielle asked the attendant. - 
:: b. &quot;Why?&quot; asked Gabrielle of the attendant. - 
:: c. &quot;*&quot;&quot;Why?&quot; asked Gabrielle the attendant. - 

In English, both verb-subject and subject-verb word orders are permitted:

:: a. &quot;Don&#x27;t turn back!&quot; warned Marcel. - 
:: b. &quot;Who&#x27;s on first?&quot; Swami demanded. - 

This however, is not the case in all languages. For example, in Peninsular Spanish, this inversion is not allowed. Quotatives must follow verb-subject order:

:: a. &quot;«No, no es un enanito», rectifica el viejo.&quot; - 
:::&quot;No, he is not a gnome&quot;, corrects the old man.

:: b. &quot;*«No, no es un enanito», el viejo rectifica.&quot; - 
:::&quot;No, he is not a gnome&quot;, the old man corrects.

===Brackets in quotes in English language===
Brackets are used to indicate an addition or a modification from the original quote. Various uses of brackets in quotes are:
* Clarification (&quot;She [Michelle] is an expert in botany.&quot;)
* Change in capitalization (&quot;[a]ccording to this article, this is untrue.&quot;)
* Translation (&quot;Hola, soy Brandon [Hello, I am Brandon].&quot;)

When &quot;[&quot;sic&quot;]&quot; is added, it means that errors are present in the original text. For example,
&quot;Domestic cats are valued by hoomans for companionship.&quot;
==In spoken discourse==
Traditionally, quotations—more specifically known as direct quotations—have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. &quot;He said: &#x27;I am leaving now&#x27;&quot; versus &quot;He said (that) he was leaving immediately&quot;); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many Indo-European languages are required to have the syntactic form of a well-formed declarative subordinate clause); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.

Both direct and indirect quotations in spoken discourse are not intended to be reproductions of an utterance that has been produced. Instead, direct quotations convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a sociolinguistic perspective, a direct quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as &quot;a performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour&quot;. Indirect quotations are simply paraphrases of something that a reporting speaker heard.

===Reasons for using===

Quotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other interlocutors. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.

The quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker’s feelings about what was said. In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker’s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.

===Form===

In most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by &quot;She said&quot;. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks. For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) &quot;to&quot; along with the conjugated verb of saying &quot;itta&quot;:

Verbs of saying (known as quotative verbs when used to introduce quotations) and quotative particles are used as quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances. Quotative evidentials are also used in some languages to indicate quoted speech (e.g. Cusco Quechua spoken in Peru, Nanti spoken in lowland southeastern Peru, Laal spoken in Chad).

====Quotative markers====
Quotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. &quot;say&quot;). A quotative marker usually appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language. For example, compare the following languages:

=====English=====

In English, the quotative verb &quot;say&quot; occurs before the quotation:
:: a. She said &quot;Will you answer the phone, will you answer the phone&quot;

In American English, verbs such as &quot;be like&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, and &quot;be all&quot; are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech. They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in other varieties of English as well (e.g. &quot;be like&quot; in New Zealand English, &quot;be like&quot; and &quot;go&quot; in Glasgow English). Though not semantically considered verbs of saying, they are used to convey the same meaning as such verbs. Like &quot;say&quot;, &quot;be like&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, and &quot;be all&quot; occur before the quotation:
:: b. I&#x27;m like &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry you had to wait&quot;
:: c. She went &quot;Who are you going with?&quot;
:: d. He&#x27;s all &quot;Okay, come with me come with me&quot;

In conversational speech, the use of &quot;say&quot; and &quot;be like&quot; occurs at about the same frequency, though &quot;say&quot; tends to be used in more formal contexts (e.g. office hours between professors and students) and &quot;be like&quot; tends to occur in more informal contexts (e.g. a conversation between two young people).

In African American Vernacular English, &quot;talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout&quot; occurs as a verb of quotation, introducing both direct and indirect quotes, as in:
:: e. They come talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout they is scared of &quot;me&quot;!

=====Japanese=====

In Japanese, the quotative particle &quot;to&quot; along with the verb of saying &quot;iu&quot; (say) occur after the quotation; the conjugated form of &quot;iu&quot; (say) is &quot;itta&quot;:

The quotative particle &quot;to&quot; can also occur with verbs of thinking, such as &quot;omou&quot; (think). Like &quot;to&quot; and &quot;iu&quot; (say), &quot;to&quot; and &quot;omou&quot; occur after the quotation.

=====Laal=====

In Laal, the quotative evidential &quot;mɨ́&quot; is used for non-self quotation (i.e. quotation in which the speaker quotes someone else, not themself); it is used with a quotative verb &quot;ɓɨ́lá&quot;. The use of &quot;mɨ́&quot; results in an indirect quotation translation. The quotative verb &quot;bɨ́lá&quot; occurs before the quotation, while the quotative evidential &quot;mɨ́&quot; occurs within the quoted speech &quot;já mɨ́ nyàg tāā wó&quot;:

As the above sentence involves a non-self quotation, &quot;à&quot; (he) and &quot;já&quot; (I) have different indices to show that they refer to different referents; only this interpretation is well-formed. The interpretation in which they share identical indices is ill-formed (i.e. ungrammatical), as indicated by the asterisk.

In addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.

===Syntax===
Different versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use coreferenced pronouns to the direct quotation&#x27;s first-person subject in the main clause: Shex said, &quot;Ix...&quot;; theyy said &quot;wey ...&quot; In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.

====Quotative verbs====
Quotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.

Quotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.
English also displays verb-second (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: &quot;No no no&quot; &quot;says&quot; Harry.

Direct and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer &quot;that&quot; after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.
The newer quotative verb &quot;be like&quot; in English is used to only introduce direct quotations. &quot;Be like&quot; includes the use of the demonstrative &quot;that&quot;, which is null in most English varieties, but can be optionally overt in some varieties like Glasgow English. Dutch&#x27;s quotative verb &quot;hebben zoiets van&quot; has a similar structure to Standard American English in that it has a null demonstrative that precedes the quotation. It differs from the English structures in that it uses an overt quantifier &quot;zoiets&quot; to be well-formed.

====Quotative particles====
Quotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of &quot;say, mention, tell, etc.&quot; In many languages, they are grammaticalized to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to tense-aspect-mood markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other language families.

Japanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle &quot;tte&quot; verbally to mean &quot;I heard (quote)&quot; with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, &quot;tte&quot; is sometimes regarded along with &quot;to&quot; to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning &quot;I heard (quote)&quot; with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.

Verbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb.

====Quotative evidentials====
Quotative or hearsay evidentials provide knowledge of who or where information originated from in speech based on logical assumption. Languages indicate this in various ways: through grammatical marking, additional words and phrases, prosody, gestures, or systematic affixes of verbs. Quotative readings of evidentials are typologically rare. For example, English can express evidentials with an optional adverb, &quot;&quot;Allegedly&quot;, Annie pulled the trigger.&quot; The interlocutor then knows the source of the quotation is from elsewhere, but this is not a quotative reading as there is no direct performative quoting or verbs of saying. Languages including Cusco Quechua, Kham, Tagalog, and Kaalallisut are documented as containing quotative evidentials. In languages with &quot;true&quot; quotative evidentials (which usually introduce quoted statements), it is also possible for them to occur with interrogatives and imperatives, yielding quoted interrogatives and quoted imperatives. Similar to quotative particles, quotative evidentials are usually grammaticalized from full lexical verbs.

Nhêengatú, a Tupí-Guaraní lingua franca of North-West Amazonia, has a reported evidential marker &quot;paá&quot;. An example scenario is as follows: X saw John go fishing. Mary then and asks X where John went. X replies &quot;u-sú u-piniatika&quot; (he went fishing). Later, Peter asks Mary where John went. She replies to Peter that she did not see John go herself, but rather heard it from a different source using the evidential marker &quot;u-sú u-piniatika &quot;paá.&quot;&quot; 


Tagalog&#x27;s quotative evidentials are used with imperative quotations.

Cusco Quechua&#x27;s quotative evidential comes as a derivation of a clitic, &quot;=si&quot;, for interrogative quotations.

=== Hand gesture ===
Hand gesturing a quotation in a conversation can be done with air quotes.

<text>Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory that describes the behavior of nature at and below the scale of atoms. It is the foundation of all quantum physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

Quantum mechanics can describe many systems that classical physics cannot. Classical physics can describe many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic and (optical) microscopic) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at very small submicroscopic (atomic and subatomic) scales. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation, valid at large (macroscopic/microscopic) scale.

Quantum systems have bound states that are quantized to discrete values of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities, in contrast to classical systems where these quantities can be measured continuously. Measurements of quantum systems show characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).

Quantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations that could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck&#x27;s solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein&#x27;s 1905 paper, which explained the photoelectric effect. These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the &quot;old quantum theory&quot;, led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others. The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms. In one of them, a mathematical entity called the wave function provides information, in the form of probability amplitudes, about what measurements of a particle&#x27;s energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield.

== Overview and fundamental concepts ==

Quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems. It is typically applied to microscopic systems: molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles. It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms, but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such as Wigner&#x27;s friend, and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative. Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy. For example, the refinement of quantum mechanics for the interaction of light and matter, known as quantum electrodynamics (QED), has been shown to agree with experiment to within 1 part in 1012 when predicting the magnetic properties of an electron.

A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities. Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a complex number, known as a probability amplitude. This is known as the Born rule, named after physicist Max Born. For example, a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a wave function, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude. Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a probability density function for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it. This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found. The Schrödinger equation relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.

One consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in predictability between measurable quantities. The most famous form of this uncertainty principle says that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise prediction for a measurement of its position and also at the same time for a measurement of its momentum.

Another consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is the phenomenon of quantum interference, which is often illustrated with the double-slit experiment. In the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles rather than waves; the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen. Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave). However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through. This behavior is known as wave–particle duality. In addition to light, electrons, atoms, and molecules are all found to exhibit the same dual behavior when fired towards a double slit.

Another non-classical phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics is quantum tunnelling: a particle that goes up against a potential barrier can cross it, even if its kinetic energy is smaller than the maximum of the potential. In classical mechanics this particle would be trapped. Quantum tunnelling has several important consequences, enabling radioactive decay, nuclear fusion in stars, and applications such as scanning tunnelling microscopy, tunnel diode and tunnel field-effect transistor.

When quantum systems interact, the result can be the creation of quantum entanglement: their properties become so intertwined that a description of the whole solely in terms of the individual parts is no longer possible. Erwin Schrödinger called entanglement &quot;...&quot;the&quot; characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought&quot;. Quantum entanglement enables quantum computing and is part of quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution and superdense coding. Contrary to popular misconception, entanglement does not allow sending signals faster than light, as demonstrated by the no-communication theorem.

Another possibility opened by entanglement is testing for &quot;hidden variables&quot;, hypothetical properties more fundamental than the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would allow more exact predictions than quantum theory provides. A collection of results, most significantly Bell&#x27;s theorem, have demonstrated that broad classes of such hidden-variable theories are in fact incompatible with quantum physics. According to Bell&#x27;s theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of &quot;local&quot; hidden variables, then the results of a Bell test will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way. Many Bell tests have been performed and they have shown results incompatible with the constraints imposed by local hidden variables.

It is not possible to present these concepts in more than a superficial way without introducing the mathematics involved; understanding quantum mechanics requires not only manipulating complex numbers, but also linear algebra, differential equations, group theory, and other more advanced subjects. Accordingly, this article will present a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and survey its application to some useful and oft-studied examples.

== Mathematical formulation ==
In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum mechanical system is a vector formula_1 belonging to a (separable) complex Hilbert space formula_2. This vector is postulated to be normalized under the Hilbert space inner product, that is, it obeys formula_3, and it is well-defined up to a complex number of modulus 1 (the global phase), that is, formula_1 and formula_5 represent the same physical system. In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space. The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example, for describing position and momentum the Hilbert space is the space of complex square-integrable functions formula_6, while the Hilbert space for the spin of a single proton is simply the space of two-dimensional complex vectors formula_7 with the usual inner product.

Physical quantities of interestposition, momentum, energy, spinare represented by observables, which are Hermitian (more precisely, self-adjoint) linear operators acting on the Hilbert space. A quantum state can be an eigenvector of an observable, in which case it is called an eigenstate, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate. More generally, a quantum state will be a linear combination of the eigenstates, known as a quantum superposition. When an observable is measured, the result will be one of its eigenvalues with probability given by the Born rule: in the simplest case the eigenvalue formula_8 is non-degenerate and the probability is given by formula_9, where formula_10 is its associated eigenvector. More generally, the eigenvalue is degenerate and the probability is given by formula_11, where formula_12 is the projector onto its associated eigenspace. In the continuous case, these formulas give instead the probability density.

After the measurement, if result formula_8 was obtained, the quantum state is postulated to collapse to formula_10, in the non-degenerate case, or to formula_15, in the general case. The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement. This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand. It was the central topic in the famous Bohr–Einstein debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments. In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a &quot;measurement&quot; has been extensively studied. Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of &quot;wave function collapse&quot; (see, for example, the many-worlds interpretation). The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become entangled so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity (see &quot;Measurement in quantum mechanics&quot;).

=== Time evolution of a quantum state ===

The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schrödinger equation:
: formula_16
Here formula_17 denotes the Hamiltonian, the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system, and formula_18 is the reduced Planck constant. The constant formula_19 is introduced so that the Hamiltonian is reduced to the classical Hamiltonian in cases where the quantum system can be approximated by a classical system; the ability to make such an approximation in certain limits is called the correspondence principle.

The solution of this differential equation is given by
: formula_20
The operator formula_21 is known as the time-evolution operator, and has the crucial property that it is unitary. This time evolution is deterministic in the sense that – given an initial quantum state formula_22 – it makes a definite prediction of what the quantum state formula_23 will be at any later time.

Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent of time, such as eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such &quot;static&quot; wave functions. For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is described by a static wave function surrounding the nucleus. For example, the electron wave function for an unexcited hydrogen atom is a spherically symmetric function known as an &quot;s&quot; orbital (Fig. 1).

Analytic solutions of the Schrödinger equation are known for very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians including the quantum harmonic oscillator, the particle in a box, the dihydrogen cation, and the hydrogen atom. Even the helium atom – which contains just two electrons – has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment, admitting no solution in closed form.

However, there are techniques for finding approximate solutions. One method, called perturbation theory, uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak potential energy. Another approximation method applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior. These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion.

=== Uncertainty principle ===

One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle. In its most familiar form, this states that no preparation of a quantum particle can imply simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement of its position and for a measurement of its momentum. Both position and momentum are observables, meaning that they are represented by Hermitian operators. The position operator formula_24 and momentum operator formula_25 do not commute, but rather satisfy the canonical commutation relation:
: formula_26
Given a quantum state, the Born rule lets us compute expectation values for both formula_27 and formula_28, and moreover for powers of them. Defining the uncertainty for an observable by a standard deviation, we have
: formula_29
and likewise for the momentum:
: formula_30
The uncertainty principle states that
: formula_31
Either standard deviation can in principle be made arbitrarily small, but not both simultaneously. This inequality generalizes to arbitrary pairs of self-adjoint operators formula_32 and formula_33. The commutator of these two operators is
: formula_34
and this provides the lower bound on the product of standard deviations:
: formula_35

Another consequence of the canonical commutation relation is that the position and momentum operators are Fourier transforms of each other, so that a description of an object according to its momentum is the Fourier transform of its description according to its position. The fact that dependence in momentum is the Fourier transform of the dependence in position means that the momentum operator is equivalent (up to an formula_36 factor) to taking the derivative according to the position, since in Fourier analysis differentiation corresponds to multiplication in the dual space. This is why in quantum equations in position space, the momentum formula_37 is replaced by formula_38, and in particular in the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation in position space the momentum-squared term is replaced with a Laplacian times formula_39.

=== Composite systems and entanglement ===
When two different quantum systems are considered together, the Hilbert space of the combined system is the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces of the two components. For example, let and be two quantum systems, with Hilbert spaces formula_40 and formula_41, respectively. The Hilbert space of the composite system is then
: formula_42
If the state for the first system is the vector formula_43 and the state for the second system is formula_44, then the state of the composite system is
: formula_45
Not all states in the joint Hilbert space formula_46 can be written in this form, however, because the superposition principle implies that linear combinations of these &quot;separable&quot; or &quot;product states&quot; are also valid. For example, if formula_43 and formula_48 are both possible states for system formula_32, and likewise formula_44 and formula_51 are both possible states for system formula_33, then
: formula_53
is a valid joint state that is not separable. States that are not separable are called entangled.

If the state for a composite system is entangled, it is impossible to describe either component system or system by a state vector. One can instead define reduced density matrices that describe the statistics that can be obtained by making measurements on either component system alone. This necessarily causes a loss of information, though: knowing the reduced density matrices of the individual systems is not enough to reconstruct the state of the composite system. Just as density matrices specify the state of a subsystem of a larger system, analogously, positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) describe the effect on a subsystem of a measurement performed on a larger system. POVMs are extensively used in quantum information theory.

As described above, entanglement is a key feature of models of measurement processes in which an apparatus becomes entangled with the system being measured. Systems interacting with the environment in which they reside generally become entangled with that environment, a phenomenon known as quantum decoherence. This can explain why, in practice, quantum effects are difficult to observe in systems larger than microscopic.

=== Equivalence between formulations ===
There are many mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics. One of the oldest and most common is the &quot;transformation theory&quot; proposed by Paul Dirac, which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics – matrix mechanics (invented by Werner Heisenberg) and wave mechanics (invented by Erwin Schrödinger). An alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman&#x27;s path integral formulation, in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible classical and non-classical paths between the initial and final states. This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the action principle in classical mechanics.

=== Symmetries and conservation laws ===
The Hamiltonian formula_17 is known as the &quot;generator&quot; of time evolution, since it defines a unitary time-evolution operator formula_55 for each value of formula_56. From this relation between formula_57 and formula_17, it follows that any observable formula_32 that commutes with formula_17 will be &quot;conserved&quot;: its expectation value will not change over time. This statement generalizes, as mathematically, any Hermitian operator formula_32 can generate a family of unitary operators parameterized by a variable formula_56. Under the evolution generated by formula_32, any observable formula_33 that commutes with formula_32 will be conserved. Moreover, if formula_33 is conserved by evolution under formula_32, then formula_32 is conserved under the evolution generated by formula_33. This implies a quantum version of the result proven by Emmy Noether in classical (Lagrangian) mechanics: for every differentiable symmetry of a Hamiltonian, there exists a corresponding conservation law.

== Examples ==

=== Free particle ===
The simplest example of a quantum system with a position degree of freedom is a free particle in a single spatial dimension. A free particle is one which is not subject to external influences, so that its Hamiltonian consists only of its kinetic energy:
: formula_70
The general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by
: formula_71
which is a superposition of all possible plane waves formula_72, which are eigenstates of the momentum operator with momentum formula_73. The coefficients of the superposition are formula_74, which is the Fourier transform of the initial quantum state formula_75.

It is not possible for the solution to be a single momentum eigenstate, or a single position eigenstate, as these are not normalizable quantum states. Instead, we can consider a Gaussian wave packet:
: formula_76
which has Fourier transform, and therefore momentum distribution
: formula_77
We see that as we make formula_78 smaller the spread in position gets smaller, but the spread in momentum gets larger. Conversely, by making formula_78 larger we make the spread in momentum smaller, but the spread in position gets larger. This illustrates the uncertainty principle.

As we let the Gaussian wave packet evolve in time, we see that its center moves through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it). However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more and more uncertain. The uncertainty in momentum, however, stays constant.

=== Particle in a box ===

The particle in a one-dimensional potential energy box is the most mathematically simple example where restraints lead to the quantization of energy levels. The box is defined as having zero potential energy everywhere &quot;inside&quot; a certain region, and therefore infinite potential energy everywhere &quot;outside&quot; that region. For the one-dimensional case in the formula_80 direction, the time-independent Schrödinger equation may be written
: formula_81

With the differential operator defined by
: formula_82the previous equation is evocative of the classic kinetic energy analogue,
: formula_83
with state formula_1 in this case having energy formula_85 coincident with the kinetic energy of the particle.

The general solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the particle in a box are
: formula_86
or, from Euler&#x27;s formula,
: formula_87

The infinite potential walls of the box determine the values of formula_88 and formula_89 at formula_90 and formula_91 where formula_1 must be zero. Thus, at formula_90,
: formula_94
and formula_95. At formula_91,
: formula_97
in which formula_98 cannot be zero as this would conflict with the postulate that formula_1 has norm 1. Therefore, since formula_100, formula_101 must be an integer multiple of formula_102,
: formula_103

This constraint on formula_89 implies a constraint on the energy levels, yielding
: formula_105

A finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth. The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well. Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well. Another related problem is that of the rectangular potential barrier, which furnishes a model for the quantum tunneling effect that plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning tunneling microscopy.

=== Harmonic oscillator ===


As in the classical case, the potential for the quantum harmonic oscillator is given by
: formula_106

This problem can either be treated by directly solving the Schrödinger equation, which is not trivial, or by using the more elegant &quot;ladder method&quot; first proposed by Paul Dirac. The eigenstates are given by
: formula_107
: formula_108
where &quot;Hn&quot; are the Hermite polynomials
: formula_109
and the corresponding energy levels are
: formula_110

This is another example illustrating the discretization of energy for bound states.

=== Mach–Zehnder interferometer ===
The Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) illustrates the concepts of superposition and interference with linear algebra in dimension 2, rather than differential equations. It can be seen as a simplified version of the double-slit experiment, but it is of interest in its own right, for example in the delayed choice quantum eraser, the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester, and in studies of quantum entanglement.

We can model a photon going through the interferometer by considering that at each point it can be in a superposition of only two paths: the &quot;lower&quot; path which starts from the left, goes straight through both beam splitters, and ends at the top, and the &quot;upper&quot; path which starts from the bottom, goes straight through both beam splitters, and ends at the right. The quantum state of the photon is therefore a vector formula_111 that is a superposition of the &quot;lower&quot; path formula_112 and the &quot;upper&quot; path formula_113, that is, formula_114 for complex formula_115. In order to respect the postulate that formula_116 we require that formula_117.

Both beam splitters are modelled as the unitary matrix formula_118, which means that when a photon meets the beam splitter it will either stay on the same path with a probability amplitude of formula_119, or be reflected to the other path with a probability amplitude of formula_120. The phase shifter on the upper arm is modelled as the unitary matrix formula_121, which means that if the photon is on the &quot;upper&quot; path it will gain a relative phase of formula_122, and it will stay unchanged if it is in the lower path.

A photon that enters the interferometer from the left will then be acted upon with a beam splitter formula_33, a phase shifter formula_28, and another beam splitter formula_33, and so end up in the state
: formula_126
and the probabilities that it will be detected at the right or at the top are given respectively by
: formula_127
: formula_128
One can therefore use the Mach–Zehnder interferometer to estimate the phase shift by estimating these probabilities.

It is interesting to consider what would happen if the photon were definitely in either the &quot;lower&quot; or &quot;upper&quot; paths between the beam splitters. This can be accomplished by blocking one of the paths, or equivalently by removing the first beam splitter (and feeding the photon from the left or the bottom, as desired). In both cases, there will be no interference between the paths anymore, and the probabilities are given by formula_129, independently of the phase formula_122. From this we can conclude that the photon does not take one path or another after the first beam splitter, but rather that it is in a genuine quantum superposition of the two paths.

== Applications ==

Quantum mechanics has had enormous success in explaining many of the features of our universe, with regard to small-scale and discrete quantities and interactions which cannot be explained by classical methods. Quantum mechanics is often the only theory that can reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and others). Solid-state physics and materials science are dependent upon quantum mechanics.

In many aspects, modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant. Important applications of quantum theory include quantum chemistry, quantum optics, quantum computing, superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes, the optical amplifier and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy. Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA.

== Relation to other scientific theories ==
=== Classical mechanics ===

The rules of quantum mechanics assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space and that observables of the system are Hermitian operators acting on vectors in that space – although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators. These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system, a necessary step in making physical predictions. An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle, a heuristic which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics in the regime of large quantum numbers. One can also start from an established classical model of a particular system, and then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit. This approach is known as quantization.

When quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics. For instance, the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator.

Complications arise with chaotic systems, which do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.

Quantum decoherence is a mechanism through which quantum systems lose coherence, and thus become incapable of displaying many typically quantum effects: quantum superpositions become simply probabilistic mixtures, and quantum entanglement becomes simply classical correlations. Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales, though at temperatures approaching absolute zero quantum behavior may manifest macroscopically.

Many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts. For example, the stability of bulk matter (consisting of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids, and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics.

=== Special relativity and electrodynamics ===

Early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schrödinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein–Gordon equation or the Dirac equation. While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles. A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory, which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles). The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction. Quantum electrodynamics is, along with general relativity, one of the most accurate physical theories ever devised.

The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems. A simpler approach, one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field. For example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical formula_131 Coulomb potential. Likewise, in a Stern–Gerlach experiment, a charged particle is modeled as a quantum system, while the background magnetic field is described classically. This &quot;semi-classical&quot; approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photons by charged particles.

Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg.

=== Relation to general relativity ===
Even though the predictions of both quantum theory and general relativity have been supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence, their abstract formalisms contradict each other and they have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent, cohesive model. Gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications. However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in physical cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant &quot;Theory of Everything&quot; (TOE). Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics. This TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature from a single force or phenomenon.

One proposal for doing so is string theory, which posits that the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.

Another popular theory is loop quantum gravity (LQG), which describes quantum properties of gravity and is thus a theory of quantum spacetime. LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity. This theory describes space as an extremely fine fabric &quot;woven&quot; of finite loops called spin networks. The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam. The characteristic length scale of a spin foam is the Planck length, approximately 1.616×10−35 m, and so lengths shorter than the Planck length are not physically meaningful in LQG.

== Philosophical implications ==

Since its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations. The arguments centre on the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the difficulties with wavefunction collapse and the related measurement problem, and quantum nonlocality. Perhaps the only consensus that exists about these issues is that there is no consensus. Richard Feynman once said, &quot;I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.&quot; According to Steven Weinberg, &quot;There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.&quot;

The views of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the &quot;Copenhagen interpretation&quot;. According to these views, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a &quot;temporary&quot; feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a &quot;final&quot; renunciation of the classical idea of &quot;causality&quot;. Bohr in particular emphasized that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementary nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations. Copenhagen-type interpretations were adopted by Nobel laureates in quantum physics, including Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Feynman, and Zeilinger as well as 21st-century researchers in quantum foundations.

Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, was troubled by its apparent failure to respect some cherished metaphysical principles, such as determinism and locality. Einstein&#x27;s long-running exchanges with Bohr about the meaning and status of quantum mechanics are now known as the Bohr–Einstein debates. Einstein believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that explicitly forbids action at a distance. He argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete, a theory that was valid but not fundamental, analogous to how thermodynamics is valid, but the fundamental theory behind it is statistical mechanics. In 1935, Einstein and his collaborators Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published an argument that the principle of locality implies the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, a thought experiment later termed the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox. In 1964, John Bell showed that EPR&#x27;s principle of locality, together with determinism, was actually incompatible with quantum mechanics: they implied constraints on the correlations produced by distance systems, now known as Bell inequalities, that can be violated by entangled particles. Since then several experiments have been performed to obtain these correlations, with the result that they do in fact violate Bell inequalities, and thus falsify the conjunction of locality with determinism.

Bohmian mechanics shows that it is possible to reformulate quantum mechanics to make it deterministic, at the price of making it explicitly nonlocal. It attributes not only a wave function to a physical system, but in addition a real position, that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equation. The evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schrödinger equation together with the guiding equation; there is never a collapse of the wave function. This solves the measurement problem.

Everett&#x27;s many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that &quot;all&quot; the possibilities described by quantum theory &quot;simultaneously&quot; occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes. This is a consequence of removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet. All possible states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus, together with the observer, are present in a real physical quantum superposition. While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we do not observe the multiverse as a whole, but only one parallel universe at a time. Exactly how this is supposed to work has been the subject of much debate. Several attempts have been made to make sense of this and derive the Born rule, with no consensus on whether they have been successful.

Relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as a modern derivative of Copenhagen-type ideas, and QBism was developed some years later.

== History ==
Quantum mechanics was developed in the early decades of the 20th century, driven by the need to explain phenomena that, in some cases, had been observed in earlier times. Scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries, when scientists such as Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations. In 1803 English polymath Thomas Young described the famous double-slit experiment. This experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.

During the early 19th century, chemical research by John Dalton and Amedeo Avogadro lent weight to the atomic theory of matter, an idea that James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and others built upon to establish the kinetic theory of gases. The successes of kinetic theory gave further credence to the idea that matter is composed of atoms, yet the theory also had shortcomings that would only be resolved by the development of quantum mechanics. While the early conception of atoms from Greek philosophy had been that they were indivisible unitsthe word &quot;atom&quot; deriving from the Greek for &quot;uncuttable&quot; the 19th century saw the formulation of hypotheses about subatomic structure. One important discovery in that regard was Michael Faraday&#x27;s 1838 observation of a glow caused by an electrical discharge inside a glass tube containing gas at low pressure. Julius Plücker, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf and Eugen Goldstein carried on and improved upon Faraday&#x27;s work, leading to the identification of cathode rays, which J. J. Thomson found to consist of subatomic particles that would be called electrons.
The black-body radiation problem was discovered by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1859. In 1900, Max Planck proposed the hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete &quot;quanta&quot; (or energy packets), yielding a calculation that precisely matched the observed patterns of black-body radiation. The word &quot;quantum&quot; derives from the Latin, meaning &quot;how great&quot; or &quot;how much&quot;. According to Planck, quantities of energy could be thought of as divided into &quot;elements&quot; whose size (&quot;E&quot;) would be proportional to their frequency (&quot;ν&quot;):
: formula_132,
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant. Planck cautiously insisted that this was only an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and was not the &quot;physical reality&quot; of the radiation. In fact, he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discovery. However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck&#x27;s quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material. Niels Bohr then developed Planck&#x27;s ideas about radiation into a model of the hydrogen atom that successfully predicted the spectral lines of hydrogen. Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could also be described as a particle (later called the photon), with a discrete amount of energy that depends on its frequency. In his paper &quot;On the Quantum Theory of Radiation&quot;, Einstein expanded on the interaction between energy and matter to explain the absorption and emission of energy by atoms. Although overshadowed at the time by his general theory of relativity, this paper articulated the mechanism underlying the stimulated emission of radiation, which became the basis of the laser.
This phase is known as the old quantum theory. Never complete or self-consistent, the old quantum theory was rather a set of heuristic corrections to classical mechanics. The theory is now understood as a semi-classical approximation to modern quantum mechanics. Notable results from this period include, in addition to the work of Planck, Einstein and Bohr mentioned above, Einstein and Peter Debye&#x27;s work on the specific heat of solids, Bohr and Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen&#x27;s proof that classical physics cannot account for diamagnetism, and Arnold Sommerfeld&#x27;s extension of the Bohr model to include special-relativistic effects.

In the mid-1920s quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics. In 1923, the French physicist Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa. Building on de Broglie&#x27;s approach, modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925, when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented wave mechanics. Born introduced the probabilistic interpretation of Schrödinger&#x27;s wave function in July 1926. Thus, the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.

By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann with greater emphasis on measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the &#x27;observer&#x27;. It has since permeated many disciplines, including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. It also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies. While quantum mechanics was constructed to describe the world of the very small, it is also needed to explain some macroscopic phenomena such as superconductors and superfluids.

<text>Quilting is the process of joining a minimum of three layers of fabric together either through stitching manually using a needle and thread, or mechanically with a sewing machine or specialised longarm quilting system. An array of stitches is passed through all layers of the fabric to create a three-dimensional padded surface. The three layers are typically referred to as the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material, and the backing.

Quilting varies from a purely functional fabric joinery technique to highly elaborate, decorative three dimensional surface treatments. A wide variety of textile products are traditionally associated with quilting, including bed coverings, home furnishings, garments and costumes, wall hangings, artistic objects, and cultural artifacts.

A quilter can employ a wide range of effects that contribute to the quality and utility of the final quilted material. To create these effects, the quilter manipulates elements such as material type and thickness, stitch length and style, pattern design, piecing, and cutting. Two-dimensional effects such as optical illusions can be achieved through aesthetic choices regarding colour, texture, and print. Three-dimensional and sculptural components of quilted material can be manipulated and enhanced further by embellishment, which may include appliqué, embroidery techniques such as shisha mirror work, and the inclusion of other objects or elements such as pearls, beads, buttons, and sequins. Some quilters create or dye their own fabrics. In contemporary artistic quilting, quilters sometimes use new and experimental materials such as plastics, paper, natural fibers, and plants.

Quilting can be considered one of the first examples of upcycling, as quilters have historically made extensive use of remnants and offcuts for the creation of new products.

==History==

===Early quilting===
The origin of the term &#x27;quilt&#x27; is linked to the Latin word &quot;culcita&quot;, meaning a bolster, cushion, or stuffed sack. The word came into the English language from the French word &quot;cuilte&quot;. The first use of the term seems to have been in England in the 13th century. 

The sewing techniques of piecing, appliqué, and quilting have been used to create clothing and furnishings in various parts of the world for several millennia, and a wide range of unique quilting styles and techniques have evolved around the globe.

The earliest known quilted garment is depicted on the carved ivory figure of a Pharaoh dating from the ancient Egyptian First Dynasty. In 1924 archaeologists discovered a quilted floor covering in Mongolia, estimated to date between 100 BC and 200 AD.

In Europe, quilting has been part of the needlework tradition since about the fifth century. Early objects contained Egyptian cotton, which may indicate that Egyptian and Mediterranean trade provided a conduit for the technique. However, quilted objects were relatively rare in Europe until approximately the twelfth century, when quilted bedding and other items appeared after the return of the Crusaders from the Middle East. The medieval quilted gambeson, aketon and arming doublet were garments worn under or instead of chain mail or plate armor. These later developed into the quilted doublet worn as part of European male clothing from the fourteenth to seventeenth century. The earliest known surviving European bed quilt is the Tristan quilt, which was made in late-fourteenth century Italy from linen padded with wool. The blocks across its center are scenes from the legend of Tristan. The quilt is and is in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

===American quilts===

In American Colonial times, quilts were predominantly whole-cloth quilts—a single piece of fabric layered with batting and backing held together with fine needlework quilting. Broderie perse quilts were popular during this time and the majority of pierced or appliqued quilts made during the 1770–1800 period were medallion-style quilts (quilts with a central ornamental panel and one or more borders). Patchwork quilting in America dates to the 1770s, the decade the United States gained its independence from England. These late-eighteenth- and nineteenth-century patchwork quilts often mixed wool, silk, linen, and cotton in the same piece, as well as mixing large-scale (often chintz) and small-scale (often calico) patterns. In North America, some worn-out blankets were utilized to create a new quilt from worn-out clothes, and in these quilts the internal batting layer was made up of old blankets or older quilts. 

During American pioneer days, foundation piecing became popular. Paper was cut into shapes and used as a pattern; each individual piece of cut fabric was basted around the paper pattern. Paper was a scarce commodity in the early American west so women would save letters from home, postcards, newspaper clippings, and catalogs to use as patterns. The paper not only served as a pattern but as an insulator. Paper found between these old quilts has become a primary source of information about pioneer life.

Quilts made without any insulation or batting were referred to as summer quilts. They were not made for warmth, but to keep the chill off during cooler summer evenings.

====African-American quilts====

There is a long tradition of African-American quilting beginning with quilts made by enslaved Africans, both for themselves and for the people who enslaved them. The style of these quilts was determined largely by time period and region, rather than race, and the documented slave-made quilts generally resemble those made by white women in their region. After 1865 and the end of slavery in the United States, African-Americans began to develop their own distinctive style of quilting.
Harriet Powers, an African American woman born into slavery, made two famous &quot;story quilts&quot; and was one of the many African-American quilters who contributed to the development of quilting in the United States. This style of African-American quilts was categorized by its bright colors, organization in a strip arrangement, and asymmetrical patterns. 

The first nationwide recognition of African-American quilt-making came when the Gee&#x27;s Bend quilting community of Alabama was celebrated in an exhibition that opened in 2002 and traveled to many museums, including the Smithsonian. Gee&#x27;s Bend is a small, isolated community of African-Americans in southern Alabama with a quilt-making tradition that goes back several generations and is characterized by pattern improvisation, multiple patterning, bright and contrasting colors, visual motion, and a lack of rules. The contributions made by Harriet Powers and other quilters of Gee&#x27;s Bend, Alabama have been recognized by the US Postal Service with a series of stamps. Many of the quilters of Gee’s Bend also participated in the Freedom Quilting Bee. A quilting co-op created by some of the African American women of Wilcox County, Alabama.Some of the founding and influential members include Estelle Witherspoon, Willie Abrams, Lucy Mingo, Minder Pettway Coleman, and Aolar Mosely. The &quot;communal&quot; nature of the quilting process (and how it can bring together women of varied races and backgrounds) was honored in the series of stamps. Themes of community and storytelling are common themes in African-American quilts. 

Beginning with the children&#x27;s story &quot;Sweet Clara and the Freedom Quilt&quot; (1989), a legend has developed that enslaved people used quilts as a means to share and transmit secret messages to escape slavery and travel the Underground Railroad. Consensus among historians is that there is no sound basis for this belief, and no documented mention among the thousands of slave narratives or other contemporary records. 

Contemporary quilters such as Faith Ringgold utilize quilt making to tell stories and make political statements about the African-American experience. Ringgold, originally a painter, began quilting in order to stray away from Western art practices. Her famous &quot;story quilts&quot; utilize mixed media, painting, and quilting. One of her most famous quilts, &quot;Tar Beach 2&quot; (1990), depicts the story of a young African-American girl flying around Harlem in New York City.

Bisa Butler, another modern African-American quilter, celebrates Black life with her vibrant, quilted portraits of both everyday people and notable historical figures. Her quilts are now preserved in the permanent collections at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Art Institute of Chicago, and about a dozen other art museums.

==== Amish quilts ====

Another American group to develop a distinct style of quilting were the Amish. Typically, these quilts use only solid fabrics, are pieced from geometric shapes, do not contain appliqué, and construction is simple (corners are butted, rather than mitered, for instance) and done entirely by hand. Amish quilters also tend to use simple patterns: Lancaster County Amish are known for their Diamond-in-a-Square and Bars patterns, while other communities use patterns such as Brick, Streak of Lightning, Chinese Coins, and Log Cabins, and midwestern communities are known for their repeating block patterns. Borders and color choice also vary by community. For example, Lancaster quilts feature wide borders with lavish quilting. Midwestern quilts feature narrower borders to balance the fancier piecing.

==== Native American quilts ====

Some Native Americans are thought to have learned quilting through observation of white settlers; others learned it from missionaries who taught quilting to Native American women along with other homemaking skills. Native American women quickly developed their own unique style, the Lone Star design (also called the Star of Bethlehem), a variation on Morning Star designs that had been featured on Native American clothing and other items for centuries. These quilts often featured floral appliqué framing the star design. Star quilts have become an important part of many Plains Indian ceremonies, replacing buffalo robes traditionally given away at births, marriages, tribal elections, and other ceremonies. Pictorial quilts, created with appliqué, were also common.

Another distinctive style of Native American quilting is Seminole piecing, created by Seminoles living in the Florida Everglades. The style evolved out of a need for cloth (the closest town was often a week&#x27;s journey away). Women would make strips of sewing the remnants of fabric rolls together, then sew these into larger pieces to make clothing. Eventually the style began to be used not just for clothing but for quilts as well. In 1900, with the introduction of sewing machines and readily available fabric in Seminole communities, the patterns became much more elaborate and the style continues to be in use today, both by Seminole women and by others who have copied and adapted their designs and techniques.

====Hawaiian quilting====
&quot;Hawaiian quilting was well established by the beginning of the twentieth century. Hawaiian women learned to quilt from the wives of missionaries from New England in the 1820s. Though they learned both pieced work and applique, by the 1870s they had adapted applique techniques to create a uniquely Hawaiian mode of expression. The classic Hawaiian quilt design is a large, bold, curvilinear appliqué pattern that covers much of the surface of the quilt, with the symmetrical design cut from only one piece of fabric.&quot;

=== South Asian quilting ===

There are two primary forms of quilting that originate in South Asia: Nakshi Kantha and Ralli. Nakshi Kantha quilts originated in India and are typically made of scraps and worn-out fabric stitched together with old sari threads using kantha embroidery stitches. &quot;The layers of cloth were spread on the ground, held in place with weights at the edges, and sewn together with rows of large basting stitches. The cloth was then folded and worked on whenever there was time.&quot; The first recorded kantha are more than 500 years old.

Ralli quilts are traditionally made in Pakistan, western India, and the surrounding area. They are made by every sector of society including Hindu and Muslim women, women of different castes, and women from different towns or villages or tribes with the colors and designs varying among these groups. The name comes from &quot;ralanna&quot;, a word meaning to mix or connect. Quilts tops were designed and pieced by one woman using scraps of hand-dyed cotton. This cotton often comes from old dresses or shawls. Once pieced, the quilt top is placed on a reed mat with the other layers and sewn together using thick, colored thread in straight parallel lines by members of the designer&#x27;s family and community.

=== East Asian quilting ===
Quilting in Japan, until the 20th century, generally covered local bast fibers with more valuable cotton cloth. The rectangular nature of Japanese cloth articles encouraged rectangle-based patterns. Sashiko stitching has now also developed purely decorative forms.

=== Swedish quilting ===
Quilting originated in Sweden in the fifteenth century with heavily stitched and appliquéd quilts made for the very wealthy. These quilts, created from silk, wool, and felt, were intended to be both decorative and functional and were found in churches and in the homes of nobility. Imported cotton first appeared in Sweden in 1870, and began to appear in Swedish quilts soon after along with scraps of wool, silk, and linen. As the availability of cotton increased and its price went down, quilting became widespread among all classes of Swedish society. Wealthier quilters used wool batting while others used linen scraps, rags, or paper mixed with animal hair. In general, these quilts were simple and narrow, made by both men and women. The biggest influence on Swedish quilting in this time period is thought to have come from America as Swedish immigrants to the United States returned to their home country when conditions there improved.

===Art quilting===

During the late 20th century, art quilts became popular for their aesthetic and artistic qualities rather than for functionality; these quilts may be displayed on a wall or table instead of being used on a bed. &quot;It is believed that decorative quilting came to Europe and Asia during the Crusades (A.D. 1100–1300), a likely idea because textile arts were more developed in China and India than in the West.&quot;

American artist Judy Chicago stated in a 1981 interview that were it not for sexism in the visual arts, the art world, and broader society, quilting would be more widely regarded as a form of high art:

=== Modern quilting ===
In the early 21st century, modern quilting became a more prominent area of quilting. Modern quilting follows a distinct aesthetic style which draws on inspiration from modern style in architecture, art, and design using traditional quilt making techniques. Modern quilts are different from art quilts in that they are made to be used. Modern quilts are also influenced by the Quilters of Gee&#x27;s Bend, Amish quilts, Nancy Crow, Denyse Schmidt, Gwen Marston, Yoshiko Jinzenji, Bill Kerr and Weeks Ringle.

The Modern Quilt Guild has attempted to define modern quilting. The characteristics of a modern quilt may include: the use of bold colors and prints, high contrast and graphic areas of solid color, improvisational piecing, minimalism, expansive negative space, and alternate grid work.

The Modern Quilt Guild, a non-profit corporation, with 14,000 members in more than 200 members guilds in 39 countries, fosters modern quilting via local guilds, workshops, webinars, and Quiltcon—an annual modern quilting conference and convention. The founding Modern Quilt Guild formed in October 2009 in Los Angeles.

QuiltCon features a quilt show with 400+ quilts, quilt vendors, lectures, and quilting workshops and classes. The first QuiltCon was February 21–24, 2013 in Austin, TX. QuiltCon 2020 was held in Austin, Texas, February 20–23, 2020 and featured 400 juried modern quilts from quilters around the world.

===Quilting in fashion and design===
Unusual quilting designs have increasingly become popular as decorative textiles. As industrial sewing technology has become more precise and flexible, quilting using exotic fabrics and embroidery began to appear in home furnishings in the early 21st century.

===Quilt blocks===
The quilt block is traditionally a sub-unit composed of several pieces of fabric sewn together. The quilt blocks are repeated, or sometimes alternated with plain blocks, to form the overall design of a quilt. Barbara Brackman has documented over 4000 different quilt block patterns from the early 1830s to the 1970s in the &quot;Encyclopedia Of Pieced Quilt Patterns&quot;. Some of the simpler designs for quilt blocks include the Nine-Patch, Shoo Fly, Churn Dash, and the Prairie Queen.

Most geometric quilt block designs fit into a &quot;grid&quot;, which is the number of squares a pattern block is divided into. The five categories into which most square patterns fall are Four Patch, Nine Patch, Five-Patch, Seven-Patch, and Eight-Pointed Star. Each block can be subdivided into multiples: a Four-Patch can be constructed of 16 or 64 squares, for example.

A simple Nine Patch is made by sewing five patterned or dark pieces (patches) to four light square pieces in alternating order. These nine sewn squares make one block.

The Shoo Fly varies from this Nine Patch by dividing each of the four corner pieces into a light and dark triangle.

Another variation develops when one square piece is divided into two equal rectangles in the basic Nine Patch design. The Churn Dash block combines the triangles and rectangle to expand the Nine Patch.

The Prairie Queen block combines two large scale triangles in the corner section with the middle section using four squares. The center piece is one full size square. Each of the nine sections does have the same overall measurement and fits together.

The number of patterns possible by subdividing Four-, Five-, Seven-, Nine-Patches and Eight-Pointed Stars and using triangles instead of squares in the small subdivisions is almost endless.

==Quilting techniques==
Many types of quilting exist today. The two most widely used are hand-quilting and machine quilting.

Hand quilting is the process of using a needle and thread to sew a running stitch by hand across the entire area to be quilted. This binds the layers together. A quilting frame or hoop is often used to assist in holding the piece being quilted off the quilter&#x27;s lap. A quilter can make one stitch at a time by first driving the needle through the fabric from the right side, then pushing it back up through the material from the wrong side to complete the stitch; this is called a stab stitch. Another option is called a rocking stitch, where the quilter has one hand, usually with a finger wearing a thimble, on top of the quilt, while the other hand is located beneath the piece to push the needle back up. A third option is called &quot;loading the needle&quot; and involves doing four or more stitches before pulling the needle through the cloth. Hand quilting is still practiced by the Amish and Mennonites within the United States and Canada, and is enjoying a resurgence worldwide.

Machine quilting is the process of using a home sewing machine or a longarm machine to sew the layers together. With the home sewing machine, the layers are tacked together before quilting. This involves laying the top, batting, and backing out on a flat surface and either pinning (using large safety pins) or tacking the layers together. Longarm quilting involves placing the layers to be quilted on a special frame. The frame has bars on which the layers are rolled, keeping these together without the need for tacking or pinning. These frames are used with a professional sewing machine mounted on a platform. The platform rides along tracks so that the machine can be moved across the layers on the frame. A longarm machine is moved across the fabric. In contrast, the fabric is moved through a home sewing machine.

Tying is another technique of fastening the three layers together. This is done primarily on quilts that are made to be used and are needed quickly. The process of tying the quilt is done with yarns or multiple strands of thread. Square knots are used to finish off the ties so that the quilt may be washed and used without fear of the knots coming undone. This technique is commonly called &quot;tacking.&quot; In the Midwest, tacked bed covers are referred to as comforters.

Quilting is now taught in some American schools. It is also taught at senior centers around the U.S., but quilters of all ages attend classes. These forms of workshops or classes are also available in other countries in guilds and community colleges.

===Quilting tools===
Contemporary quilters use a wide range of quilting designs and styles, from ancient and ethnic to post-modern futuristic patterns. There is no one single school or style that dominates the quilt-making world.

Sewing machines can be used in the process of piecing together a quilt top. Some quilters also use a home sewing machine for quilting together the layers of the quilt, as well as binding the final product. While most home sewing machines can be used to quilt layers together, having a wide throat (the space to the right of the needle mechanism) is useful to manipulate a bulky quilt through the machine when the throat is both high and long.

Fabric markers can be used to mark where cuts should be made in the fabric. Marks from specialist fabric marker wash out of fabrics.
Quilting rulers are usually square or rectangular measuring instruments with length measurement and degree angle markings along multiple edges.

Longarm quilting machines can be used to make larger quilts. Larger machines can be leveraged so that the quilter does not have to hold the fabric. Some specialist quilt shops offer longarm services.

Machine quilting needles are very sharp in order to readily pierce layers of quilt and properly sew together the quilt top, batting and backing.

Hand quilting needles are traditionally called &quot;betweens&quot; and are generally smaller and stronger than normal sewing needles. They have a very small eye which prevents any extra bump at the head of the needles when you are pulling through the thread.

Pins can be used in many different combinations to achieve similar results.

Thimbles provide protection to fingertips.

Specialist quilting threads come in many types, including different weights of thread and different materials. Cotton, polyester, and nylon threads are used in different forms of quilting.

Rotary cutters revolutionized quilt-making when they appeared in the late 1970s. Rotary cutters simplify the process of cutting even slices of fabric.

Basting spray is a temporary aerosol glue that can be used to spray the layers of a quilt together, so it stays in place whilst being sewn. It is a specially formulated glue that will not clog a sewing machine, and is a much quicker basting method than hand basting.

Quilting templates/patterns come in many varieties and are generally considered the basis of the structure of the quilt, like a blueprint for a house.

Bias binding or bias tape can be made from strips of quilt fabric or purchased as quilt binding. It is used in the last stage of making a quilt, and is a method of covering the edges of the quilt.

<text>Qt ( or ; pronounced &quot;cute&quot; or as an initialism) is a cross-platform application development framework for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed.

Qt is currently being developed by The Qt Company, a publicly listed company, and the Qt Project under open-source governance, involving individual developers and organizations working to advance Qt. Qt is available under both commercial licenses and open-source GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, and LGPL 3.0 licenses.

== Purposes and abilities ==
Qt is used for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and multi-platform applications that run on all major desktop platforms and mobile or embedded platforms.
Most GUI programs created with Qt have a native-looking interface, in which case Qt is classified as a &quot;widget toolkit&quot;. Non-GUI programs can also be developed, such as command-line tools and consoles for servers. An example of such a non-GUI program using Qt is the Cutelyst web framework.

Qt supports various C++ compilers, including the GCC and Clang C++ compilers and the Visual Studio suite. It supports other languages with bindings or extensions, such as Python via Python bindings and PHP via an extension for PHP5, and has extensive internationalization support. Qt also provides Qt Quick, that includes a declarative scripting language called QML that allows using JavaScript to provide the logic. With Qt Quick, rapid application development for mobile devices became possible, while logic can still be written with native code as well to achieve the best possible performance.

Other features include SQL database access, XML parsing, JSON parsing, thread management and network support.

== Releases ==

The latest version of the Qt Framework is Qt 6.8, which was released on 8 October 2024.

Also still supported are — for commercial users — 6.5 LTS, released on 3 April 2023, 6.2 LTS, released on 30 September 2021, and 5.15 LTS, released on 26 May 2020 – long-term support (LTS) versions are generally supported for three years with a commercial license, while 5.15 support was extended to five years for subscription license holders, and so it is supported until 26 May 2025. Additionally the KDE project provides unofficial support for, at least, Qt 5.15, i.e. not just for commercial users.

== Qt in use ==
In 2017, the Qt Company estimated a community of about 1 million developers worldwide in over 70 industries.

== Qt software architecture ==
=== Qt concepts ===
Qt is built on these key concepts:
;Complete abstraction of the GUI: When first released, Qt used its own paint engine and controls, emulating the look of the different platforms it runs on when it drew its widgets. This made the porting work easier because very few classes in Qt really depended on the target platform; however, this occasionally led to slight discrepancies where that emulation was imperfect. Recent versions of Qt use the native style APIs of the different platforms, on platforms that have a native widget set, to query metrics and draw most controls, and do not suffer from such issues as often. On some platforms (such as MeeGo and KDE) Qt &quot;is&quot; the native API. Some other portable graphical toolkits have made different design decisions; for example, wxWidgets uses the toolkits of the target platform for its implementations.
;Signals and slots: A language construct introduced in Qt for communication between objects which makes it easy to implement the observer pattern while avoiding boilerplate code. The concept is that GUI widgets can send signals containing event information which can be received by other controls using special functions known as slots.
;Metaobject compiler: The metaobject compiler, termed &quot;moc&quot;, is a tool that is run on the sources of a Qt program. It interprets certain macros from the C++ code as annotations, and uses them to generate added C++ code with meta information about the classes used in the program. This meta information is used by Qt to provide programming features not available natively in C++: signals and slots, introspection and asynchronous function calls.
;Language bindings:Qt can be used in several programming languages other than C++, such as Python, Javascript, C# and Rust via language bindings; many languages have bindings for Qt 5 and bindings for Qt 4.

=== Qt modules ===
Starting with Qt 4.0 the framework was split into individual modules. With Qt 5.0 the architecture was modularized even further. Qt is now split into &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;add-on&quot; modules.

==== Qt essentials ====
==== Qt add-ons ====
=== Editions ===
There are four editions of Qt available: &quot;Community&quot;, &quot;Indie Mobile&quot;, &quot;Professional&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The Community version is under the open source licenses, while the Indie Mobile, Professional and Enterprise versions, which contain additional functionality and libraries, e.g. Enterprise Controls are commercially sold by The Qt Company.

=== Supported platforms ===
Qt works on many different platforms; the following are officially supported:

After Nokia opened the Qt source code to the community on Gitorious, various ports appeared. There are also some ports of Qt that may be available, but are not supported anymore. These platforms are listed in List of platforms supported by Qt. See also there for current community support for other lesser known platforms, such as SailfishOS.

=== Licensing ===
Qt is available under the following free software licenses: GPL 2.0, GPL 3.0, LGPL 3.0 and LGPL 2.1 (with Qt special exception). Note that some modules are available only under a GPL license, which means that applications which link to these modules need to comply with that license.

In addition, Qt has always been available under a commercial license, like the Qt Commercial License, that allows developing proprietary applications with no restrictions on licensing.

=== Qt tools ===
Qt comes with its own set of tools to ease cross-platform development, which can otherwise be cumbersome due to different set of development tools.

Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE for C++ and QML. Qt Designer&#x27;s GUI layout/design functionality is integrated into the IDE, although Qt Designer can still be started as a standalone tool.

In addition to Qt Creator, Qt provides qmake, a cross-platform build script generation tool that automates the generation of Makefiles for development projects across different platforms.
There are other tools available in Qt, including the Qt Designer interface builder and the Qt Assistant help browser (which are both embedded in Qt Creator), the Qt Linguist translation tool, uic (user interface compiler), and moc (Meta-Object Compiler).

== History of Qt ==

=== Early developments ===
In the summer of 1990, Haavard Nord and Eirik Chambe-Eng (the original developers of Qt and the CEO and President, respectively, of Trolltech) were working together on a database application for ultrasound images written in C++ and running on Mac OS, Unix, and Microsoft Windows. They began development of &quot;Qt&quot; in 1991, three years before the company was incorporated as Quasar Technologies, then changed the name to Troll Tech and then to Trolltech.

The toolkit was called Qt because the letter Q looked appealing in Haavard&#x27;s Emacs typeface, and &quot;t&quot; was inspired by Xt, the X toolkit.

The first two versions of Qt had only two flavors: Qt/X11 for Unix and Qt/Windows for Windows.

On 20 May 1995 Trolltech publicly released Qt 0.90 for X11/Linux with the source code under the &quot;Qt Free Edition License&quot;. This license was viewed as not compliant with the free software definition by Free Software Foundation because, while the source was available, it did not allow the redistribution of modified versions. Trolltech used this license until version 1.45. Controversy erupted around 1998 when it became clear that the K Desktop Environment was going to become one of the leading desktop environments for Linux. As it was based on Qt, many people in the free software movement worried that an essential piece of one of their major operating systems would be proprietary.

The Windows platform was available only under a proprietary license, which meant free/open source applications written in Qt for X11 could not be ported to Windows without purchasing the proprietary edition.

=== Becoming free software–friendly ===
With the release of version 2.0 of the toolkit in mid-1999, the license was changed to the Q Public License (QPL), a free software license, but one regarded by the Free Software Foundation as incompatible with the GPL. Compromises were sought between KDE and Trolltech whereby Qt would not be able to fall under a more restrictive license than the QPL, even if Trolltech was bought out or went bankrupt. This led to the creation of the KDE Free Qt foundation, which guarantees that Qt would fall under a BSD-style license should no free/open source version of Qt be released during 12 months.

In 2000, Qt/X11 2.2 was released under the GPL v2, ending all controversy regarding GPL compatibility.

At the end of 2001, Trolltech released Qt 3.0, which added support for Mac OS X (now known as macOS). The Mac OS X support was available only in the proprietary license until June 2003, when Trolltech released Qt 3.2 with Mac OS X support available under the GPL.

In 2002, members of the KDE on Cygwin project began porting the GPL licensed Qt/X11 code base to Windows. This was in response to Trolltech&#x27;s refusal to license Qt/Windows under the GPL on the grounds that Windows was not a free/open source software platform. The project achieved reasonable success although it never reached production quality.

This was resolved when Trolltech released Qt 4.0 also for Windows under the GPL in June 2005. Qt 4 supported the same set of platforms in the free software/open source editions as in the proprietary edition, so it is possible, with Qt 4.0 and later releases, to create GPL-licensed free/open source applications using Qt on all supported platforms. The GPL v3 with special exception was later added as an added licensing option. The GPL exception allows the final application to be licensed under various GPL-incompatible free software/open source licenses such as the Mozilla Public License 1.1.

=== Acquisition by Nokia ===
Nokia acquired Trolltech ASA on 17 June 2008 and changed the name first to Qt Software, then to Qt Development Frameworks.

Nokia focused on turning Qt into the main development platform for its devices, including a port to the Symbian S60 platform. Version 1.0 of the Nokia Qt SDK was released on 23 June 2010. The source code was made available over Gitorious, a community oriented git source code repository, with a goal of creating a broader community using and improving Qt.

On 14 January 2009, Qt version 4.5 added another option, the LGPL, to make Qt more attractive for both non-GPL open source projects and closed applications.

In February 2011, Nokia announced its decision to drop Symbian technologies and base their future smartphones on the Windows Phone platform instead (and since then support for that platform has also been dropped). One month later, Nokia announced the sale of Qt&#x27;s commercial licensing and professional services to Digia, with the immediate goal of taking Qt support to Android, iOS and Windows 8 platforms, and to continue focusing on desktop and embedded development, although Nokia was to remain the main development force behind the framework at that time.

=== Merging and demerging with Digia ===
In March 2011, Nokia sold the commercial licensing part of Qt to Digia, creating Qt Commercial. In August 2012, Digia announced that it would acquire Qt from Nokia. The Qt team at Digia started their work in September 2012. They released Qt 5.0 within a month and newer versions every six months with new features and additional supported platforms.

In September 2014, Digia transferred the Qt business and copyrights to their wholly owned subsidiary, The Qt Company, which owns 25 brands related to Qt. In May 2016, Digia and Qt demerged completely into two independent companies.

=== The Qt Project and open governance ===
Qt 5 was officially released on 19 December 2012. This new version marked a major change in the platform, with hardware-accelerated graphics, QML and JavaScript playing a major role. The traditional C++-only QWidgets continued to be supported, but did not benefit from the performance improvements available through the new architecture. Qt 5 brings significant improvements to the speed and ease of developing user interfaces.

Framework development of Qt 5 moved to open governance at qt-project.org, which made it possible for developers outside Digia to submit patches for review.

=== Qt contributors ===

Aside from The Qt Company, many organizations and individuals using Qt as their development platform participate in the open development of Qt via the Qt Project.

One such Qt contributor is Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB, a Swedish Qt consulting company. KDAB is involved in many areas, including maintenance of several components.

Together with RIM/BlackBerry, KDAB is maintaining the QNX and BlackBerry 10 ports of Qt.

Another participator is Intel, contributing for example Wayland support. AudioCodes maintains IBM ClearCase support in Qt Creator.

As a heavy user of Qt, the KDE project submits many patches and features from its developer library KDE Frameworks back to Qt.

<text>QuakeC is a compiled language developed in 1996 by John Carmack of id Software to program parts of the video game &quot;Quake&quot;. Using QuakeC, a programmer is able to customize &quot;Quake&quot; to great extents by adding weapons, changing game logic and physics, and programming complex scenarios. It can be used to control many aspects of the game itself, such as parts of the AI, triggers, or changes in the level. The &quot;Quake&quot; engine was the only game engine to use QuakeC. Following engines used DLL game modules for customization written in C, and C++ from id Tech 4 on.

== Overview ==
The QuakeC source to the original id Software &quot;Quake&quot; game logic was published in 1996 and used as the basis for modifications like capture the flag and others. QuakeC source code is compiled using a tool called qcc into a bytecode kept in a file called . The programmers of &quot;Quake&quot; modifications could then publish their bytecode without revealing their source code. Most &quot;Quake&quot; mods were published this way.

QuakeC allowed the &quot;Quake&quot; engine to dominate the direction of the first-person shooter genre. Thanks to Carmack&#x27;s idea of extending video game life by adding unlimited expandability (extensibility already played a big role in &quot;Doom&quot;), an enormous Internet community of gamers and programmers alike has arisen and many modern multiplayer games are extensible in some form.

QuakeC is known as interpreted because as &quot;Quake&quot; runs, it is continually interpreting the progs.dat file.

== Limitations and subsequent solutions ==
The syntax of QuakeC is based on that of the C programming language, explaining its name, but it does not support the implementation of new types, structures, arrays, or any kind of referencing other than the &quot;entity&quot; type (which is always a reference). QuakeC also suffers from the fact that many built-in functions (functions prototyped in the QuakeC code but actually defined within the game engine and written in C) return strings in a temporary string buffer, which can only hold one string at any given time. In other words, a construct such as

:codice_1

will fail because the second call to codice_2 (which converts a floating-point value to a string) overwrites the string returned by the first call before SomeFunction can do something with it. QuakeC does not contain any string handling functions or file handling functions, which were simply not needed by the original game.

Most video games at the time had their game logic written in plain C/C++ and compiled into the executable, which is faster. However, this makes it harder for the community to create mods and it makes the process of porting the game to another platform (such as Linux) more costly.

Despite its advantages, the choice of implementing game logic using a custom scripting language and interpreter was dropped from the next generation Quake II engine in favor of compiled C code due to the overall inflexibility of QuakeC, the increasingly complex game logic, the performance to be gained by packaging game logic into a native dynamic link library, and the advantage of leveraging an already established programming language&#x27;s community, tools, educational materials, and documentation.

Distributing native code created new security and portability concerns. QuakeC bytecode afforded little opportunity for mischief, while native code has access to the whole machine. QuakeC bytecode also worked on any machine that could run Quake. Compiling to native code added an additional barrier to entry for novice mod developers, because they were being asked to set up a more complicated programming environment. The eventual solution, implemented by the Quake III engine, was to combine the advantages of original QuakeC with the advantages of compiling C to native code. The lcc C compiler was extended to compile standard C into bytecode, which could be interpreted by a virtual machine in a manner similar to QuakeC. This addressed the security, portability, and tool chain problems, but lost the performance advantage of native code. That was solved by further compiling the bytecode into native code at run time on supported machines.

== Modified compilers and language extensions ==
A decompiler and a recompiler were released by Armin Rigo (called codice_3 and codice_4 respectively). These programs were made through the process of reverse engineering, and were most likely published before the release of codice_5.

id Software released the source of codice_5, their QuakeC compiler, along with the original QuakeC code in 1996. Modified versions soon sprung up, including Jonathan Roy&#x27;s codice_7 and Ryan &quot;FrikaC&quot; Smith&#x27;s FrikQCC. These added functionality, optimizations, and compiling speed boosts.

In 1999, when id Software released the code from Quake&#x27;s engine under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the workings of the bytecode interpreter were examined and new QuakeC compilers were released, such as J.P. Grossman&#x27;s codice_8 and a new version of FrikQCC. These compilers took advantage of newly discovered features in a backwards-compatible way so that the bytecode could still be properly interpreted by unmodified Quake engines. New features include arrays, pointers, integers, for loops and string manipulation.

With the &quot;Quake&quot; engine source code now able to be changed, further features were added to QuakeC in the form of new built-in functions. Features long yearned for by QuakeC coders finally reached realization as QuakeC now had file and string handling functions, enlarged string buffers, more math functions, and so on. However, programmers taking advantage of these changes lost backwards compatibility with the unmodified Quake engine.

&quot;Xonotic&quot; since version 0.7 uses the gmqcc compiler.

== Client-side QuakeC ==
Some enhanced &quot;Quake&quot; engines (notably DarkPlaces and FTEQW) have support for an extension of regular QuakeC (now commonly referred to as server-side QuakeC) that allows client-side-only scripting of the &quot;Quake&quot; engine, also abbreviated as CSQC (client-side QuakeC). This is especially useful for GUIs, HUDs and any visually heavy effects that do not need to be simulated on the server and transferred over the network.

<text>The Quad Cities is a region of five cities (originally Tri-Cities, later four, see History) in the U.S. states of Iowa and Illinois: Davenport and Bettendorf (the fifth to be included) in southeastern Iowa, and Rock Island, Moline and East Moline (the fourth to be included) in northwestern Illinois. These cities are the center of the Quad Cities metropolitan area, a region within the Mississippi River Valley, which as of 2023, had a population estimate of 467,817 and a Combined Statistical Area (CSA) population of 474,019, making it the 90th-largest CSA in the nation.

==History==
===Early history===
Before European settlers came to inhabit the Quad Cities, the confluence of rivers had attracted many varying cultures of indigenous peoples, who used the waterways and riverbanks for their settlements for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, it was a home and principal trading place of the Sauk and Fox tribes of Native Americans. Saukenuk was the principal village of the Sauk tribe and birthplace of its 19th-century war chief, Black Hawk. In 1832, Sauk chief Keokuk and General Winfield Scott signed a treaty in Davenport after the US defeated the Sauk and their allies in the Black Hawk War. The treaty resulted in the Native Americans ceding of land to the United States in exchange for a much smaller reservation elsewhere. Black Hawk State Historic Site in Rock Island preserves part of historic Saukenuk and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The history of urban settlements in the Quad Cities was stimulated by riverboat traffic. For between LeClaire, Iowa, and Rock Island, the Mississippi River flowed across a series of finger-like rock projections protruding from either bank. These rapids were difficult for steamboats to traverse. As demand for river-based transportation increased along the upper Mississippi, the navigability of the river throughout the &quot;Rock Island Rapids&quot; became a greater concern. Over time, a minor industry grew up in the area to meet the steamboats&#x27; needs. Boat crews needed rest areas to stop before encountering the rapids, places to hire expert pilots such as Phillip Suiter, who was the first licensed pilot on the upper Mississippi River, to guide the boat through the rocky waters, or, when the water was low, places where goods could be removed and transported by wagon on land past the rapids. Today, the rocks are submerged six feet underwater by a lake formed by two locks and dams.

As the Industrial Revolution developed in the United States, many enterprising industrialists looked to the Mississippi River as a promising source of power generation. The combination of energy and easy access to river transportation attracted entrepreneurs and industrialists to the Quad Cities for development. In 1848, John Deere moved his plough business to Moline. His business was incorporated as Deere &amp; Company in 1868. Deere &amp; Company is the largest employer today in the Quad Cities.

The first railroad bridge built across the Mississippi River connected Davenport and Rock Island in 1856. It was built by the Rock Island Railroad Company and replaced the slow seasonal ferry service and winter ice bridges as the primary modes of transportation across the river. Steamboaters saw the nationwide railroads as a threat to their business. On May 6, 1856, just weeks after completion of the bridge, an angry steamboater crashed the &quot;Effie Afton&quot; into it. John Hurd, the owner of the &quot;Effie Afton&quot;, filed a lawsuit against the Rock Island Railroad Company in &quot;Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company&quot;. The Rock Island Railroad Company selected Abraham Lincoln as their trial lawyer and won after he took the case to the US Supreme Court. Expert riverboat pilot Phillip Suiter was one of his witnesses. It was a pivotal trial in Lincoln&#x27;s career.

===Evolution of an identity===

After the Civil War, the region began to gain a common identity. The river towns that were thoughtfully planned and competently led flourished, while other settlements, usually get-rich-quick schemes for speculators, failed to pan out. By World War I, the towns of Davenport, Rock Island, and Moline had begun to style themselves as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot;, a cluster of three more-or-less equally-sized river communities growing around the small bend of the Mississippi River where it flows west. But with the growth of Rock Island County, during the 1930s the term &quot;Quad Cities&quot; came into vogue, as East Moline was given &quot;equal status&quot;. Despite the fact that the region had earned the name &quot;Quad Cities&quot;, the National Basketball Association had a franchise in Moline, Illinois, from 1946 to 1951 called the &quot;Tri-Cities Blackhawks&quot;. Then, with the opening of an Alcoa (now Arconic) plant east of Davenport in 1948, the town of Bettendorf underwent so much growth that many people in the community discussed the adoption of the name &quot;Quint Cities&quot;, but by this time, the name &quot;Quad Cities&quot; had become known well beyond the area, and &quot;Quint Cities&quot; never caught on, despite the efforts of WOC-TV (now KWQC-TV) and others. Consequently, when Bettendorf passed East Moline in size, there was some debate about whether Bettendorf had &quot;displaced&quot; East Moline. Instead, local officials, such as the Chamber of Commerce, have chosen an inclusive approach, maintaining the name &quot;Quad Cities&quot; yet including all five cities.

===1980s–current===
Beginning in the late 1970s, economic conditions caused major industrial restructuring, which disrupted the basis of the region&#x27;s economy. The major companies, agricultural manufacturers, ceased or scaled back operations in the Quad Cities. Factories which closed included International Harvester (Navistar) in Rock Island and Case IH in Bettendorf. Moline-based John Deere cut its labor headcount by one half. Later in the 1980s, Caterpillar Inc. closed its factories at Mount Joy and Bettendorf.

Since the 1990s, the Quad Cities governments, businesses, non-profits and residents have worked hard to redevelop the region. They have achieved national attention for their accomplishments.

Examples of revitalization and rebirth include:
* Davenport&#x27;s River Renaissance (a downtown revitalization project that includes a river music history center), an ag-tech venture capital campus, and the Figge Art Museum opened or were completed during the first decade of the 21st century.
* Moline has invested in what was once a robust downtown. The &quot;John Deere Commons&quot; and the Vibrant Arena at The MARK (formerly &quot;The MARK of the Quad Cities&quot;, the &quot;iWireless Center&quot;, and the &quot;TaxSlayer Center&quot;) both opened during the 1990s.
* In 2007, Davenport and Rock Island competed for and won the title of &quot;most livable small city&quot; from the National Council of Mayors, based upon an unfunded proposal called RiverVision.
* In 2008 Bettendorf was ranked by CNN as one of the ten best places to buy a house in the United States.
* In 2010, the Quad Cities were named &quot;the most affordable metro&quot; by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine.
* In 2012, Davenport housing market ranked second in the nation beating the housing bubble, due to its lack of foreclosures and their low unemployment.
* In 2012, the Quad Cities Metropolitan Area was ranked among the fastest-growing areas in the nation in the growth of high-tech jobs.
*In 2012, the Quad Cities were named the &quot;2012 All American City&quot;
*In 2013, Modern Woodman Park was voted the best minor league ballpark in America.

===Proposed mergers===
Over the years, several communities in the Quad Cities region have proposed or performed mergers. As it grew, Davenport annexed the communities of Rockingham, Nahant, Probstei, East Davenport, Oakdale, Cawiezeel, Blackhawk, Mt. Joy, Green Tree, and others. Bettendorf annexed portions of Pleasant Valley in the 1970s. In 1987, Rock Island, Moline, East Moline, Milan, Carbon Cliff, Hampton, Coal Valley and Silvis considered a super-city merger which would have seen the Illinois cities become the second-largest city in the state, but the proposal ultimately failed. Moline and East Moline considered a merger in 1997. That same year, Green Rock and Colona did merge. Bettendorf and Riverdale also considered a merger.

==Geography==
The Quad Cities is located at the confluence of the Rock and Mississippi rivers, approximately west of Chicago, and forms the largest metropolitan area along the Mississippi River between Minneapolis–Saint Paul and the St. Louis metropolitan area. Interstate 80 crosses the Mississippi River here. The Quad Cities Metropolitan Area consists of three counties: Scott County in Iowa, and Rock Island County and Henry County in Illinois. The Quad Cities Metropolitan Area is also considered part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis. 

The Quad Cities area is distinctive because the Mississippi River flows from east to west as it passes through the heart of the area; the Iowa cities of Davenport and Bettendorf are located due north of Rock Island and Moline, respectively.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 United States Census Count, the metropolitan area grew to 471,551. As of the 2000 census, a total of 96,495 households and 60,535 families resided in the area.

===Race and ethnicity===
The racial makeup of the area is 90.6% White (410,861), 3.7% Black or African American (27,757), 0.6% American Indian and Alaskan Native (1,255), 1.0% Asian (6,624), 0.03% Pacific Islander (156), and 2.0% from two or more races (11,929). 7.1% of the population is Hispanic or Latino of any race (37,070). The predominant ethnicities in the Quad Cities are of northern European descent, including German, Irish, and English, as well Scandinavian (Mostly Swedish and Norwegian) and Dutch. The primary minority groups in the area are African-Americans, which in Davenport make up the third largest black population in the state of Iowa, a community dating back to the 1830s when Iowa was a free territory. Many of the city&#x27;s African-American residents have roots in the Southern/Border states of the U.S., including Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, and Missouri. The most significant Asian-American populations are South Asian and Vietnamese American.

===Religion===
According to resources, Christianity is the largest religion practiced in the area. However, the two states have a different population of Christian groups. In Davenport and Bettendorf, Catholics make up an 18.5% plurality, but Protestants with 15.1% Mainline and 11.6% Evangelical make up large minorities as well. The Black Protestants on the Iowa side comes in at 1.2%. On the Illinois side, between Rock Island, Moline, and East Moline, Catholicism is less prevalent at 12.4%, and at 12.5% Evangelical and 11.0% Mainline have smaller declines.

The Jewish population is about 500–600, which is down from about 1,800–2,000 in the 1950s and 1960s.

==Metropolitan area==

The Quad Cities metropolitan area, more formally known as the Davenport–Moline–Rock Island Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), is the metropolitan area associated with the Quad Cities in the U.S. states of Iowa and Illinois. The Davenport–Moline–Rock Island MSA consists of four counties – Scott County in Iowa and Henry, Mercer, and Rock Island counties in Illinois – and had an estimated population of 384,324 as of 2020.

The Quad Cities metropolitan area is also considered part of the Great Lakes Megalopolis, and is the largest metropolitan area along the Mississippi River in Iowa and between Minneapolis–Saint Paul and the St. Louis metropolitan area.

The Handel Oratorio Society, dating to 1880, is the second-oldest organization of its kind in the nation and presents annual performances of &quot;Messiah&quot; along with another major work for choir and orchestra. The Augustana Choir, founded at Rock Island&#x27;s Augustana College in 1934, is one of the nation&#x27;s leading collegiate choruses. Major outdoor summer music festivals include the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, Mississippi Valley Blues Festival, and River Roots Live.

The Quad Cities&#x27; three traditional community theaters – Playcrafters Barn Theatre (founded in 1920, comedies and dramas) and Quad City Music Guild (1948, musicals) in Moline, and Genesius guild (1957, outdoor Shakespeare and Greek comedies and tragedies) in Rock Island – were joined in 1976 by Circa &#x27;21 Dinner Playhouse, a professional dinner theater in downtown Rock Island&#x27;s historic Fort Theatre.

Historic buildings and sites listed on state and the National Register of Historic Places interpret the history of people&#x27;s settlement and lives in the area.

==Media==

The Quad Cities is the 151st largest radio market in the United States. It is ranked 97th by Nielsen Media Research for the 2008–09 television season with 309,600 television households.

The area is served by over 13 commercial radio stations, 8 non-commercial radio stations, 3 low power FM radio stations, 8 TV stations and 3 daily newspapers.

In 2012, the Mississippi Valley Fair that is held in Davenport served as the film location for Rodney Atkins&#x27; music video &quot;Just Wanna Rock N&#x27; Roll&quot;.

Also in 2012, the PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary &quot;Poor Kids&quot; was filmed in and around the Quad Cities showing poverty from a child&#x27;s perspective.

==Transportation==

Four interstate highways serve the Quad Cities: Interstate 80, Interstate 280, Interstate 74 serve both states while Interstate 88 serves just Illinois. United States highways include U.S. Route 6 and U.S. Route 67 which run through both Iowa and Illinois, while U.S. Route 61 serves just Iowa and U.S. Route 150 serves just Illinois.

A total of five bridges accessible by automobiles connect Iowa with Illinois in the Quad Cities across the Mississippi River. The Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge carries Interstate 80 and connects Le Claire, Iowa, with Rapids City, Illinois. Continuing downstream, the I-74 Bridge connects Bettendorf, Iowa, with Moline, Illinois, and is the busiest bridge with an average of 70,400 cars a day. The Government Bridge connects Downtown Davenport with the Rock Island Arsenal. Three bridges connect Davenport with Rock Island, Illinois; The Rock Island Centennial Bridge, The Crescent Rail Bridge, and the furthest downstream bridge, the Sergeant John F. Baker, Jr. Bridge which carries I-280.

Several state highways also serve the area. Iowa Highway 22 is on Davenport&#x27;s southwest side and runs west through the county, while Iowa Highway 130 runs along Northwest Boulevard on Davenport&#x27;s north edge. Illinois Route 5 (John Deere Road) runs from Rock Island east till it runs into Interstate 88. Illinois Route 92 runs along the Mississippi River, while Illinois Route 84 runs along the east side of Rock Island County. Illinois Route 192 connects Highway 92 with Illinois Route 94 near Taylor Ridge. The Chicago – Kansas City Expressway also serves the area along Interstates 74, 80, and 88.

There are three transit operators in the Quad Cities with limited interconnection between them. Rock Island County Metropolitan Mass Transit District (Quad Cities MetroLINK) serves the Illinois cities of Rock Island, Moline, East Moline, Milan, Silvis, Carbon Cliff, Hampton and Colona. It has 12 routes and a fleet of about 52 buses. It operates a river craft during summer months. In Iowa, Davenport Citibus has 10 fixed routes and operates 20 buses, seven days a week and Bettendorf Transit operates three routes, Monday–Saturday, and has eight buses.

Intercity bus service to the Quad Cities is provided by Burlington Trailways and Greyhound Lines.

Amtrak currently does not serve the Quad Cities. The closest station is about away in Galesburg, Illinois. In 2008, United States Senators Tom Harkin, Chuck Grassley, Dick Durbin, and Barack Obama sent a letter to Amtrak asking them to begin plans to bring rail service to the Quad Cities. In October 2010, a $230 million federal fund was announced that will bring Amtrak service to the Quad Cities, with a new line running from Moline to Chicago. They hoped to have the line completed in 2015, and offer two round trips daily to Chicago.

In December 2011, the federal government awarded $177 million in funding for the Amtrak connection. Budgetary and logistical issues have delayed the completion of all necessary track improvements, but the project is still in development. The multi-modal Moline Q Station building was completed in early 2018, with the attached Westin Element hotel opening in February. When the full project is completed, it will establish passenger rail through the Quad Cities, for the first time since the 1970s.

The Quad Cities is served by the Quad Cities International Airport, Illinois&#x27; third-busiest airport, located in Moline. The airport is marketed as a regional alternative to the larger airports in Chicago, nearly away. The smaller Davenport Municipal Airport is the home of the Quad City Air Show.

<text>Quantum chemistry, also called molecular quantum mechanics, is a branch of physical chemistry focused on the application of quantum mechanics to chemical systems, particularly towards the quantum-mechanical calculation of electronic contributions to physical and chemical properties of molecules, materials, and solutions at the atomic level. These calculations include systematically applied approximations intended to make calculations computationally feasible while still capturing as much information about important contributions to the computed wave functions as well as to observable properties such as structures, spectra, and thermodynamic properties. Quantum chemistry is also concerned with the computation of quantum effects on molecular dynamics and chemical kinetics. 

Chemists rely heavily on spectroscopy through which information regarding the quantization of energy on a molecular scale can be obtained. Common methods are infra-red (IR) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and scanning probe microscopy. Quantum chemistry may be applied to the prediction and verification of spectroscopic data as well as other experimental data. 

Many quantum chemistry studies are focused on the electronic ground state and excited states of individual atoms and molecules as well as the study of reaction pathways and transition states that occur during chemical reactions. Spectroscopic properties may also be predicted. Typically, such studies assume the electronic wave function is adiabatically parameterized by the nuclear positions (i.e., the Born–Oppenheimer approximation). A wide variety of approaches are used, including semi-empirical methods, density functional theory, Hartree–Fock calculations, quantum Monte Carlo methods, and coupled cluster methods. 

Understanding electronic structure and molecular dynamics through the development of computational solutions to the Schrödinger equation is a central goal of quantum chemistry. Progress in the field depends on overcoming several challenges, including the need to increase the accuracy of the results for small molecular systems, and to also increase the size of large molecules that can be realistically subjected to computation, which is limited by scaling considerations — the computation time increases as a power of the number of atoms. 

==History==
Some view the birth of quantum chemistry as starting with the discovery of the Schrödinger equation and its application to the hydrogen atom. However, a 1927 article of Walter Heitler (1904–1981) and Fritz London is often recognized as the first milestone in the history of quantum chemistry. This was the first application of quantum mechanics to the diatomic hydrogen molecule, and thus to the phenomenon of the chemical bond. However, prior to this a critical conceptual framework was provided by Gilbert N. Lewis in his 1916 paper &quot;The Atom and the Molecule&quot;, wherein Lewis developed the first working model of valence electrons. Important contributions were also made by Yoshikatsu Sugiura and S.C. Wang. A series of articles by Linus Pauling, written throughout the 1930s, integrated the work of Heitler, London, Sugiura, Wang, Lewis, and John C. Slater on the concept of valence and its quantum-mechanical basis into a new theoretical framework. Many chemists were introduced to the field of quantum chemistry by Pauling&#x27;s 1939 text &quot;The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry&quot;, wherein he summarized this work (referred to widely now as valence bond theory) and explained quantum mechanics in a way which could be followed by chemists. The text soon became a standard text at many universities. In 1937, Hans Hellmann appears to have been the first to publish a book on quantum chemistry, in the Russian and German languages. 

In the years to follow, this theoretical basis slowly began to be applied to chemical structure, reactivity, and bonding. In addition to the investigators mentioned above, important progress and critical contributions were made in the early years of this field by Irving Langmuir, Robert S. Mulliken, Max Born, J. Robert Oppenheimer, Hans Hellmann, Maria Goeppert Mayer, Erich Hückel, Douglas Hartree, John Lennard-Jones, and Vladimir Fock.

== Electronic structure ==
The electronic structure of an atom or molecule is the quantum state of its electrons. The first step in solving a quantum chemical problem is usually solving the Schrödinger equation (or Dirac equation in relativistic quantum chemistry) with the electronic molecular Hamiltonian, usually making use of the Born–Oppenheimer (B–O) approximation. This is called determining the electronic structure of the molecule. An exact solution for the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation can only be obtained for the hydrogen atom (though exact solutions for the bound state energies of the hydrogen molecular ion within the B-O approximation have been identified in terms of the generalized Lambert W function). Since all other atomic and molecular systems involve the motions of three or more &quot;particles&quot;, their Schrödinger equations cannot be solved analytically and so approximate and/or computational solutions must be sought. The process of seeking computational solutions to these problems is part of the field known as computational chemistry.

=== Valence bond theory ===
As mentioned above, Heitler and London&#x27;s method was extended by Slater and Pauling to become the valence-bond (VB) 
method. In this method, attention is primarily devoted to the pairwise interactions between atoms, and this method therefore correlates closely with classical chemists&#x27; drawings of bonds. It focuses on how the atomic orbitals of an atom combine to give individual chemical bonds when a molecule is formed, incorporating the two key concepts of orbital hybridization and resonance.

=== Molecular orbital theory ===

An alternative approach to valence bond theory was developed in 1929 by Friedrich Hund and Robert S. Mulliken, in which electrons are described by mathematical functions delocalized over an entire molecule. The Hund–Mulliken approach or molecular orbital (MO) method is less intuitive to chemists, but has turned out capable of predicting spectroscopic properties better than the VB method. This approach is the conceptual basis of the Hartree–Fock method and further post-Hartree–Fock methods.

=== Density functional theory ===
The Thomas–Fermi model was developed independently by Thomas and Fermi in 1927. This was the first attempt to describe many-electron systems on the basis of electronic density instead of wave functions, although it was not very successful in the treatment of entire molecules. The method did provide the basis for what is now known as density functional theory (DFT). Modern day DFT uses the Kohn–Sham method, where the density functional is split into four terms; the Kohn–Sham kinetic energy, an external potential, exchange and correlation energies. A large part of the focus on developing DFT is on improving the exchange and correlation terms. Though this method is less developed than post Hartree–Fock methods, its significantly lower computational requirements (scaling typically no worse than &quot;n&quot;3 with respect to &quot;n&quot; basis functions, for the pure functionals) allow it to tackle larger polyatomic molecules and even macromolecules. This computational affordability and often comparable accuracy to MP2 and CCSD(T) (post-Hartree–Fock methods) has made it one of the most popular methods in computational chemistry.

== Chemical dynamics ==
A further step can consist of solving the Schrödinger equation with the total molecular Hamiltonian in order to study the motion of molecules. Direct solution of the Schrödinger equation is called &quot;quantum dynamics&quot;, whereas its solution within the semiclassical approximation is called &quot;semiclassical dynamics.&quot; Purely classical simulations of molecular motion are referred to as &quot;molecular dynamics (MD)&quot;. Another approach to dynamics is a hybrid framework known as &quot;mixed quantum-classical dynamics;&quot; yet another hybrid framework uses the Feynman path integral formulation to add quantum corrections to molecular dynamics, which is called path integral molecular dynamics. Statistical approaches, using for example classical and quantum Monte Carlo methods, are also possible and are particularly useful for describing equilibrium distributions of states.

=== Adiabatic chemical dynamics ===

In adiabatic dynamics, interatomic interactions are represented by single scalar potentials called potential energy surfaces. This is the Born–Oppenheimer approximation introduced by Born and Oppenheimer in 1927. Pioneering applications of this in chemistry were performed by Rice and Ramsperger in 1927 and Kassel in 1928, and generalized into the RRKM theory in 1952 by Marcus who took the transition state theory developed by Eyring in 1935 into account. These methods enable simple estimates of unimolecular reaction rates from a few characteristics of the potential surface.

=== Non-adiabatic chemical dynamics ===
Non-adiabatic dynamics consists of taking the interaction between several coupled potential energy surfaces (corresponding to different electronic quantum states of the molecule). The coupling terms are called vibronic couplings. The pioneering work in this field was done by Stueckelberg, Landau, and Zener in the 1930s, in their work on what is now known as the Landau–Zener transition. Their formula allows the transition probability between two adiabatic potential curves in the neighborhood of an avoided crossing to be calculated. Spin-forbidden reactions are one type of non-adiabatic reactions where at least one change in spin state occurs when progressing from reactant to product.

<doc id="25213" wikidata="Q253" url="?curid=25213" title="QWERTY">
<text>QWERTY ( ) is a keyboard layout for Latin-script alphabets. The name comes from the order of the first six keys on the top letter row of the keyboard: . The QWERTY design is based on a layout included in the Sholes and Glidden typewriter sold via E. Remington and Sons from 1874. QWERTY became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878 and remains in ubiquitous use.

==History==
The QWERTY layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Latham Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer who lived in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In October 1867, Sholes filed a patent application for his early writing machine he developed with the assistance of his friends Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soulé.

The first model constructed by Sholes used a piano-like keyboard with two rows of characters arranged alphabetically as shown below:
Sholes struggled for the next five years to perfect his invention, making many trial-and-error rearrangements of the original machine&#x27;s alphabetical key arrangement. The study of bigram (letter-pair) frequency by educator Amos Densmore, brother of the financial backer James Densmore, is believed to have influenced the array of letters, although this contribution has been called into question. Others suggest instead that the letter groupings evolved from telegraph operators&#x27; feedback.

In November 1868 he changed the arrangement of the latter half of the alphabet, N to Z, right-to-left. In April 1870 he arrived at a four-row, upper case keyboard approaching the modern QWERTY standard, moving six vowel letters, A, E, I, O, U, and Y, to the upper row as follows:
In 1873 Sholes&#x27;s backer, James Densmore, successfully sold the manufacturing rights for the Sholes &amp; Glidden Type-Writer to E. Remington and Sons. The keyboard layout was finalized within a few months by Remington&#x27;s mechanics and was ultimately presented:
After they purchased the device, Remington made several adjustments, creating a keyboard with essentially the modern QWERTY layout. These adjustments included placing the &quot;R&quot; key in the place previously allotted to the period key. Apocryphal claims that this change was made to let salesmen impress customers by pecking out the brand name &quot;TYPE WRITER QUOTE&quot; from one keyboard row is not formally substantiated. Vestiges of the original alphabetical layout remained in the &quot;home row&quot; sequence DFGHJKL.

The modern ANSI layout is:
The QWERTY layout became popular with the success of the Remington No. 2 of 1878, the first typewriter to include both upper and lower case letters, using a key.

One popular but possibly apocryphal explanation for the QWERTY arrangement is that it was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.

===Differences from modern layout===

==== Substituting characters ====

The QWERTY layout depicted in Sholes&#x27;s 1878 patent is slightly different from the modern layout, most notably in the absence of the numerals 0 and 1, with each of the remaining numerals shifted one position to the left of their modern counterparts. The letter M is located at the end of the third row to the right of the letter L rather than on the fourth row to the right of the N, the letters X and C are reversed, and most punctuation marks are in different positions or are missing entirely. 0 and 1 were omitted to simplify the design and reduce the manufacturing and maintenance costs; they were chosen specifically because they were &quot;redundant&quot; and could be recreated using other keys. Typists who learned on these machines learned the habit of using the uppercase letter I (or lowercase letter L) for the digit one, and the uppercase O for the zero.

The 0 key was added and standardized in its modern position early in the history of the typewriter, but the 1 and exclamation point were left off some typewriter keyboards into the 1970s.

==== Combined characters ====

In early designs, some characters were produced by printing two symbols with the carriage in the same position. For instance, the exclamation point, which shares a key with the numeral 1 on post-mechanical keyboards, could be reproduced by using a three-stroke combination of an apostrophe, a backspace, and a period. A semicolon (;) was produced by printing a comma (,) over a colon (:). As the backspace key is slow in simple mechanical typewriters (the carriage was heavy and optimized to move in the opposite direction), a more professional approach was to block the carriage by pressing and holding the space bar while printing all characters that needed to be in a shared position. To make this possible, the carriage was designed to advance only after releasing the space bar.

In the era of mechanical typewriters, combined characters such as &quot;é&quot; and &quot;õ&quot; were created by the use of dead keys for the diacritics (&quot;′, ~&quot;), which did not move the paper forward. Thus the &quot;′&quot; and &quot;e&quot; would be printed at the same location on the paper, creating &quot;é&quot;.

===Contemporaneous alternatives===

There were no particular technological requirements for the QWERTY layout, since at the time there were ways to make a typewriter without the &quot;up-stroke&quot; typebar mechanism that had required it to be devised. Not only were there rival machines with &quot;down-stroke&quot; and &quot;front stroke&quot; positions that gave a visible printing point, the problem of typebar clashes could be circumvented completely: examples include Thomas Edison&#x27;s 1872 electric print-wheel device which later became the basis for Teletype machines; Lucien Stephen Crandall&#x27;s typewriter (the second to come onto the American market in 1883) whose type was arranged on a cylindrical sleeve; the Hammond typewriter of 1885 which used a semi-circular &quot;type-shuttle&quot; of hardened rubber (later light metal); and the Blickensderfer typewriter of 1893 which used a type wheel. The early Blickensderfer&#x27;s &quot;Ideal&quot; keyboard was also non-QWERTY, instead having the sequence &quot;DHIATENSOR&quot; in the home row, these 10 letters being capable of composing 70% of the words in the English language.

==Properties==
Alternating hands while typing is a desirable trait in a keyboard design. While one hand types a letter, the other hand can prepare to type the next letter, making the process faster and more efficient. In the QWERTY layout many more words can be spelled using only the left hand than the right hand. Thousands of English words can be spelled using only the left hand, while only a couple of hundred words can be typed using only the right hand (the three most frequent letters in the English language, , are all typed with the left hand). In addition, more typing strokes are done with the left hand in the QWERTY layout. This is helpful for left-handed people but disadvantageous for right-handed people.

Contrary to popular belief, the QWERTY layout was not designed to slow the typist down, but rather to speed up typing. Indeed, there is evidence that, aside from the issue of jamming, placing often-used keys farther apart increases typing speed, because it encourages alternation between the hands. (On the other hand, in the German keyboard the has been moved between the and the to help type the frequent digraphs TZ and ZU in that language.) Almost every word in the English language contains at least one vowel letter, but on the QWERTY keyboard only the vowel letter is on the home row, which requires the typist&#x27;s fingers to leave the home row for most words.

A feature much less commented on than the order of the keys is that the keys do not form a rectangular grid, but rather each column slants diagonally. This is because of the mechanical linkages – each key is attached to a lever, and hence the offset prevents the levers from running into each other – and has been retained in most electronic keyboards. Some keyboards, such as the Kinesis or TypeMatrix, retain the QWERTY layout but arrange the keys in vertical columns, to reduce unnecessary lateral finger motion.

==Computer keyboards==
The first computer terminals such as the Teletype were typewriters that could produce and be controlled by various computer codes. These used the QWERTY layouts and added keys such as escape which had special meanings to computers. Later keyboards added function keys and arrow keys. Since the standardization of personal computers and Windows after the 1980s, most full-sized computer keyboards have followed this standard (see drawing at right). This layout has a separate numeric keypad for data entry at the right, 12 function keys across the top, and a cursor section to the right and center with keys for , , , , , and with cursor arrows in an inverted-T shape.

===Diacritical marks===
QWERTY was designed for English, a language with accents (&#x27;diacritics&#x27;) appearing only in a few words of foreign origin. The standard US keyboard has no provision for these at all; the need was later met by the so-called &quot;US-International&quot; keyboard mapping, which uses &quot;dead keys&quot; to type accents without having to add more physical keys. (The same principle is used in the standard US keyboard layout for macOS, but in a different way). Most European (including UK) keyboards for PCs have an key (&#x27;Alternative Graphics&#x27; key, replaces the right Alt key) that enables easy access to the most common diacritics used in the territory where sold. For example, default keyboard mapping for the UK/Ireland keyboard has the diacritics used in Irish but these are rarely printed on the keys; but to type the accents used in Welsh and Scots Gaelic requires the use of a &quot;UK Extended&quot; keyboard mapping and the dead key or compose key method. This arrangement applies to Windows, ChromeOS and Linux; macOS computers have different techniques. The US International and UK Extended mappings provide many of the diacritics needed for students of other European languages.

===Other keys and characters===
Some QWERTY keyboards have alt codes, in which holding while inputting a sequence of numbers on a numeric keypad allows the entry of special characters. For example, + results in ú (a Latin lowercase letter u with an acute accent).

==Specific language variants==

Minor changes to the arrangement are made for other languages. There are a large number of different keyboard layouts used for different languages written in Latin script. They can be divided into three main families according to where the , , , , and keys are placed on the keyboard. These are usually named after the first six letters, for example this QWERTY layout and the AZERTY layout.

In this section you will also find keyboard layouts that include some additional symbols of other languages. But they are different from layouts that were designed with the goal to be usable for multiple languages (see Multilingual variants).

The following sections give general descriptions of QWERTY keyboard variants along with details specific to certain operating systems. The emphasis is on Microsoft Windows.

===English===

====Canada====

English-speaking Canadians have traditionally used the same keyboard layout as in the United States, unless they are in a position where they have to write French on a regular basis. French-speaking Canadians respectively have favoured the Canadian French keyboard layout (see French (Canada), below).

The CSA keyboard is the official multilingual keyboard layout of Canada.
====United Kingdom====

The United Kingdom and Ireland use a keyboard layout based on the 48-key version defined in the (now withdrawn) British Standard BS 4822. It is very similar to that of the United States, but has an key and a larger key, includes and signs and some rarely used EBCDIC symbols (, ), and uses different positions for the characters , , , , , and .

The BS 4822:1994 standard did not make any use of the key and lacked support for any non-ASCII characters other than and . It also assigned a key for the non-ASCII character broken bar , but lacked one for the far more commonly used ASCII character vertical bar . It also lacked support for various diacritics used in the Welsh alphabet, and the Scots Gaelic alphabet; and also is missing the letter yogh, ȝ, used very rarely in the Scots language. Therefore, various manufacturers have modified or extended the BS 4822 standard:
* The B00 key (left of ), shifted, results in vertical bar on some systems (e.g. Windows UK/Ireland keyboard layout and Linux/X11 UK/Ireland keyboard layout), rather than the broken bar assigned by BS 4822 and provided in some systems (e.g. IBM OS/2 UK166 keyboard layout)
* The E00 key (left of ) with provides either vertical bar (OS/2&#x27;s UK166 keyboard layout, Linux/X11 UK keyboard layout) or broken bar (Microsoft Windows UK/Ireland keyboard layout)

Support for the diacritics needed for Scots Gaelic and Welsh was added to Windows and ChromeOS using a &quot;UK-extended&quot; setting (see below); Linux and X11 systems have an explicit or reassigned key for this purpose.

=====UK Apple keyboard=====

The British version of the Apple Keyboard does not use the standard UK layout. Instead, some older versions have the US layout (see below) with a few differences: the sign is reached by and the sign by , the opposite to the US layout. The is also present and is typed with . Umlauts are reached by typing and then the vowel, and ß is reached by typing .

Newer Apple &quot;British&quot; keyboards use a layout that is relatively unlike either the US or traditional UK keyboard. It uses an elongated return key, a shortened left with and in the newly created position, and in the upper left of the keyboard are and instead of the traditional EBCDIC codes. The middle-row key that fits inside the key has and .

====United States====
The arrangement of the character input keys and the keys contained in this layout is specified in the US national standard ANSI-INCITS 154-1988 (R1999) (formerly ANSI X3.154-1988 (R1999)), where this layout is called &quot;ASCII keyboard&quot;. The complete US keyboard layout, as it is usually found, also contains the usual function keys in accordance with the international standard ISO/IEC 9995-2, although this is not explicitly required by the US American national standard.

US keyboards are used not only in the United States, but also in many other English-speaking places (except UK and Ireland), including India, Australia, Anglophone Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and Indonesia that uses the same 26-letter alphabets as English. In many other English-speaking jurisdictions (e.g., Canada, Australia, the Caribbean nations, Hong Kong, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Singapore, New Zealand, and South Africa), local spelling sometimes conforms more closely to British English usage, although these nations decided to use a US English keyboard layout. Until Windows 8 and later versions, when Microsoft separated the settings, this had the undesirable side effect of also setting the language to US English, rather than the local orthography.

The US keyboard layout has a second instead of the key and does not use any dead keys; this makes it inefficient for all but a handful of languages (unless the &#x27;US-International&#x27; keyboard mapping is used, see below). On the other hand, the US keyboard layout (or the similar UK layout) is occasionally used by programmers in countries where the keys for are located in less convenient positions on the locally customary layout.

On some keyboards the is bigger than traditionally and takes up also a part of the line above, more or less the area of the traditional location of the key. In these cases the backslash is located in alternative places. It can be situated one line above the default location, on the right of the key. Sometimes it is placed one line below its traditional situation, on the right of the (in these cases the key is narrower than usual on the line of its default location). It may also be two lines below its default situation on the right of a narrower than traditionally right key.
===Arabic===
Two keyboard layouts that are based on Qwerty are used in Arabic-speaking countries. Microsoft designate them as Arabic (101) and Arabic (102).
In both the number line is identical to the American layout, beside being mirrored, and not including the key to the left of . 
The key on the right side of the keyboard is also the same. | could also be produced by shifting the key on the left side of the keyboard. are produced by shifting the same keys, but is mirrored to . In Arabic (102) it&#x27;s true also for {} which are again mirrored.
Finally, instead of being the normal output of their keys, are produced by shifting the same keys.

===Czech===

The typewriter came to the Czech-speaking area in the late 19th century, when it was part of Austria-Hungary where German was the dominant language of administration. Therefore, Czech typewriters have the QWERTZ layout.

However, with the introduction of imported computers, especially since the 1990s, the QWERTY keyboard layout is frequently used for computer keyboards. The Czech QWERTY layout differs from QWERTZ in that the characters (e.g. and others) missing from the Czech keyboard are accessible with on the same keys where they are located on an American keyboard. In Czech QWERTZ keyboards the positions of these characters accessed through differs.
===Danish===

Both the Danish and Norwegian keyboards include dedicated keys for the letters Å/å, Æ/æ and Ø/ø, but the placement is a little different, as the and keys are swapped on the Norwegian layout. (The Finnish–Swedish keyboard is also largely similar to the Norwegian layout, but the and are replaced with and . On some systems, the Danish keyboard may allow typing Ö/ö and Ä/ä by holding the or key while striking and , respectively.) Computers with Windows are commonly sold with ÖØÆ and ÄÆØ printed on the two keys, allowing same computer hardware to be sold in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, with different operating system settings.
===Dutch (Netherlands)===

Though it is seldom used (most Dutch keyboards use US International layout), the Dutch layout uses QWERTY but has additions for the sign, the diaresis (¨), and the braces ({ }) as well as different locations for other symbols. An older version contained a single-stroke key for the Dutch character IJ/ij, which is usually typed by the combination of and . In the 1990s, there was a version with the now-obsolete florin sign (Dutch: guldenteken) for IBM PCs.

In Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), &quot;AZERTY&quot; keyboards are used instead, due to influence from the French-speaking part of Belgium.

See also #US-International in the Netherlands below.
===Estonian===

The keyboard layout used in Estonia is virtually the same as the Swedish layout. The main difference is that the and keys (to the right of ) are replaced with and respectively (the latter letter being the most distinguishing feature of the Estonian alphabet). Some special symbols and dead keys are also moved around.
===Faroese===

The same as the Danish layout with added (Eth), since the Faroe Islands are a self-governed part of the Kingdom of Denmark.
===French (Canada)===

This keyboard layout is commonly used in Canada by French-speaking Canadians. It is the most common layout for laptops and stand-alone keyboards aimed at the Francophone market. Unlike the AZERTY layout used in France and Belgium, it is a QWERTY layout and as such is also relatively commonly used by English speakers in the US and Canada (accustomed to using US standard QWERTY keyboards) for easy access to the accented letters found in some French loanwords. It can be used to type all accented French characters, as well as some from other languages, and serves all English functions as well. It is popular mainly because of its close similarity to the basic US keyboard commonly used by English-speaking Canadians and Americans and historical use of US-made typewriters by French-Canadians. It can also easily &#x27;map&#x27; to or from a standard US QWERTY keyboard with the sole loss the guillemet/degree sign key. Its significant difference from the US standard is that the right key is reconfigured as an key that gives easy access to a further range of characters (marked in blue and red on the keyboard image. Blue indicates an alternative character that will display as typed. Red indicates a dead key: the diacritic will be applied to the next vowel typed.)

In some variants, the key names are translated to French:
* is or (short for &quot;Fixer&quot;/&quot;Verrouiller Majuscule&quot;, meaning &quot;Lock Uppercase&quot;).
* is .
* is .
===Greek===

* The stress accents, indicated in red, are produced by pressing that key (or shifted key) followed by an appropriate vowel.
* Use of the key may produce the characters shown in blue.
===German===

Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and Luxembourg use QWERTZ layouts, where the letter is to the right of .

===Icelandic===
The Icelandic keyboard layout is different from the standard QWERTY keyboard because the Icelandic alphabet has some special letters, most of which it shares with the other Nordic countries:
Þ/þ, Ð/ð, Æ/æ, and Ö/ö. (Æ/æ also occurs in Norwegian, Danish and Faroese, Ð/ð in Faroese, and Ö/ö in Swedish, Finnish and Estonian. In Norwegian Ö/ö could be substituted for Ø/Ø which is the same sound/letter and is widely understood).

The letters Á/á, Ý/ý, Ú/ú, Í/í, and É/é are produced by first pressing the dead key and then the corresponding letter. The Nordic letters Å/å and Ä/ä can be produced by first pressing , located below the key, and (for , two dots) which also works for the non-Nordic ÿ, Ü/ü, Ï/ï, and Ë/ë. These letters are not used natively in Icelandic, but may have been implemented for ease of communication in other Nordic languages. Additional diacritics may be found behind the key: for (freestanding grave accent, &quot;backtick&quot;) and for (freestanding circumflex).
===Irish===

Microsoft Windows includes an Irish layout which supports acute accents with for the Irish language and grave accents with the dead key for Scots Gaelic. The other Insular Celtic languages have their own layout. The default UK/Irish layout supports acute accents as standard and is thus more commonly used.
===Italian===
* Braces (right above square brackets and shown in purple) are given with both pressed.
* The tilde (~) and backquote (`) characters are not present on the Italian keyboard layout (with Linux, they are available by pressing +, and ; Windows might not recognise these keybindings).
* When using Microsoft Windows, the standard Italian keyboard layout does not allow one to write 100% correct Italian language, since it lacks capital accented vowels, and in particular the È key. The common workaround is writing E&#x27; (E followed by an apostrophe) instead, or relying on the auto-correction feature of several word processors when available. It is possible to obtain the È symbol in MS Windows by typing . Mac users, however, can write the correct accented character by pressing or, in the usual Mac way, by pressing the correct key for the accent (in this case ) and subsequently pressing the wanted letter (in this case ). Linux users can also write it by pressing the key with enabled.

There is an alternate layout, which differs only in disposition of characters accessible through , and includes the tilde and the curly brackets. It is commonly used in IBM keyboards.

Italian typewriters often have the QZERTY layout instead.

The Italian-speaking part of Switzerland uses the QWERTZ keyboard.
=== Latvian ===
Although rarely used, a keyboard layout specifically designed for the Latvian language called ŪGJRMV exists. The Latvian QWERTY keyboard layout is most commonly used; its layout is the same as Latin ones, but with a dead key, which allows entering special characters (āčēģīķļņõŗšūž). The most common dead key is the apostrophe , which is followed by (Windows default for Latvian layout). Some prefer using the tick .
===Lithuanian===
In a Lithuanian QWERTY keyboard, the keys , , , , , , and are in places of , , , , , , , and respectively in standard QWERTY. The numbers should be typed in combination with the key. Aside from these changes the keyboard is standard QWERTY. Besides QWERTY, the ĄŽERTY layout without the alteration of the number row is used.

===Maltese===
The Maltese language uses Unicode (UTF-8) to display the Maltese diacritics: ċ Ċ; ġ Ġ; ħ Ħ; ż Ż (together with à À; è È; ì Ì; ò Ò; ù Ù). There are two standard keyboard layouts for Maltese, according to &quot;MSA 100:2002 Maltese Keyboard Standard&quot;; one of 47 keys and one of 48 keys. The 48-key layout is the most popular.
===Norwegian===
The Norwegian languages use the same letters as Danish, but the Norwegian keyboard differs from the Danish layout regarding the placement of the , and (backslash) keys. On the Danish keyboard, the and are swapped. The Swedish keyboard is also similar to the Norwegian layout, but and are replaced with and . On some systems, the Norwegian keyboard may allow typing Ö/ö and Ä/ä by holding the or key while striking and , respectively.

There is also an alternative keyboard layout called &quot;Norwegian with Sámi&quot;, which allows for easier input of the characters required to write various Sámi languages. All the Sámi characters are accessed through the key.

On Macintosh computers, the &quot;Norwegian&quot; and &quot;Norwegian extended&quot; keyboard layouts have a slightly different placement for some of the symbols obtained with the help of the or keys. Notably, the &quot;$&quot; sign is accessed with and &quot;¢&quot; with . Furthermore, the frequently used &quot;@&quot; is placed between and .
===Polish===

Most typewriters use a QWERTZ keyboard with Polish letters (with diacritical marks) accessed directly (officially approved as &quot;Typist&#x27;s keyboard&quot;, , Polish Standard PN-87), which is mainly ignored in Poland as impractical (custom-made keyboards, e.g., those in the public sector as well as some Apple computers, present an exception to this paradigm); the &quot;Polish programmer&#x27;s&quot; () layout has become the &quot;de facto&quot; standard, used on virtually all computers sold on the Polish market.

Most computer keyboards in Poland are laid out according to the standard US visual and functional layout. Polish diacritics are accessed by using the &quot;AltGr&quot; key with a corresponding similar letter from the base Latin alphabet. Normal capitalization rules apply with respect to &quot;Shift&quot; and &quot;Caps Lock&quot; keys. For example, to enter &quot;Ź&quot;, one can type with &quot;Caps Lock&quot; off, or turn on &quot;Caps Lock&quot; and type .

Both ANSI and ISO mechanical layouts are common sights, and even some non-standard mechanical layouts are in use. ANSI is often preferred, as the additional key provides no additional function, at least in Microsoft Windows where it duplicates the backslash key, while taking space from the Shift key. Many keyboards do not label &quot;AltGr&quot; as such, leaving the &quot;Alt&quot; marking as in the US layout – the right key nevertheless functions as in this layout, causing possible confusion when keyboard shortcuts with the key are required (these usually work only with the left &quot;Alt&quot;) and causing the key to be commonly referred to as &quot;right Alt&quot; (). However, keyboards with &quot;AltGr&quot; marking are available and it is also officially used by Microsoft when depicting the layout.

Also, on MS Windows, the tilde character &quot;~&quot; () acts as a dead key to type Polish letters (with diacritical marks) thus, to obtain an &quot;Ł&quot;, one may press . The tilde character is obtained with .

In Linux-based systems, the euro symbol is typically mapped to instead of , the tilde acts as a normal key, and several accented letters from other European languages are accessible through combinations with left Alt. Polish letters are also accessible by using the key.

Software keyboards on touchscreen devices usually make the Polish diacritics available as one of the alternatives which show up after long-pressing the corresponding Latin letter. However, modern predictive text and autocorrection algorithms largely mitigate the need to type them directly on such devices.

===Portuguese===
====Brazil====

The Brazilian computer keyboard layout is specified in the ABNT NBR 10346 variant 2 (alphanumeric portion) and 10347 (numeric portion) standards.

Essentially, the Brazilian keyboard contains dead keys for five variants of diacritics in use in the language; the letter Ç, the only application of the cedilla in Portuguese, has its own key. In some keyboard layouts the + combination produces the ₢ character (Unicode 0x20A2), symbol for the old currency cruzeiro, a symbol that is not used in practice (the common abbreviation in the eighties and nineties used to be Cr$). The cent sign ¢, is accessible via +, but is not commonly used for the centavo, subunit of previous currencies as well as the current real, which itself is represented by R$. The Euro sign € is not standardized in this layout. The masculine and feminine ordinals ª and º are accessible via combinations. The section sign § (Unicode U+00A7), in Portuguese called &quot;parágrafo&quot;, is nowadays practically only used to denote sections of laws.

Variant 2 of the Brazilian keyboard, the only which gained general acceptance (MS Windows treats both variants as the same layout), has a unique mechanical layout, combining some features of the ISO 9995-3 and the &quot;JIS&quot; keyboards in order to fit 12 keys between the left and right Shift (compared to the American standard of 10 and the international of 11). Its modern, IBM PS/2-based variations, are thus known as 107-keys keyboards, and the original PS/2 variation was 104-key. Variant 1, never widely adopted, was based on the ISO 9995-2 keyboards. To make this layout usable with keyboards with only 11 keys in the last row, the rightmost key (/?°) has its functions replicated across the +, +, and + combinations.
====Portugal====

Essentially, the Portuguese keyboard contains dead keys for five variants of diacritics; the letter Ç, the only application of the cedilla in Portuguese, has its own key, but there are also a dedicated key for the ordinal indicators and a dedicated key for quotation marks. The + combination for producing the euro sign € (Unicode 0x20AC) has become standard. On some QWERTY keyboards the key labels are translated, but the majority are labelled in English.

During the 20th century, a different keyboard layout, HCESAR, was in widespread use in Portugal.
===Romanian (in Romania and Moldova)===
The current Romanian National Standard SR 13392:2004 establishes two layouts for Romanian keyboards: a &quot;primary&quot; one and a &quot;secondary&quot; one.

The &quot;primary&quot; layout is intended for traditional users who have learned how to type with older, Microsoft-style implementations of the Romanian keyboard. The &quot;secondary&quot; layout is mainly used by programmers as it does not contradict the physical arrangement of keys on a US-style keyboard. The &quot;secondary&quot; arrangement is used as the default Romanian layout by Linux distributions, as defined in the &quot;X Keyboard Configuration Database&quot;.

There are four Romanian-specific characters that are incorrectly implemented in versions of Microsoft Windows until Vista came out:
* Ș (U+0218, S with comma), incorrectly implemented as Ş (U+015E, S with cedilla)
* ș (U+0219, s with comma), incorrectly implemented as ş (U+015F, s with cedilla)
* Ț (U+021A, T with comma), incorrectly implemented as Ţ (U+0162, T with cedilla)
* ț (U+021B, t with comma), incorrectly implemented as ţ (U+0163, t with cedilla)

The cedilla-versions of the characters do not exist in the Romanian language (they came to be used due to a historic bug). The UCS now says that encoding this was a mistake because it messed up Romanian data and the letters with cedilla and the letters with comma are the same letter with a different style.

Since Romanian hardware keyboards are not widely available, Cristian Secară has created a driver that allows Romanian characters to be generated with a US-style keyboard in all versions of Windows prior to Vista through the use of the AltGr key modifier.

Windows Vista and newer versions include the correct diacritical signs in the default Romanian Keyboard layout.

This layout has the Z and Y keys mapped like in English layouts and also includes characters like the &#x27;at&#x27; (@) and dollar ($) signs, among others. The older cedilla-version layout is still included albeit as the &#x27;Legacy&#x27; layout.
===Slovak===

In Slovakia, similarly to the Czech Republic, both QWERTZ and QWERTY keyboard layouts are used. QWERTZ is the default keyboard layout for Slovak in Microsoft Windows.
===Spanish===

====Spain====
The Spanish keyboard layout is used to write in Spanish and in other languages of Spain such as Catalan, Basque, Galician, Aragonese, Asturian and Occitan. It includes Ñ for Spanish, Asturian and Galician, the acute accent, the diaeresis, the inverted question and exclamation marks (¿, ¡), the superscripted o and a (º, ª) for writing abbreviated ordinal numbers in masculine and feminine in Spanish and Galician, and finally, some characters required only for typing Catalan and Occitan, namely Ç, the grave accent and the interpunct (&#x27; / &#x27;, used in &quot;l·l, n·h, s·h&quot;; located at Shift-3). It can also be used to write other international characters, such as those using a circumflex accent (used in French and Portuguese among others) or a tilde (used in both Spanish and Portuguese), which are available as dead keys. However, it lacks two characters used in Asturian: Ḥ and Ḷ (historically, general support for these two has been poor – they are not present in the ISO 8859-1 character encoding standard, or any other ISO/IEC 8859 standard). Several alternative distributions, based on this one or created from scratch, have been created to address this issue (see the Other original layouts and layout design software section for more information).

On most keyboards, € is marked as Alt Gr + E and not Alt Gr + 5 as shown in the image. However, in some keyboards, € is found marked twice. An alternative version exists, supporting all of ISO 8859-1.

Spanish keyboards are usually labelled in Spanish instead of English, its abbreviations being:
On some keyboards, the c-cedilla key (Ç) is located one or two lines above, rather than on the right of, the acute accent key (´). In some cases it is placed on the right of the plus sign key (+), while in other keyboards it is situated on the right of the inverted exclamation mark key (¡).
====Latin America, officially known as Spanish Latinamerican sort====

The Latin American Spanish keyboard layout is used throughout Mexico, Central and South America. Before its design, Latin American vendors had been selling the Spanish (Spain) layout as default.

Its most obvious difference from the Spanish (Spain) layout is the lack of a Ç key; on Microsoft Windows, it lacks a tilde (~) dead key, whereas on Linux systems the dead tilde can be optionally enabled. This is not a problem when typing in Spanish, but it is rather problematic when typing in Portuguese, which can be an issue in countries with large commercial ties to Brazil (Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay).

Normally &quot;Bloq Mayús&quot; is used instead of &quot;Caps Lock&quot;, and &quot;Intro&quot; instead of &quot;Enter&quot;.
===Swedish===

The central characteristics of the Swedish keyboard are the three additional letters Å/å, Ä/ä, and Ö/ö. The same visual layout is also in use in Finland and Estonia, as the letters Ä/ä and Ö/ö are shared with the Swedish language, and even Å/å is needed by Swedish-speaking Finns. However, the Finnish multilingual keyboard adds new letters and punctuation to the functional layout.

The Norwegian keyboard largely resembles the Swedish layout, but the and are replaced with and . The Danish keyboard is also similar, but it has the and swapped. On some systems, the Swedish or Finnish keyboard may allow typing Ø/ø and Æ/æ by holding the or key while striking and , respectively.

The &quot;Swedish with Sámi&quot; keyboard allows typing not only Ø/ø and Æ/æ, but even the letters required to write various Sámi languages. This keyboard has the same function for all the keys engraved on the regular Swedish keyboard, and the additional letters are available through the key.

On Macintosh computers, the &quot;Swedish&quot; and &quot;Swedish Pro&quot; keyboards differ somewhat from the image shown above, especially as regards the characters available using the or keys. (on the upper row) produces the sign, and produces the sign. The digit keys produce with and with .

On Linux systems, the Swedish keyboard may also give access to additional characters as follows:
* first row: and 
* second row: and 
* third row: and 
* fourth row: and 
Several of these characters function as dead keys.
===Turkish===

Today the majority of Turkish keyboards are based on QWERTY (the so-called Q-keyboard layout), although there is also the older F-keyboard layout specifically designed for the language.
===Vietnamese===
The Vietnamese keyboard layout is an extended Latin QWERTY layout. The letters Ă, Â, Ê, and Ô are found on what would be the number keys – on the US English keyboard, with – producing the tonal marks (grave accent, hook, tilde, acute accent and dot below, in that order), producing Đ, producing the đồng sign (₫) when not shifted, and brackets () producing Ư and Ơ.
==Multilingual variants==

Multilingual keyboard layouts, unlike the default layouts supplied for one language and market, try to make it possible for the user to type in any of several languages using the same number of keys. Mostly this is done by adding a further virtual layer in addition to the -key by means of (or &#x27;right &#x27; reused as such), which contains a further repertoire of symbols and diacritics used by the desired languages.

This section also tries to arrange the layouts in ascending order by the number of possible languages and not chronologically according to the Latin alphabet as usual.

===United Kingdom (Extended) Layout ===


====Windows====
From Windows XP SP2 onwards, Microsoft has included a variant of the British QWERTY keyboard (the &quot;United Kingdom Extended&quot; keyboard layout) that can additionally generate several diacritical marks. This supports input on a standard physical UK keyboard for many languages without changing positions of frequently used keys, which is useful when working with text in Welsh, Scots Gaelic and Irish — languages native to parts of the UK (Wales, parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively).

In this layout, the grave accent key () becomes, as it also does in the US International layout, a dead key modifying the character generated by the next key pressed. The apostrophe, double-quote, tilde and circumflex (caret) keys are not changed, becoming dead keys only when &#x27;shifted&#x27; with . Additional precomposed characters are also obtained by shifting the &#x27;normal&#x27; key using the key. The extended keyboard is software installed from the Windows control panel, and the extended characters are not normally engraved on keyboards.

The UK Extended keyboard uses mostly the AltGr key to add diacritics to the letters a, e, i, n, o, u, w and y (the last two being used in Welsh) as appropriate for each character, as well as to their capitals. Pressing the key and then a character that does not take the specific diacritic produces the behaviour of a standard keyboard. The key presses followed by spacebar generate a stand-alone mark.:
* grave accents (e.g. à, è, etc.) needed for Scots Gaelic are generated by pressing the grave accent (or &#x27;backtick&#x27;) key , which is a dead key, then the letter. Thus produces à.
* acute accents (e.g. á) needed for Irish are generated by pressing the key together with the letter. Thus produces á; produces Á.
* the circumflex diacritic needed for Welsh may be added by , acting as a dead key combination, followed by the letter. Thus then produces â, then produces the letter ŵ.

Some other languages commonly studied in the UK and Ireland are also supported to some extent:
* diaeresis or umlaut (e.g. ä, ë, ö, etc.) is generated by a dead key combination , then the letter. Thus produces ä.
* tilde (e.g. ã, ñ, õ, etc., as used in Spanish and Portuguese) is generated by dead key combination , then the letter. Thus produces ã.
* cedilla (e.g. ç) under c is generated by , and the capital letter (Ç) is produced by 

The and letter method used for acutes and cedillas does not work for applications which assign shortcut menu functions to these key combinations.

These combinations are intended to be mnemonic and designed to be easy to remember: the circumflex accent (e.g. â) is similar to the free-standing circumflex (caret) (codice_1), printed above the key; the diaeresis/umlaut (e.g. ö) is visually similar to the double-quote (codice_2) above on the UK keyboard; the tilde (codice_3) is printed on the same key as the .

The UK Extended layout is almost entirely transparent to users familiar with the UK layout. A machine with the extended layout behaves exactly as with the standard UK, except for the rarely used grave accent key. This makes this layout suitable for a machine for shared or public use by a user population in which some use the extended functions.

Despite being created for multilingual users, UK-Extended in Windows does have some gaps — there are many languages that it cannot cope with, including Romanian and Turkish, and all languages with different character sets, such as Greek and Russian. It also does not cater for thorn (þ, Þ) in Old English, the ß in German, the œ in French, nor for the å, æ, ø, ð, þ in Nordic languages.

====ChromeOS====
The UK Extended layout (a ChromeOS extension) provides all the same combinations as with Windows, but adds many more symbols and dead keys via AltGr.
|-
|◉||A a ||S s ||D d ||F f ||G g ||H h ||J j ||K k ||L l ||: ; ||@ &#x27; ||~ # 
|shift||| \ ||Z z ||X x ||C c ||V v ||B b ||N n ||M m ||&lt; , ||&gt; . ||? / ||shift
Notes: Dotted circle (◌) is used here to indicate a dead key. The (&quot;backtick&quot;, grave accent) key is the only one that acts as a free-standing dead key and thus does not respond as shown on the key-cap. All others are invoked by AltGr. 
 (°) is a degree sign; (º) is a masculine ordinal indicator
* Dead keys
** produces grave accents (e.g., ) ( produces a standalone backtick).
** (release) produces double dot diacritics (diaeresis or umlaut: e.g., )
** (release) produces circumflex accents (e.g., )
** (release) produces (mainly) comma diacritic or cedilla below the letter (e.g., ) [In addition, produces ]
** (release) produces a hook (diacritic) on vowels (e.g., )
** AltGr+[ same as AltGr+2
** AltGr+] same as AltGr+#
** (release) produces overrings (e.g., )
** (release) produces macrons (e.g., )
** (release) produces mainly hook above (e.g., )
** (release) produces a horn (diacritic) (e.g., )
** (release) produces acute accents (e.g., ) 
** (release) produces double acute accents on some letters (e.g., ) that exist in Unicode as pre-composed characters
** (release) produces acute accents (e.g., )
** (release) produces caron (haček) diacritics (e.g., )
** (release) produces tilde diacritics (e.g., )
** (release) produces inverted breve diacritics (e.g., )
** (release) produces mainly underdots (e.g., )
** (release) produces mainly overdots (e.g., )

Finally, any arbitrary Unicode glyph can be produced given its hexadecimal code point: , release, then the hex value, then or . For example (release) produces the Ethiopic syllable SEE, ሴ.

===US-International ===
Windows provides an alternative layout for a US keyboard to type diacritics, called the US-International layout. Linux and ChromeOS (which calls it the International/Extended keyboard) also provide this layout with slight modifications such as many more combinations.

The layout is installed from the settings panel. The additional functions (shown in blue) may or may not be engraved on the keyboard, but are always functional. It can be used to type most major languages from Western Europe: Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese, Finnish, German, Icelandic, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scots Gaelic, Spanish, and Swedish. It is not sufficient for French because it lacks the grapheme “œ/Œ” (as does every keyboard layout provided by Windows except the Canadian multilingual standard keyboard). Some less common western and central European languages (such as Welsh, Maltese, Czech and Hungarian), are not fully supported. If the keyboard does not have an key, the right-hand is used. If that key does not exist (which is true of many laptops) the combination works as well.

This layout uses keys , , , and as dead keys to generate characters with diacritics by pressing the appropriate key, then the letter on the keyboard. Only certain letters such as vowels and &quot;n&quot;, work, otherwise the symbol is produced followed by the typed letter. To get only the symbol &#x27;, `, &quot;, ^ and ~, press the after the key.

* + vowel → vowel with acute accent, e.g., → é
* + vowel → vowel with grave accent, e.g., → è
* + vowel → vowel with diaeresis (or umlaut), e.g., → ë
* + vowel → vowel with circumflex accent, e.g., → ê
* + , or → letter with tilde, e.g. → ñ, → õ
* + → ç (Windows) or ć (X11)

The layout is not entirely transparent to users familiar with the conventional US layout as the dead keys act different (they don&#x27;t appear immediately and produce accented letters depending on what letter is typed next). This could be disconcerting on a machine for shared or public use. There are alternatives, such as requiring to be held down to get the dead-key function.

====US-International in the Netherlands====

The Dutch layout is historical, and keyboards with this layout are rarely used. Instead, the standard keyboard layout in the Netherlands is US-International, as the Dutch language heavily relies on diacritics and the US-International keyboard provides easy access to diacritics using dead keys. While many US keyboards do not have or extra US-International characters engraved on them, Dutch keyboards typically have the engraved at the location of the right key, and have the euro sign engraved next to the key.
=== Apple International English Keyboard ===

There are three kinds of Apple Keyboards for English: the United States, the United Kingdom and International English. The International English version features the same changes as the United Kingdom version, only without substituting for the symbol on , and as well lacking visual indication for the symbol on (although this shortcut is present with all Apple QWERTY layouts).

Differences from the US layout are:

# The key is located on the left of the key, and the key is located on the right of the key.
# The key is added on the left of the key.
# The left key is shortened and the key has the shape of inverted L.
===Canadian Multilingual Standard===

The Canadian Multilingual Standard keyboard layout is used by some Canadians. Though the caret (^) is missing, it is easily inserted by typing the circumflex accent followed by a space.
===Finnish multilingual===

The visual layout used in Finland is basically the same as the Swedish layout. This is practical, as Finnish and Swedish share the special characters Ä/ä and Ö/ö, and while the Swedish Å/å is unnecessary for writing Finnish, it is needed by Swedish-speaking Finns and to write Swedish family names which are common.

As of 2008, there is a new standard for the Finnish multilingual keyboard layout, developed as part of a localization project by CSC. All the engravings of the traditional Finnish–Swedish visual layout have been retained, so there is no need to change the hardware, but the functionality has been extended considerably, as additional characters (e.g., Æ/æ, Ə/ə, Ʒ/ʒ) are available through the key, as well as dead keys, which allow typing a wide variety of letters with diacritics (e.g., Ç/ç, Ǥ/ǥ, Ǯ/ǯ).

Based on the Latin letter repertory included in the Multilingual European Subset No. 2 (MES-2) of the Unicode standard, the layout has three main objectives. First, it provides for easy entering of text in both Finnish and Swedish, the two official languages of Finland, using the familiar keyboard layout but adding some advanced punctuation options, such as dashes, typographical quotation marks, and the non-breaking space (NBSP).

Second, it is designed to offer an indirect but intuitive way to enter the special letters and diacritics needed by the other three Nordic national languages (Danish, Norwegian and Icelandic) as well as the regional and minority languages (Northern Sámi, Southern Sámi, Lule Sámi, Inari Sámi, Skolt Sámi, Romani language as spoken in Finland, Faroese, Kalaallisut also known as Greenlandic, and German).

As a third objective, it allows for relatively easy entering of particularly names (of persons, places or products) in a variety of European languages using a more or less extended Latin alphabet, such as the official languages of the European Union (excluding Bulgarian and Greek). Some letters, like Ł/ł needed for Slavic languages, are accessed by a special &quot;overstrike&quot; key combination acting like a dead key.
Initially the Romanian letters Ș/ș and Ț/ț (S/s and T/t with comma below) were not supported (the presumption was that Ş/ş and Ţ/ţ (with cedilla) would suffice as surrogates), however the layout was updated in 2019 to include the letters with the commas as well.
===EurKEY===
EurKEY, a multilingual keyboard layout intended for Europeans, programmers and translators which uses the US-standard QWERTY layout as base and adds a third and fourth layer available through the key and +. These additional layers provide support for many Western European languages, special characters, the Greek alphabet (via dead keys), and many common mathematical symbols.

Unlike most of the other QWERTY layouts, which are formal standards for a country or region, EurKEY is not an EU, EFTA or any national standard.

To address the ergonomics issue of QWERTY, EurKEY Colemak-DH was also developed a Colmak-DH version with the EurKEY design principles.
==Alternatives==

Several alternatives to QWERTY have been developed over the years, claimed by their designers and users to be more efficient, intuitive, and ergonomic. Nevertheless, none have seen widespread adoption, partly due to the sheer dominance of available keyboards and training. Although some studies have suggested that some of these may allow for faster typing speeds, many other studies have failed to do so, and many of the studies claiming improved typing speeds were severely methodologically flawed or deliberately biased, such as the studies administered by August Dvorak himself before and after World War II. Economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis have noted that rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether they actually offer any real benefits, and some studies on keyboard layout have suggested that, for a skilled typist, layout is largely irrelevanteven randomized and alphabetical keyboards allow for similar typing speeds to QWERTY and Dvorak keyboardsand that switching costs always outweigh the benefits of further training with a keyboard layout a person has already learned.

The most widely used such alternative is the Dvorak keyboard layout; another alternative is Colemak, which is based partly on QWERTY and is claimed to be easier for an existing QWERTY typist to learn while offering several supposed optimisations. Most modern computer operating systems support these and other alternative mappings with appropriate special mode settings, with some modern operating systems allowing the user to map their keyboard in any way they like, but few keyboards are made with keys labeled according to any other standard.

== Comparison to other keyboard input systems ==

Comparisons have been made between Dvorak, Colemak, QWERTY, and other keyboard input systems, namely stenotype or its electronic implementations. However, stenotype is a fundamentally different system, which relies on phonetics and simultaneous key presses or chords. Although Shorthand (or &#x27;stenography&#x27;) has long been known as a faster and more accurate typing system, adoption has been limited, possibly due to the historically high cost of equipment, steeper initial learning curve, and low awareness of the benefits within primary education and in the general public.

The first typed shorthand machines appeared around 1830, with English versions gaining popularity in the early 1900s. Modern electronic stenotype machines or programs produce output in written language, which provides an experience similar to other keyboard setups that immediately produce legible work.

==Half QWERTY==

A half QWERTY keyboard is a combination of an alpha-numeric keypad and a QWERTY keypad, designed for mobile phones. In a half QWERTY keyboard, two characters share the same key, which reduces the number of keys and increases the surface area of each key, useful for mobile phones that have little space for keys. It means that &#x27;Q&#x27; and &#x27;W&#x27; share the same key and the user must press the key once to type &#x27;Q&#x27; and twice to type &#x27;W&#x27;.

<text>Quake III Arena is a 1999 multiplayer-focused first-person shooter developed by id Software. The third installment of the &quot;Quake&quot; series, &quot;Arena&quot; differs from previous games by excluding a story-based single-player mode and focusing primarily on multiplayer gameplay. The single-player mode is played against computer-controlled bots. It features music composed by Sonic Mayhem and Front Line Assembly founder Bill Leeb.

Notable features of &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; include a minimalist design, very extensively customizable settings such as field of view, texture detail and enemy model; and advanced movement features such as strafe-jumping and rocket-jumping.

The game was praised by reviewers who, for the most part, described the gameplay as fun and engaging. Many liked the crisp graphics and focus on multiplayer. &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, often being considered one of the greatest video games ever made, has also been used extensively in professional electronic sports tournaments such as QuakeCon, Cyberathlete Professional League, DreamHack, and the Electronic Sports World Cup.

==Gameplay==
Unlike its predecessors, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; does not have a single-player campaign. Instead, it simulates the multiplayer experience with computer-controlled players. The game&#x27;s story is brief: &quot;the greatest warriors of all time fight for the amusement of a race called the Vadrigar in the Arena Eternal.&quot; The introduction video shows the abduction of such a warrior, Sarge, while making a last stand. Continuity with prior games in the &quot;Quake&quot; series and even &quot;Doom&quot; is maintained by the inclusion of player models and biographical information. A familiar mixture of gothic and technological map architecture as well as specific equipment is included, such as the Quad Damage power-up, the rocket launcher, and the BFG.

In &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, the player progresses through tiers of maps, combating different bot characters that increase in difficulty, from Crash (at Tier 0) to Xaero (at Tier 7). As the game progresses, the fights take place in more complex arenas and against tougher opponents. While deathmatch maps are designed for up to 16 players, tournament maps are designed for duels between 2 players and in the single-player game could be considered &#x27;boss battles&#x27;.

The weapons are balanced by role, with each weapon having advantages in certain situations, such as the railgun at long-range and the lightning gun at close quarters. The BFG super-weapon is an exception to this; compared to other similarly named weapons in the &quot;Doom&quot;/&quot;Quake&quot; series, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;&#x27;s incarnation of this weapon is basically a fast-firing rocket launcher and it is found in hard-to-reach locations. Weapons appear as level items, spawning at regular intervals in set locations on the map. If a player dies, all of their weapons are lost and they receive the spawn weapons for the current map, usually the gauntlet and machine gun. Players also drop the weapon they were using when killed, which other players can then pick up.

&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; comes with several gameplay modes: Free for All (FFA), a classic deathmatch, where each player competes against the rest for the highest score, Team Deathmatch (TDM), where usually two teams of four compete for the highest team frag (kill) total, Tournament (1v1), a deathmatch between two players, usually ending after a set time and Capture the Flag, which is played on symmetrical maps where teams have to recover the enemy flag from the opponents&#x27; base while retaining their own.

&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; was specifically designed for multiplayer. The game allows players whose computers are connected by a network or to the internet to play against each other in real time, and incorporates a handicap system. It employs a client–server model, requiring all players&#x27; clients to connect to a server. &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;&#x27;s focus on multiplayer gameplay spawned a lively community, similar to QuakeWorld, that is still active as of 2021.

==Characters==
&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; features several characters from previous entries in the &quot;Quake&quot; series including &quot;Bitterman&quot; from &quot;Quake II&quot;, the &quot;Ranger&quot; character from &quot;Quake&quot; as well as Doomguy from id Software&#x27;s sister franchise &quot;Doom&quot;.

==Development==
During early March 1999, ATI leaked the internal hardware vendor (IHV) copy of the game, which unveiled to the public in Macworld Conference &amp; Expo at Moscone Center in January and Makuhari Messe in February by Steve Jobs (CEO of Apple Inc. at the time when it unveiled). This was a functional version of the engine with a textured level and working guns. The IHV contained most of the weapons (excepting the Gauntlet) that would make it into the final game although most were not fully modeled; a chainsaw and grappling hook were also in the IHV but did not make it into the final release. Many of the sounds that would make it into the final release were also included. The game was developed by nine people in 18 months.

After the IHV leak, id Software released a beta of the game called &quot;Quake III Arena Test&quot; on April 24, 1999, initially only for Mac OS before expanding to Windows at a later date. The Q3Test started with version 1.05 and included three levels that would be included in the final release: dm7, dm17, and q3tourney2. Id Software continued to update Q3Test up until version 1.09.

id co-founder and former technical director John Carmack has stated that &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; is his favorite game he has worked on.

&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; was shipped to retailers on December 2, 1999; the official street date for the game was December 5, although id Software chief executive officer Todd Hollenshead expected the game to be available as early as December 3 from retailers like Babbage&#x27;s and EB Games. The game supported the A3D 2.0 HRTF technology by Aureal Semiconductor out of the box.

===Game engine===
The &quot;id Tech 3&quot; engine is the name given to the engine that was developed for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. Unlike most other games released at the time, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; requires an OpenGL-compliant graphics accelerator to run. The game does not include a software or Direct3D renderer.

The graphic technology of the game is based tightly around a &quot;shader&quot; system where the appearance of many surfaces can be defined in text files referred to as &quot;shader scripts&quot;. &quot;Quake 3&quot; also introduced spline-based curved surfaces in addition to planar volumes, which are responsible for many of the surfaces present within the game. &quot;Quake 3&quot; also provided support for models animated using vertex animation with attachment tags (known as the .md3 format), allowing models to maintain separate torso and leg animations and hold weapons. &quot;Quake 3&quot; is one of the first games where the third-person model is able to look up and down and around as the head, torso and legs are separate. Other visual features include volumetric fog, mirrors, portals, decals, and wave-form vertex distortion.

For networking, id Tech 3 uses a &quot;snapshot&quot; system to relay information about game &quot;frames&quot; to the client over UDP. The server attempts to omit as much information as possible about each frame, relaying only differences from the last frame the client confirmed as received (Delta encoding). &quot;id Tech 3&quot; uses a virtual machine to control object behavior on the server, effects and prediction on the client and the user interface. This presents many advantages as mod authors do not need to worry about crashing the entire game with bad code, clients could show more advanced effects and game menus than was possible in &quot;Quake II&quot; and the user interface for mods was entirely customizable. Unless operations which require a specific endianness are used, a QVM file will run the same on any platform supported by &quot;Quake III Arena.&quot; The engine also contains bytecode compilers for the x86 and PowerPC architectures, executing QVM instructions via an interpreter.

&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; features an advanced AI with five difficulty levels which can accommodate both a beginner and an advanced player, though they usually do not pose a challenge to high-tier or competitive players. Each bot has its own, often humorous, &#x27;personality&#x27;, expressed as scripted lines that are triggered to simulate real player chat. If the player types certain phrases, the bots may respond: for example, typing &quot;You bore me&quot; might cause a bot to reply &quot;You should have been here 3 hours ago!&quot;. Each bot has a number of alternative lines to reduce the repetition of bot chatter. The Gladiator bots from &quot;Quake II&quot; were ported to &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and incorporated into the game by their creator - Jan Paul van Waveren, aka Mr. Elusive. Bot chat lines were written by R. A. Salvatore, Seven Swords and Steve Winter. Xaero, the hardest opponent in the game, was based on the Gladiator bot Zero. The bot Hunter appears on magazine covers in the later id game &quot;Doom 3&quot;.

On August 19, 2005, id Software released the complete source code for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; under the GNU General Public License v2.0 or later, as they have for most of their prior engines. As before, the &quot;engine&quot;, but not the content such as textures and models, was released, so that anyone who wishes to build the game from source will still need an original copy of the game to play it as intended.

===Fast inverse square root===

Fast inverse square root, sometimes referred to as Fast InvSqrt() or by the hexadecimal constant 0x5F3759DF, is an algorithm that estimates formula_1, the reciprocal (or multiplicative inverse) of the square root of a 32-bit floating-point number formula_2 in IEEE 754 floating-point format. The algorithm is best known for its implementation in the source code of &quot;Quake III Arena.&quot;

At the time, it was generally computationally expensive to compute the reciprocal of a floating-point number, especially on a large scale. However, the fast inverse square root bypassed this step.

Around 2002, initial speculation pointed to John Carmack as the probable author of the code, but he demurred and suggested it was written by Terje Mathisen, an accomplished assembly programmer who had previously helped id Software with &quot;Quake&quot; optimization. Mathisen had written an implementation of a similar bit of code in the late 1990s, but the original authors proved to be much further back in the history of 3D computer graphics with Gary Tarolli&#x27;s implementation for the SGI Indigo as a possible earliest known use.

===Source ports===
&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; has been unofficially ported to several consoles, including the PlayStation Portable handheld and Xbox console. These versions require a modified console or handheld and the assets to the original game to go along with the source port.

Carmack has said that Quake Trilogy (including Arena) will be ported on the iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad. An unofficial version for iOS was released through Cydia for jailbroken iOS devices in April 2008; it is a demo version similar to the original except that it integrates the iPhone and iPod Touch&#x27;s accelerometer and touch controls to make gameplay possible. A high-definition version for iPad was released in November 2010, featuring re-created controls, sharper graphics, better gameplay, and better framerate; this improved version was also integrated into the iPhone and iPod touch version of the port.

A Moorestown prototype version was demonstrated on a reference design that demonstrated performance of up to 90 frames per second. An unofficial port of Quake III for Symbian mobile devices was made. It requires PAK files from original game to run. An unofficial port of the game to Android was created based on the released source code. This means the game can be run on several Android powered devices, most notably the Motorola Milestone, Motorola Droid, and the Nexus One, as well as other high-end devices.

In August 2011, the ARM-based Raspberry Pi credit card-sized computer was shown running a specially-compiled ARM version of &quot;Quake III&quot; on Debian.

In February 2019, an unofficial port of &quot;Quake III&quot; called ioQuake3DS was released for the Nintendo 3DS by masterfeizz. The console must be homebrewed in order to be run.

In May 2022, an unofficial VR port was released for Meta Quest and Pico virtual reality headsets by a group of modders around Team Beef. To run the port, players must use sideloading. The port is based on the IoQuake3 source port.

==Release==
As a result of the disappointing sales of &quot;Blue Stinger&quot;, Activision was discouraged from publishing further titles for the Dreamcast and relinquished the distribution of the Dreamcast version of &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; (ported by Raster Productions) to Sega. First announced on January 29, 2000. and released on October 23, 2000, the Dreamcast version of &quot;Quake III&quot; featured 4 player cross-platform play between Dreamcast and PC players. It is often considered one of the best PC-to-console ports of its time thanks to its smooth frame rate and online play. There are still communities that play this version online on the remaining dedicated servers running patch version 1.16n and the required map pack. The Dreamcast version of &quot;Quake III&quot; also included VMU Maze mini-games.

&quot;Quake III Revolution&quot; (ported by Bullfrog Productions, published by Electronic Arts in North America and Electronic Arts Square in Japan) was released for the PlayStation 2 in March 2001, featuring several elements adopted from &quot;Team Arena&quot;, along with a more mission-based single-player mode. It features split-screen multiplayer for up to 4 players with the PS2 Multitap. As the game was an early PS2 title, it lacked online play - Sony would not launch their network functionality in North America until August 2002. GameRankings rated the release at 83%. &quot;Quake III Revolution&quot; was widely criticized for having long loading times compared to the Dreamcast and PC versions, poor game balance, and for not including USB mouse and keyboard support out of the box (unlike the PlayStation 2&#x27;s version of Unreal Tournament).

&quot;Quake Arena Arcade&quot; for the Xbox 360 was officially announced by id at QuakeCon 2007. The title, jointly developed by id and Pi Studios, was released on Xbox Live Arcade on December 15, 2010. The retail price of the game was set at 1200 Microsoft Points, or $15 USD. &quot;Quake Arena DS&quot; for the Nintendo DS was announced at QuakeCon on August 4, 2007. John Carmack stated touch screen controls would not be implemented, as he preferred the game be played with the D-pad instead. This version was silently cancelled. &quot;Quake Zero&quot; was announced at QuakeCon on August 3, 2007, and was an updated version of &quot;Quake 3 Arena&quot;, distributed by free download, run in a browser window and supported by built-in advertising content. &quot;Quake Zero&quot; was launched as &quot;Quake Live&quot;, released in 2010.

On November 15, 2021, Microsoft made the x86-64-based Xbox One/Series X/S consoles backward compatible with &quot;Quake Arena Arcade&quot;, one of 76 titles published in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the original Xbox console&#x27;s launch.

==Additional content==
===Official expansion===
An expansion pack titled &quot;Quake III: Team Arena&quot; was released on December 15, 2000, in North America, January 15, 2001, in Japan and January 26, in Europe. It was developed by id Software and published by Activision. The expansion focused on team-based gameplay through new game modes, as well as the addition of three new weapons (the Chaingun, Nailgun, and Prox Launcher), and new items and player models. &quot;Quake III: Team Arena&quot; was criticized, as its additions were long overdue and had already been implemented by fan modifications. &quot;Quake III: Gold&quot; was later released on September 26, 2001, in North America, March 29, 2002, in Japan and August 9 in Europe. &quot;Quake III: Gold&quot; including the full version of &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and the &quot;Quake III: Team Arena&quot; expansion pack bundled together in a Hybrid Disc CD-ROM. Canadian electro-industrial band Front Line Assembly made the soundtrack for the expansion, the counterpart to Sonic Mayhem&#x27;s &quot;Quake III Arena: Noize&quot;.

===Mods===
Like its predecessors, &quot;Quake&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot;, &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; can be heavily modified, allowing the engine to be used for many different games. Mods range from small gameplay adjustments like &quot;Rocket Arena 3&quot; and &quot;Orange Smoothie Productions&quot; to total conversions such as &quot;Smokin&#x27; Guns&quot;, &quot;DeFRaG&quot;, and &quot;Loki&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. The source code&#x27;s release has allowed total conversion mods such as &quot;Tremulous&quot;, &quot;World of Padman&quot;, &quot;OpenArena&quot;, and &quot;Urban Terror&quot; to evolve into free standalone games. Other mods like &quot;Weapons Factory Arena&quot; have moved to more modern commercial engines. &quot;Challenge ProMode Arena&quot; became the primary competitive mod for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; since the Cyberathlete Professional League announced CPMA as its basis for competition. CPMA includes alternative gameplays, including air-control, rebalanced weapons, instant weapon switching, and additional jumping techniques. Another mod that underwent several open beta versions and was very popular in 1999–2001 was &quot;Quake 3 Fortress&quot; (Q3F). The initial version of this game was an indirect port of the &quot;Quakeworld&quot; &quot;Team Fortress&quot; mod with many clans and leagues competing in both games simultaneously. Q3F was eventually ported to another Quake 3 mod &quot;Enemy Territory Fortress&quot; which had limited success. The developers of Q3F eventually abandoned the mod but used it to create the standalone 2003 game &quot;&quot;, which uses the &quot;Quake III&quot; engine and is still popular with approximately 9,400 active players in 2018.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0–100 range, calculated an average score of 93 out of 100 (&quot;Universal acclaim/Must-Play&quot;) for the Dreamcast version, 84 out of 100 (&quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;) for the PlayStation 2 version&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot; edition. while the Xbox Live Arcade version&#x27;s &quot;Arena Arcade&quot; edition received a lowest score with the average score of 69 out of 100 (&quot;Mixed or Average&quot;).

Reviews for the game were very positive, with many describing the game as fast and addictive. Curved surfaces were a welcome addition to the series. Most reviewers felt the game was best when played with others online. A &quot;Diehard GameFan&quot; review by Robert Howarth described the game as the best &quot;pure deathmatch&quot; experience around, but criticised the game&#x27;s frame rate, which didn&#x27;t run very well on low-end systems and required either a RIVA TNT2 or GeForce 256 GPU to run the game at an acceptable frame rate. &quot;GameSpot&quot; reviewer Jeff Gerstmann described the game as outstanding. He noted the fun level designs, great-looking textures, impressive special effects and weapons sounds. Gerstmann however criticised the narrator&#x27;s voice and thought that some levels could become too crowded when playing multiplayer. An &quot;IGN&quot; review felt the game lacked originality but enjoyed the detailed wall textures and outer space jump levels. The high number of character skins and the artificial intelligence of opponent bots were praised but the weapons were said to be &quot;bland and predictable&quot;. A &quot;Eurogamer&quot; review described the game as &quot;polished&quot; and &quot;stunning&quot; and thought that it &quot;was extremely well balanced and plays very well&quot;. The reviewer was especially pleased with the customisable 3D engine and looked forward to new maps and mods.

Blake Fischer reviewed the PC version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it five stars out of five, describing it as &quot;the best deathmatch yet. Period. End of story. If you want single-player or a storyline, buy &quot;Half-Life&quot;. If you want great DM and near-infinite expandability, &quot;Quake III&quot; is the best in the business&quot;.

Frank O&#x27;Connor reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that it was &quot;a brilliant, if flawed, conversion of arguably the best online game ever made – it&#x27;s sure a hell of a lot more interesting use of the Dreamcast modem than &quot;Chu Chu Rocket&quot;&quot;. The Dreamcast version won GameSpot&#x27;s annual &quot;Best Multiplayer Game&quot; award among console games, and was a runner-up in the &quot;Best Shooting Game&quot; category, which went to &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;.

Garrett Kenyon reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;all in all, this is a fast and beautiful game – easily the best shooter available for PS2&quot;. Japanese gaming magazine &quot;Shūkan Famicom Tsūshin&quot; scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 25 out of 40 (63 out of 100 for online version), while a User Reviewer average scored at the MK2network website are scored 62 out of 100. The PlayStation 2 version was a nominee for &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2001 Blister Awards for &quot;Best Console Shooter Game&quot;, but lost to &quot;&quot; for Xbox.

&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; won &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 1999 &quot;Special Achievement in Graphics&quot; award, and wrote that it &quot;set a new high-water mark in 3D graphics this year&quot;. During the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the game was nominated for &quot;Computer Action Game of the Year&quot;, which was ultimately awarded to &quot;Half-Life: Opposing Force&quot;.

In January 2016, Red Bull labeled Q3DM17 (The Longest Yard) one of the 10 greatest FPS multiplayer levels of all time.

===Sales===
&quot;Quake III&quot;″s sales surpassed 50,000 copies during its first three days of release, by which time 1 million copies had been printed. It debuted at #5 on PC Data&#x27;s weekly computer game sales chart for the December 5–11 period. The game rose to fourth place in the weekly top 10 the following week. Domestically, it sold 222,840 copies and earned revenues of $10.1 million (~$ in ) by early 2000.

In North America, &quot;Quake III&quot; sold 168,309 copies and earned $7.65 million (~$ in ) from January through October 2000, according to PC Data. Its overall sales in the region, including its launch in 1999, totaled 319,970 units by November 2000. Its sales for 2000 alone ultimately reached 190,950 units and $8.4 million (~$ in ) by the end of the year. The game later received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

===Competitive play===
&quot;Quake III Arena&quot;&#x27;s multiplayer-focused development led to it developing a large community of competitive players and like its predecessors it was used extensively in professional electronic sports tournaments. In competitive &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; there are two distinct gameplays, often referred to as &#x27;rulesets&#x27;, the out-of-the-box &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; game, also known as vanilla &quot;Quake 3&quot; (VQ3), and the CPM ruleset of the &quot;Challenge Pro Mode Arena&quot; mod. On July 26, 2006, &quot;Challenge Pro Mode Arena&quot; with VQ3 gameplay was chosen by Cyberathlete Professional League as the mod of choice for their tournament, making it the standard competitive mod for &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;. Previously, &quot;Orange Smoothie Productions&quot; was the most widely used tournament mod.

The following competitions have held &quot;Quake III&quot; events:

*Cyberathlete Amateur League
*Cyberathlete Professional League
*Electronic Sports World Cup
*QuakeCon
*World Cyber Games
*Dreamhack

These competitions have now moved on to more recent games or have transitioned to its variant successor, &quot;Quake Live&quot;.

<doc id="25216" wikidata="Q737103" url="?curid=25216" title="Quake II">
<text>Quake II is a 1997 first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Activision. It is the second installment of the &quot;Quake&quot; series, following &quot;Quake&quot;.

Developed over the course of a year, &quot;Quake II&quot; was released on December 9, 1997. In contrast to the first game, which featured a combination of science fiction and fantasy elements, &quot;Quake II&quot; entirely drops the latter elements and is set during humankind&#x27;s war against a rogue alien race known as the Strogg, half-mutant half-machine creatures whose homeplanet, Stroggos, is the target of the humans&#x27; invasion force. The player takes the role of a space marine (referred to as Bitterman) as he crash-lands on the planet and, being the last survivor of his squad, is tasked with completing a series of missions to cripple the Strogg and end their plans to conquer Earth. The game&#x27;s storyline is continued in its expansions, including one tying in &quot;Quake II&quot; and the first game, and &quot;Quake 4&quot;. The game&#x27;s heavy metal soundtrack was provided by Sascha Dikiciyan.

Besides its single player component, &quot;Quake II&quot; also uses a client/server network system similar to that of &quot;Quake&quot; for multiplayer. Unlike &quot;Quake&quot;, where hardware acceleration was only implemented through later patches, &quot;Quake II&quot; was released with native OpenGL support. &quot;Quake II&quot; was also the first id Software game not to be released for the then-deprecated MS-DOS operating system, rather running natively on Windows 95, with several ports to other systems following afterwards. The source code for &quot;Quake II&quot; was released by id Software under the GPL license on December 21, 2001.

&quot;Quake II&quot; received critical acclaim on its release, and similarly to its predecessor is generally considered to be one of the best video games ever made. An &quot;enhanced&quot; version of &quot;Quake II&quot; developed by Nightdive Studios was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S on August 10, 2023. It includes the original game and its two expansion packs, an episode consisting of the levels from the Nintendo 64 version of the game, and a brand new episode designed by MachineGames.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Quake II&quot; is a first-person shooter, in which the player shoots enemies from the perspective of the main character. The gameplay is very similar to that featured in &quot;Quake&quot;, in terms of movement and controls, although the player&#x27;s movement speed has been slowed down, and the player now has the ability to crouch. The game retains four of the eight weapons from &quot;Quake&quot; (the Shotgun, Super Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, and Rocket Launcher), although they have been redesigned visually and made to function in slightly different ways. The remainder of &quot;Quake&quot;″s eight weapons (the Axe, Nailgun, Super Nailgun, and Thunderbolt) are not present in &quot;Quake II&quot;. The six new weapons are the Blaster, Machine Gun, Chain Gun, Hyperblaster, Railgun, and BFG10K. The Quad Damage power up from &quot;Quake&quot; is present in &quot;Quake II&quot;, and new power-ups include the Ammo Pack, Invulnerability, Bandolier, Enviro-Suit, Rebreather, and Silencer.

===Single-player===
The single-player game features a number of changes from &quot;Quake&quot;. First, the player is given mission-based objectives that correspond to the storyline, including stealing a Tank Commander&#x27;s head to open a door and calling down an air-strike on a bunker. CGI cutscenes are used to illustrate the player&#x27;s progress through the main objectives, although they are all essentially the same short piece of video, showing a computerized image of the player character as he moves through game&#x27;s levels. Another addition is the inclusion of a non-hostile character type: the player character&#x27;s captured comrades. It is not possible to interact with these characters, however, as they have all been driven insane by their Strogg captors.

The game features much larger levels than &quot;Quake&quot;, with many more wide open areas. A hub system allows the player to travel back and forth between levels, which is necessary to complete certain objectives. Some of the textures and symbols that appear in the game are similar to some of those found in &quot;Quake&quot;. Enemies demonstrate visible wounds after they have taken damage.

===Multiplayer===
The multiplayer portion is similar to that of &quot;Quake&quot;. It can be played as a free-for-all deathmatch game mode, a cooperative version of the single-player game, or as a 1 vs 1 match that is used in official tournaments, like the Cyberathlete Professional League. It can also be played in Capture the Flag mode (CTF). The deathmatch game benefited from the release of eight specifically designed levels that id Software added after the game&#x27;s initial release. They were introduced to the game via one of the early patches, that were released free of charge. Prior to the release of these maps, players were limited to playing multiplayer games on the single-player levels, which, while functional as multiplayer levels, were not designed with deathmatch gameplay specifically in mind.

As in &quot;Quake&quot;, it is possible to customize the way in which the player appears to other people in multiplayer games. However, whereas in &quot;Quake&quot;, the only option was to change the color of the player&#x27;s uniform unless third party modifications were used, now the game comes with a selection of three different player models: a male marine, a female marine, and a male cyborg; choice of player model also affects the speech effects the player&#x27;s character will make, such as exhaling in effort while jumping or groaning when injured. Each model can be customized from in the in-game menu via the selection of pre-drawn skins, which differ in many ways; for example, skin color, camouflage style, and application of facepaint.

==Plot==
&quot;Quake II&quot; takes place in a science fiction environment set against the backdrop of a war between humanity and an alien race known as the Strogg, who capture and convert organic creatures into horrific cyborgs for their war machine. In the single-player game, the player assumes the role of a Marine named Bitterman taking part in &quot;Operation Alien Overlord&quot;, a desperate attempt to end the war by launching a counter-offensive on alien home planet of Stroggos. Most of the other soldiers are captured or killed as soon as they approach the planned landing zone. Bitterman survives because another Marine&#x27;s personal capsule collided with his upon launch, causing him to crash far short of the landing zone. Bitterman fights his way through the highly industrial Strogg city, destroying strategic objectives along the way, and finally kills the Strogg leader, the Makron, in his orbital asteroid base.

==Development==
===Design===
Originally, &quot;Quake II&quot; was supposed to be a new game and intellectual property; titles like &quot;Strogg&quot;, &quot;Lock and Load&quot;, and just &quot;Load&quot; were toyed with in the early days of development. But after numerous failed attempts, the team at id decided to stick with &quot;Quake II&quot; and forgo the Gothic Lovecraftian horror theme from the original in favor of a more sci-fi aesthetic.

The game was developed with a 13-person team. Activision obtained the worldwide distribution rights to the game in May 1997. Artist and co-owner Adrian Carmack had said that &quot;Quake II&quot; is his favorite game in the series because &quot;it was different and a cohesive project&quot;. This is the last id Software game to feature American McGee as he was fired shortly after its release.

===Technology===
Unlike &quot;Quake&quot;, where hardware-accelerated graphics controllers were supported only with later patches, &quot;Quake II&quot; came with OpenGL support out of the box. Later downloads from id Software added support for AMD&#x27;s 3DNow! instruction set for improved performance on their K6-2 processors, and Rendition released a native renderer for their V1000 graphics chip. The latest version is 3.21. This update includes numerous bug fixes and new levels designed for multiplayer deathmatch. Version 3.21, available as source code on id Software&#x27;s FTP server, has no improved functionality over version 3.20 and is simply a slight modification to make compiling for Linux easier.

&quot;Quake II&quot; uses an improved client–server model introduced in &quot;Quake&quot;. The game code of &quot;Quake II&quot;, which defines all the functionality for weapons, entities, and game mechanics, can be changed in any way because id Software published the source code of their own implementation that shipped with the game. &quot;Quake II&quot; uses the shared library functionality of the operating system to load the game library at run-time—this is how mod authors are able to alter the game and provide different gameplay mechanics, new weapons, and much more. The full source code to &quot;Quake II&quot; version 3.19 was released under the terms of the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later on December 22, 2001. Version 3.21 followed later. An LCC-friendly version was released on January 1, 2002, by a modder going by the name of Major Bitch.

&quot;Quake II&quot;″s game engine was a popular license and formed the basis for several commercial and free games, such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;War§ow&quot;, &quot;SiN&quot;, &quot;Anachronox&quot;, &quot;Heretic II&quot;, &quot;Daikatana&quot;, &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. Valve&#x27;s 1998 video game &quot;Half-Life&quot; used the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine during early development stages. However, the final version runs on a heavily modified version of the &quot;Quake&quot; engine, &quot;GoldSrc&quot;, with a small amount of the &quot;Quake II&quot; code.

===Music===
The soundtrack for &quot;Quake II&quot; was mainly provided by Sonic Mayhem, with some additional tracks by Bill Brown; the main theme was also composed by Bill Brown and Rob Zombie, and one track by Jer Sypult. The soundtrack for the Nintendo 64 version of the game was composed by Aubrey Hodges, credited as Ken &quot;Razor&quot; Richmond.

===Source ports===
Since the release of the &quot;Quake II&quot; engine&#x27;s source code, several updates from third-party projects to the game engine have been created; the most prominent of these are projects focused on graphical enhancements to the game such as most notable Yamagi Quake II, Quake2maX, EGL, Quake II Evolved, and KMQuake II. The source release also revealed numerous security flaws which can result in remote compromise of both the &quot;Quake II&quot; client and server. As id Software no longer maintains &quot;Quake II&quot;, most third-party engines include fixes for these bugs. The unofficial patch 3.24 that fixes bugs and adds only meager tweaks is recommended for &quot;Quake II&quot; purists, as it is not intended to add new features or be an engine mod in its own right. The most popular server-side engine modification for multiplayer, &quot;R1Q2&quot;, is generally recommended as a replacement for the 3.20 release for both clients and servers.

In July 2003, Vertigo Software released a source port of &quot;Quake II&quot; for the Microsoft .NET platform, using Managed C++, called Quake II .NET. It became a poster application for the language, showcasing the powerful interoperability between .NET and standard C++ code. It remains one of the top downloads on the Visual C++ website. In May 2004, Bytonic Software released a source port of &quot;Quake II&quot; (called Jake2) written in Java using JOGL. In 2010 Google ported Jake2 to HTML5, running in Safari and Chrome.

====vkQuake2====
In December 2018, Polish programmer Krzysztof Kondrak released the original &quot;Quake II&quot; v3.21 source code with Vulkan support added. The port, called vkQuake2, is available under the GPLv2.

====Quake II RTX====
A new source port of the game, titled Quake II RTX, was announced by Nvidia in March 2019 and was released on June 6 for Windows and Linux on Steam. This source port requires either a Nvidia RTX or an AMD Radeon RX 6000 series GPU or higher to utilize these cards&#x27; hardware ray tracing functionality, but a software fallback is available for graphics cards that are fast enough.
The source port, provided free of charge, includes the three levels present in the original &quot;Quake II&quot; demo, but can be used to play the full game if its data files are available. Unlike in most games, ray tracing is used extensively here for lighting, reflections, etc. This is only possible because of the otherwise low hardware demands of &quot;Quake II&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Quake II&quot; released on December 9, 1997, in the United States and on December 12 in Europe. Despite the title, &quot;Quake II&quot; is a sequel to the original &quot;Quake&quot; in name only. The scenario, enemies, and theme are separate and do not fall into the same continuity as &quot;Quake&quot;. id initially wanted to set it separately from &quot;Quake&quot;, but for legal reasons (most of their suggested names were already taken), they decided to use the working title.&quot;Quake II&quot; was adopted as a name to leverage the popularity of &quot;Quake&quot; according to Jennell Jaquays. &quot;Quake II&quot; has been released on Steam, but this version does not include the soundtrack. The game was released on a bonus disc included with &quot;Quake 4&quot; Special Edition for the PC, along with both expansion packs. This version lacks the soundtrack. &quot;Quake II&quot; is available on a bonus disc with the Xbox 360 version of &quot;Quake 4&quot;. This version is a direct port featuring the original soundtrack and multiplayer maps.

In 2015, &quot;Quake II: Quad Damage&quot;, a bundle containing the original game with the mission packs has been released at GOG.com, but unlike the previous releases, this one contains a new customizable launcher and the official soundtrack in OGG format which was made possible to play in-game, making it the only digital release at the time to include music.

The game has been included in the following official compilations:

* &quot;Quake II: Quad Damage&quot; – contains &quot;Quake II&quot; and all three official expansion packs.
* &quot;Quake II: Colossus&quot; – a compilation for Linux that contains &quot;Quake II&quot; and both mission packs.
* &quot;Ultimate Quake&quot; – a compilation including the original &quot;Quake&quot; trilogy.

===Ports===
Ports of &quot;Quake II&quot; were released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64 (ported by Raster Productions) and PlayStation (ported by HammerHead) video game consoles. In both cases, the core gameplay was largely identical; however, changes were made to the game sequence and split-screen multiplayer replaced network or Internet play. A Macintosh port was developed by Logicware and released in July 1999. &quot;Quake II: Colossus&quot; (&quot;Quake II&quot; with both official add-ons) was ported to Linux by id Software and published by Macmillan Digital Publishing in 1999. Be Inc. ported &quot;Quake II: Colossus&quot; to BeOS to test their OpenGL acceleration in 1999, and provided the game files for free download at a later date—a Windows, Macintosh, or Linux install CD was required to install the game, with the add-ons being optional.

The PlayStation version contains abridged versions of Units 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 10 of the PC version, redesigned to meet the console&#x27;s technical limitations. For example, many short airlock-like corridors were added to maps to provide loading pauses inside what were contiguous areas in the PC version. In addition, part of the first mission of the N64 port is used as a prologue. Some enemy types were removed and two new enemies was added: the Arachnid, a human-spider cyborg with twin railgun arms, and the Guardian, a bipedal boss enemy. Saving the game is only possible between levels and at mid-level checkpoints where the game loads, while in the PC version the game could be saved and loaded at any time. The game supports the PlayStation Mouse peripheral to provide a greater parity with the PC version&#x27;s gameplay. The music used in this port is a combination of the &quot;Quake II&quot; original music score and tracks from the PC version&#x27;s mission packs, while the opening and closing cut-scenes are taken from the Ground Zero expansion pack.

The PlayStation version uses an engine developed by HammerHead for their future PlayStation projects and runs at a 512x240 resolution at 30 frames per second. The developer was keen to retain a visual parity with the PC version and avoid tricks such as the use of environmental fog. Colored lights for levels and enemies, and yellow highlights for gunfire and explosions, are carried across from the PC version, with the addition of lens flare effects located around the light sources on the original lightmaps. There is no skybox; instead, a flat Gouraud-textured purple &quot;sky&quot; is drawn across the ceiling. The game uses particles to render blood, debris, and rail gun beams analogously to the PC version.

There is a split-screen multiplayer mode for two to four players (a four player game is possible using the PlayStation&#x27;s Multi-tap). The only available player avatar is a modified version of the male player avatar from the PC version, the most noticeable difference being the addition of a helmet. Players can only customize the color of their avatar&#x27;s armor and change their name. The twelve multiplayer levels featured are unique to the PlayStation version, with none of the PC multiplayer maps being carried over.

The Nintendo 64 version has different single-player levels and multiplayer maps, and features multiplayer support for up to four players. This version has new lighting effects, mostly seen in gunfire, and uses the Expansion Pak for extra graphical detail. This port features a new soundtrack, consisting mostly of dark ambient pieces, composed by Aubrey Hodges.

A port of &quot;Quake II&quot; was included with &quot;Quake 4&quot; for the Xbox 360 on a bonus disc. This is a direct port of the original game, with some graphical improvements. The port allows for System Link play for up to sixteen players, split-screen for four players, and cooperative play in single-player for up to sixteen players or four players with split-screen alone.

=== Enhanced version ===
An &quot;enhanced&quot; version of &quot;Quake II&quot; developed by Nightdive Studios was released for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S on August 10, 2023, during QuakeCon. It collects the full single-player campaign alongside all previously released official expansions and multiplayer maps. It is the first console version of the game to be presented in native widescreen at a resolution of 1080p and 60 frames-per-second performance on the eighth-generation platforms, while the PlayStation 5, Xbox One X, Xbox Series X/S and Windows releases are able to support native 4K (3840x2160) resolution and up to 120FPS with compatible displays. The Xbox Series X/S and Windows releases also support 8-player splitscreen. This version of the game also introduces a new single-player expansion, &quot;Call of the Machine&quot;, which was designed exclusively for the enhanced version by Bethesda studio MachineGames, comprising 28 additional levels and a new Deathmatch map. The Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Quake II&quot; is also bundled with the enhanced version as a bonus.

==Additional content==
===Official expansions===
====&quot;Mission Pack: The Reckoning&quot;====
&quot;Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning&quot; is the first expansion pack, released on May 27, 1998. It was developed by Xatrix Entertainment. First announced in January 1998, it features eighteen single player levels, six deathmatch levels, three weapons (the Ion Ripper, Phalanx Particle Cannon, and Trap), a power-up, two enemies, seven modified versions of existing enemies, and five music tracks. The storyline follows Joker, a member of an elite squad of marines on a mission to infiltrate a Strogg base on one of Stroggos&#x27; moons and destroy the Strogg fleet, which is preparing to attack. Joker crash lands in the swamps outside of the compound where his squad is waiting. He travels through the swamps and bypasses the compounds outer defenses and enters through the main gate, finding his squad just in time to watch them get executed by Strogg forces. Next, Joker escapes on his own to the fuel refinery where he helps the Air Force destroy all fuel production, then infiltrates the Strogg spaceport, boards a cargo ship and reaches the Moon Base, destroying it and the Strogg fleet. The section of the game that takes place on the Moon Base has low gravity, something that was previously used on one secret level of the original &quot;Quake&quot;.

The Reckoning received mixed reviews. It holds 69.50% from Gamerankings and GameSpot given a score of 7.4/10.

====&quot;Mission Pack: Ground Zero&quot;====
&quot;Quake II Mission Pack: Ground Zero&quot; is the second expansion pack, released on September 11, 1998. It was developed by Rogue Entertainment. It comes with fourteen single-player levels, ten multiplayer maps, five additional music tracks, five enemies, seven power-ups, and five weapons. In the expansion&#x27;s story the Gravity Well has trapped the Earth Fleet in orbit above the planet Stroggos. One of the marines who managed to land, Stepchild, must now make his way to the Gravity Well to destroy it and free the fleet above and disable the entire defenses of the planet.

&quot;Ground Zero&quot; received average to mixed reviews. It holds 65.40% from Gamerankings. Patrick Baggatta of IGN gave the expansion 7.5/10, describing it as similar to the original, but noting occasionally confusing map design. Elliott Chin of GameSpot gave the game 7.9/10, citing it as decent for an expansion and praising the monsters and enhanced AI. Johnny B. of Game Revolution rated the expansion D+, citing bad level design and few additions to the original game, and noted the multiplayer power-up gameplay as the only fun feature.

====&quot;Netpack I: Extremities&quot;====
&quot;Quake II Netpack I: Extremities&quot; contains, among other features, 11 game mods and 12 deathmatch maps.

====&quot;Call of the Machine&quot;====
The fourth mission pack, &quot;Call of the Machine&quot;, was released as part of the enhanced version of &quot;Quake II&quot; released on August 10, 2023.

=== Unofficial expansions ===
Two unofficial expansions were released on CDs in 1998: &quot;Zaero&quot;, developed by Team Evolve and published by Macmillan Digital Publishing, and &quot;Juggernaut: The New Story&quot;, developed by Canopy Games and published by HeadGames Publishing.

===Community content===
As with the original &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot; was designed to allow players to easily create custom content. A large number of mods, maps, graphics such as player models and skins, and sound effects were created and distributed to others free of charge via the Internet. Popular websites such as PlanetQuake and Telefragged allowed players to gain access to custom content. Another improvement over &quot;Quake&quot; was that it was easier to select custom player models, skins, and sound effects because they could be selected from an in-game menu.

Mods for the game include &quot;Action Quake&quot; from 1999. &quot;PC Gaming World&quot;″s Simon Quirk wrote of the game, &quot;The &quot;Action Quake&quot; team fancied a multiplayer-only total conversion of &quot;Quake II&quot; where strategy, accuracy, and cool-looking fights would dominate.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Quake II&quot; received very positive reviews across all platforms.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game and stated that &quot;all in all, id should be commended for the advancement of its technology and improvement in its single-player level design, but it&#x27;s going to be up to mod designers to provide the necessary additions to the multiplayer game in order to make it stand out from &quot;Quake&quot;.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; said the game &quot;lives up to its impossibly high hype.&quot; Praising its interconnected levels, new weapons, enemy design, soundtrack, and the ability to play as a female character in multiplayer mode (which they called &quot;an overdue nod to the growing number of QuakeGrrls&quot;), they gave it a perfect 5.0 out of 5 in all four categories (graphics, sound, control, and funfactor).

On aggregating review website GameRankings, the PC version held 87%, the Nintendo 64 version 81%, and the PlayStation version 80%. &quot;AllGame&quot; editor Michael L. House stated, &quot;the beauty of Quake II is not in the single-player game, it&#x27;s in the multi-player feature.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; editor Vince Broady described &quot;Quake II&quot; as &quot;the only first-person shooter to render the original Quake entirely obsolete.&quot;

Daniel Erickson reviewed the N64 version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, and stated that &quot;a good first-person shooter with a great multiplayer mode; &quot;GoldenEye&quot; is no longer the only game in town.&quot;

At the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Quake II&quot; was awarded &quot;PC Action Game of the Year&quot;; it also received nominations for &quot;Computer Entertainment Title of the Year&quot; and &quot;Interactive Title of the Year&quot;. &quot;Quake II&quot; won &quot;Macworld&quot;″s 1999 &quot;Best Shoot-&#x27;Em-Up&quot; award, and the magazine&#x27;s Christopher Breen wrote: &quot;In either single-player or multiplayer mode, for careening-through-corridor-carnage satisfaction, &quot;Quake II&quot; is a must-have.&quot; It also won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1997 &quot;Action Game of the Year&quot; award. The editors wrote that &quot;for pure adrenaline-pumping, visceral, instantly gratifying action, &quot;Quake II&quot; is the hands-down winner. No game gave us the rush that &quot;Quake II&quot; did&quot;.

In 1998, &quot;PC Gamer&quot; declared it the 3rd-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it &quot;id&#x27;s gun-happy masterpiece is the most sensational and subtle shooter ever, and one of the best games of any type ever created.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Quake 2&quot; as number 5 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;&quot;Quake 2&quot; is the standard for multiplayer shooting, and we&#x27;ve yet to see a &quot;&quot;Quake&quot; killer&quot; that can keep us from returning to multiplayer &quot;Quake&quot; for longer than a month or so.&quot;

===Sales===
&quot;Quake II&quot; entered PC Data&#x27;s monthly computer game sales rankings at #2 for December 1997, behind &quot;Riven&quot;. The game&#x27;s sales in the United States alone reached 240,913 copies by the end of 1997, after its release on December 9. According to PC Data, it was the country&#x27;s 22nd-best-selling computer game of 1997. The following year, &quot;Quake II&quot; secured fifth place on PC Data&#x27;s charts for January and February 1998, then dropped to #8 in March and #9 in April. It remained in PC Data&#x27;s top 20 for another two months, before exiting in July 1998. &quot;Quake II&quot; surpassed 850,000 units shipped to retailers by April 1998, and 900,000 by June.

According to PC Data, &quot;Quake II&quot; was the United States&#x27; 14th-best-selling computer game during the January–November 1998 period. It ultimately secured 15th place for the full year, with sales of 279,536 copies and revenues of $12.6 million. GameDaily reported in January 1999 that &quot;Quake II&quot;″s sales in the United States had reached 550,000 units; this number rose to 610,000 units by December of that year. Worldwide, &quot;Quake II&quot; sold over 1 million copies by 2002.

<text>In the Sinosphere, qi ( ) is traditionally believed to be a vital force part of all living entities. Literally meaning &#x27;vapor&#x27;, &#x27;air&#x27;, or &#x27;breath&#x27;, the word &quot;qi&quot; is polysemous, often translated as &#x27;vital energy&#x27;, &#x27;vital force&#x27;, &#x27;material energy&#x27;, or simply &#x27;energy&#x27;. Qi is also a concept in traditional Chinese medicine and in Chinese martial arts. The attempt to cultivate and balance qi is called &quot;qigong&quot;.

Believers in qi describe it as a vital force, with one&#x27;s good health requiring its flow to be unimpeded. Originally prescientific, today it is a pseudoscientific concept, i.e. not corresponding to the concept of energy as used in the physical sciences, with the notion of vital force itself being abandoned by the scientific community.

Chinese gods and immortals, especially anthropomorphic gods, are sometimes thought to have qi and be a reflection of the microcosm of qi in humans, both having qi that can concentrate in certain body parts.

==Linguistic aspects==

The cultural keyword &quot;qì&quot; is analyzable in terms of Chinese and Sino-Xenic pronunciations. Possible etymologies include the logographs , , and with various meanings ranging from &quot;vapor&quot; to &quot;anger&quot;, and the English loanword qi or ch&#x27;i.

===Pronunciation and etymology===
The logograph is read with two Chinese pronunciations, the usual &quot;qì&quot; &quot;air; vital energy&quot; and the rare archaic &quot;xì&quot; &quot;to present food&quot; (later disambiguated with ). Hackett Publishing Company, Philip J. Ivanhoe, and Bryan W. Van Norden theorize that the word qi possibly came from a term that referred to &quot;the mist that arose from heated sacrificial offerings&quot;.

Pronunciations of in modern varieties of Chinese with standardized IPA equivalents include: Standard Chinese &quot;qì&quot; , Wu Chinese qi , Southern Min &quot;khì&quot; , Eastern Min &quot;ké&quot; , Standard Cantonese &quot;hei3&quot; , and Hakka Chinese &quot;hi&quot; .

Pronunciations of in Sino-Xenic borrowings include: Japanese &quot;ki&quot;, Korean &quot;gi&quot;, and Vietnamese &quot;khí.&quot;

Reconstructions of the Middle Chinese pronunciation of standardized to IPA transcription include: /kʰe̯iH/ (Bernard Karlgren), /kʰĭəiH/ (Wang Li), /kʰiəiH/ (Li Rong), /kʰɨjH/ (Edwin Pulleyblank), and /kʰɨiH/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang).

Axel Schuessler&#x27;s reconstruction of the Later Han Chinese pronunciation of is /kɨs/.

Reconstructions of the Old Chinese pronunciation of standardized to IPA transcription include: */kʰɯds/ (Zhengzhang Shangfang), */C.qʰəp-s/ (William H. Baxter and Laurent Sagart), and */kə(t)s/ (Axel Schuessler).

The etymology of &quot;qì&quot; interconnects with Kharia &quot;kʰis&quot; &quot;anger&quot;, Sora &quot;kissa&quot; &quot;move with great effort&quot;, Khmer &quot;kʰɛs&quot; &quot;strive after; endeavor&quot;, and Gyalrongic &quot;kʰɐs&quot; &quot;anger&quot;.

===Characters===
In the East Asian languages, &quot;qì&quot; has three logographs:
* is the traditional Chinese character, Korean &quot;hanja&quot;, and Japanese &quot;kyūjitai&quot; (&quot;old character form&quot;) &quot;kanji&quot;
* is the Japanese &quot;shinjitai&quot; (&quot;new character form&quot;) &quot;kanji&quot;
* is the simplified Chinese character.
In addition, &quot;qì&quot; is an uncommon character especially used in writing Daoist talismans. Historically, the word &quot;qì&quot; was generally written as until the Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE), when it was replaced by the graph clarified with &quot;mǐ&quot; &quot;rice&quot; indicating &quot;steam (rising from rice as it cooks.)&quot; and depicting the Traditional Chinese view of the transformative, changeable nature of existence and the universe.

This primary logograph , the earliest written character for &quot;qì,&quot; consisted of three wavy horizontal lines seen in Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) oracle bone script, Zhou dynasty (1046–256 BCE) bronzeware script and large seal script, and Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) small seal script. These oracle, bronze, and seal scripts logographs were used in ancient times as a phonetic loan character to write &quot;qǐ&quot; &quot;plead for; beg; ask&quot; which did not have an early character.

The vast majority of Chinese characters are classified as radical-phonetic characters. Such characters combine a semantically suggestive &quot;radical characters&quot; with a phonetic element approximating ancient pronunciation. For example, the widely known word &quot;dào&quot; &quot;the Dao; the way&quot; graphically combines the &quot;walk&quot; radical with a &quot;shǒu&quot; &quot;head&quot; phonetic. Although the modern &quot;dào&quot; and &quot;shǒu&quot; pronunciations are dissimilar, the Old Chinese &quot;*lˤuʔ-s&quot; and &quot;*l̥uʔ-s&quot; were alike. The regular script character &quot;qì&quot; is unusual because &quot;qì&quot; is both the &quot;air radical&quot; and the phonetic, with &quot;mǐ&quot; &quot;rice&quot; semantically indicating &quot;steam; vapor&quot;.

This &quot;qì&quot; &quot;air/gas radical&quot; was only used in a few native Chinese characters like &quot;yīnyūn&quot; &quot;thick mist/smoke&quot;, but was also used to create new scientific characters for gaseous chemical elements. Some examples are based on pronunciations in European languages: &quot;fú&quot; (with a &quot;fú&quot; phonetic) &quot;fluorine&quot; and &quot;nǎi&quot; (with a &quot;nǎi&quot; phonetic) &quot;neon&quot;. Others are based on semantics: &quot;qīng&quot; (with a &quot;jīng&quot; phonetic, abbreviating &quot;qīng&quot; &quot;light-weight&quot;) &quot;hydrogen (the lightest element)&quot; and &quot;lǜ&quot; (with a &quot;lù&quot; phonetic, abbreviating &quot;lǜ&quot; &quot;green&quot;) &quot;(greenish-yellow) chlorine&quot;.

&quot;Qì&quot; is the phonetic element in a few characters such as &quot;kài&quot; &quot;hate&quot; with the &quot;heart-mind radical&quot; or , &quot;xì&quot; &quot;set fire to weeds&quot; with the &quot;fire radical&quot; , and &quot;xì&quot; &quot;to present food&quot; with the &quot;food radical&quot; .

The first Chinese dictionary of characters, the &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot;(121 CE) notes that the primary &quot;qì&quot; is a pictographic character depicting &quot;cloudy vapors&quot;, and that the full combines &quot;rice&quot; with the phonetic qi , meaning &quot;present provisions to guests&quot; (later disambiguated as &quot;xì&quot; ).

===Meanings===
Qi is a polysemous word. The unabridged Chinese-Chinese character dictionary &quot;Hanyu Da Cidian&quot; defines it as &quot;present food or provisions&quot; for the &quot;xì&quot; pronunciation but also lists 23 meanings for the &quot;qì&quot; pronunciation. The modern &quot;ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary,&quot; which enters &quot;xì&quot; &quot;grain; animal feed; make a present of food&quot;, and a &quot;qì&quot; entry with seven translation equivalents for the noun, two for bound morphemes, and three equivalents for the verb. n. ① air; gas ② smell ③ spirit; vigor; morale ④ vital/material energy (in Ch[inese] metaphysics) ⑤ tone; atmosphere; attitude ⑥ anger ⑦ breath; respiration b.f. ① weather &quot;tiānqì&quot; ② [linguistics] aspiration &quot;sòngqì&quot; v. ① anger ② get angry ③ bully; insult.Qi was also thought of as meaning &quot;&#x27;forces in nature&#x27;&quot; that deity could control and magicians and occultists could harness.

===English borrowing===
Qi was an early Chinese loanword in English. It was romanized as &quot;k&#x27;i&quot; in Church Romanization in the early-19th century, as ch&#x27;i in Wade–Giles in the mid-19th century (sometimes misspelled &quot;chi&quot; omitting the apostrophe), and as qi in Pinyin in the mid-20th century. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; entry for qi gives the pronunciation as , the etymology from Chinese &quot;qì&quot; &quot;air; breath&quot;, and a definition of &quot;The physical life-force postulated by certain Chinese philosophers; the material principle.&quot; It also gives eight usage examples, with the first recorded example of &quot;k&#x27;í&quot; in 1850 (&quot;The Chinese Repository&quot;), of ch&#x27;i in 1917 (&quot;The Encyclopaedia Sinica&quot;), and qi in 1971 (Felix Mann&#x27;s &quot;Acupuncture&quot;)

The word qi is very frequently used in word games—such as &quot;Scrabble&quot;—due to containing a letter Q without a letter U.

==Concept==

References to concepts analogous to qi are found in many Asian belief systems. Philosophical conceptions of qi from the earliest records of Chinese philosophy (5th century BCE) correspond to Western notions of humours and to the ancient Hindu yogic concept of &quot;prana.&quot; An early form of qi comes from the writings of the Chinese philosopher Mencius (4th century BCE).

The ancient Chinese described qi as &quot;life force&quot;. They believed it permeated everything and linked their surroundings together. Qi was also linked to the flow of energy around and through the body, forming a cohesive functioning unit. By understanding the rhythm and flow of qi, they believed they could guide exercises and treatments to provide stability and longevity.

Although the concept has been important within many Chinese philosophies, over the centuries the descriptions of qi have varied and have sometimes been in conflict. Until China came into contact with Western scientific and philosophical ideas, the Chinese had not categorized all things in terms of matter and energy. Qi and &quot;li&quot; (: &quot;pattern&quot;) were &#x27;fundamental&#x27; categories similar to matter and energy.

&quot;In later Chinese philosophy, qi was thought of as the fundamental &#x27;stuff&#x27; out of which everything in the universe condenses and into which it eventually dissipates.&quot;

Fairly early on, some Chinese thinkers began to believe that there were different fractions of qi—the coarsest and heaviest fractions formed solids, lighter fractions formed liquids, and the most ethereal fractions were the &quot;lifebreath&quot; that animated living beings. &quot;Yuanqi&quot; is a notion of innate or prenatal qi which is distinguished from acquired qi that a person may develop over their lifetime.

==Philosophical roots==

The earliest texts that speak of qi give some indications of how the concept developed. In the Analects of Confucius, qi could mean &quot;breath&quot;. Combining it with the Chinese word for blood (making 血氣, &quot;xue&quot;–qi, blood and breath), the concept could be used to account for motivational characteristics:

The philosopher Mozi used the word qi to refer to noxious vapors that would eventually arise from a corpse were it not buried at a sufficient depth. He reported that early civilized humans learned how to live in houses to protect their qi from the moisture that troubled them when they lived in caves. He also associated maintaining one&#x27;s qi with providing oneself with adequate nutrition. In regard to another kind of qi, he recorded how some people performed a kind of prognostication by observing qi (clouds) in the sky.

Mencius described a kind of qi that might be characterized as an individual&#x27;s vital energies. This qi was necessary to activity and it could be controlled by a well-integrated willpower. When properly nurtured, this qi was said to be capable of extending beyond the human body to reach throughout the universe. It could also be augmented by means of careful exercise of one&#x27;s moral capacities. On the other hand, the qi of an individual could be degraded by adverse external forces that succeed in operating on that individual.

Living things were not the only things believed to have qi. Zhuangzi indicated that wind is the qi of the Earth. Moreover, cosmic yin and yang &quot;are the greatest of qi. He described qi as &quot;issuing forth&quot; and creating profound effects. He also said &quot;Human beings are born [because of] the accumulation of qi. When it accumulates there is life. When it dissipates there is death... There is one qi that connects and pervades everything in the world.&quot;

The Guanzi essay &quot;Neiye&quot; (Inward Training) is the oldest received writing on the subject of the cultivation of vapor &quot;[qi]&quot; and meditation techniques. The essay was probably composed at the Jixia Academy in Qi in the late fourth century B.C.

Xun Zi, another Confucian scholar of the Jixia Academy, followed in later years. At 9:69/127, Xun Zi says, &quot;Fire and water have qi but do not have life. Grasses and trees have life but do not have perceptivity. Fowl and beasts have perceptivity but do not have &quot;yi&quot; (sense of right and wrong, duty, justice). Men have qi, life, perceptivity, and &quot;yi&quot;.&quot; Chinese people at such an early time had no concept of radiant energy, but they were aware that one can be heated by a campfire from a distance away from the fire. They accounted for this phenomenon by claiming &quot;qi&quot; radiated from fire. At 18:62/122, he also uses &quot;qi&quot; to refer to the vital forces of the body that decline with advanced age.

Among the animals, the gibbon and the crane were considered experts at inhaling the qi. The Confucian scholar Dong Zhongshu (ca. 150 BC) wrote in Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals: &quot;The gibbon resembles a macaque, but he is larger, and his color is black. His forearms being long, he lives eight hundred years, because he is expert in controlling his breathing.&quot; (&quot;&quot;)

Later, the syncretic text assembled under the direction of Liu An, the Huai Nan Zi, or &quot;Masters of Huainan&quot;, has a passage that presages most of what is given greater detail by the Neo-Confucians:

Qi is linked to East Asian thought on magic, and certain body parts were important to magic traditions such as some Taoist sects.

==Role in traditional Chinese medicine==
The &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot; &quot;(&quot;&quot;The Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Classic of Medicine&quot;, circa 2nd century BCE) is historically credited with first establishing the pathways, called meridians, through which qi allegedly circulates in the human body.

In traditional Chinese medicine, symptoms of various illnesses are believed to be either the product of disrupted, blocked, and unbalanced qi movement through meridians or deficiencies and imbalances of qi in the &quot;Zang Fu&quot; organs. Traditional Chinese medicine often seeks to relieve these imbalances by adjusting the circulation of qi using a variety of techniques including herbology, food therapy, physical training regimens (qigong, tai chi, and other martial arts training), moxibustion, &quot;tui na&quot;, or acupuncture.The cultivation of Heavenly and Earthly qi allow for the maintenance of psychological actions

The nomenclature of Qi in the human body is different depending on its sources, roles, and locations. For sources there is a difference between so-called &quot;Primordial Qi&quot; (acquired at birth from one&#x27;s parents) and Qi acquired throughout one&#x27;s life. Or again Chinese medicine differentiates between Qi acquired from the air we breathe (so called &quot;Clean Air&quot;) and Qi acquired from food and drinks (so-called &quot;Grain Qi&quot;). Looking at roles Qi is divided into &quot;Defensive Qi&quot; and &quot;Nutritive Qi&quot;. Defensive Qi&#x27;s role is to defend the body against invasions while Nutritive Qi&#x27;s role is to provide sustenance for the body. To protect against said invasions, medicines have four types of qi; cold, hot, warm, and cool. Cold qi medicines are used to treat invasions hot in nature, while hot qi medicines are used to treat invasions cold in nature. looking at locations, Qi is also named after the Zang-Fu organ or the Meridian in which it resides: &quot;Liver Qi&quot;, &quot;Spleen Qi&quot;, etc. Lastly, prolonged exposure to the three evil qi (wind, cold, and wetness) can result in the penetration of evil qi through surface body parts, eventually reaching Zang-Fu organs. 

A qi field (&quot;chu-chong&quot;) refers to the cultivation of an energy field by a group, typically for healing or other benevolent purposes. A qi field is believed to be produced by visualization and affirmation. They are an important component of Wisdom Healing Qigong (&quot;Zhineng Qigong&quot;), founded by Grandmaster Ming Pang.

==Scientific view==
The existence of Qi has not been proven scientifically. A 1998 consensus statement on acupuncture by the United States National Institutes of Health noted that concepts such as qi &quot;are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical information&quot;.

==Practices involving qi==
===Feng shui===

The traditional Chinese art of geomancy, the placement and arrangement of space called feng shui, is based on calculating the balance of qi, interactions between the five elements, yin and yang, and other factors. The retention or dissipation of qi is believed to affect the health, wealth, energy level, luck, and many other aspects of the occupants. Attributes of each item in a space affect the flow of qi by slowing it down, redirecting it or accelerating it. This is said to influence the energy level of the occupants. Positive qi flows in curved lines, whereas negative qi travels in straight lines. In order for qi to be nourishing and positive, it must continue to flow not too quickly or too slowly. In addition, qi should not be blocked abruptly, because it would become stagnant and turn destructive.

One use for a &quot;luopan&quot; is to detect the flow of qi. The quality of qi may rise and fall over time. Feng shui with a compass might be considered a form of divination that assesses the quality of the local environment.

There are three kinds of qi, known as heaven qi (&quot;tian qi&quot; 天气), Earth qi (&quot;di qi&quot; 地气), and human qi (&quot;ren qi&quot; 人气). Heaven qi is composed of natural forces including the sun and rain. Earth qi is affected by heaven qi. For example, too much sun would lead to drought, and a lack of sun would cause plants to die off. Human qi is affected by earth qi, because the environment has effects on human beings. Feng shui is the balancing of heaven, Earth, and human qi.

===Reiki===

Reiki is a form of alternative medicine called energy healing. Reiki practitioners use a technique called &quot;palm healing&quot; or &quot;hands-on healing&quot; through which a &quot;universal energy&quot; is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing. Reiki is a pseudoscience, and is used as an illustrative example of pseudoscience in scholarly texts and academic journal articles. It is based on qi (&quot;chi&quot;), which practitioners say is a universal life force, although there is no empirical evidence that such a life force exists. Clinical research has not shown reiki to be effective as a treatment for any medical condition. There has been no proof of the effectiveness of reiki therapy compared to the placebo effect. An overview of reiki investigations found that studies reporting positive effects had methodological flaws. The American Cancer Society stated that reiki should not replace conventional cancer treatment, a sentiment echoed by Cancer Research UK and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Developed in Japan in 1922 by Mikao Usui, it has been adapted into varying cultural traditions across the world.

According to its believers, Reiki healing occurs by laying hands over or on an individual&#x27;s area of pain and controlling the universal Qi flow of the nearby space, sending into the area of malaise and purifying it. There is no regulation of the practicing of Reiki in the United States and generally no central world organization that has authority over it.

===Qigong===

Qìgōng (气功 or 氣功) involves coordinated breathing, movement, and awareness. It is traditionally viewed as a practice to cultivate and balance qi. With roots in traditional Chinese medicine, philosophy and martial arts, &quot;qigong&quot; is now practiced worldwide for exercise, healing, meditation, and training for martial arts. Typically a &quot;qigong&quot; practice involves rhythmic breathing, slow and stylized movement, practicing mindfulness, and visualization of guiding qi.

===Martial arts===

Qi is a didactic concept in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese martial arts. Martial qigong is a feature of both internal and external training systems in China and other East Asian cultures. The most notable of the qi-focused &quot;internal&quot; force (jin) martial arts are Baguazhang, Xingyiquan, tai chi, Southern Praying Mantis, Snake Kung Fu, Southern Dragon Kung Fu, Aikido, Kendo, Hapkido, Aikijujutsu, Luohanquan, and Liuhebafa.

Demonstrations of qi or &quot;ki&quot; are popular in some martial arts and may include the unraisable body, the unbendable arm, and other feats of power. These feats can be explained using biomechanics and physics.

===Acupuncture and moxibustion===
Acupuncture is a part of traditional Chinese medicine that involves insertion of needles or the application of pinching/gripping into/onto superficial structures of the body (skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscles) at acupuncture points to balance the flow of qi. This is often accompanied by moxibustion, a treatment that involves burning mugwort on or near the skin at an acupuncture point.

<text>A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern &quot;classical&quot; computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.
The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or &quot;quantum bit&quot;), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two &quot;basis&quot; states, a state that is in an abstract sense &quot;between&quot; the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.
Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits is proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).
In principle, a classical computer can solve the same computational problems as a quantum computer, given enough time. Quantum advantage comes in the form of time complexity rather than computability, and quantum complexity theory shows that some quantum algorithms are exponentially more efficient than the best-known classical algorithms. A large-scale quantum computer could in theory solve computational problems that are unsolvable by a classical computer in any reasonable amount of time. This concept of additional ability has been called &quot;quantum supremacy&quot;. While such claims have drawn significant attention to the discipline, near-term practical use cases remain limited.

== History ==
For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities. Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain perplexing physical phenomena observed at atomic scales, and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations. Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography, and quantum physics was essential for nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.

As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge. In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.
When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics, prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.
In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.

Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch&#x27;s algorithm in 1985, the BernsteinVazirani algorithm in 1993, and Simon&#x27;s algorithm in 1994.
These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as &quot;quantum parallelism&quot;.
Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and DiffieHellman encryption protocols, which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing. In 1996, Grover&#x27;s algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem. The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations, validating Feynman&#x27;s 1982 conjecture.

Over the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.
In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.

In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer. However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.

== Quantum information processing ==
Computer engineers typically describe a modern computer&#x27;s operation in terms of classical electrodynamics.
Within these &quot;classical&quot; computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators) may rely on quantum behavior, but these components are not isolated from their environment, so any quantum information quickly decoheres.
While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm, quantum mechanical notions like superposition and interference are largely irrelevant for program analysis.

Quantum programs, in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems. Physicists describe these systems mathematically using linear algebra. Complex numbers model probability amplitudes, vectors model quantum states, and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states. Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.

As physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,
=== Quantum information ===
Just as the bit is the basic concept of classical information theory, the &quot;qubit&quot; is the fundamental unit of quantum information. The same term &quot;qubit&quot; is used to refer to an abstract mathematical model and to any physical system that is represented by that model. A classical bit, by definition, exists in either of two physical states, which can be denoted 0 and 1. A qubit is also described by a state, and two states often written formula_1 and formula_2 serve as the quantum counterparts of the classical states 0 and 1. However, the quantum states formula_1 and formula_2 belong to a vector space, meaning that they can be multiplied by constants and added together, and the result is again a valid quantum state. Such a combination is known as a &quot;superposition&quot; of formula_1 and formula_2.

A two-dimensional vector mathematically represents a qubit state. Physicists typically use Dirac notation for quantum mechanical linear algebra, writing formula_7 for a vector labeled formula_8 . Because a qubit is a two-state system, any qubit state takes the form formula_9 , where formula_1 and formula_2 are the standard &quot;basis states&quot;, and formula_12 and formula_13 are the &quot;probability amplitudes,&quot; which are in general complex numbers. If either formula_12 or formula_13 is zero, the qubit is effectively a classical bit; when both are nonzero, the qubit is in superposition. Such a quantum state vector acts similarly to a (classical) probability vector, with one key difference: unlike probabilities, probability are not necessarily positive numbers. Negative amplitudes allow for destructive wave interference.

When a qubit is measured in the standard basis, the result is a classical bit. The Born rule describes the norm-squared correspondence between amplitudes and probabilitieswhen measuring a qubit formula_9, the state collapses to formula_1 with probability formula_18, or to formula_2 with probability formula_20.
Any valid qubit state has coefficients formula_12 and formula_13 such that formula_23.
As an example, measuring the qubit formula_24 would produce either formula_1 or formula_2 with equal probability.

Each additional qubit doubles the dimension of the state space.
As an example, the vector represents a two-qubit state, a tensor product of the qubit with the qubit .
This vector inhabits a four-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors , , , and .
The Bell state is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubitsthe two qubits are &quot;entangled&quot; because neither qubit has a state vector of its own.
In general, the vector space for an &quot;n&quot;-qubit system is 2&quot;n&quot;-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2100 classical values.

=== Unitary operators ===
The state of this one-qubit quantum memory can be manipulated by applying quantum logic gates, analogous to how classical memory can be manipulated with classical logic gates. One important gate for both classical and quantum computation is the NOT gate, which can be represented by a matrix
formula_27
Mathematically, the application of such a logic gate to a quantum state vector is modelled with matrix multiplication. Thus
: formula_28 and formula_29.
The mathematics of single qubit gates can be extended to operate on multi-qubit quantum memories in two important ways. One way is simply to select a qubit and apply that gate to the target qubit while leaving the remainder of the memory unaffected. Another way is to apply the gate to its target only if another part of the memory is in a desired state. These two choices can be illustrated using another example. The possible states of a two-qubit quantum memory are
formula_30
The controlled NOT (CNOT) gate can then be represented using the following matrix:
formula_31
As a mathematical consequence of this definition, formula_32, formula_33, formula_34, and formula_35. In other words, the CNOT applies a NOT gate (formula_36 from before) to the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state formula_37. If the first qubit is formula_38, nothing is done to either qubit.

In summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

=== Quantum parallelism ===

&quot;Quantum parallelism&quot; is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously. This can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated. The resulting state encodes the function&#x27;s output values for all input values in the superposition, allowing for the computation of multiple outputs simultaneously. This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms. However, &quot;parallelism&quot; in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value. To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient.

=== Quantum programming ===
There are a number of models of computation for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed.

==== Gate array ====
A quantum gate array decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit quantum gates. A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements. However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.

Any quantum computation (which is, in the above formalism, any unitary matrix of size formula_39 over formula_40 qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates. A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a universal gate set, since a computer that can run such circuits is a universal quantum computer. One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above. This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates. Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Implementation of Boolean functions using the few-qubit quantum gates is presented here.

==== Measurement-based quantum computing ====

A measurement-based quantum computer decomposes computation into a sequence of Bell state measurements and single-qubit quantum gates applied to a highly entangled initial state (a cluster state), using a technique called quantum gate teleportation.

==== Adiabatic quantum computing ====

An adiabatic quantum computer, based on quantum annealing, decomposes computation into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution.

==== Neuromorphic quantum computing ====
Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated as ‘n.quantum computing’) is an unconventional type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations. It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing. Both, traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and do not follow the von Neumann architecture. They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the “minimum”. Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation.

==== Topological quantum computing ====

A topological quantum computer decomposes computation into the braiding of anyons in a 2D lattice.

==== Quantum Turing machine ====

A quantum Turing machine is the quantum analog of a Turing machine. All of these models of computation—quantum circuits, one-way quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation, and topological quantum computation—have been shown to be equivalent to the quantum Turing machine; given a perfect implementation of one such quantum computer, it can simulate all the others with no more than polynomial overhead. This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical.

====Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing====
The threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can mitigate errors, yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains &quot;a rather distant dream&quot;. According to some researchers, &quot;noisy intermediate-scale quantum&quot; (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their reliability.
Scientists at Harvard University successfully created &quot;quantum circuits&quot; that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may potentially remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers. The Harvard research team was supported by MIT, QuEra Computing, Caltech, and Princeton University and funded by DARPA&#x27;s Optimization with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices (ONISQ) program.

=== Quantum cryptography and cybersecurity ===

Quantum computing has significant potential applications in the fields of cryptography and cybersecurity. Quantum cryptography, which relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, offers the possibility of secure communication channels that are resistant to eavesdropping. Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, such as BB84, enable the secure exchange of cryptographic keys between parties, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of communication. Moreover, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can produce high-quality random numbers, which are essential for secure encryption.

However, quantum computing also poses challenges to traditional cryptographic systems. Shor&#x27;s algorithm, a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, could potentially break widely used public-key cryptography schemes like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. Post-quantum cryptography, which involves the development of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, is an active area of research aimed at addressing this concern.

Ongoing research in quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography is crucial for ensuring the security of communication and data in the face of evolving quantum computing capabilities. Advances in these fields, such as the development of new QKD protocols, the improvement of QRNGs, and the standardization of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, will play a key role in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of information in the quantum era.

== Communication ==
Quantum cryptography enables new ways to transmit data securely; for example, quantum key distribution uses entangled quantum states to establish secure cryptographic keys. When a sender and receiver exchange quantum states, they can guarantee that an adversary does not intercept the message, as any unauthorized eavesdropper would disturb the delicate quantum system and introduce a detectable change. With appropriate cryptographic protocols, the sender and receiver can thus establish shared private information resistant to eavesdropping.

Modern fiber-optic cables can transmit quantum information over relatively short distances. Ongoing experimental research aims to develop more reliable hardware (such as quantum repeaters), hoping to scale this technology to long-distance quantum networks with end-to-end entanglement. Theoretically, this could enable novel technological applications, such as distributed quantum computing and enhanced quantum sensing.

== Algorithms ==
Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist. Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.

Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include Shor&#x27;s algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, solving Pell&#x27;s equation, and more generally solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups. These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform. No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely. Certain oracle problems like Simon&#x27;s problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn&#x27;t necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.

Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations ,have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are BQP-complete. Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that &quot;no quantum algorithm&quot; gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.

Some quantum algorithms, like Grover&#x27;s algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms. Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems.

=== Simulation of quantum systems ===
Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, quantum simulation may be an important application of quantum computing. Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a collider. In June 2023, IBM computer scientists reported that a quantum computer produced better results for a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.

About 2% of the annual global energy output is used for nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia for the Haber process in the agricultural fertilizer industry (even though naturally occurring organisms also produce ammonia). Quantum simulations might be used to understand this process and increase the energy efficiency of production. It is expected that an early use of quantum computing will be modeling that improves the efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process by the mid-2020s although some have predicted it will take longer.

=== Post-quantum cryptography ===
A notable application of quantum computation is for attacks on cryptographic systems that are currently in use. Integer factorization, which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes). By comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor&#x27;s algorithm to find its factors. This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem. In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor&#x27;s algorithm. In particular, the RSA, Diffie–Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman algorithms could be broken. These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data. Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.

Identifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of &quot;post-quantum cryptography&quot;. Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor&#x27;s algorithm applies, like the McEliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory. Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem. It has been proven that applying Grover&#x27;s algorithm to break a symmetric (secret key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2&quot;n&quot;/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2&quot;n&quot; in the classical case, meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have the same security against an attack using Grover&#x27;s algorithm that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see &quot;Key size&quot;).

=== Search problems ===
The most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is &quot;unstructured search&quot;, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of formula_40 items in a database. This can be solved by Grover&#x27;s algorithm using formula_42 queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the formula_43 queries required for classical algorithms. In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover&#x27;s algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups. Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover&#x27;s algorithm, including Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp&#x27;s algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions, and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann&#x27;s algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.

Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover&#x27;s algorithm have the following properties:
#There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,
#The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and
#There exists a Boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer.

For problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover&#x27;s algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms. A general class of problems to which Grover&#x27;s algorithm can be applied is a Boolean satisfiability problem, where the &quot;database&quot; through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers. An example and possible application of this is a password cracker that attempts to guess a password. Breaking symmetric ciphers with this algorithm is of interest to government agencies.

=== Quantum annealing ===

Quantum annealing relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations. A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which slowly evolves to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question. The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process. Adiabatic optimization may be helpful for solving computational biology problems.

=== Machine learning ===
Since quantum computers can produce outputs that classical computers cannot produce efficiently, and since quantum computation is fundamentally linear algebraic, some express hope in developing quantum algorithms that can speed up machine learning tasks.

For example, the HHL Algorithm, named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is believed to provide speedup over classical counterparts. Some research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks.
Deep generative chemistry models emerge as powerful tools to expedite drug discovery. However, the immense size and complexity of the structural space of all possible drug-like molecules pose significant obstacles, which could be overcome in the future by quantum computers. Quantum computers are naturally good for solving complex quantum many-body problems and thus may be instrumental in applications involving quantum chemistry. Therefore, one can expect that quantum-enhanced generative models including quantum GANs may eventually be developed into ultimate generative chemistry algorithms.

== Engineering ==

 classical computers outperform quantum computers for all real-world applications. While current quantum computers may speed up solutions to particular mathematical problems, they give no computational advantage for practical tasks. Scientists and engineers are exploring multiple technologies for quantum computing hardware and hope to develop scalable quantum architectures, but serious obstacles remain.

=== Challenges ===

There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer. Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these requirements for a practical quantum computer:
* Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits
* Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values
* Quantum gates that are faster than decoherence time
* Universal gate set
* Qubits that can be read easily.

Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult. Superconducting quantum computers, like those constructed by Google and IBM, need helium-3, a nuclear research byproduct, and special superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.

The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution. This has led to the development of quantum controllers that enable interfacing with the qubits. Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.

==== Decoherence ====

One of the greatest challenges involved in constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere. However, other sources of decoherence also exist. Examples include the quantum gates and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits. Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided. Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time &quot;T&quot;2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the &quot;dephasing time&quot;), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperatures. Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator) in order to prevent significant decoherence. A 2020 study argues that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.

As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.

These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time; hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.

As described by the threshold theorem, if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence. This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them. An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10−3, assuming the noise is depolarizing.

Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems. However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits. The number required to factor integers using Shor&#x27;s algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between &quot;L&quot; and &quot;L&quot;2, where &quot;L&quot; is the number of binary digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of &quot;L&quot;. For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error correction. With error correction, the figure would rise to about 107 bits. Computation time is about &quot;L&quot;2 or about 107 steps and at 1MHz, about 10 seconds. However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude. Careful estimates show that at least 3million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer. In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger.

Another approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads, and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates.

=== Quantum supremacy ===

Physicist John Preskill coined the term &quot;quantum supremacy&quot; to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers. The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.

In October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the Sycamore quantum computer more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on Summit, generally considered the world&#x27;s fastest computer. This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed, and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers and even beating it.

In December 2020, a group at USTC implemented a type of Boson sampling on 76 photons with a photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, to demonstrate quantum supremacy. The authors claim that a classical contemporary supercomputer would require a computational time of 600 million years to generate the number of samples their quantum processor can generate in 20 seconds.

Claims of quantum supremacy have generated hype around quantum computing, but they are based on contrived benchmark tasks that do not directly imply useful real-world applications.

In January 2024, a study published in &quot;Physical Review Letters&quot; provided direct verification of quantum supremacy experiments by computing exact amplitudes for experimentally generated bitstrings using a new-generation Sunway supercomputer, demonstrating a significant leap in simulation capability built on a multiple-amplitude tensor network contraction algorithm. This development underscores the evolving landscape of quantum computing, highlighting both the progress and the complexities involved in validating quantum supremacy claims.

=== Skepticism ===

Despite high hopes for quantum computing, significant progress in hardware, and optimism about future applications, a 2023 Nature spotlight article summarized current quantum computers as being &quot;For now, [good for] absolutely nothing&quot;. The article elaborated that quantum computers are yet to be more useful or efficient than conventional computers in any case, though it also argued that in the long term such computers are likely to be useful. A 2023 Communications of the ACM article found that current quantum computing algorithms are &quot;insufficient for practical quantum advantage without significant improvements across the software/hardware stack&quot;. It argues that the most promising candidates for achieving speedup with quantum computers are &quot;small-data problems&quot;, for example in chemistry and materials science. However, the article also concludes that a large range of the potential applications it considered, such as machine learning, &quot;will not achieve quantum advantage with current quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future&quot;, and it identified I/O constraints that make speedup unlikely for &quot;big data problems, unstructured linear systems, and database search based on Grover&#x27;s algorithm&quot;.

This state of affairs can be traced to several current and long-term considerations.

* Conventional computer hardware and algorithms are not only optimized for practical tasks, but are still improving rapidly, particularly GPU accelerators. 
* Current quantum computing hardware generates only a limited amount of entanglement before getting overwhelmed by noise.
* Quantum algorithms provide speedup over conventional algorithms only for some tasks, and matching these tasks with practical applications proved challenging. Some promising tasks and applications require resources far beyond those available today. In particular, processing large amounts of non-quantum data is a challenge for quantum computers.
* Some promising algorithms have been &quot;dequantized&quot;, i.e., their non-quantum analogues with similar complexity have been found.
* If quantum error correction is used to scale quantum computers to practical applications, its overhead may undermine speedup offered by many quantum algorithms.
* Complexity analysis of algorithms sometimes makes abstract assumptions that do not hold in applications. For example, input data may not already be available encoded in quantum states, and &quot;oracle functions&quot; used in Grover&#x27;s algorithm often have internal structure that can be exploited for faster algorithms.

In particular, building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain sufficiently high degree of entanglement for a long time. When trying to outperform conventional computers, quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers, but this leaves the possibility that efficient non-quantum techniques will be developed in response, as seen for Quantum supremacy demonstrations. Therefore, it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible non-quantum algorithms (which may be unknown) and show that some quantum algorithms asymptomatically improve upon those bounds.

Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum computers could ever be built, typically because of the issue of maintaining coherence at large scales, but also for other reasons.

Bill Unruh doubted the practicality of quantum computers in a paper published in 1994. Paul Davies argued that a 400-qubit computer would even come into conflict with the cosmological information bound implied by the holographic principle. Skeptics like Gil Kalai doubt that quantum supremacy will ever be achieved. Physicist Mikhail Dyakonov has expressed skepticism of quantum computing as follows:
:&quot;So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment must be... about 10300... Could we ever learn to control the more than 10300 continuously variable parameters defining the quantum state of such a system? My answer is simple. &quot;No, never.&quot;&quot;

=== Physical realizations ===


A practical quantum computer must use a physical system as a programmable quantum register. Researchers are exploring several technologies as candidates for reliable qubit implementations. Superconductors and trapped ions are some of the most developed proposals, but experimentalists are considering other hardware possibilities as well. 
For example, topological quantum computer approaches are being explored for more fault-tolerance computing systems.

The first quantum logic gates were implemented with trapped ions and prototype general purpose machines with up to 20 qubits have been realized. However, the technology behind these devices combines complex vacuum equipment, lasers, microwave and radio frequency equipment making full scale processors difficult to integrate with standard computing equipment. Moreover, the trapped ion system itself has engineering challenges to overcome.

The largest commercial systems are based on superconductor devices and have scaled to 2000 qubits. However, the error rates for larger machines have been on the order of 5%. Technologically these devices are all cryogenic and scaling to large numbers of qubits requires wafer-scale integration, a serious engineering challenge by itself.

== Potential applications ==

With focus on business management&#x27;s point of view, the potential applications of quantum computing into four major categories are cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation, and data management and searching.

Investment in quantum computing research has increased in the public and private sectors.

=== Computability ===
Any computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer. Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics, which underlies the operation of quantum computers.

Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer. It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time. More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a Turing machine. In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of computability. This means that quantum computers cannot solve undecidable problems like the halting problem, and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the Church–Turing thesis.

=== Complexity ===

While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently factor integers, while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.
The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called BQP, for &quot;bounded error, quantum, polynomial time&quot;. More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine with an error probability of at most 1/3. As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to BPP (&quot;bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time&quot;), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machines with bounded error. It is known that formula_44 and is widely suspected that formula_45, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.

The exact relationship of BQP to P, NP, and PSPACE is not known. However, it is known that formula_46; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources. It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers. For instance, integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P. On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example). It is suspected that formula_47; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer. As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of NP-complete problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from NP-hardness that all problems in NP are in BQP).

<text>In mathematics, especially in abstract algebra, a quasigroup is an algebraic structure that resembles a group in the sense that &quot;division&quot; is always possible. Quasigroups differ from groups mainly in that the associative and identity element properties are optional. In fact, a nonempty associative quasigroup is a group.

A quasigroup that has an identity element is called a loop.

== Definitions ==
There are at least two structurally equivalent formal definitions of quasigroup:
* One defines a quasigroup as a set with one binary operation.
* The other, from universal algebra, defines a quasigroup as having three primitive operations.

The homomorphic image of a quasigroup that is defined with a single binary operation, however, need not be a quasigroup, in contrast to a quasigroup as having three primitive operations. We begin with the first definition.

=== Algebra ===
A quasigroup is a non-empty set with a binary operation (that is, a magma, indicating that a quasigroup has to satisfy the closure property), obeying the Latin square property. This states that, for each and in , there exist unique elements and in such that both
formula_1
formula_2 
hold. (In other words: Each element of the set occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column of the quasigroup&#x27;s multiplication table, or Cayley table. This property ensures that the Cayley table of a finite quasigroup, and, in particular, a finite group, is a Latin square.) The requirement that and be unique can be replaced by the requirement that the magma be cancellative.

The unique solutions to these equations are written and . The operations &quot; and &quot; are called, respectively, left division and right division. With regard to the Cayley table, the first equation (left division) means that the entry in the row is in the column while the second equation (right division) means that the entry in the column is in the row.

The empty set equipped with the empty binary operation satisfies this definition of a quasigroup. Some authors accept the empty quasigroup but others explicitly exclude it.

=== Universal algebra ===
Given some algebraic structure, an identity is an equation in which all variables are tacitly universally quantified, and in which all operations are among the primitive operations proper to the structure. Algebraic structures that satisfy axioms that are given solely by identities are called a variety. Many standard results in universal algebra hold only for varieties. Quasigroups form a variety if left and right division are taken as primitive.

A right-quasigroup is a type algebra that satisfy both identities:
formula_3
formula_4

A left-quasigroup is a type algebra that satisfy both identities:
formula_5
formula_6

A quasigroup is a type algebra (i.e., equipped with three binary operations) that satisfy the identities:
formula_3
formula_4
formula_5
formula_6

In other words: Multiplication and division in either order, one after the other, on the same side by the same element, have no net effect.

Hence if is a quasigroup according to the definition of the previous section, then is the same quasigroup in the sense of universal algebra. And vice versa: if is a quasigroup according to the sense of universal algebra, then is a quasigroup according to the first definition.

== Loops ==
A loop is a quasigroup with an identity element; that is, an element, &quot;e&quot;, such that
: &quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;e&quot; = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;e&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;.

It follows that the identity element, &quot;e&quot;, is unique, and that every element of &quot;Q&quot; has unique left and right inverses (which need not be the same).

A quasigroup with an idempotent element is called a pique (&quot;pointed idempotent quasigroup&quot;); this is a weaker notion than a loop but common nonetheless because, for example, given an abelian group, , taking its subtraction operation as quasigroup multiplication yields a pique with the group identity (zero) turned into a &quot;pointed idempotent&quot;. (That is, there is a principal isotopy .)

A loop that is associative is a group. A group can have a strictly nonassociative pique isotope, but it cannot have a strictly nonassociative loop isotope.

There are weaker associativity properties that have been given special names.

For instance, a Bol loop is a loop that satisfies either:
: &quot;x&quot; ∗ (&quot;y&quot; ∗ (&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;z&quot;)) = (&quot;x&quot; ∗ (&quot;y&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;)) ∗ &quot;z&quot; for each &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; in &quot;Q&quot; (a &quot;left Bol loop&quot;),
or else
: ((&quot;z&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;) ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ &quot;x&quot; = &quot;z&quot; ∗ ((&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ &quot;x&quot;) for each &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; in &quot;Q&quot; (a &quot;right Bol loop&quot;).

A loop that is both a left and right Bol loop is a Moufang loop. This is equivalent to any one of the following single Moufang identities holding for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;:
: &quot;x&quot; ∗ (&quot;y&quot; ∗ (&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;z&quot;)) = ((&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ &quot;x&quot;) ∗ &quot;z&quot;
: &quot;z&quot; ∗ (&quot;x&quot; ∗ (&quot;y&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;)) = ((&quot;z&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;) ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ &quot;x&quot;
: (&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ (&quot;z&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; ∗ ((&quot;y&quot; ∗ &quot;z&quot;) ∗ &quot;x&quot;)
: (&quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ (&quot;z&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; ∗ (&quot;y&quot; ∗ &quot;z&quot;)) ∗ &quot;x&quot;.

According to Jonathan D. H. Smith, &quot;loops&quot; were named after the Chicago Loop, as their originators were studying quasigroups in Chicago at the time.

== Symmetries ==
 names the following important properties and subclasses:

=== Semisymmetry ===
A quasigroup is semisymmetric if any of the following equivalent identities hold for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;:
: 
: 

Although this class may seem special, every quasigroup &quot;Q&quot; induces a semisymmetric quasigroup &quot;Q&quot;Δ on the direct product cube &quot;Q&quot;3 via the following operation:
where &quot; and &quot; are the conjugate division operations given by and .

=== Triality ===

A quasigroup may exhibit semisymmetric triality.

=== Total symmetry ===
A narrower class is a totally symmetric quasigroup (sometimes abbreviated TS-quasigroup) in which all conjugates coincide as one operation: . Another way to define (the same notion of) totally symmetric quasigroup is as a semisymmetric quasigroup that is commutative, i.e. .

Idempotent total symmetric quasigroups are precisely (i.e. in a bijection with) Steiner triples, so such a quasigroup is also called a Steiner quasigroup, and sometimes the latter is even abbreviated as squag. The term sloop refers to an analogue for loops, namely, totally symmetric loops that satisfy instead of . Without idempotency, total symmetric quasigroups correspond to the geometric notion of extended Steiner triple, also called Generalized Elliptic Cubic Curve (GECC).

=== Total antisymmetry ===
A quasigroup is called weakly totally anti-symmetric if for all , the following implication holds.
: (&quot;c&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot;) ∗ &quot;y&quot; = (&quot;c&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot;) ∗ &quot;x&quot; implies that &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;.

A quasigroup is called totally anti-symmetric if, in addition, for all , the following implication holds:
: &quot;x&quot; ∗ &quot;y&quot; = &quot;y&quot; ∗ &quot;x&quot; implies that &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;.

This property is required, for example, in the Damm algorithm.

== Examples ==
* Every group is a loop, because if and only if , and if and only if .
* The integers Z (or the rationals Q or the reals R) with subtraction (−) form a quasigroup. These quasigroups are not loops because there is no identity element (0 is a right identity because , but not a left identity because, in general, ).
* The nonzero rationals Q× (or the nonzero reals R×) with division (÷) form a quasigroup.
* Any vector space over a field of characteristic not equal to 2 forms an idempotent, commutative quasigroup under the operation .
* Every Steiner triple system defines an idempotent, commutative quasigroup: is the third element of the triple containing &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. These quasigroups also satisfy for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in the quasigroup. These quasigroups are known as &quot;Steiner quasigroups&quot;.
* The set where and with all other products as in the quaternion group forms a nonassociative loop of order 8. See hyperbolic quaternions for its application. (The hyperbolic quaternions themselves do &quot;not&quot; form a loop or quasigroup.)
* The nonzero octonions form a nonassociative loop under multiplication. The octonions are a special type of loop known as a Moufang loop.
* An associative quasigroup is either empty or is a group, since if there is at least one element, the invertibility of the quasigroup binary operation combined with associativity implies the existence of an identity element, which then implies the existence of inverse elements, thus satisfying all three requirements of a group.
* The following construction is due to Hans Zassenhaus. On the underlying set of the four-dimensional vector space F4 over the 3-element Galois field define
*: (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3, &quot;x&quot;4) ∗ (&quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;3, &quot;y&quot;4) = (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, &quot;x&quot;3, &quot;x&quot;4) + (&quot;y&quot;1, &quot;y&quot;2, &quot;y&quot;3, &quot;y&quot;4) + (0, 0, 0, (&quot;x&quot;3 − &quot;y&quot;3)(&quot;x&quot;1&quot;y&quot;2 − &quot;x&quot;2&quot;y&quot;1)).
: Then, is a commutative Moufang loop that is not a group.
* More generally, the nonzero elements of any division algebra form a quasigroup with the operation of multiplication in the algebra.

== Properties ==

Quasigroups have the cancellation property: if , then . This follows from the uniqueness of left division of &quot;ab&quot; or &quot;ac&quot; by &quot;a&quot;. Similarly, if , then .

The Latin square property of quasigroups implies that, given any two of the three variables in , the third variable is uniquely determined.

=== Multiplication operators ===
The definition of a quasigroup can be treated as conditions on the left and right multiplication operators , defined by 
: &quot;L&quot;&quot;x&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;xy&quot;
: &quot;R&quot;&quot;x&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;yx&quot;

The definition says that both mappings are bijections from &quot;Q&quot; to itself. A magma &quot;Q&quot; is a quasigroup precisely when all these operators, for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;, are bijective. The inverse mappings are left and right division, that is, 
: 

In this notation the identities among the quasigroup&#x27;s multiplication and division operations (stated in the section on universal algebra) are
: 
: 
where denotes the identity mapping on &quot;Q&quot;.

=== Latin squares ===
The multiplication table of a finite quasigroup is a Latin square: an table filled with &quot;n&quot; different symbols in such a way that each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.

Conversely, every Latin square can be taken as the multiplication table of a quasigroup in many ways: the border row (containing the column headers) and the border column (containing the row headers) can each be any permutation of the elements. See &quot;Small Latin squares and quasigroups&quot;.

==== Infinite quasigroups ====
For a countably infinite quasigroup &quot;Q&quot;, it is possible to imagine an infinite array in which every row and every column corresponds to some element &quot;q&quot; of &quot;Q&quot;, and where the element is in the row corresponding to &quot;a&quot; and the column responding to &quot;b&quot;. In this situation too, the Latin square property says that each row and each column of the infinite array will contain every possible value precisely once.

For an uncountably infinite quasigroup, such as the group of non-zero real numbers under multiplication, the Latin square property still holds, although the name is somewhat unsatisfactory, as it is not possible to produce the array of combinations to which the above idea of an infinite array extends since the real numbers cannot all be written in a sequence. (This is somewhat misleading however, as the reals can be written in a sequence of length , assuming the well-ordering theorem.)

=== Inverse properties ===
The binary operation of a quasigroup is invertible in the sense that both &quot;L&quot;&quot;x&quot; and &quot;R&quot;&quot;x&quot;, the left and right multiplication operators, are bijective, and hence invertible.

Every loop element has a unique left and right inverse given by
: 

A loop is said to have (&quot;two-sided&quot;) &quot;inverses&quot; if for all &quot;x&quot;. In this case the inverse element is usually denoted by −1.

There are some stronger notions of inverses in loops that are often useful:
* A loop has the &quot;left inverse property&quot; if for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Equivalently, or .
* A loop has the &quot;right inverse property&quot; if for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Equivalently, or .
* A loop has the &quot;antiautomorphic inverse property&quot; if or, equivalently, if .
* A loop has the &quot;weak inverse property&quot; when if and only if . This may be stated in terms of inverses via or equivalently .

A loop has the &quot;inverse property&quot; if it has both the left and right inverse properties. Inverse property loops also have the antiautomorphic and weak inverse properties. In fact, any loop that satisfies any two of the above four identities has the inverse property and therefore satisfies all four.

Any loop that satisfies the left, right, or antiautomorphic inverse properties automatically has two-sided inverses.

== Morphisms ==
A quasigroup or loop homomorphism is a map between two quasigroups such that . Quasigroup homomorphisms necessarily preserve left and right division, as well as identity elements (if they exist).

=== Homotopy and isotopy ===

Let &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;P&quot; be quasigroups. A quasigroup homotopy from &quot;Q&quot; to &quot;P&quot; is a triple of maps from &quot;Q&quot; to &quot;P&quot; such that
: &quot;α&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;β&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;)
for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;. A quasigroup homomorphism is just a homotopy for which the three maps are equal.

An isotopy is a homotopy for which each of the three maps is a bijection. Two quasigroups are isotopic if there is an isotopy between them. In terms of Latin squares, an isotopy is given by a permutation of rows &quot;α&quot;, a permutation of columns &quot;β&quot;, and a permutation on the underlying element set &quot;γ&quot;.

An autotopy is an isotopy from a quasigroup to itself. The set of all autotopies of a quasigroup forms a group with the automorphism group as a subgroup.

Every quasigroup is isotopic to a loop. If a loop is isotopic to a group, then it is isomorphic to that group and thus is itself a group. However, a quasigroup that is isotopic to a group need not be a group. For example, the quasigroup on R with multiplication given by is isotopic to the additive group , but is not itself a group as it has no identity element. Every medial quasigroup is isotopic to an abelian group by the Bruck–Toyoda theorem.

=== Conjugation (parastrophe) ===
Left and right division are examples of forming a quasigroup by permuting the variables in the defining equation. From the original operation ∗ (i.e., ) we can form five new operations: (the opposite operation), and , and their opposites. That makes a total of six quasigroup operations, which are called the conjugates or parastrophes of ∗. Any two of these operations are said to be &quot;conjugate&quot; or &quot;parastrophic&quot; to each other (and to themselves).

=== Isostrophe (paratopy) ===
If the set &quot;Q&quot; has two quasigroup operations, ∗ and ·, and one of them is isotopic to a conjugate of the other, the operations are said to be isostrophic to each other. There are also many other names for this relation of &quot;isostrophe&quot;, e.g., paratopy.

== Generalizations ==
=== Polyadic or multiary quasigroups ===

An &quot;n&quot;-ary quasigroup is a set with an &quot;n&quot;-ary operation, with , such that the equation has a unique solution for any one variable if all the other &quot;n&quot; variables are specified arbitrarily. Polyadic or multiary means &quot;n&quot;-ary for some nonnegative integer &quot;n&quot;.

A 0-ary, or nullary, quasigroup is just a constant element of &quot;Q&quot;. A 1-ary, or unary, quasigroup is a bijection of &quot;Q&quot; to itself. A binary, or 2-ary, quasigroup is an ordinary quasigroup.

An example of a multiary quasigroup is an iterated group operation, ; it is not necessary to use parentheses to specify the order of operations because the group is associative. One can also form a multiary quasigroup by carrying out any sequence of the same or different group or quasigroup operations, if the order of operations is specified.

There exist multiary quasigroups that cannot be represented in any of these ways. An &quot;n&quot;-ary quasigroup is irreducible if its operation cannot be factored into the composition of two operations in the following way:
: &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;−1, &quot;h&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;), &quot;x&quot;&quot;j&quot;+1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;),
where and . Finite irreducible &quot;n&quot;-ary quasigroups exist for all ; see for details.

An &quot;n&quot;-ary quasigroup with an &quot;n&quot;-ary version of associativity is called an &quot;n&quot;-ary group.

<text>A quaestor ( , ; ; &quot;investigator&quot;) was a public official in ancient Rome. There were various types of quaestors, with the title used to describe greatly different offices at different times.

In the Roman Republic, quaestors were elected officials who supervised the state treasury and conducted audits. When assigned to provincial governors, the duties were mainly administrative and logistical, but also could expand to encompass military leadership and command. It was the lowest ranking position in the &quot; (course of offices); by the first century BC, one had to have been quaestor to be eligible for any other posts.

In the Roman Empire, the position initially remained as assistants to the magistrates with financial duties in the provinces, but over time, it faded away in the face of the expanding imperial bureaucracy. A position with a similar name (the &quot;) emerged during the Constantinian period with judicial responsibilities.

==Etymology==
&quot;Quaestor&quot; derives from the Latin verb &#x27;, &#x27;, meaning &quot;to inquire&quot; (probably ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root of interrogative pronouns &quot;*kʷo-&quot;). The job title has traditionally been understood as deriving from the original investigative function of the &quot;&quot;.

== Under the kings ==

The earliest quaestors were &quot;&quot;, chosen to investigate capital crimes, and may have been appointed as needed rather than holding a permanent position. Under the Republic, these &quot;quaestores parricidii&quot; persisted, as prosecutors for capital cases in trials before the people. They disappear, however, by the second century BC.

Ancient authors disagree on the exact manner of selection for this office as well as on its chronology, with some dating it to the mythical reign of Romulus. This view, however, is &quot;not at all credible&quot; and there is no clear evidence for a specific date for the quaestorship&#x27;s beginning.

== During the Republic ==

The classical quaestors with financial responsibilities may be unconnected with the older &quot;questores parricidii&quot;. However, the debate still continues, but has more recently trended against connecting the two offices, which are connected by nothing other than a name. The two general theses are that the classical quaestorship related with financial matters either was created entirely separately from the older judicial quaestorship or that it evolved from that older quaestorship to meet greater administrative needs.

The traditional &quot;cursus honorum&quot; (career path) was loosely regulated, but after 197 BC, became more so, with a basic progression that one first had to hold the quaestorship before being considered for higher office as praetor or consul, with quaestor as the lowest office. After Sulla&#x27;s reforms, the &quot;cursus honorum&quot; was cemented, with the added requirement that to stand for the quaestorship, one first needed to have been one of the vigintiviri and have held the military tribunate. The reforms also established that the minimum age for candidates had to be 30.

Quaestors were elected last in the electoral comitia, as they were of the lowest rank. During the late Republic, however, their terms of office started before their more senior colleagues, on 5 December rather than 1 January. This was the earliest term start of the major magistracies of the Republic, being earlier than that of the tribunes of the plebs (who came into office on 10 December).

=== Responsibilities ===

After election, they were assigned – usually by lot on their first day in office – to their tasks. Very rarely were quaestors directly assigned to a specific task without lot (i.e., &quot;extra sortem&quot;), likely with the approval of the senate to a magistrate&#x27;s request. Some quaestors were assigned to specific tasks (the management of the treasury or of the grain supply in Ostia), but most were assigned to assist a higher magistrate.

Those assigned to the treasury were supervised by the Senate (usually with the consuls as intermediaries), while those assigned to a higher magistrate were supervised by their superior. Quaestors could be dismissed by their superiors, but this appears rare; there is only one known case thereof, when then-proconsul Marcus Aurelius Cotta dismissed his quaestor Publius Oppius in 73 BC.

In the early Republic, one quaestor was attached to each consul, both when the consul was in Rome for civic duties and on military campaign. By 227 BC, every magistrate with &quot;imperium&quot; (consuls and praetors) left the city accompanied by a quaestor. This close cooperation led these provincial quaestors to take a more active role in assisting their superiors with military – even assuming command at times – and administrative tasks. The expanding use of prorogation also affected quaestors, who were regularly prorogued with their superiors &quot;pro quaestore&quot;; more frustratingly, ancient sources did not always differentiate between quaestors and their proquaestorian counterparts, regularly calling both quaestors.

Quaestors in the provinces generally remained in the same province as their superiors for the duration of the superior&#x27;s term, but this was not obligatory, as the quaestorian careers of Gaius Gracchus, Julius Caesar, and the rotating names of quaestors serving under Gaius Verres attest. Terms in the provinces usually lasted one or two years. Quaestors acted militarily solely under the auspices and &quot;imperium&quot; of their commanders, except under exceptional circumstances such as the death of that commander.

The relationship between a governor and his quaestor was similar to that between a patron and a client, but was entirely official. While in office together, a quaestor was expected to show &quot;reverence, courtesy, and loyalty&quot; to his governor; the governor was likewise obliged to respect his subordinates. This relationship often continued past the designated terms of either individual, and the quaestor could be called upon for assistance or other needs by the consul. Also related were the need to maintain a working relationship to avoid tensions that could endanger the province, as well as a &quot;certain degree of complicity [needed...] to conceal anything that could compromise the magistrates&#x27; reputations&quot;.

==== Domestic duties ====

There were usually two quaestors assigned to the city of Rome (termed urban quaestors), with both simultaneously responsible for the treasury. While some older scholars believed that the urban quaestors were forbidden from leaving the city, this is now rejected.

The normal main duty of the urban quaestors was to handle the &quot;aerarium&quot; (the public treasury). This involved control and management of the gold and coins stored there, safekeeping of the keys to the treasury, supervision of all public expenses and tax receipts, validation of official documents, and archival of the same. The quaestors were aided by assistants called &quot;apparitores&quot;, who likely served multi-year terms to familiarise themselves with the job; their number multiplied during the later Republic to meet administrative needs. As part of administering the treasury, they also handled the receipt and auditing of war reparations and tribute from polities defeated by Rome. Collections of taxes were also handled by the urban quaestors and their staff, with overpayments reimbursed when funds became available. They also made the appropriate withdrawals from the treasury to cover various expenses – including building, army pay, temple maintenance, state visits, state funerals, road maintenance, minting of coins, etc – as directed by the Senate.

They were also in charge of auctions for public land (&quot;ager publicus&quot;). Such land was acquired by conquest and became the property of the Roman people. Land sales could be directed by the Senate to meet funding shortfalls, as during the Second Punic War, when the urban quaestors auctioned lands around Capua to raise funds. These quaestors were also responsible for handling public auction of war booty returned to the public treasury by victorious generals. This included objects as well as slaves, with the proceeds to be deposited in the public treasury. They were also responsible for public auction of property seized from citizens who had debts or fines owed to the state if they were unable to pay. These responsibilities over public debts also included the collection of fines in general, where a convict ordered to pay a fine would be required to make a surety to the urban quaestors and deposit the money in the &quot;aerarium&quot;.

Returning magistrates and governors also had to produce detailed account books for their handling of public money, which would then be deposited in the treasury, where the urban quaestors and their staff would audit them. These records were supposed to total a running ledger of starting balances, a line-by-line itemised accounting of all inflows and outflows, and ending balances for the province. They also included, for generals, detailed lists of all the money, gold, silver, spoils, and other assets acquired during a governorship. The scribes checked the account books, looking for transactional documentation and arithmetic errors, the results were then approved or disapproved by the quaestors. A negative audit could provide fodder for corruption charges, which was regular in the last two centuries of the Republic.

After the formation of the permanent courts (), the urban quaestors were also responsible for assembling the jury pools and allocation of portions of those pools to the various courts. These quaestors also handled various tasks assigned ad hoc by the Senate, such as meeting and accompanying foreign dignitaries on state visits or leaving Rome to the provinces on special assignments.

In earlier Republic, the quaestors also controlled the distribution of the legionary &quot;aquilae&quot; (eagle standards), which were kept in the treasury before distribution to generals before they were returned on the conclusion of a campaign. This likely, however, fell into disuse as Rome expanded across the Mediterranean.

==== Provincial administration ====
Because consuls, praetors, and their promagisterial counterparts were &quot;practically... plenipotentiary agent[s] upon [which all] aspect[s] of government associated with that &quot;provincia&quot; depended&quot;, the quaestor&#x27;s responsibilities could vary widely, including not only financial and administrative matters but also sometimes encompassing military command and judicial functions. In general, however, the core administrative duty of the quaestor was to &quot;[extract] whatever material assets the Roman military apparatus might need&quot;. When quaestors were sometimes assigned to a province alone (without attachment to a superior) in the late republic, quaestorian responsibilities increased dramatically as the only Roman magistrate present. At times, quaestors were sent without superiors to peaceful acquisitions to inventory property, auction them if necessary, and transport proceeds to Rome.

During normal times under a governor, the quaestor would handle administrative tasks related to supply of the armies. He would oversee the transport of public money assigned by the Senate to the province, record its uses, and use it to pay soldiers&#x27; wages or purchase supplies. He also helped manage the taxation of the province in terms of collecting food, supplies, and money from local leaders. In terms of taxation, quaestors also handled the local auction of raw goods to public contractors (&quot;publicani&quot;) or merchants; at times, they also made requisitions from local provincials on orders of their superior or at times on their own accord. This remit also extended to minting coinage – usually to pay soldiers serving in the provinces – from precious metal stocks on hand.

The provincial quaestor also had to carefully record all the money that fell into the provincial government&#x27;s hands. Other assets acquired by conquest or otherwise classed as war spoils – from gold to grain, arms, and ships – also had to be inventoried, recorded, and deposited in the public treasury at Rome. Captives captured in war were usually sold into slavery in that province, which was managed by the quaestor for funds also to be noted in the account books. They also were expected to register those provincial records in Rome upon conclusion of their terms for review by the urban quaestors, which were supposed to record all movements of funds. Loss of those records could give rise to damaging charges of corruption. After Julius Caesar&#x27;s &quot;lex Julia&quot;, these records had to be made in triplicate, with two copies lodged in provincial cities (not always the same cities from governor to governor) and the remaining copy returned to Rome for presentation. Then, at least according to custom, both the quaestor and the governor would return to Rome to present the provincial accounts. Upon the close of the term, the quaestor would coordinate to divide the remaining money between the incoming provincial administration and the treasury in Rome.

These great responsibilities with little immediate oversight gave both provincial quaestors and their governors many opportunities for corruption by misappropriating funds, demanding exorbitant taxes, getting involved in various business schemes, or taking bribes outright. Quaestors&#x27; behaviour did not always comport with their administrative and legal responsibilities.

==== On campaign ====

On campaign, provincial quaestors acted as subordinate military officers to their attached superior, taking a role &quot;analogous to... that [of] other members of the governor&#x27;s entourage, such as his legates&quot;. At times, the quaestor could get into tension with the governor&#x27;s legates over respective spheres of responsibility or accountability; officially, however, the quaestor was &quot;higher up the chain of command... [as], besides the governor, he was the only magistrate [and] representative of the Senate and the Roman people&quot;, giving him &quot;greater authority than legates in all areas of provincial command&quot;.

Quaestors are documented at various times leading and raising troops and fleets under the command of their governors. Some quaestors were delegated significant open-ended responsibilities far exceeding administrative tasks: Lucullus, for example, during the First Mithridatic War as Sulla&#x27;s proquaestor, led troops, assembled fleets, travelled the eastern Mediterranean as a diplomat, intervened to overthrow governments, commanded naval battles, captured prisoners, and levied taxes and indemnities.

When a governor left the province, he normally left it to his quaestor&#x27;s command (though this was at times given instead to one of his high-ranking legates). If a governor died, however, the quaestor generally assumed command of the forces until replacement, possibly with &quot;imperium pro praetore&quot;. The specifics of how this &quot;imperium&quot; was delegated after the death of its actual possessor are unclear: some scholars believe that this was automatic, whereas others believed that a proconsul had to first endow his quaestor with propraetorian &quot;imperium&quot;.

A provincial quaestor also could be sent as a diplomatic representative. Two famous examples thereof are those of Tiberius Gracchus and Sulla: Gracchus negotiated a peace treaty on behalf of his proconsul allowing some twenty thousand soldiers to leave with their lives (though the treaty was later invalidated by the Senate) and Sulla negotiated the capture of Jugurtha at the end of the Jugurthine War.

=== History ===

There were initially two quaestors; they were initially appointed by the consuls, but according to Tacitus after 447 BC, they were elected by the &quot;comitia tributa&quot;. When plebeians were permitted to stand for the quaestorship in 421 BC, two more were added, with assignments to administer the &quot;aerarium&quot; under senatorial direction. It is also around this time that Livy reports a relationship between the quaestors and the public treasury. After 267 BC, four more quaestors were added, possibly with assignments to various towns in Italy (e.g., Ostia for management of the food supply).

The specific number elected year-to-year is difficult to determine at any time, but before Lucius Cornelius Sulla&#x27;s reforms in 81 BC, there were 19 quaestors; his reforms created one for the water supply, raising the total to 20. He also made holding the quaestorship compulsory for advancement to future offices. These reforms also established a minimum age for the office, established at 30. Additionally, the reforms granted quaestors automatic membership in the senate upon being elected, whereas previously, membership in the senate was granted only after censors revised the Senate rolls every few years.

During Julius Caesar&#x27;s dictatorship, he doubled the number of quaestors to forty.

== During the empire ==

=== Principate ===
During the Principate, the number was halved back to twenty by Augustus. He also removed the quaestors from government of the &quot;aerarium&quot; (with a short interlude under Claudius when this was reversed). The emperor and the two consuls each had two quaestors, with the emperor selecting his own, the &quot;quaestores Caesaris&quot;, who were often up-and-coming men from noble families.

Over time, the former duties of the quaestors were subsumed by imperial officials, but, in the senatorial provinces, they &quot;retained some financial functions through the Principate&quot;.

=== Late empire ===

During the reign of the Emperor Constantine I, a new quaestorship was established, called the &quot;quaestor sacri palatii&quot; (). The office functioned as a spokesman for the emperor and was charged with the creation of laws and management of legal petitions, serving as de facto minister of justice. The formal judicial powers of the office were slim, but, as chief legal advisor to the emperor, holders gained substantial influence. Various famous lawyers held this quaestorship, including Antiochus Chuzon and Tribonian, who contributed greatly to the production of the Theodosian Code and Code of Justinian, respectively.

From 440 onward, the office of the quaestor worked in conjunction with the praetorian prefect of the East to oversee the supreme tribunal, or supreme court, at Constantinople. There, they heard appeals from the various subordinate courts and governors.

===Byzantine empire===

Emperor Justinian I also created the offices &#x27;, a judicial and police official for Constantinople, and &#x27; (quaestor of the army), a short-lived joint military-administrative post covering the border of the lower Danube. The &#x27; survived long into the Byzantine Empire, although its duties were altered to match the &#x27; by the 9th century AD, who was a judicial officer in charge of resolving various disputes.

The office survived into the 14th century as a purely honorific title.

<text>Q.E.D. or QED is an initialism of the Latin phrase , meaning &quot;that which was to be demonstrated&quot;. Literally, it states &quot;what was to be shown&quot;. Traditionally, the abbreviation is placed at the end of mathematical proofs and philosophical arguments in print publications, to indicate that the proof or the argument is complete.

== Etymology and early use ==
The phrase &quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot; is a translation into Latin from the Greek (; abbreviated as &quot;ΟΕΔ&quot;). The meaning of the Latin phrase is &quot;that [thing] which was to be demonstrated&quot; (with &quot;demonstrandum&quot; in the gerundive). However, translating the Greek phrase can produce a slightly different meaning. In particular, since the verb means both &quot;to show&quot; or &quot;to prove&quot;, a different translation from the Greek phrase would read &quot;The very thing it was required to have shown.&quot;

The Greek phrase was used by many early Greek mathematicians, including Euclid and Archimedes.

The Latin phrase is attested in a 1501 Euclid translation of Giorgio Valla. Its abbreviation &quot;q.e.d.&quot; is used once in 1598 by Johannes Praetorius, more in 1643 by Anton Deusing, extensively in 1655 by Isaac Barrow in the form &quot;Q.E.D.&quot;, and subsequently by many post-Renaissance mathematicians and philosophers.

== Modern philosophy ==
During the European Renaissance, scholars often wrote in Latin, and phrases such as &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; were often used to conclude proofs.
Perhaps the most famous use of &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; in a philosophical argument is found in the &quot;Ethics&quot; of Baruch Spinoza, published posthumously in 1677. Written in Latin, it is considered by many to be Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;. The style and system of the book are, as Spinoza says, &quot;demonstrated in geometrical order&quot;, with axioms and definitions followed by propositions. For Spinoza, this is a considerable improvement over René Descartes&#x27;s writing style in the &quot;Meditations&quot;, which follows the form of a diary.

== Difference from Q.E.F. ==
There is another Latin phrase with a slightly different meaning, usually shortened similarly, but being less common in use. , originating from the Greek geometers&#x27; closing (), meaning &quot;which had to be done&quot;. Because of the difference in meaning, the two phrases should not be confused.

Euclid used the Greek original of Quod Erat Faciendum (Q.E.F.) to close propositions that were not proofs of theorems, but constructions of geometric objects. For example, Euclid&#x27;s first proposition showing how to construct an equilateral triangle, given one side, is concluded this way.

== Equivalent forms ==

There is no common formal English equivalent, although the end of a proof may be announced with a simple statement such as &quot;thus it is proved&quot;, &quot;this completes the proof&quot;, &quot;as required&quot;, &quot;as desired&quot;, &quot;as expected&quot;, &quot;hence proved&quot;, &quot;ergo&quot;, &quot;so correct&quot;, or other similar phrases.

== Typographical forms used symbolically ==

Due to the paramount importance of proofs in mathematics, mathematicians since the time of Euclid have developed conventions to demarcate the beginning and end of proofs. In printed English language texts, the formal statements of theorems, lemmas, and propositions are set in italics by tradition. The beginning of a proof usually follows immediately thereafter, and is indicated by the word &quot;proof&quot; in boldface or italics. On the other hand, several symbolic conventions exist to indicate the end of a proof.

While some authors still use the classical abbreviation, Q.E.D., it is relatively uncommon in modern mathematical texts. Paul Halmos claims to have pioneered the use of a solid black square (or rectangle) at the end of a proof as a Q.E.D. symbol, a practice which has become standard, although not universal. Halmos noted that he adopted this use of a symbol from magazine typography customs in which simple geometric shapes had been used to indicate the end of an article, so-called &quot;&quot;. This symbol was later called the &quot;tombstone&quot;, the &quot;Halmos symbol&quot;, or even a &quot;halmos&quot; by mathematicians. Often the Halmos symbol is drawn on chalkboard to signal the end of a proof during a lecture, although this practice is not so common as its use in printed text.

The tombstone symbol appears in TeX as the character formula_1 (filled square, \blacksquare) and sometimes, as a formula_2 (hollow square, \square or \Box). In the AMS Theorem Environment for LaTeX, the hollow square is the default end-of-proof symbol. Unicode explicitly provides the &quot;end of proof&quot; character, U+220E (∎). Some authors use other Unicode symbols to note the end of a proof, including, ▮ (U+25AE, a black vertical rectangle), and ‣ (U+2023, a triangular bullet). Other authors have adopted two forward slashes (//, formula_3) or four forward slashes (////, formula_4). In other cases, authors have elected to segregate proofs typographically—by displaying them as indented blocks.

== Modern &quot;humorous&quot; use ==
In Joseph Heller&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;, the Chaplain, having been told to examine a forged letter allegedly signed by him (which he knew he didn&#x27;t sign), verified that his &quot;name&quot; was in fact there. His investigator replied, &quot;Then you wrote it. Q.E.D.&quot; The chaplain said he did not write it and that it was not his handwriting, to which the investigator replied, &quot;Then you signed your name in somebody else&#x27;s handwriting again.&quot;

<text>The quagga ( or ) (Equus quagga quagga) is an extinct subspecies of the plains zebra that was endemic to South Africa until it was hunted to extinction in the late 19th century. It was long thought to be a distinct species, but MtDNA studies have supported it being a subspecies of plains zebra. A more recent study suggested that it was the southernmost cline or ecotype of the species.

The quagga is believed to have been around long and tall at the shoulders. It was distinguished from other zebras by its limited pattern of primarily brown and white stripes, mainly on the front part of the body. The rear was brown and without stripes, and appeared more horse-like. The distribution of stripes varied considerably between individuals. Little is known about the quagga&#x27;s behaviour, but it may have gathered into herds of 30–50. Quaggas were said to be wild and lively, yet were also considered more docile than the related Burchell&#x27;s zebra. They were once found in great numbers in the Karoo of Cape Province and the southern part of the Orange Free State in South Africa.

After the European settlement of South Africa began, the quagga was extensively hunted, as it competed with domesticated animals for forage. Some were taken to zoos in Europe, but breeding programmes were unsuccessful. The last wild population lived in the Orange Free State; the quagga was extinct in the wild by 1878. The last captive specimen died in Amsterdam on 12 August 1883. Only one quagga was ever photographed alive, and only 23 skins exist today. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal whose DNA was analysed. The Quagga Project has attempted to breed Burchell&#x27;s zebras with similar striping patterns to the quagga.

==Taxonomy==
It has been historically suggested that the name &quot;quagga&quot; is derived from the Khoikhoi word for &quot;zebra&quot; (cf. Tshwa &#x27;zebra&#x27;), thereby being an onomatopoeic word, resembling the quagga&#x27;s call, variously transcribed as &quot;kwa-ha-ha&quot;, &quot;kwahaah&quot;, or &quot;oug-ga&quot;. The name is still used colloquially for the plains zebra.

The quagga was originally classified as a distinct species, &quot;Equus quagga&quot;, in 1778 by Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert. Traditionally, the quagga and the other plains and mountain zebras were placed in the subgenus &quot;Hippotigris&quot;. Much debate has occurred over the status of the quagga in relation to the plains zebra. The British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock in 1902 was perhaps the first to suggest that the quagga was a subspecies of the plains zebra. As the quagga was scientifically described and named before the plains zebra, the trinomial name for the quagga becomes &quot;E. quagga quagga&quot; under this scheme, and the other subspecies of the plains zebra are placed under &quot;E. quagga&quot;, as well.

Historically, quagga taxonomy was further complicated because the extinct southernmost population of Burchell&#x27;s zebra (&quot;Equus quagga burchellii&quot;, formerly &quot;Equus burchellii burchellii&quot;) was thought to be a distinct subspecies (also sometimes thought a full species, &quot;E. burchellii&quot;). The extant northern population, the &quot;Damara zebra&quot;, was later named &quot;Equus quagga antiquorum&quot;, which means that it is today also referred to as &quot;E. q. burchellii&quot;, after it was realised they were the same taxon. The extinct population was long thought very close to the quagga, since it also showed limited striping on its hind parts. As an example of this, Shortridge placed the two in the now disused subgenus &quot;Quagga&quot; in 1934. Most experts now suggest that the two subspecies represent two ends of a cline.

Different subspecies of plains zebras were recognised as members of &quot;Equus quagga&quot; by early researchers, though much confusion existed over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described on the basis of differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as &quot;E. q. danielli&quot; and &quot;Hippotigris isabellinus&quot;, were based only on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. One craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (&quot;Equus ferus caballus&quot;), but early morphological studies have been noted as being erroneous. Studying skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.

===Evolution===

The quagga is poorly represented in the fossil record, and the identification of these fossils is uncertain, as they were collected at a time when the name &quot;quagga&quot; referred to all zebras. Fossil skulls of &quot;Equus mauritanicus&quot; from Algeria have been claimed to show affinities with the quagga and the plains zebra, but they may be too badly damaged to allow definite conclusions to be drawn from them.

The quagga was the first extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study launched the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was more closely related to zebras than to horses, with the quagga and mountain zebra (&quot;Equus zebra&quot;) sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to the plains zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2 percent per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to the plains zebra.

Later morphological studies came to different conclusions. A 1999 analysis of cranial measurements found that the quagga was as different from the plains zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of the plains zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept the plains zebra and the quagga as separate species.

A genetic study published in 2005 confirmed the subspecific status of the quagga. It showed that the quagga had little genetic diversity, and that it diverged from the other plains zebra subspecies only between 120,000 and 290,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene, and possibly the penultimate glacial maximum. Its distinct coat pattern perhaps evolved rapidly because of geographical isolation and/or adaptation to a drier environment. In addition, plains zebra subspecies tend to have less striping the further south they live, and the quagga was the most southern-living of them all. Other large African ungulates diverged into separate species and subspecies during this period, as well, probably because of the same climate shift.

The simplified cladogram below is based on the 2005 analysis (some taxa shared haplotypes and could, therefore, not be differentiated):
A 2018 genetic study of plains zebras populations confirmed the quagga as a member of that species. They found no evidence for subspecific differentiation based on morphological differences between southern populations of zebras, including the quagga. Modern plains zebra populations may have originated from southern Africa, and the quagga appears to be less divergent from neighbouring populations than the northernmost living population in northeastern Uganda. Instead, the study supported a north–south genetic continuum for plains zebras, with the Ugandan population being the most distinct. Zebras from Namibia appear to be the closest genetically to the quagga.

==Description==

The quagga is believed to have been long and tall at the shoulders. Based on measurements of skins, mares were significantly longer and slightly taller than stallions, whereas the stallions of extant zebras are the largest. Its coat pattern was unique among equids: zebra-like in the front but more like a horse in the rear. It had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs. The stripes were boldest on the head and neck and became gradually fainter further down the body, blending with the reddish brown of the back and flanks, until disappearing along the back. It appears to have had a high degree of polymorphism, with some having almost no stripes and others having patterns similar to the extinct southern population of Burchell&#x27;s zebra, where the stripes covered most of the body except for the hind parts, legs and belly. It also had a broad dark dorsal stripe on its back. It had a standing mane with brown and white stripes.

The only quagga to have been photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London&#x27;s Zoo. Five photographs of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. The German naturalist Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed that this is an optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark.

Living in the very southern end of the plains zebra&#x27;s range, the quagga had a thick winter coat that moulted each year. Its skull was described as having a straight profile and a diastema, and as being relatively broad with a narrow occiput. Like other plains zebras, the quagga did not have a dewlap on its neck as the mountain zebra does. The 2004 morphological study found that the skeletal features of the southern Burchell&#x27;s zebra population and the quagga overlapped, and that they were impossible to distinguish. Some specimens also appeared to be intermediate between the two in striping, and the extant Burchell&#x27;s zebra population still exhibits limited striping. It can therefore be concluded that the two subspecies graded morphologically into each other. Today, some stuffed specimens of quaggas and southern Burchell&#x27;s zebra are so similar that they are impossible to definitely identify as either, since no location data was recorded.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The quagga was the southernmost distributed plains zebra, mainly living south of the Orange River. It was a grazer, and its habitat range was restricted to the grasslands and arid interior scrubland of the Karoo region of South Africa, today forming parts of the provinces of Northern Cape, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and the Free State. These areas were known for distinctive flora and fauna and high amounts of endemism. Quaggas have been reported gathering into herds of 30–50, and sometimes travelled in a linear fashion. They may have been sympatric with Burchell&#x27;s zebra between the Vaal and Orange rivers. This is disputed, and there is no evidence that they interbred. It could also have shared a small portion of its range with Hartmann&#x27;s mountain zebra (&quot;Equus zebra hartmannae&quot;).

Little is known about the behaviour of quaggas in the wild, and it is sometimes unclear what exact species of zebra is referred to in old reports. The only source that unequivocally describes the quagga in the Free State is that of the British military engineer and hunter William Cornwallis Harris. His 1840 account reads as follows:

The geographical range of the quagga does not appear to extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is almost invariably to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.

The practical function of striping in zebras has been debated and it is unclear why the quagga lacked stripes on its hind parts. A cryptic function for protection from predators (stripes obscure the individual zebra in a herd) and biting flies (which are less attracted to striped objects), as well as various social functions, have been proposed for zebras in general. Differences in hind quarter stripes may have aided species recognition during stampedes of mixed herds, so that members of one subspecies or species would follow its own kind. It has also been evidence that the zebras developed striping patterns as thermoregulation to cool themselves down, and that the quagga lost them due to living in a cooler climate, although one problem with this is that the mountain zebra lives in similar environments and has a bold striping pattern. A 2014 study strongly supported the biting-fly hypothesis, and the quagga appears to have lived in areas with lesser amounts of fly activity than other zebras.

A 2020 study suggested that the sexual dimorphism in size, with quagga mares being larger than stallions, could be due to the cold and droughts that affects the Karoo plateau, conditions that were even more severe in prehistoric times, such as during ice ages (other plains zebras live in warmer areas). Isolation, cold, and aridity could thereby have affected quagga evolution, including coat colour and size dimorphism. Since plains zebra mares are pregnant or lactate for much of their lives, larger size could have been a selective advantage for quagga mares, as they would therefore have more food reserves when food was scarce. Dimorphism and coat colour could also have evolved through genetic drift due to isolation, but these influences are not mutually exclusive, and could have worked together.

==Relationship with humans==

Quaggas have been identified in cave art attributed to the indigenous San people of Southern Africa. As it was easy to find and kill, the quagga was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or exploited. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its restricted range. Local farmers used them as guards for their livestock, as they were likely to attack intruders. Quaggas were said to be lively and highly strung, especially the stallions. Quaggas were brought to European zoos, and an attempt at captive breeding was made at London Zoo, but this was halted when a lone stallion killed itself by bashing itself against a wall after losing its temper. On the other hand, captive quaggas in European zoos were said to be tamer and more docile than Burchell&#x27;s zebra. One specimen was reported to have lived in captivity for 21 years and 4 months, dying in 1872.

The quagga was long regarded a suitable candidate for domestication, as it counted as the most docile of the zebras. The Dutch colonists in South Africa had considered this possibility, because their imported work horses did not perform very well in the extreme climate and regularly fell prey to the feared African horse sickness. In 1843, the English naturalist Charles Hamilton Smith wrote that the quagga was &#x27;unquestionably best calculated for domestication, both as regards strength and docility&#x27;. Some mentions have been given of tame or domesticated quaggas in South Africa. In Europe, two stallions were used to drive a phaeton by the sheriff of London in the early 19th century.

In an attempt at domesticating the quagga, the British lord George Douglas, 16th Earl of Morton obtained a single male which he bred with a female horse of partial Arabian ancestry. This produced a female hybrid with stripes on its back and legs. Lord Morton&#x27;s mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. It is unknown what happened to the hybrid mare itself. This led to new ideas on telegony, referred to as pangenesis by the British naturalist Charles Darwin. At the close of the 19th century, the Scottish zoologist James Cossar Ewart argued against these ideas and proved, with several cross-breeding experiments, that zebra stripes could appear as an atavistic trait at any time.

There are 23 known stuffed and mounted quagga specimens throughout the world, including a juvenile, two foals, and a foetus. In addition, a mounted head and neck, a foot, seven complete skeletons, and samples of various tissues remain. A 24th mounted specimen was destroyed in Königsberg, Germany, during World War II, and various skeletons and bones have also been lost.

===Extinction===

The quagga had disappeared from much of its range by the 1850s. The last population in the wild, in the Orange Free State, was extirpated in the late 1870s. The last known wild quagga died in 1878. The specimen in London died in 1872 and the one in Berlin in 1875. The last captive quagga, a female in Amsterdam&#x27;s Natura Artis Magistra zoo, lived there from 9 May 1867 until it died on 12 August 1883, but its origin and cause of death are unclear. Its death was not recognised as signifying the extinction of its kind at the time, and the zoo requested another specimen; hunters believed it could still be found &quot;closer to the interior&quot; in the Cape Colony. Since locals used the term quagga to refer to all zebras, this may have led to the confusion. The extinction of the quagga was internationally accepted by the 1900 Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa. The last specimen was featured on a Dutch stamp in 1988. The specimen itself was mounted and is kept in the collection of Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. It has been on display for special occasions.

In 1889, the naturalist Henry Bryden wrote: &quot;That an animal so beautiful, so capable of domestication and use, and to be found not long since in so great abundance, should have been allowed to be swept from the face of the earth, is surely a disgrace to our latter-day civilization.&quot;

===Breeding back project===


After the very close relationship between the quagga and extant plains zebras was discovered, Rau started the Quagga Project in 1987 in South Africa to create a quagga-like zebra population by selectively breeding for a reduced stripe pattern from plains zebra stock, with the eventual aim of introducing them to the quagga&#x27;s former range. To differentiate between the quagga and the zebras of the project, they refer to it as &quot;Rau quaggas&quot;. The founding population consisted of 19 individuals from Namibia and South Africa, chosen because they had reduced striping on the rear body and legs. The first foal of the project was born in 1988. Once a sufficiently quagga-like population has been created, participants in the project plan to release them in the Western Cape.

Introduction of these quagga-like zebras could be part of a comprehensive restoration programme, including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third- and fourth-generation animals produced by the project were considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning has not yet been developed.

<text>QuickTime (or QuickTime Player) is an extensible multimedia architecture created by Apple, which supports playing, streaming, encoding, and transcoding a variety of digital media formats. The term &quot;QuickTime&quot; also refers to the QuickTime Player front-end media player application, which is built-into macOS, and was formerly available for Windows.

QuickTime was created in 1991, when the concept of playing digital video directly on computers was &quot;groundbreaking.&quot; QuickTime could embed a number of advanced media types, including panoramic images (called QuickTime VR) and Adobe Flash. Over the 1990s, QuickTime became a dominant standard for digital multimedia, as it was integrated into many websites, applications, and video games, and adopted by professional filmmakers. The QuickTime File Format became the basis for the MPEG-4 standard. During its heyday, QuickTime was notably used to create the innovative &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Xplora1&quot; video games, and to exclusively distribute movie trailers for several &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. QuickTime could support additional codecs through plug-ins, for example with Perian.

As operating systems and browsers gained support for MPEG-4 and subsequent standards like H.264, the need for a cross-platform version of QuickTime diminished, and Apple discontinued the Windows version of QuickTime in 2016. In Mac OS X Snow Leopard, QuickTime 7 was discontinued in favor of QuickTime Player X, which abandoned the aging QuickTime framework in favor of the AVFoundation framework. QuickTime Player X does not support video editing (beyond trimming clips) or plug-ins for additional codec support. macOS Catalina dropped support for all 32-bit applications, including the QTKit framework and the old QuickTime 7.

== Overview ==
QuickTime is bundled with macOS. QuickTime for Microsoft Windows was downloadable as a standalone installation, and was bundled with Apple&#x27;s iTunes before iTunes 10.5, but is no longer supported and therefore security vulnerabilities will no longer be patched. Already, at the time of the Windows version&#x27;s discontinuation, two such zero-day vulnerabilities (both of which permitted arbitrary code execution) were identified and publicly disclosed by Trend Micro; consequently, Trend Micro strongly advised users to uninstall the product from Windows systems.

Software development kits (SDK) for QuickTime are available to the public with an Apple Developer Connection (ADC) subscription.

It is available free of charge for both macOS operating systems. There are some other free player applications that rely on the QuickTime framework, providing features not available in the basic QuickTime Player. For example, iTunes can export audio in WAV, AIFF, MP3, AAC, and Apple Lossless. In addition, macOS has a simple AppleScript that can be used to play a movie in full-screen mode, but since version 7.2 full-screen viewing is now supported in the non-Pro version.

== QuickTime framework ==

The QuickTime framework provides the following:

* Encoding and transcoding video and audio from one format to another. Command-line utilities afconvert (to convert audio formats), avconvert (to convert video formats) and qtmodernizer (to automatically convert older formats to H.264/AAC) are provided with macOS for power users.
* Decoding video and audio, then sending the decoded stream to the graphics or audio subsystem for playback. In macOS, QuickTime sends video playback to the Quartz Extreme (OpenGL) Compositor.
* A &quot;component&quot; plug-in architecture for supporting additional 3rd-party codecs (such as DivX).

As of early 2008, the framework hides many older codecs listed below from the user although the option to &quot;Show legacy encoders&quot; exists in QuickTime Preferences to use them. The framework supports the following file types and codecs natively:

Due to macOS Mojave being the last version to include support for 32-bit APIs and Apple&#x27;s plans to drop 32-bit application support in future macOS releases, many codecs will no longer be supported in newer macOS releases, starting with macOS Catalina, which was released on October 7, 2019.

As of Mac OS X Lion, the underlying media framework for QuickTime, QTKit, was deprecated in favor of a newer graphics framework, AVFoundation, and completely discontinued as of macOS Catalina.

=== Windows ===
PictureViewer is a component of QuickTime for Microsoft Windows and the Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9 operating systems. It is used to view picture files from the still image formats that QuickTime supports. In macOS, it is replaced by Preview.

=== Irix ===
A version of QuickTime for the Irix operating system running on SGI hardware with MIPS processors was developed in the mid-1990s but never released.

== QuickTime Player ==
=== QuickTime 7 Pro ===
QuickTime Player 7 is limited to only basic playback operations unless a QuickTime Pro license key is purchased from Apple. Until Catalina, Apple&#x27;s professional applications (e.g. Final Cut Studio, Logic Studio) included a QuickTime Pro license. Pro keys are specific to the major version of QuickTime for which they are purchased and unlock additional features of the QuickTime Player application on macOS or Windows. The Pro key does not require any additional downloads; entering the registration code immediately unlocks the hidden features.

QuickTime 7 is still available for download from Apple, but as of mid-2016, Apple stopped selling registration keys for the Pro version.

Features enabled by the Pro license include, but are not limited to:
* Editing clips through the cut, copy and paste functions, merging separate audio and video tracks, and freely placing the video tracks on a virtual canvas with the options of cropping and rotation.
* Saving and exporting (encoding) to any of the codecs supported by QuickTime. QuickTime 7 includes presets for exporting video to a video-capable iPod, Apple TV, and the iPhone.
* Saving existing QuickTime movies from the web directly to a hard disk drive. This is often, but not always, either hidden or intentionally blocked in the standard mode. Two options exist for saving movies from a web browser:
** Save as source – This option will save the embedded video in its original format. (I.e. not limited to .mov files.)
** Save as QuickTime movie – This option will save the embedded video in a .mov file format no matter what the original container is/was.

=== QuickTime Player X ===
Mac OS X Snow Leopard includes QuickTime X. QuickTime Player X lacks cut, copy and paste and will only export to four formats, but its limited export feature is free. Users do not have an option to upgrade to a Pro version of QuickTime X, but those who have already purchased QuickTime 7 Pro and are upgrading to Snow Leopard from a previous version of Mac OS X will have QuickTime 7 stored in the Utilities or user defined folder. Otherwise, users will have to install QuickTime 7 from the &quot;Optional Installs&quot; directory of the Snow Leopard DVD after installing the OS.

Mac OS X Lion and later also include QuickTime X. No installer for QuickTime 7 is included with these software packages, but users can download the QuickTime 7 installer from the Apple support site. QuickTime X on later versions of macOS support cut, copy and paste functions similarly to the way QuickTime 7 Pro did; the interface has been significantly modified to simplify these operations, however.

On September 24, 2018, Apple ended support for QuickTime 7 and QuickTime Pro, and updated many download and support pages on their website to state that QuickTime 7 &quot;will not be compatible with future macOS releases.&quot;

== File formats ==
The native file format for QuickTime video, QuickTime File Format, specifies a multimedia container file that contains one or more tracks, each of which stores a particular type of data: audio, video, effects, or text (e.g. for subtitles). Each track either contains a digitally encoded media stream (using a specific format) or a data reference to the media stream located in another file. The ability to contain abstract data references for the media data, and the separation of the media data from the media offsets and the track edit lists means that QuickTime is particularly suited for editing, as it is capable of importing and editing in place (without data copying).

Other file formats that QuickTime supports natively (to varying degrees) include AIFF, WAV, DV-DIF, MP3, and MPEG program stream. With additional QuickTime Components, it can also support ASF, DivX Media Format, Flash Video, Matroska, Ogg, and many others.

=== QuickTime and MPEG-4 ===
On February 11, 1998, the ISO approved the QuickTime file format as the basis of the MPEG‑4 file format. The MPEG-4 file format specification was created on the basis of the QuickTime format specification published in 2001. The MP4 (codice_1) file format was published in 2001 as the revision of the MPEG-4 Part 1: Systems specification published in 1999 (ISO/IEC 14496-1:2001). In 2003, the first version of MP4 format was revised and replaced by MPEG-4 Part 14: MP4 file format (ISO/IEC 14496-14:2003). The MP4 file format was generalized into the ISO Base Media File Format ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004, which defines a general structure for time-based media files. It in turn is used as the basis for other multimedia file formats (for example 3GP, Motion JPEG 2000).
 A list of all registered extensions for ISO Base Media File Format is published on the official registration authority website www.mp4ra.org. This registration authority for code-points in &quot;MP4 Family&quot; files is Apple Computer Inc. and it is named in Annex D (informative) in MPEG-4 Part 12.

By 2000, MPEG-4 formats became industry standards, first appearing with support in QuickTime 6 in 2002. Accordingly, the MPEG-4 container is designed to capture, edit, archive, and distribute media, unlike the simple file-as-stream approach of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2.

==== Profile support ====
QuickTime 6 added limited support for MPEG-4, specifically encoding and decoding using Simple Profile (SP). Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) features, like B-frames, were unsupported (in contrast with, for example, encoders such as XviD or 3ivx). QuickTime 7 supports the H.264 encoder and decoder.

==== Container benefits ====
Because both MOV and MP4 containers can use the same MPEG-4 codecs, they are mostly interchangeable in a QuickTime-only environment. MP4, being an international standard, has more support. This is especially true on hardware devices, such as the Sony PSP and various DVD players, on the software side, most DirectShow / Video for Windows codec packs include a MP4 parser, but not one for MOV.

In QuickTime Pro&#x27;s MPEG-4 Export dialog, an option called &quot;Passthrough&quot; allows a clean export to MP4 without affecting the audio or video streams. QuickTime 7 now supports multichannel AAC-LC and HE-AAC audio (used, for example, in the high-definition trailers on Apple&#x27;s site), for both .MOV and .MP4 containers.

== History ==
Apple released the first version of QuickTime on December 2, 1991, as a multimedia add-on for System 6 and later. The lead developer of QuickTime, Bruce Leak, ran the first public demonstration at the May 1991 Worldwide Developers Conference, where he played Apple&#x27;s famous 1984 advertisement in a window at 320×240 pixels resolution.

=== QuickTime 1.x ===
The original video codecs included:

* the Animation codec, which used run-length encoding and was better suited to cartoon-type images with large areas of flat color
* the Apple Video codec (also known as &quot;Road Pizza&quot;), suited to normal live-action video.
* the Graphics codec, for 8-bit images, including ones that had undergone dithering

The first commercial project produced using QuickTime 1.0 was the CD-ROM From Alice to Ocean. The first publicly visible use of QuickTime was Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s interactive factory tour (dubbed &quot;The Rik &amp; Joe Show&quot; after its in-house developers). &quot;The Rik and Joe Show&quot; was demonstrated onstage at MacWorld in San Francisco when John Sculley announced QuickTime.

Apple released QuickTime 1.5 for Mac OS in the latter part of 1992. This added the SuperMac-developed Cinepak vector-quantization video codec (initially known as Compact Video). It could play video at 320×240 resolution at 30 frames per second on a 25 MHz Motorola 68040 CPU. It also added &quot;text&quot; tracks, which allowed for captioning, lyrics and other potential uses.

Apple contracted San Francisco Canyon Company to port QuickTime to the Windows platform. Version 1.0 of QuickTime for Windows provided only a subset of the full QuickTime API, including only movie playback functions driven through the standard movie controller.

QuickTime 1.6 came out the following year. Version 1.6.2 first incorporated the &quot;QuickTime PowerPlug&quot; which replaced some components with PowerPC-native code when running on PowerPC Macs.

=== QuickTime 2.x ===

Apple released QuickTime 2.0 for System Software 7 in June 1994—the only version never released for free. It added support for music tracks, which contained the equivalent of MIDI data and which could drive a sound-synthesis engine built into QuickTime itself (using a limited set of instrument sounds licensed from Roland), or any external MIDI-compatible hardware, thereby producing sounds using only small amounts of movie data.

Following Bruce Leak&#x27;s departure to Web TV, the leadership of the QuickTime team was taken over by Peter Hoddie.

QuickTime 2.0 for Windows appeared in November 1994 under the leadership of Paul Charlton. As part of the development effort for cross-platform QuickTime, Charlton (as architect and technical lead), along with ace individual contributor Michael Kellner and a small highly effective team including Keith Gurganus, ported a subset of the Macintosh Toolbox to Intel and other platforms (notably, MIPS and SGI Unix variants) as the enabling infrastructure for the QuickTime Media Layer (QTML) which was first demonstrated at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in May 1996. The QTML later became the foundation for the Carbon API which allowed legacy Macintosh applications to run on the Darwin kernel in Mac OS X.

The next versions, 2.1 and 2.5, reverted to the previous model of giving QuickTime away for free. They improved the music support and added sprite tracks which allowed the creation of complex animations with the addition of little more than the static sprite images to the size of the movie. QuickTime 2.5 also fully integrated QuickTime VR 2.0.1 into QuickTime as a QuickTime extension. On January 16, 1997, Apple released the QuickTime MPEG Extension (PPC only) as an add-on to QuickTime 2.5, which added software MPEG-1 playback capabilities to QuickTime.

=== Lawsuit against San Francisco Canyon ===

In 1994, Apple filed suit against software developer San Francisco Canyon for intellectual property infringement and breach of contract. Apple alleged that San Francisco Canyon had helped develop Video for Windows using several hundred lines of unlicensed QuickTime source code. They were contracted by Intel to help make Video for Windows better use system resources on Intel processors, which was subsequently unilaterally removed. Microsoft and Intel were added to the lawsuit in 1995. The suit ended in a settlement in 1997.

=== QuickTime 3.x ===
The release of QuickTime 3.0 for Mac OS on March 30, 1998, introduced the now-standard revenue model of releasing the software for free, but with additional features of the Apple-provided MoviePlayer application that end-users could only unlock by buying a QuickTime Pro license code. Since the &quot;Pro&quot; features were the same as the existing features in QuickTime 2.5, any previous user of QuickTime could continue to use an older version of the central MoviePlayer application for the remaining lifespan of Mac OS to 2002, indeed, since these additional features were limited to MoviePlayer, any other QuickTime-compatible application remained unaffected.

QuickTime 3.0 added support for graphics importer components that could read images from GIF, JPEG, TIFF, and other file formats, and video output components which served primarily to export movie data via FireWire. Apple also licensed several third-party technologies for inclusion in QuickTime 3.0, including the Sorenson Video codec for advanced video compression, the QDesign Music codec for substantial audio compression, and the complete Roland Sound Canvas instrument set and GS Format extensions for improved playback of MIDI music files. It also added video &quot;effects&quot; which programmers could apply in real-time to video tracks. Some of these effects would even respond to mouse clicks by the user, as part of the new movie interaction support (known as wired movies).

==== QuickTime interactive ====
During the development cycle for QuickTime 3.0, part of the engineering team was working on a more advanced version of QuickTime to be known as QuickTime interactive or QTi. Although similar in concept to the wired movies feature released as part of QuickTime 3.0, QuickTime interactive was much more ambitious. It allowed any QuickTime movie to be a fully interactive and programmable container for media. A special track type was added that contained an interpreter for a custom programming language based on 68000 assembly language. This supported a comprehensive user interaction model for mouse and keyboard event handling based in part on the AML language from the Apple Media Tool.

The QuickTime interactive movie was to have been the playback format for the next generation of HyperCard authoring tool. Both the QuickTime interactive and the HyperCard 3.0 projects were canceled in order to concentrate engineering resources on streaming support for QuickTime 4.0, and the projects were never released to the public.

=== QuickTime 4.x ===
Apple released QuickTime 4.0 on June 8, 1999 for Mac OS 7.5.5 through 8.6 (later Mac OS 9) and Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. Three minor updates (versions 4.0.1, 4.0.2, and 4.0.3) followed.
It introduced features that most users now consider basic:

* Graphics exporter components, which could write some of the same formats that the previously introduced importers could read. (GIF support was omitted, possibly because of the LZW patent.)
* Support for the QDesign Music 2 and MPEG-1 Layer 3 audio (MP3). 
* QuickTime 4 was the first version to support streaming. It was accompanied by the release of the free QuickTime Streaming Server version 1.0.
* QuickTime 4 Player introduced brushed metal to the Macintosh user interface.

On December 17, 1999, Apple provided QuickTime 4.1, this version&#x27;s first major update. Two minor versions (4.1.1 and 4.1.2) followed. The most notable improvements in the 4.1.x family were:

* Support for files larger than 2.0 GB in Mac OS 9. (This is a consequence of Mac OS 9 requiring the HFS Plus filesystem.)
* Variable bit rate (VBR) support for MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3) audio.
* Support for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL).
* Introduction of AppleScript support in Mac OS.
* The requirement of a PowerPC processor for Mac OS systems. QuickTime 4.1 dropped support for Motorola 68k Macintosh systems.

=== QuickTime 5.x ===
QuickTime 5 was one of the shortest-lived versions of QuickTime, released in April 2001 and superseded by QuickTime 6 a little over a year later. This version was the last to have greater capabilities under Mac OS 9 than under Mac OS X, and the last version of QuickTime to support Mac OS versions 7.5.5 through 8.5.1 on a PowerPC Mac and Windows 95. Version 5.0 was initially only released for Mac OS and Mac OS X on April 14, 2001, and version 5.0.1 followed shortly thereafter on April 23, 2001, supporting the classic Mac OS, Mac OS X, and Windows. Three more updates to QuickTime 5 (versions 5.0.2, 5.0.4, and 5.0.5) were released over its short lifespan.

QuickTime 5 delivered the following enhancements:
* MPEG-1 playback for Windows, and updated MPEG-1 Layer 3 audio support for all systems.
* Sorenson Video 3 playback and export (added with the 5.0.2 update).
* Realtime rendering of effects &amp; transitions in DV files, including enhancements to DV rendering, multiprocessor support, and Altivec enhancements for PowerPC G4 systems.
* Flash 4 playback and export.
* A new QuickTime VR engine, adding support for cubic VR panoramas.

=== QuickTime 6.x ===
On July 15, 2002, Apple released QuickTime 6.0, providing the following features:

* MPEG-4 playback, import, and export, including MPEG-4 Part 2 video and AAC Audio.
* Support for Flash 5, JPEG 2000, and improved Exif handling.
* Instant-on streaming playback.
* MPEG-2 playback (via the purchase of Apple&#x27;s MPEG-2 Playback Component).
* Scriptable ActiveX control.

QuickTime 6 was initially available for Mac OS 8.6 – 9.x, Mac OS X (10.1.5 minimum), and Windows 98, Me, 2000, and XP. Development of QuickTime 6 for Mac OS slowed considerably in early 2003, after the release of Mac OS X v10.2 in August 2002. QuickTime 6 for Mac OS continued on the 6.0.x path, eventually stopping with version 6.0.3.

QuickTime 6.1 &amp; 6.1.1 for Mac OS X v10.1 and Mac OS X v10.2 (released October 22, 2002) and QuickTime 6.1 for Windows (released March 31, 2003) offered ISO-Compliant MPEG-4 file creation and fixed the CAN-2003-0168 vulnerability.

Apple released QuickTime 6.2 exclusively for Mac OS X on April 29, 2003, to provide support for iTunes 4, which allowed AAC encoding for songs in the iTunes library. (iTunes was not available for Windows until October 2003.)

On June 3, 2003, Apple released QuickTime 6.3, delivering the following:

* Support for 3GPP, including 3G Text, video, and audio (AAC and AMR codecs).
* Support for the .3gp, .amr, and .sdv file formats via separate component.

QuickTime 6.4, released on October 16, 2003, for Mac OS X v10.2, Mac OS X v10.3, and Windows, added the following:

* Addition of the Apple Pixlet codec (only for Mac OS X v10.3 and later).
* ColorSync support.
* Integrated 3GPP.

On December 18, 2003, Apple released QuickTime 6.5, supporting the same systems as version 6.4. Versions 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 followed on April 28, 2004, and October 27, 2004. These versions would be the last to support Windows 98 and Me. The 6.5 family added the following features:

* 3GPP2 and AMC mobile multimedia formats.
* QCELP voice code.
* Apple Lossless (in version 6.5.1).

QuickTime 6.5.3 was released on October 12, 2005, for Mac OS X v10.2.8 after the release of QuickTime 7.0, fixing a number of security issues.

=== QuickTime 7.x ===

Initially released on April 29, 2005, in conjunction with Mac OS X v10.4 (for version 10.3.9 and 10.4.x), QuickTime 7.0 featured the following:

* Improved MPEG-4 compliance.
* A H.264/MPEG-4 AVC codec (does not support the AVCHD H.264 AVC format from Sony HD camcorders).
* Support for &quot;Core Audio&quot;, a set of Application programming interfaces that supports high resolution sound and replaces Sound Manager.
* Support for using Core Image filters in Mac OS X v10.4 on live video (Not to be confused with Core Video).
* Support for Quartz Composer (.qtz) animations.
* Support for distinct decode order and display order.
* &quot;QuickTime Kit Framework&quot; (&quot;QTKit&quot;), a Cocoa framework for QuickTime.
After a couple of preview Windows releases, Apple released 7.0.2 as the first stable release on September 7, 2005, for Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Version 7.0.4, released on January 10, 2006, was the first universal binary version. But it suffered numerous bugs, including a buffer overrun, which is more problematic to most users.

Apple dropped support for Windows 2000 with the release of QuickTime 7.2 on July 11, 2007. The last version available for Windows 2000, 7.1.6, contains numerous security vulnerabilities. References to this version have been removed from the QuickTime site, but it can be downloaded from Apple&#x27;s support section. Apple has not indicated that they will be providing any further security updates for older versions. QuickTime 7.2 is the first version for Windows Vista.

Apple dropped support for Flash content in QuickTime 7.3, breaking content that relied on Flash for interactivity, or animation tracks. Security concerns seem to be part of the decision. Flash flv files can still be played in QuickTime if the free Perian plugin is added.

In QuickTime 7.3, a processor that supports SSE is required. QuickTime 7.4 does not require SSE. Unlike versions 7.2 and 7.3, QuickTime 7.4 cannot be installed on Windows XP without service packs or with Service Pack 1/1A installed (its setup program checks if Service Pack 2 is installed).

QuickTime 7.5 was released on June 10, 2008. QuickTime 7.5.5 was released on September 9, 2008, which requires Mac OS X v10.4 or higher, dropping 10.3 support. QuickTime 7.6 was released on January 21, 2009. QuickTime 7.7 was released on August 3, 2011.

QuickTime 7.6.6 is available for OS X, 10.6.3 Snow Leopard until 10.14 Mojave, as 10.15 Catalina will only support 64-bit applications. There is a 7.7 release of QuickTime 7 for OS X, but it is only for Leopard 10.5.

QuickTime 7.7.6 is the last release for Windows XP Service Pack 2 or 3.

QuickTime 7.7.9 is the last Windows release of QuickTime. Apple stopped supporting QuickTime on Windows afterwards.

Safari 12, released on September 17, 2018, for macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra (and the default browser included on macOS Mojave released on September 24, 2018), which drops support for NPAPI plug-ins (except for Adobe Flash) dropped its support for QuickTime 7&#x27;s web plugin. On September 24, 2018, Apple dropped support for the macOS version of QuickTime 7. This effectively marked the end of the technology in Apple&#x27;s codec and web development.

Starting with macOS Catalina, QuickTime 7 applications, image, audio and video codecs will no longer be compatible with macOS or supported by Apple.

=== QuickTime X (QuickTime Player v10.x) ===
QuickTime X (pronounced &quot;QuickTime Ten&quot;) was initially demonstrated at WWDC on June 8, 2009, and shipped with Mac OS X v10.6.

It includes visual chapters, conversion, sharing to YouTube, video editing, capture of video and audio streams, screen recording, GPU acceleration, and live streaming.

But it removed support for various widely used formats, in particular the omission of MIDI caused significant inconvenience and trouble to many musicians and their potential audiences.

In addition, a screen recorder is featured which records whatever is on the screen. However it is not possible to capture certain Digital rights management protected content. This includes iTunes/Apple TV video purchases, or any content protected by Apple&#x27;s FairPlay DRM technology. While Safari uses FairPlay, Google Chrome and Firefox use Widevine for DRM, whose content is not protected from QuickTime screen capturing.

The reason for the jump in numbering from 7 to 10 (X) was to indicate a similar break with the previous versions of the product that Mac OS X indicated. QuickTime X is fundamentally different from previous versions, in that it is provided as a Cocoa (Objective-C) framework and breaks compatibility with the previous QuickTime 7 C-based APIs that were previously used. QuickTime X was completely rewritten to implement modern audio video codecs in 64-bit. QuickTime X is a combination of two technologies: QuickTime Kit Framework (QTKit) and QuickTime X Player. QTKit is used by QuickTime player to display media. QuickTime X does not implement all of the functionality of the previous QuickTime as well as some of the codecs. When QuickTime X attempts to operate with a 32-bit codec or perform an operation not supported by QuickTime X, it will start a 32-bit helper process to perform the requested operation. The website &quot;Ars Technica&quot; revealed that QuickTime X uses QuickTime 7.x via QTKit to run older codecs that have not made the transition to 64-bit.

QuickTime X does not support .SRT subtitle files. It has been suggested using the program Subler to interleave the MP4 and SRT files will fix this oversight, which can be downloaded at Bitbucket.

QuickTime 7 may still be required to support older formats on Snow Leopard such as QTVR, interactive QuickTime movies, and MIDI files. In such cases, a compatible version of QuickTime 7 is included on Snow Leopard installation disc and may be installed side-by-side with QuickTime X. Users who have a Pro license for QuickTime 7 can then activate their license.

A Snow Leopard compatible version of QuickTime 7 may also be downloaded from Apple Support website.

The software got an increment with the release of Mavericks, and as of August 2018, the current version is v10.5. It contains more sharing options (email, YouTube, Facebook, Flickr etc.), more export options (including web export in multiple sizes, and export for iPhone 4/iPad/Apple TV (but not Apple TV 2). It also includes a new way of fast forwarding through a video and mouse support for scrolling.

Starting with macOS Catalina, Apple only provides QuickTime X, as QuickTime 7 was never updated to 64-bit, affecting many applications, image, audio, and video formats utilizing QuickTime 7, and compatibility with these codecs in QuickTime X.

=== Platform support ===


== Creating software that uses QuickTime ==

=== QuickTime X ===
QuickTime X previously provided the QTKit Framework on Mac OS 10.6 until 10.14.
Since the release of macOS 10.15, AVKit and AVFoundation are used instead (due to the removal of 32-bit audio and video codecs, as well as image formats and APIs supported by QuickTime 7).

=== Previous versions ===
QuickTime consists of two major subsystems: the Movie Toolbox and the Image Compression Manager. The Movie Toolbox consists of a general API for handling time-based data, while the Image Compression Manager provides services for dealing with compressed raster data as produced by video and photo codecs.

Developers can use the QuickTime software development kit (SDK) to develop multimedia applications for Mac or Windows with the C programming language or with the Java programming language (see QuickTime for Java), or, under Windows, using COM/ActiveX from a language supporting this.

The COM/ActiveX option was introduced as part of QuickTime 7 for Windows and is intended for programmers who want to build standalone Windows applications using high-level QuickTime movie playback and control with some import, export, and editing capabilities. This is considerably easier than mastering the original QuickTime C API.

QuickTime 7 for Mac introduced the QuickTime Kit (aka QTKit), a developer framework that is intended to replace previous APIs for Cocoa developers. This framework is for Mac only, and exists as Objective-C abstractions around a subset of the C interface. Mac OS X v10.5 extends QTKit to full 64-bit support. The QTKit allows multiplexing between QuickTime X and QuickTime 7 behind the scenes so that the user need not worry about which version of QuickTime they need to use.

== Bugs and vulnerabilities ==
QuickTime 7.4 was found to disable Adobe&#x27;s video compositing program, After Effects. This was due to the DRM built into version 7.4 since it allowed movie rentals from iTunes. QuickTime 7.4.1 resolved this issue.

Versions 4.0 through 7.3 contained a buffer overflow bug which could compromise the security of a PC using either the QuickTime Streaming Media client, or the QuickTime player itself. The bug was fixed in version 7.3.1.

QuickTime 7.5.5 and earlier are known to have a list of significant vulnerabilities that allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access and application crash) on a targeted system. The list includes six types of buffer overflow, data conversion, signed vs. unsigned integer mismatch, and uninitialized memory pointer.

QuickTime 7.6 has been found to disable Mac users&#x27; ability to play certain games, such as &quot;Civilization IV&quot; and &quot;The Sims 2&quot;. There are fixes available from the publisher, Aspyr.

QuickTime 7 lacks support for H.264 Sample Aspect Ratio. QuickTime X does not have this limitation, but many Apple products (such as Apple TV) still use the older QuickTime 7 engine. iTunes previously utilized QuickTime 7, but as of October 2019, iTunes no longer utilizes the older QuickTime 7 engine.

QuickTime 7.7.x on Windows fails to encode H.264 on multi-core systems with more than approximately 20 threads, e.g. HP Z820 with 2× 8-core CPUs. A suggested solution is to disable hyper-threading/limit CPU cores. Encoding speed and stability depends on the scaling of the player window.

On April 14, 2016, Christopher Budd of Trend Micro announced that Apple has ceased all security patching of QuickTime for Windows, and called attention to two Zero Day Initiative advisories, ZDI-16-241 and ZDI-16-242, issued by Trend Micro&#x27;s subsidiary TippingPoint on that same day. Also on that same day, the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued alert TA16-105A, encapsulating Budd&#x27;s announcement and the Zero Day Initiative advisories. Apple responded with a statement that QuickTime 7 for Windows is no longer supported by Apple.

<doc id="25233" wikidata="Q43010" url="?curid=25233" title="Quartz">
<text>Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silica (silicon dioxide). The atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon–oxygen tetrahedra, with each oxygen being shared between two tetrahedra, giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2. Quartz is, therefore, classified structurally as a framework silicate mineral and compositionally as an oxide mineral. Quartz is the second most abundant mineral in Earth&#x27;s continental crust, behind feldspar.

Quartz exists in two forms, the normal α-quartz and the high-temperature β-quartz, both of which are chiral. The transformation from α-quartz to β-quartz takes place abruptly at . Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce microfracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold.

There are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are classified as gemstones. Since antiquity, varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and hardstone carvings, especially in Europe and Asia.

Quartz is the mineral defining the value of 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness, a qualitative scratch method for determining the hardness of a material to abrasion.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;quartz&quot; is derived from the German word , which had the same form in the first half of the 14th century in Middle High German and in East Central German and which came from the Polish dialect term &quot;&quot;, which corresponds to the Czech term (&quot;hard&quot;). Some sources, however, attribute the word&#x27;s origin to the Saxon word &quot;Querkluftertz&quot;, meaning &quot;cross-vein ore&quot;.

The Ancient Greeks referred to quartz as () derived from the Ancient Greek () meaning &quot;icy cold&quot;, because some philosophers (including Theophrastus) understood the mineral to be a form of supercooled ice. Today, the term &quot;rock crystal&quot; is sometimes used as an alternative name for transparent coarsely crystalline quartz.

== Early studies ==

Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder believed quartz to be water ice, permanently frozen after great lengths of time. He supported this idea by saying that quartz is found near glaciers in the Alps, but not on volcanic mountains, and that large quartz crystals were fashioned into spheres to cool the hands. This idea persisted until at least the 17th century. He also knew of the ability of quartz to split light into a spectrum.

In the 17th century, Nicolas Steno&#x27;s study of quartz paved the way for modern crystallography. He discovered that regardless of a quartz crystal&#x27;s size or shape, its long prism faces always joined at a perfect 60° angle thus discovering the law of constancy of interfacial angles.

== Crystal habit and structure ==

Quartz belongs to the trigonal crystal system at room temperature, and to the hexagonal crystal system above . The former is called α-quartz; the latter is β-quartz. The ideal crystal shape is a six-sided prism terminating with six-sided pyramid-like rhombohedrons at each end. In nature, quartz crystals are often twinned (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive.

Well-formed crystals typically form as a druse (a layer of crystals lining a void), of which quartz geodes are particularly fine examples. The crystals are attached at one end to the enclosing rock, and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance, within gypsum.

α-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, space group &quot;P&quot;3121 or &quot;P&quot;3221 (space group 152 or 154 resp.) depending on the chirality. Above , α-quartz in &quot;P&quot;3121 becomes the more symmetric hexagonal &quot;P&quot;6422 (space group 181), and α-quartz in &quot;P&quot;3221 goes to space group &quot;P&quot;6222 (no. 180).

These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both α-quartz and β-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO4 tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between α- and β-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without a change in the way they are linked. However, there is a significant change in volume during this transition, and this can result in significant microfracturing in ceramics during firing, in ornamental stone after a fire and in rocks of the Earth&#x27;s crust exposed to high temperatures, thereby damaging materials containing quartz and degrading their physical and mechanical properties.

== Varieties (according to microstructure) ==
Although many of the varietal names historically arose from the color of the mineral, current scientific naming schemes refer primarily to the microstructure of the mineral. Color is a secondary identifier for the cryptocrystalline minerals, although it is a primary identifier for the macrocrystalline varieties.

The most important microstructure difference between types of quartz is that of &quot;macrocrystalline quartz&quot; (individual crystals visible to the unaided eye) and the microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline varieties (aggregates of crystals visible only under high magnification). The cryptocrystalline varieties are either translucent or mostly opaque, while the macrocrystalline varieties tend to be more transparent. Chalcedony is a cryptocrystalline form of silica consisting of fine intergrowths of both quartz, and its monoclinic polymorph moganite. Agate is a variety of chalcedony that is fibrous and distinctly banded with either concentric or horizontal bands. While most agates are translucent, onyx is a variety of agate that is more opaque, featuring monochromatic bands that are typically black and white. Carnelian or sard is a red-orange, translucent variety of chalcedony. Jasper is an opaque chert or impure chalcedony.

== Varieties (according to color) ==

Pure quartz, traditionally called rock crystal or clear quartz, is colorless and transparent or translucent and has often been used for hardstone carvings, such as the Lothair Crystal. Common colored varieties include citrine, rose quartz, amethyst, smoky quartz, milky quartz, and others. These color differentiations arise from the presence of impurities which change the molecular orbitals, causing some electronic transitions to take place in the visible spectrum causing colors.

===Amethyst===
Amethyst is a form of quartz that ranges from a bright vivid violet to a dark or dull lavender shade. The world&#x27;s largest deposits of amethysts can be found in Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Russia, France, Namibia, and Morocco. Amethyst derives its color from traces of iron in its structure.

===Ametrine===
Ametrine, as its name suggests, is commonly believed to be a combination of citrine and amethyst in the same crystal; however, this may not be technically correct. Like amethyst, the yellow quartz component of ametrine is colored by iron oxide inclusions. Some, but not all, sources define citrine solely as quartz with its color originating from aluminum-based color centers. Other sources do not make this distinction. In the former case, the yellow quartz in ametrine is not considered true citrine. Regardless, most ametrine on the market is in fact partially heat- or radiation-treated amethyst. 

=== Blue quartz ===
Blue quartz contains inclusions of fibrous magnesio-riebeckite or crocidolite.

=== Dumortierite quartz ===
Inclusions of the mineral dumortierite within quartz pieces often result in silky-appearing splotches with a blue hue. Shades of purple or gray sometimes also are present. &quot;Dumortierite quartz&quot; (sometimes called &quot;blue quartz&quot;) will sometimes feature contrasting light and dark color zones across the material. &quot;Blue quartz&quot; is a minor gemstone.

=== Citrine ===
Citrine is a variety of quartz whose color ranges from yellow to yellow-orange or yellow-green. The cause of its color is not well agreed upon. Evidence suggests the color of citrine is linked to the presence of aluminum-based color centers in its crystal structure, similar to those of smoky quartz. Both smoky quartz and citrine are dichroic in polarized light and will fade when heated sufficiently or exposed to UV light. They may occur together in the same crystal as “smoky citrine.” Smoky quartz can also be converted to citrine by careful heat treatment. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the color of citrine may be due to trace amounts of iron, but synthetic crystals grown in iron-rich solutions have failed to replicate the color or dichroism of natural citrine. The UV-sensitivity of natural citrine further indicates that its color is not caused solely by trace elements.

Natural citrine is rare; most commercial citrine is heat-treated amethyst or smoky quartz. Amethyst loses its natural violet color when heated to above 200-300°C and turns a color that resembles natural citrine, but is often more brownish. Unlike natural citrine, the color of heat-treated amethyst comes from trace amounts of the iron oxide minerals hematite and goethite. Clear quartz with natural iron inclusions or limonite staining may also resemble citrine, but it is not true citrine. Like amethyst, heat-treated amethyst often exhibits color zoning, or uneven color distribution throughout the crystal. In geodes and clusters, the color is usually deepest near the tips. This does not occur in natural citrine. 

It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow topaz visually, but they differ in hardness. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine, with much of its production coming from the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The name is derived from the Latin word &quot;citrina&quot; which means &quot;yellow&quot; and is also the origin of the word &quot;citron&quot;. Citrine has been referred to as the &quot;merchant&#x27;s stone&quot; or &quot;money stone&quot;, due to a superstition that it would bring prosperity.

Citrine was first appreciated as a golden-yellow gemstone in Greece between 300 and 150 BC, during the Hellenistic Age. Yellow quartz was used prior to that to decorate jewelry and tools but it was not highly sought after.

=== Milky quartz ===
Milk quartz or milky quartz is the most common variety of crystalline quartz. The white color is caused by minute fluid inclusions of gas, liquid, or both, trapped during crystal formation, making it of little value for optical and quality gemstone applications.

=== Rose quartz ===
Rose quartz is a type of quartz that exhibits a pale pink to rose red hue. The color is usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese in the material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic rutile needles that produce asterism in transmitted light. Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that the color is due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the quartz.

Additionally, there is a rare type of pink quartz (also frequently called crystalline rose quartz) with color that is thought to be caused by trace amounts of phosphate or aluminium. The color in crystals is apparently photosensitive and subject to fading. The first crystals were found in a pegmatite found near Rumford, Maine, US, and in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The crystals found are more transparent and euhedral, due to the impurities of phosphate and aluminium that formed crystalline rose quartz, unlike the iron and microscopic dumortierite fibers that formed rose quartz.

=== Smoky quartz ===
Smoky quartz is a gray, translucent version of quartz. It ranges in clarity from almost complete transparency to a brownish-gray crystal that is almost opaque. Some can also be black. The translucency results from natural irradiation acting on minute traces of aluminum in the crystal structure.

=== Prase ===
Prase is a leek-green variety of quartz that gets its color from inclusions of the amphibole actinolite. However, the term has also variously been used for a type of quartzite, a microcrystalline variety of quartz or jasper, or any leek-green quartz.

=== Prasiolite ===
Prasiolite, also known as &quot;vermarine&quot;, is a variety of quartz that is green in color. The green is caused by iron ions. It is a rare mineral in nature and is typically found with amethyst; most &quot;prasiolite&quot; is not natural – it has been artificially produced by heating of amethyst. , almost all natural prasiolite has come from a small Brazilian mine, but it is also seen in Lower Silesia in Poland. Naturally occurring prasiolite is also found in the Thunder Bay area of Canada.

== Piezoelectricity ==
Quartz crystals have piezoelectric properties; they develop an electric potential upon the application of mechanical stress. Quartz&#x27;s piezoelectric properties were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880.

== Occurrence ==

Quartz is a defining constituent of granite and other felsic igneous rocks. It is very common in sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and shale. It is a common constituent of schist, gneiss, quartzite and other metamorphic rocks. Quartz has the lowest potential for weathering in the Goldich dissolution series and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual soils. Generally a high presence of quartz suggests a &quot;mature&quot; rock, since it indicates the rock has been heavily reworked and quartz was the primary mineral that endured heavy weathering.

While the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten magma, quartz also chemically precipitates from hot hydrothermal veins as gangue, sometimes with ore minerals like gold, silver and copper. Large crystals of quartz are found in magmatic pegmatites. Well-formed crystals may reach several meters in length and weigh hundreds of kilograms.

The largest documented single crystal of quartz was found near Itapore, Goiaz, Brazil; it measured approximately and weighed over .

== Mining ==
Quartz is extracted from open pit mines. Miners occasionally use explosives to expose deep pockets of quartz. More frequently, bulldozers and backhoes are used to remove soil and clay and expose quartz veins, which are then worked using hand tools. Care must be taken to avoid sudden temperature changes that may damage the crystals.

== Related silica minerals ==
Tridymite and cristobalite are high-temperature polymorphs of SiO2 that occur in high-silica volcanic rocks. Coesite is a denser polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites and in metamorphic rocks formed at pressures greater than those typical of the Earth&#x27;s crust. Stishovite is a yet denser and higher-pressure polymorph of SiO2 found in some meteorite impact sites. Moganite is a monoclinic polymorph. Lechatelierite is an amorphous silica glass SiO2 which is formed by lightning strikes in quartz sand.

== Safety ==
As quartz is a form of silica, it is a possible cause for concern in various workplaces. Cutting, grinding, chipping, sanding, drilling, and polishing natural and manufactured stone products can release hazardous levels of very small, crystalline silica dust particles into the air that workers breathe. Crystalline silica of respirable size is a recognized human carcinogen and may lead to other diseases of the lungs such as silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis.

== Synthetic and artificial treatments ==

Not all varieties of quartz are naturally occurring. Some clear quartz crystals can be treated using heat or gamma-irradiation to induce color where it would not otherwise have occurred naturally. Susceptibility to such treatments depends on the location from which the quartz was mined.

Prasiolite, an olive colored material, is produced by heat treatment; natural prasiolite has also been observed in Lower Silesia in Poland. Although citrine occurs naturally, the majority is the result of heat-treating amethyst or smoky quartz. Carnelian has been heat-treated to deepen its color since prehistoric times.

Because natural quartz is often twinned, synthetic quartz is produced for use in industry. Large, flawless, single crystals are synthesized in an autoclave via the hydrothermal process.

Like other crystals, quartz may be coated with metal vapors to give it an attractive sheen.

== Uses ==

Quartz is the most common material identified as the mystical substance maban in Australian Aboriginal mythology. It is found regularly in passage tomb cemeteries in Europe in a burial context, such as Newgrange or Carrowmore in Ireland. Quartz was also used in Prehistoric Ireland, as well as many other countries, for stone tools; both vein quartz and rock crystal were knapped as part of the lithic technology of the prehistoric peoples.

While jade has been since earliest times the most prized semi-precious stone for carving in East Asia and Pre-Columbian America, in Europe and the Middle East the different varieties of quartz were the most commonly used for the various types of jewelry and hardstone carving, including engraved gems and cameo gems, rock crystal vases, and extravagant vessels. The tradition continued to produce objects that were very highly valued until the mid-19th century, when it largely fell from fashion except in jewelry. Cameo technique exploits the bands of color in onyx and other varieties.

Efforts to synthesize quartz began in the mid-nineteenth century as scientists attempted to create minerals under laboratory conditions that mimicked the conditions in which the minerals formed in nature: German geologist Karl Emil von Schafhäutl (1803–1890) was the first person to synthesize quartz when in 1845 he created microscopic quartz crystals in a pressure cooker. However, the quality and size of the crystals that were produced by these early efforts were poor.

Elemental impurity incorporation strongly influences the ability to process and utilize quartz. Naturally occurring quartz crystals of extremely high purity, necessary for the crucibles and other equipment used for growing silicon wafers in the semiconductor industry, are expensive and rare. These high-purity quartz are defined as containing less than 50 ppm of impurity elements. A major mining location for high purity quartz is the Spruce Pine Gem Mine in Spruce Pine, North Carolina, United States. Quartz may also be found in Caldoveiro Peak, in Asturias, Spain.

By the 1930s, the electronics industry had become dependent on quartz crystals. The only source of suitable crystals was Brazil; however, World War II disrupted the supplies from Brazil, so nations attempted to synthesize quartz on a commercial scale. German mineralogist Richard Nacken (1884–1971) achieved some success during the 1930s and 1940s. After the war, many laboratories attempted to grow large quartz crystals. In the United States, the U.S. Army Signal Corps contracted with Bell Laboratories and with the Brush Development Company of Cleveland, Ohio to synthesize crystals following Nacken&#x27;s lead. (Prior to World War II, Brush Development produced piezoelectric crystals for record players.) By 1948, Brush Development had grown crystals that were 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter, the largest at that time. By the 1950s, hydrothermal synthesis techniques were producing synthetic quartz crystals on an industrial scale, and today virtually all the quartz crystal used in the modern electronics industry is synthetic.

An early use of the piezoelectricity of quartz crystals was in phonograph pickups. One of the most common piezoelectric uses of quartz today is as a crystal oscillator. The quartz oscillator or resonator was first developed by Walter Guyton Cady in 1921. George Washington Pierce designed and patented quartz crystal oscillators in 1923. The quartz clock is a familiar device using the mineral. Warren Marrison created the first quartz oscillator clock based on the work of Cady and Pierce in 1927. The resonant frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is changed by mechanically loading it, and this principle is used for very accurate measurements of very small mass changes in the quartz crystal microbalance and in thin-film thickness monitors.

Almost all the industrial demand for quartz crystal (used primarily in electronics) is met with synthetic quartz produced by the hydrothermal process. However, synthetic crystals are less prized for use as gemstones. The popularity of crystal healing has increased the demand for natural quartz crystals, which are now often mined in developing countries using primitive mining methods, sometimes involving child labor.

<text>From the time of Plato through the Middle Ages, the quadrivium (plural: quadrivia) was a grouping of four subjects or arts—arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy—that formed a second curricular stage following preparatory work in the &quot;trivium&quot;, consisting of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. Together, the &quot; trivium&quot; and the &quot;quadrivium&quot; comprised the seven liberal arts, and formed the basis of a liberal arts education in Western society until gradually displaced as a curricular structure by the &quot;studia humanitatis&quot; and its later offshoots, beginning with Petrarch in the 14th century. The seven classical arts were considered &quot;thinking skills&quot; and were distinguished from practical arts, such as medicine and architecture.

The &quot;quadrivium&quot;, Latin for &#x27;four ways&#x27;, and its use for the four subjects have been attributed to Boethius, who
was apparently the first to use the term when affirming that the height of philosophy can be attained only following &quot;a sort of fourfold path&quot; (&quot;quodam quasi quadruvio&quot;). It was considered the foundation for the study of philosophy (sometimes called the &quot;liberal art &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;) and theology. The &quot;quadrivium&quot; was the upper division of medieval educational provision in the liberal arts, which comprised arithmetic (number in the abstract), geometry (number in space), music (number in time), and astronomy (number in space and time).

Educationally, the &quot;trivium&quot; and the &quot;quadrivium&quot; imparted to the student the seven essential thinking skills of classical antiquity. Altogether the Seven Liberal Arts belonged to the so-called &#x27;lower faculty&#x27; (of Arts), whereas Medicine, Jurisprudence (Law), and Theology were established in the three so-called &#x27;higher&#x27; faculties. It was therefore quite common in the middle ages for lecturers in the lower trivium and/or quadrivium faculty to be students themselves in one of the higher faculties. Philosophy was typically &quot;neither&quot; a subject &quot;nor&quot; a faculty in its own right, but was rather present &quot;implicitly&quot; as an &#x27;auxiliary tool&#x27; within the discourses of the higher faculties, especially theology; the separation of philosophy from theology and its elevation to an autonomous academic discipline were post-medieval developments.

Displacement of the quadrivium by other curricular approaches from the time of Petrarch gained momentum with the subsequent Renaissance emphasis on what became the modern humanities, one of four liberal arts of the modern era, alongside natural science (where much of the actual subject matter of the original quadrivium now resides), social science, and the arts; though it may appear that music in the quadrivium would be a modern branch of performing arts, it was then an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice, and effectively a branch of music theory more tightly bound to arithmetic than to musical expression.

==Origins==
These four studies compose the secondary part of the curriculum outlined by Plato in &quot;The Republic&quot; and are described in the seventh book of that work (in the order Arithmetic, Geometry, Astronomy, Music).
The quadrivium is implicit in early Pythagorean writings and in the &quot;De nuptiis&quot; of Martianus Capella, although the term &quot;quadrivium&quot; was not used until Boethius, early in the sixth century. As Proclus wrote:

The Pythagoreans considered all mathematical science to be divided into four parts: one half they marked off as concerned with quantity, the other half with magnitude; and each of these they posited as twofold. A quantity can be considered in regard to its character by itself or in its relation to another quantity, magnitudes as either stationary or in motion. Arithmetic studies quantities as such, music the relations between quantities, geometry magnitude at rest, spherics [astronomy] magnitude inherently moving.

==Medieval usage==
At many medieval universities, this would have been the course leading to the degree of Master of Arts (after the BA). After the MA, the student could enter for bachelor&#x27;s degrees of the higher faculties (Theology, Medicine or Law). To this day, some of the postgraduate degree courses lead to the degree of Bachelor (the B.Phil and B.Litt. degrees are examples in the field of philosophy).

The study was eclectic, approaching the philosophical objectives sought by considering it from each aspect of the quadrivium within the general structure demonstrated by Proclus (AD 412–485), namely arithmetic and music on the one hand and geometry and cosmology on the other.

The subject of music within the quadrivium was originally the classical subject of harmonics, in particular the study of the proportions between the musical intervals created by the division of a monochord. A relationship to music as actually practised was not part of this study, but the framework of classical harmonics would substantially influence the content and structure of music theory as practised in both European and Islamic cultures.

==Modern usage==
In modern applications of the liberal arts as curriculum in colleges or universities, the quadrivium may be considered to be the study of number and its relationship to space or time: arithmetic was pure number, geometry was number in space, music was number in time, and astronomy was number in space and time. Morris Kline classified the four elements of the quadrivium as pure (arithmetic), stationary (geometry), moving (astronomy), and applied (music) number.

This schema is sometimes referred to as &quot;classical education&quot;, but it is more accurately a development of the 12th- and 13th-century Renaissance with recovered classical elements, rather than an organic growth from the educational systems of antiquity. The term continues to be used by the classical education movement and at the independent Oundle School, in the United Kingdom.

<text>Quadrupedalism is a form of locomotion where animals have four legs that are used to bear weight and move around. An animal or machine that usually maintains a four-legged posture and moves using all four legs is said to be a quadruped (from Latin &quot;quattuor&quot; for &quot;four&quot;, and &quot;pes&quot;, &quot;pedis&quot; for &quot;foot&quot;). Quadruped animals are found among both vertebrates and invertebrates.

==Quadrupeds vs. tetrapods==
Although the words ‘quadruped’ and ‘tetrapod’ are both derived from terms meaning ‘four-footed’, they have distinct meanings. A tetrapod is any member of the taxonomic unit Tetrapoda (which is defined by descent from a specific four-limbed ancestor), whereas a quadruped actually uses four limbs for locomotion. Not all tetrapods are quadrupeds and not all entities that could be described as ‘quadrupedal’ are tetrapods. This last meaning includes certain artificial objects; almost all quadruped &quot;organisms&quot; are tetrapods (one exception is some raptorial arthropods adapted for four-footed locomotion, such as the Mantodea. Another example is brush-footed butterflies (Nymphalidae), the largest butterfly family with ~6000 species, including the well-known monarch (shown in photo)).

The distinction between quadrupeds and tetrapods is important in evolutionary biology, particularly in the context of tetrapods whose limbs have adapted to other roles (e.g., hands in the case of humans, wings in the case of birds and bats, and fins in the case of whales). All of these animals are tetrapods, but not all are quadrupeds. Even snakes, whose limbs have become vestigial or lost entirely, are, nevertheless, tetrapods.

== In infants and for exercise ==

Quadrupedalism is sometimes referred to as being &quot;on all fours&quot;, and is observed in crawling, especially by infants.

In the 20th century quadrupedal movement was popularized as a form of physical exercise by Georges Hebert. Kenichi Ito is a Japanese man famous for speed running on four limbs in competitions.

==Other human quadrupedalism==
In July 2005, in rural Turkey, scientists discovered five Turkish siblings who habitually walked on both their hands and feet. Unlike chimpanzees, which ambulate on their knuckles, the Ulas family walked on their palms, allowing them to preserve the dexterity of their fingers.

==Quadrupedal robots==

BigDog is a dynamically stable quadruped robot created in 2005 by Boston Dynamics with Foster-Miller, the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Harvard University Concord Field Station. Its successor was Spot.

Also by NASA JPL, in collaboration with University of California, Santa Barbara Robotics Lab, is RoboSimian, with emphasis on stability and deliberation. It has been demonstrated at the DARPA Robotics Challenge.

== Pronograde posture ==
A related concept to quadrupedalism is pronogrady, or having a horizontal posture of the trunk. Although nearly all quadrupedal animals are pronograde, bipedal animals also have that posture, including many living birds and extinct dinosaurs.

Nonhuman apes with orthograde (vertical) backs may walk quadrupedally in what is called knuckle-walking.
