<text>Synchronized swimming (in British English, synchronised swimming), also known as artistic swimming, is a sport where swimmers perform a synchronized choreographed routine, accompanied by music. The sport is governed internationally by World Aquatics (formerly known as FINA). It has traditionally been a women&#x27;s sport, although FINA introduced a new mixed gender duet competition that included one male swimmer in each duet at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships and European Aquatics introduced men&#x27;s individual events at the 2022 European Aquatics Championships. From 2024, men are able to compete in the team event at the Olympics.

Synchronized swimming has been part of the Summer Olympics program since 1984, featuring both women&#x27;s duet and team events. In 2017, under the instruction of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FINA renamed the sport from &quot;synchronized swimming&quot; to &quot;artistic swimming&quot; —a decision that has faced controversy. The new official name has yet to gain general acceptance beyond the core of the sport.

== History ==

At the turn of the 20th century, synchronized swimming was referred to as water ballet. The first recorded synchronized swimming competition took place in 1891 in Berlin, Germany. During this period, many swim clubs were formed, and the sport simultaneously developed in Canada. As well as existing as a sport, it often constituted a popular addition to Music Hall evenings, in the larger variety theatres of London or Glasgow which were equipped with on-stage water tanks for the purpose.

In 1917, Australian Annette Kellerman popularised the sport when she performed in a water ballet at the New York Hippodrome. After experimenting with various diving actions and stunts in the water, Katherine Curtis started one of the first water ballet clubs at the University of Chicago, where the team began executing strokes, &quot;tricks&quot;, and floating formations. Curtis is widely credited as the true originator of synchronized swimming; important historical details regarding the origin of the phrase &quot;synchronized swimming&quot;, its reference to the Olympic sport, and the technical structure of that sport are all credited to Curtis.

Busby Berkeley created a 15-minute &quot;aquacade&quot; for the 1933 film &quot;Footlight Parade&quot;, &quot;By a Waterfall&quot;. According to TCM.com, &quot;The set, complete with an 80-by-40-foot swimming pool, took up an entire soundstage. Berkeley had the pool lined with glass walls and a glass floor so he could shoot the swimmers from every possible angle. Then he designed the swimming suits and bathing caps to create the illusion that the women were almost naked.&quot; It was shot in six days after two weeks&#x27; rehearsal... &quot;The results were so spectacular that the audience at the premiere gave the number a standing ovation and threw their programs in the air. Broadway impresario Billy Rose even tried to steal Berkeley from Warners to stage his aquacade.&quot;

On May 27, 1939, the first U.S. synchronised swimming competition took place at Wright Junior College between Wright and the Chicago Teachers&#x27; College.

In 1924, the first competition in North America was in Montreal, with Peg Seller as the first champion. Other important pioneers of the sport are Beulah Gundling, Käthe Jacobi, Marion Kane Elston, Dawn Bean, Billie MacKellar, Teresa Anderson, Gail Johnson, Gail Emery, Charlotte Davis, Mary Derosier, Norma Olsen, and Clark Leach. Charlotte Davis coached Tracie Ruiz and Candy Costie, who won the gold medal in duet synchronised swimming at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.

In 1933 and 1934, Katherine Curtis organised a show, &quot;The Kay Curtis Modern Mermaids&quot;, for the World Exhibition in Chicago. The announcer, Norman Ross, introduced the sport as &quot;synchronised swimming&quot; for the first time. The term eventually became standardised through the AAU, but Curtis still used the term &quot;rhythmic swimming&quot; in her book, &quot;Rhythmic Swimming: A Source Book of Synchronised Swimming and Water Pageantry&quot; (Minneapolis: Burgess Publishing Co., 1936).

Curtis persuaded the AAU to make synchronised swimming an officially recognised sport in December 1941, but she herself transferred overseas in 1943. She served as the Recreation Director of the Red Cross under Generals Patton and Eisenhower, during which time she produced the first international aquacade in Caserta, Italy. She was the Director of Travel in post-war Europe until 1962. In 1959 the Helms Hall of Fame officially recognised Curtis (along with Annette Kellerman) – ascribing to her the primary development of synchronised swimming. In 1979, the International Swimming Hall of Fame inducted Curtis with similar accolades.

The first Official National Team Championships were held in Chicago at Riis Pool on August 11, 1946. The Town Club &#x27;C&#x27; team were the first national champions. The team was composed of: Polly Wesner, Nancy Hanna, Doris Dieskow, Marion Mittlacher, Shirley Brown, Audrey Huettenrauch, Phyllis Burrell and Priscilla Hirsch.

Esther Williams, a national AAU champion swimmer, popularized synchronised swimming during WWII and after, through (often elaborately staged) scenes in Hollywood films such as &quot;Bathing Beauty&quot; (1944), &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; (1952), and &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1955). In the 1970s and 1980s, Ft. Lauderdale swimming champion Charkie Phillips revived water ballet on television with The Krofftettes in &quot;The Brady Bunch Hour&quot; (1976–1977), NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Show&quot; (1980), and then on screen with Miss Piggy in &quot;The Great Muppet Caper&quot; (1981).

Margaret Swan Forbes published &quot;Coaching Synchronized Swimming Effectively&quot; in 1984; it was the first official teaching manual for synchronized swimming.

In July 2017, following a request by the IOC, FINA approved changes to its constitution that renamed synchronised swimming to &quot;artistic swimming&quot;. FINA justified the change by stating that it would help to clarify the nature of the sport (with the new name being similar to artistic gymnastics), and claimed it would help &quot;enhance its popularity&quot;. The changes received criticism, with swimmers and coaches arguing that they were never consulted, and that the name &quot;artistic swimming&quot; diminishes the athleticism of the sport which already had historically faced an &quot;uphill battle to be taken seriously&quot;. Another objection raised was that rebranding would cost federations and other groups involved in the sport sums of money that neither the IOC nor FINA was willing to compensate. Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vitaly Mutko vowed that the country would still refer to the sport as synchronised swimming, stating that &quot;to keep the name synchronised swimming is our right, and if the Federation itself, the coaches will want it, we will do it&quot;. Since then, most national governing bodies have adopted the new name, some such as the U.S. adopted it after a delay (in 2020), with the CEO of USA Artistic Swimming stating that &quot;19 of the top 25 countries in the world are either partially or fully using the name artistic swimming&quot;. Competitions where the new name was first used include the 2019 World Aquatics Championships and the 2018 Asian Games. It was also used at the 2020 Summer Olympics and the 2020 European Aquatics Championships.

In 2022, a spattering of competitions introduced men-only individual (solo) events for the first time, including the 2022 European Aquatics Championships and the 2022 World Junior Artistic Swimming Championships. This followed the addition of mixed gender events featuring one male and one female swimmer at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. Later in the year, in December, the International Olympic Committee announced men were eligible to compete at the 2024 Olympic Games only in a mixed gender team event, with a cap on male participation at 25% of team event members, following the up-to-two men format of mixed gender team events at the 2022 FINA Artistic Swimming World Series.

In 2023, World Aquatics added men&#x27;s solo events to the artistic swimming program for the first time at a World Aquatics Championships, scheduling the debut for the 2023 World Aquatics Championships.

== Olympic Games ==
The first Olympic demonstration of synchronized swimming was at the 1952 Olympic Games, where the Helsinki officials welcomed Katherine Curtis and lit a torch in her honor. Curtis died in 1980, but synchronised swimming did not become an official Olympic sport until the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. It was also not until 1968 that synchronised swimming became officially recognized by FINA as the fourth water sport next to swimming, platform diving and water polo.

From 1984 through 1992, the Summer Olympic Games featured solo and duet competitions, but they were both dropped in 1996 in favor of team competition. At the 2000 Olympic Games, however, the duet competition was restored and is now featured alongside the team competition. At the 2024 Olympic Games, men were included in competition for the first time. Additionally, these games included a team acrobatic routine round.

== World Aquatics Championships ==
Synchronized swimming has been part of the World Aquatics Championships since the beginning. From 1973 through 2001, the World Aquatics Championships featured solo, duet and team competitions. In 2003, a free routine combination, comprising elements of solo, duet and team, was added. In 2005, it was renamed free combination. In 2007, solo, duet and team events were split between technical and free routines. In 2015, the mixed duet (technical and free) were added to the competition program. In 2019, the highlight routine was added into the competition program and it was renamed into acrobatic routine in 2023. Also in 2023, the men&#x27;s solo (technical and free routines) were added to the competition program.

== European Aquatics Championships ==
Artistic swimming is part of the program of the European Aquatics Championships from 1974. A stand alone European Aquatics Artistic Swimming Championships was incorporated into the 2023 European Games, for the first time taking place outside the larger European Aquatics Championships.

== Basic skills ==

=== Sculls ===

Sculls (hand movements used to propel the body) are some of the most essential skills in synchronised swimming. Commonly used sculls include support scull, stationary scull, propeller scull, alligator scull, torpedo scull, split scull, barrel scull, spinning scull, totem scull, canoe scull and paddle scull. The support scull is used most often to support the body while a swimmer is performing upside down.

=== Eggbeater ===
The &quot;eggbeater kick&quot; is another important skill of synchronised swimming. It is a form of treading water that allows for stability and height above the water while leaving the hands free to perform arm motions. An average eggbeater height is usually around collarbone level. Eggbeater is used in all &quot;arm&quot; sections, a piece of choreography in which the swimmer is upright, often with one or both arms in the air. Another variation is a body boost, which is executed through an eggbeater buildup and a strong whip kick, propelling the swimmer out of the water vertically. A body boost can raise a swimmer out of the water to hip level

== Lifts and highlights ==

A lift or highlight is when members of the team propel another teammate relatively high out of the water. They are quite common in routines of older age groups and higher skill levels.
There are many variations on lifts and these can include partner lifts, float patterns or other areas of unique, artistic choreography intended to exceptionally impress the judges and audience.

=== Parts ===

There are typically three parts to lifts in synchronised swimming: The top (or &quot;flyer&quot;), the base, and the pushers. However, sometimes there is no base and the pushers push the flyer directly.
* The Flyer is usually the smallest member of the team. Flyers must be agile and flexible, with a preferable gymnastics background if they are jumping off the lift.
* The Base tends to be of average size. Intense leg strength and a solid core is mandatory as well as the ability to hold a squat position.
* The Feet/Lifters/Pushers are the team members that provide the force for the base to explosively stand up, and the flyer to gain height out of the water.

=== Common types ===
* The platform lift is the oldest form of highlight. In a platform, the base lays out in a back layout position underwater. The top sets in a squatting position on her torso and stands once the lift reaches the surface. The remaining teammates use eggbeater to hold the platform and the top out of the water.
* The stack lift is the most common form of lifts in synchro. The base sets up in a squatting position a few feet underwater, with the lifters holding her feet and/or legs. The top then squats on the shoulders of the base. As the lift rises, lifters extend their arms while the base and top extend their legs to achieve maximum height. A common addition to a stack lift is a rotation while it ascends or descends.
* A toss or throw is set up exactly like a stack lift. However, when the lift reaches its full height, the &quot;flyer&quot; on top of the lift will jump off of their teammate&#x27;s shoulders, usually performing some sort of acrobatic movement or position. This is a very difficult lift and should only be attempted by experienced swimmers.
* A basket or bunken toss is a newer form of highlight that utilizes a small platform created by the interlocking hands of two lifters persons, with the flyer standing on their hands, and the base inverted standing on the underside of their hands. There will be one person lifting each of the lifters&#x27; waists, and another person deep under the basket assisting the base in remaining vertical. These highlights are often used by national teams to achieve exceptional height out of the water for the flyer.

== Positions ==

There are hundreds of different regular positions that can be used to create seemingly infinite combinations. These are a few basic and commonly used ones:
* Back Layout: The most basic position. The body floats, completely straight and rigid, face-up on the surface while sculling under the hips.
* Back Tuck Somersault: Start in a back layout position. Bring your legs into your chest and pivot yourself backwards doing a full rotation or 360. From the tuck position, extend your legs and finish in a back layout position.
* Ballet Leg: Beginning in a back layout, one leg is extended and held perpendicular to the body, while the other is held parallel to the surface of the water.
* Bent Knee (or Heron): While holding a vertical body position, one leg remains vertical while the other leg bends so that its toe is touching the knee of the vertical leg.
* Crane (or Fishtail): While holding a vertical body position, one leg remains vertical while the other is dropped parallel to the surface, making a 90-degree angle or &quot;L&quot; shape. More specifically, a crane position requires the 90-degree angle in the legs (even if the bottom leg is submerged), while a fishtail requires the bottom foot to be at the surface which may or may not create a 90-degree angle in the legs depending on height.
* Double Ballet Leg: Similar to ballet leg position where both legs are extended and held perpendicular to the body.
* Flamingo: Similar to ballet leg position where bottom leg is pulled into the chest so that the shin of the bottom leg is touching the knee of the vertical leg, while remaining parallel to the surface of the water.
* Front Layout: Much like a Back Layout, the only difference is that the swimmer is on his/her stomach, sculling by his/her chest, and not breathing.
* Front Walkover: Begin in a front layout position. Scull downwards into a pike position. Lift one leg vertically into a crane position. Lower that same leg into a split position. Lift the remaining leg vertically into a knight position. Lower the remaining leg and scull above your head into a back layout position.
* Knight: The body is in a surface arch position, where the legs are flat on the surface, and the body is arched so that the head is vertically in line with the hips. One leg is lifted, creating a vertical line perpendicular to the surface.
* Side Fishtail: Side fishtail is a position which one leg remains vertical, while the other is extended out to the side parallel to the water, creating a side &quot;Y&quot; position.
* Split Position: With the body vertical, one leg is stretched forward along the surface and the other extended back along the surface, in an upside down split position.
* Tower: Start in a front layout position. Scull downwards into a pike position. Lift one leg vertically into a crane position. Lift the other leg into a vertical position and descend into the water.
* Tub: Both legs are pulled up to the chest with the shins and tops of the feet dry and parallel on the surface of the water.
* Vertical: Achieved by holding the body completely straight upside down and perpendicular to the surface usually with both legs entirely out of water.

The International Olympic Committee has further described the technical positions.

== Routine ==

Routines are composed of &quot;figures&quot; (leg movements), arm sections and highlights. Swimmers are synchronised both to each other and to the music. During a routine swimmers can never use the bottom of the pool for support, but rather depend on sculling motions with the arms, and eggbeater kick to keep afloat. After the performance, the swimmers are judged and scored on their performance based on execution, artistic impression, and difficulty. Execution of technical skill, difficulty, patterns, choreography, and synchronization are all critical to achieving a high score.

=== Technical vs. free routines ===

Depending on the competition level, swimmers will perform a &quot;technical&quot; routine with predetermined elements that must be performed in a specific order. The technical routine acts as a replacement for the figure event. In addition to the technical routine, the swimmers will perform a longer &quot;free&quot; routine, which has no requirements and is a chance for the swimmers to get creative and innovative with their choreography.

=== Length ===

The type of routine and competition level determines the length of routines. Routines typically last two to four minutes, the shortest being the technical solo, with length added as the number of swimmers is increased (duets, teams, combos and highlight). Age and skill level are other important factors in determining the required routine length.

=== Scoring ===

Previously, free routines are scored on a scale of 100, with points for execution, artistic impression, and difficulty. As of 2021, however, the scoring system was changed so that difficulty and execution was worth more than artistic impression. Therefore, free routines now have no upper limit when it comes to final scores. Technical routines have also the evaluation of technical elements.
In group routines a group consists of 8 competitors for World Championships and FINA events, each missing participant brings penalty points to the team. A group can consist of a minimum of 4 competitors and a maximum of 10 (for Free Combination and Highlight). If a swimmer touches the bottom, they will be given a penalty; however, if they use the bottom (by pushing off of it), they will be disqualified.

== Preparation ==

When performing routines in competition and practice, competitors wear a rubber noseclip to keep water from entering their nose when submerged. Some swimmers wear earplugs to keep the water out of their ears. Hair is worn in a bun and flavorless gelatin, Knox, is applied to keep hair in place; a decorative headpiece is secured (bobby-pinned or sewed) to the bun. Recently, a new substance has been developed to replace Knox, called Synkro Gelatin. Rarely, swimmers wear custom-made swimming caps in place of their hair in buns.

Competitors wear custom swimsuits, usually elaborately decorated with bright fabric and sequins to reflect the music to which they are swimming. The costume and music are not judged but create an aesthetic appeal to the audience.

Makeup is also worn in this sport, but FINA has required a more natural look. No &quot;theatrical make-up&quot; is allowed, only makeup that provides a natural, clean and healthy glow is acceptable. In Canada, eye makeup must be smaller than a circle made by the swimmer&#x27;s thumb and forefinger, and be used solely for &quot;natural enhancement&quot;.

Underwater speakers ensure that swimmers can hear the music and aid their ability to synchronize with each other. Routines are prepared and set to counts in the music to further ensure synchronization. Coaches use underwater speakers to communicate with the swimmers during practice. Goggles, though worn during practice, are not permitted during routine competition unless the swimmers have medical disabilities or conditions.

== Competitions ==
=== Figures ===

A standard meet begins with the swimmers doing &quot;figures&quot;, which are progressions between positions performed individually without music. All swimmers must compete wearing the standard black swimsuit and white swim cap, as well as goggles and a noseclip. Figures are performed in front of a panel of 5 judges who score individual swimmers from 1 to 10 (10 being the best). If the swimmer does not do the correct figure, it may result in them getting a zero. The figure competition prefaces the routine events. However, figures are only performed when a swimmer is under the age of 15/16 and has not reached the junior age group.

=== United States ===

In the United States, competitors are divided into groups by age. The eight age groups are: 12 and under, 13–15, 16–17, 18–19, Junior (elite 15–18), Senior (elite 15+), Collegiate, and Master. In addition to these groups, younger swimmers may be divided by ability into 3 levels: Novice, Intermediate, and age group. Certain competitions require the athlete(s) to pass a certain Grade Level. Grades as of now range from Level one to Level six, and will soon go to Level ten. Seasons range in length, and some swimmers participate year-round in competitions. There are many levels of competition, including but not limited to: State, Regional, Zone, National, Junior Olympic, and US Junior and Senior Opens. Each swimmer may compete in the following routine events: solo, duet, combo (consisting of ten swimmers), and team (consisting of eight swimmers). In the 12 &amp; under and 13-15 age groups, figure scores are combined with routines to determine the final rankings. The 16-17 and 18-19 age groups combine the scores of the technical and free routines to determine the final rankings. USA Synchro&#x27;s annual intercollegiate championships have been dominated by The Ohio State University, Stanford University, Lindenwood University (which no longer has a collegiate program), and The University of the Incarnate Word.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, as of 2010, synchronized swimming has an age-based structure system with age groups 10 &amp; under, 12 &amp; under, and 13–15 for the provincial levels. There is also a skill level which is 13–15 and juniors (16–18) known as national stream, as well as competition at the Masters and University levels. The 13–15 age group and 16–18 age group are national stream athletes that align with international age groups – 15 and Under and Junior (16–18) and Senior (18+) level athletes. Wildrose age group is for competitors before they reach 13–15 national stream. Wildrose ranges from Tier 8 and under 16 and over provincial/wildrose. These are also competitive levels. Recreational levels, called &quot;stars&quot;, also exist. Synchro Canada requires that a competitor must pass Star 3 before entering Tier 1. To get into a Tier a swimmer must take a test for that Tier. In these tests, the swimmer must be able to perform the required movements for the level. (Canada no longer uses Tiers as a form of level placement). The Canadian University synchronised swimming League (CUASL) is intended for Canadian Swimmers who wish to continue their participation in the sport during their university studies, as well as offering a &quot;Novice&quot; category for those new to the sport. Traditionally, the top teams hail from McGill University, the University of Ottawa, and the University of British Columbia.

=== Men&#x27;s and mixed competition ===

Some international, national and regional competitions allow men to compete, and the Fédération internationale de natation (FINA) introduced a new mixed duet competition at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships.

In the late 19th century, synchronised swimming was a male-only event. However, in the 20th century it became a women&#x27;s sport, with men banned from many competitions. In the U.S., men were allowed to participate with women until 1941, when synchronised swimming became part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU). The AAU required men and women to compete separately, which resulted in a decline of male participants. In the 1940s and 1950s, Bert Hubbard and Donn Squire were among the top US male competitors.

In 1978, the U.S. changed their rules to allow men to once again compete with women. Rules in other countries varied; in the UK, men were prohibited from competing until 2014, while in France, Benoît Beaufils was allowed to compete at national events in the 1990s. American Bill May was a top competitor in the late-1990s and early-2000s. He medalled in several international events, including the 1998 Goodwill Games. However, male competitors were barred from top competitions, including the World Aquatics Championships and the Olympics. However, at the 2015 World Aquatics Championships, FINA introduced a new mixed duet discipline. Both May and Beaufils returned from decade-long retirements to represent their countries. Among their competitors were Russian Aleksandr Maltsev and Italian Giorgio Minisini, both over 15 years younger than May and Beaufils. Pairs from ten countries competed in the inaugural events. The 2016 European Aquatics Championships was the first time men were allowed to compete at the European Championships. While men are allowed in more events, they were still barred from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics. FINA did propose adding the mixed duet competition to the 2020 Summer Olympics.

In 2022, FINA allowed men to compete as soloists at the 2022 FINA Artistic Swimming World Series and the 2022 FINA World Junior Artistic Swimming Championships and LEN allowed men to compete as soloists both at the European Junior Championships and the 2022 European Aquatics Championships. The International Olympic Committee allowed for the participation of up to two men per team of eight in a mixed gender team event at the 2024 Olympic Games, competition of men in duet, solo, and men-only team events was not permitted. The mixed team format for the 2024 Olympic Games was adapted from the mixed team format, up to two men allowed per team, used at the 2022 FINA Artistic Swimming World Series (March to May 2022).

Men&#x27;s solo events debuted at the senior World Championships level at the 2023 World Aquatics Championships with solo technical and solo free routines.

== Injuries ==

Common injuries that may occur in synchronized swimming are tendon injuries, as the sport tends to cause muscle imbalances. Common joint injuries include the rotator cuff and the knees.

In their 2012 book &quot;Concussions and Our Kids&quot;, Dr. Robert Cantu and Mark Hyman quoted Dr. Bill Moreau, the medical director for the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC), as saying, &quot;These women are superior athletes. They&#x27;re in the pool eight hours a day. Literally, they&#x27;re within inches of one another, sculling and paddling. As they go through their various routines, they&#x27;re literally kicking each other in the head.&quot; Moreau said that during a two-week training session in Colorado Springs, the female athletes suffered a 50% concussion rate. As a result, the USOC began reassessing concussion awareness and prevention for all sports.

Others believe the incidence of concussions among synchronized swimmers is much higher, especially among the sport&#x27;s elite athletes. &quot;I would say 100 percent of my athletes will get a concussion at some point,&quot; said Myriam Glez, a former French synchronized swimmer and coach. &quot;It might be minor, might be more serious, but at some point or another, they will get hit.&quot;

<text>Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, such as saltwater or freshwater environments, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Swimmers achieve locomotion by coordinating limb and body movements to achieve hydrodynamic thrust that results in directional motion. Newborns can instinctively hold their breath underwater and exhibit rudimentary swimming movements as part of a survival reflex. Swimming requires endurance, skill, and efficient techniques to maximize speed and minimize energy consumption.

Swimming is a popular activity and competitive sport where certain techniques are deployed to move through water. It offers numerous health benefits, such as strengthened cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and increased flexibility. It is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.

Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum. As a formalized sport, swimming is featured in various local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics.

Swimming involves repeated motions known as strokes to propel the body forward. While the front crawl, also known as freestyle, is widely regarded as the fastest of the four main strokes, other strokes are practiced for special purposes, such as training.

Swimming comes with certain risks, mainly because of the aquatic environment where it takes place. For instance, swimmers may find themselves incapacitated by panic and exhaustion, both potential causes of death by drowning. Other dangers may arise from exposure to infection or hostile aquatic fauna. To minimize such eventualities, most facilities employ a lifeguard to keep alert for any signs of distress.

Swimmers often wear specialized swimwear, although depending on the area&#x27;s culture, some swimmers may also swim nude or wear their day attire. In addition, a variety of equipment can be used to enhance the swimming experience or performance, including but not limited to the use of swimming goggles, floatation devices, swim fins, and snorkels.

==Science==

Swimming relies on the nearly neutral buoyancy of the human body. On average, the body has a relative density of 0.98 compared to water, which causes the body to float. However, buoyancy varies based on body composition, lung inflation, muscle and fat content, centre of gravity and the salinity of the water. Higher levels of body fat and saltier water both lower the relative density of the body and increase its buoyancy. Because they tend to have a lower centre of gravity and higher muscle content, human males find it more difficult to float or be buoyant. See also: &quot;Hydrostatic weighing.&quot; 

Since the human body is less dense than water, water can support the body&#x27;s weight during swimming. As a result, swimming is &quot;low-impact&quot; compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.

Hydrodynamics is important to stroke technique for swimming faster, and swimmers who want to swim faster or exhaust less try to reduce the drag of the body&#x27;s motion through the water. To be more hydrodynamically effective, swimmers can either increase the power of their strokes or reduce water resistance. However, power must increase by a factor of three to achieve the same effect as reducing resistance. Efficient swimming by reducing water resistance involves a horizontal water position, rolling the body to reduce the breadth of the body in the water, and extending the arms as far as possible to reduce wave resistance.

Just before plunging into the pool, swimmers may perform exercises such as squatting. Squatting helps enhance a swimmer&#x27;s start by warming up the thigh muscles.

==Infant swimming==

Human babies demonstrate an innate swimming or diving reflex from newborn until approximately ten months. Other mammals also demonstrate this phenomenon (see mammalian diving reflex). The diving response involves apnea, reflex bradycardia, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in other words, babies immersed in water spontaneously hold their breath, slow their heart rate, and reduce blood circulation to the extremities (fingers and toes).
Because infants exhibit instinctual swimming behaviors, though formal training is recommended to reinforce these abilities., classes for babies about six months old are offered in many locations. This helps build muscle memory and makes strong swimmers from a young age.

==Technique==
Swimming can be undertaken using a wide range of styles, known as &#x27;strokes,&#x27; and which are used for different purposes or to distinguish between classes in competitive swimming. Using a defined stroke for propulsion through the water is unnecessary, and untrained swimmers may use a &#x27;doggy paddle&#x27; of arm and leg movements, similar to how four-legged animals swim.

Four main strokes are used in competition and recreational swimming: the front crawl, breaststroke, backstroke, and butterfly. 

In non-competitive swimming, there are some additional swimming strokes, including the sidestroke. The sidestroke, toward the end of the 19th century, changed this pattern by raising one arm above the water first, then the other, and then each in turn. It is still used in lifesaving and recreational swimming.

Other strokes exist for particular reasons, such as training, school lessons, and rescue, and it is often possible to change strokes to avoid using parts of the body, either to separate specific body parts, such as swimming with only arms or legs to exercise them harder, or for amputees or those affected by paralysis.

==History==

Swimming has been recorded since prehistoric times, and the earliest records of swimming date back to Stone Age paintings from around 7,000 years ago. Written references date from 2000 BCE. Some earliest references include the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Bible (Ezekiel 47:5, Acts 27:42, Isaiah 25:11), Beowulf, and other sagas.

In 450 BC, Herodotus described a failed seaborne expedition of Mardonius with the words &quot;…those who could not swim perished from that cause, others from the cold&quot;.

The coastal tribes living in the volatile Low Countries were known as excellent swimmers by the Romans. Men and horses of the Batavi tribe could cross the Rhine without losing formation, according to Tacitus. Dio Cassius describes one surprise tactic employed by Aulus Plautius against the Celts at the Battle of the Medway:

The [British Celts] thought that Romans would not be able to cross it without a bridge, and consequently bivouacked in rather careless fashion on the opposite bank; but he sent across a detachment of [Batavii], who were accustomed to swim easily in full armour across the most turbulent streams. ... Thence the Britons retired to the river Thames at a point near where it empties into the ocean and at flood-tide forms a lake. This they easily crossed because they knew where the firm ground and the easy passages in this region were to be found, but the Romans in attempting to follow them were not so successful. However, the [Batavii] swam across again and some others got over by a bridge a little way up-stream, after which they assailed the barbarians from several sides at once and cut down many of them.

The Talmud, a compendium of Jewish law written compiled c. 500 CE, requires fathers to teach their son how to swim.

In 1538, Nikolaus Wynmann, a Swiss–German professor of languages, wrote the earliest known complete book about swimming, &quot;Colymbetes, sive de arte natandi dialogus et festivus et iucundus lectu&quot; (&quot;The Swimmer, or A Dialogue on the Art of Swimming and Joyful and Pleasant to Read&quot;).

Competitive swimming in Europe started around 1800, mostly using the breaststroke, which started as the current breaststroke arms and the legs of the butterfly stroke. In 1873, John Arthur Trudgen introduced the trudgen to Western swimming competitions. 

The butterfly was developed in the 1930s and was considered a variant of the breaststroke until it was accepted as a separate style in 1953. 

==Purpose==
There are many reasons why people swim, from a recreational pursuit to swimming as a necessary part of a job or other activity. Swimming may also be used to rehabilitate injuries, especially various cardiovascular and muscle injuries. Professional opportunities in swimming range from competitive sports to coaching, lifeguarding, and working in aquatic therapy. Some may be gifted and choose to compete professionally and go on to claim fame.

===Recreation===

Many swimmers swim for recreation, with swimming consistently ranking as one of the physical activities people are most likely to participate in. Recreational swimming can also be used for exercise, relaxation, or rehabilitation. The support of the water and the reduction in impact make swimming accessible for people unable to undertake activities such as running. Swimming is one of the most relaxing activities, and water is known to calm us and help reduce stress.

===Health===

Swimming is primarily a cardiovascular/aerobic exercise due to the long exercise time, requiring a constant oxygen supply, except for short sprints where the muscles work anaerobically. Furthermore, swimming can help tone and strengthen muscles. Regular swimming can help in weight management and contribute to maintaining a healthy body weight. (Robinson 2022) Swimming allows sufferers of arthritis to exercise affected joints without worsening their symptoms. Swimming is often recommended for individuals with joint conditions or injuries, as the buoyancy of water reduces stress on the joints. However, swimmers with arthritis may wish to avoid swimming breaststroke, as improper technique can exacerbate arthritic knee pain. As with most aerobic exercise, swimming reduces the harmful effects of stress. Swimming also improves health for people with cardiovascular problems and chronic illnesses. It is proven to impact the mental health of pregnant women and mothers positively. Swimming can even improve mood. Although many forms of physical activity have been shown to improve bone density and health, this is where swimming has its downfalls. Due to the low-impact nature of the sport, studies have demonstrated that bone mass acquisition will be negatively impacted, which could be an issue for adolescent athletes in particular.

====Disabled swimmers====
Since 2010, the Americans with Disabilities Act has required that swimming pools in the United States be accessible to disabled swimmers.

====Elderly swimmers====
&quot;Water-based exercise can benefit older adults by improving quality of life and decreasing disability. It also improves or maintains the bone health of post-menopausal women.&quot;
Swimming is an ideal workout for the elderly, as it is a low-impact sport with very little risk of injury. Exercise in the water works out all muscle groups, helping with conditions such as muscular dystrophy which is common in seniors. It is also a common way to relieve pain from arthritis.

===Sport===
Swimming as a sport predominantly involves participants competing to be the fastest over a given distance in a certain period of time. Competitors swim different distances in different levels of competition. For example, swimming has been an Olympic sport since 1896, and the current program includes events from 50 m to 1500 m in length, across all four main strokes and medley. During the season competitive swimmers typically train multiple times per day and week to increase endurance, strength, and preserve fitness. Furthermore when the cycle of work is completed swimmers go through a stage called taper where intensity is reduced in preparation for competition season. During taper, focus is on power and water feel.

The sport is governed internationally by World Aquatics, formerly known as FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) before it adopted its current name in December 2022. World Aquatics recognizes competitions of the 25 meter and 50 meter pools for International Competitions. In the United States, a pool of 25 yards in length is commonly used for competition, especially in the College Level. 

Other swimming and water-related sporting disciplines include open water swimming, diving, synchronized swimming, water polo, triathlon, and the modern pentathlon.

===Safety===

To prioritize safety when swimming, swimmers can ensure that there are certified lifeguards present, swimming in designated areas, and being aware of potential hazards such as currents and underwater obstacles. 

As a popular leisure activity done all over the world, one of the primary risks of swimming is drowning. Drowning may occur from a variety of factors, from swimming fatigue to simply inexperience in the water. From 2005 to 2014, an average of 3,536 fatal unintentional drownings occurred in the United States, approximating 10 deaths a day.

To minimize the risk and prevent potential drownings from occurring, lifeguards are often employed to supervise swimming locations such as public pools, waterparks, lakes and beaches. Different lifeguards receive different training depending on the sites that they are employed at; i.e. a waterfront lifeguard receives more rigorous training than a poolside lifeguard. Well-known aquatic training services include the National Lifesaving Society and the Canadian Red Cross, which specialize in training lifeguards in North America. 

Learning basic water safety skills, such as swimming with a buddy and knowing how to respond to emergencies, is essential for swimmers of all levels.

===Occupation===
Some occupations require workers to swim, such as abalone and pearl diving, and spearfishing.

Swimming is used to rescue people in the water who are in distress, including exhausted swimmers, non-swimmers who have accidentally entered the water, and others who have come to harm on the water. Lifeguards or volunteer lifesavers are deployed at many pools and beaches worldwide to fulfil this purpose, and they, as well as rescue swimmers, may use specific swimming styles for rescue purposes.

Swimming is also used in marine biology to observe plants and animals in their natural habitat. Other sciences use swimming; for example, Konrad Lorenz swam with geese as part of his studies of animal behavior.

Swimming also has military purposes. Military swimming is usually done by special operation forces, such as Navy SEALs and US Army Special Forces. Swimming is used to approach a location, gather intelligence, engage in sabotage or combat, and subsequently depart. This may also include airborne insertion into water or exiting a submarine while it is submerged. Due to regular exposure to large bodies of water, all recruits in the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard are required to complete basic swimming or water survival training.

Swimming is also a professional sport. Companies sponsor swimmers who have the skills to compete at the international level. Many swimmers compete competitively to represent their home countries in the Olympics. Professional swimmers may also earn a living as entertainers, performing in water ballets.

=== Locomotion ===
Locomotion by swimming over brief distances is frequent when alternatives are precluded. There have been cases of political refugees swimming in the Baltic Sea and of people jumping in the water and swimming ashore from vessels not intended to reach land where they planned to go.

==Risks==


There are many risks associated with voluntary or involuntary human presence in water, which may result in death directly or through drowning asphyxiation. Swimming is both the goal of much voluntary presence and the prime means of regaining land in accidental situations.

Most recorded water deaths fall into these categories:
* Panic occurs when an inexperienced swimmer or a nonswimmer becomes mentally overwhelmed by the circumstances of their immersion, leading to sinking and drowning. Occasionally, panic kills through hyperventilation, even in shallow water.
* Exhaustion can make a person unable to sustain efforts to swim or tread water, often leading to death through drowning. An adult with fully developed and extended lungs has generally positive or at least neutral buoyancy, and can float with modest effort when calm and in still water. A small child has negative buoyancy and must make a sustained effort to avoid sinking rapidly.
* Hypothermia, in which a person loses critical core temperature, can lead to unconsciousness or heart failure.
* Dehydration from prolonged exposure to hypertonic salt water—or, less frequently, salt water aspiration syndrome where inhaled salt water creates foam in the lungs that restricts breathing—can cause loss of physical control or kill directly without actual drowning. Hypothermia and dehydration also kill directly, without causing drowning, even when the person wears a life vest.
* Blunt trauma in a fast moving flood or river water can kill a swimmer outright, or lead to their drowning.

Adverse effects of swimming can include:
* Exostosis, an abnormal bony overgrowth narrowing the ear canal due to frequent, long-term splashing or filling of cold water into the ear canal, also known as surfer&#x27;s ear
* Infection from water-borne bacteria, viruses, or parasites
* Chlorine inhalation (in swimming pools)
* Heart attacks while swimming (the primary cause of sudden death among triathlon participants, occurring at the rate of 1 to 2 per 100,000 participations.)
* Adverse encounters with aquatic life:
** Stings from sea lice, jellyfish, fish, seashells, and some species of coral
** Puncture wounds caused by crabs, lobsters, sea urchins, zebra mussels, stingrays, flying fish, sea birds, and debris
** Hemorrhaging bites from fish, marine mammals, and marine reptiles, occasionally resulting from predation
** Venomous bites from sea snakes and certain species of octopus
** Electrocution or mild shock from electric eels and electric rays

Around any pool area, safety equipment is often important, and is a zoning requirement for most residential pools in the United States. Supervision by personnel trained in rescue techniques is required at most competitive swimming meets and public pools.

==Lessons==


Traditionally, children were considered not able to swim independently until 4 years of age,
although now infant swimming lessons are recommended to prevent drowning.

In Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Finland, the curriculum for the fifth grade (fourth grade in Estonia) states that all children should learn to swim as well as how to handle emergencies near water. Most commonly, children are expected to be able to swim —of which at least on their back – after first falling into deep water and getting their head under water. Even though about 95 percent of Swedish school children know how to swim, drowning remains the third most common cause of death among children.

In both the Netherlands and Belgium swimming lessons under school time (&quot;schoolzwemmen&quot;, school swimming) are supported by the government. Most schools provide swimming lessons. There is a long tradition of swimming lessons in the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch translation for the breaststroke swimming style is even &quot;schoolslag&quot; (schoolstroke). In France, swimming is a compulsory part of the curriculum for primary schools. Children usually spend one semester per year learning swimming during CP/CE1/CE2/CM1 (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th grade).

In many places, swimming lessons are provided by local swimming pools, both those run by the local authority and by private leisure companies. Many schools also include swimming lessons into their Physical Education curricula, provided either in the schools&#x27; own pool or in the nearest public pool.

In the UK, the &quot;Top-ups scheme&quot; calls for school children who cannot swim by the age of 11 to receive intensive daily lessons. Children who have not reached Great Britain&#x27;s National Curriculum standard of swimming 25 meters by the time they leave primary school receive a half-hour lesson every day for two weeks during term-time.

In Canada and Mexico there has been a call to include swimming in public school curriculum.

In the United States there is the Infant Swimming Resource (ISR) initiative that provides lessons for infant children, to cope with an emergency where they have fallen into the water. They are taught how to roll-back-to-float (hold their breath underwater, to roll onto their back, to float unassisted, rest and breathe until help arrives), while clothed and unclothed. In ISR they teach the children how to roll with their clothes on, as a simulation, if they were to actually fall in walking or crawling by.

In Switzerland, swimming lessons for babies are popular, to help them getting used to be in another element. At the competition level, unlike in other countries - such as the Commonwealth countries, swimming teams are not related to educational institutions (high-schools and universities), but rather to cities or regions.

==Clothing and equipment==

===Swimsuits===
Standard everyday clothing is usually impractical for swimming and is unsafe under some circumstances. Most cultures today expect swimmers to wear swimsuits.

Men&#x27;s swimsuits commonly resemble shorts, or briefs. Men&#x27;s casual swimsuits (for example, boardshorts) are rarely skintight, unlike competitive swimwear, like jammers or diveskins. In most cases, boys and men swim with their upper body exposed, except in countries where custom or law prohibits it in a public setting, or for practical reasons such as sun protection.

Modern women&#x27;s swimsuits are generally skintight, covering the pubic region and the breasts (See bikini). Women&#x27;s swimwear may also cover the midriff as well. Women&#x27;s swimwear is often a fashion statement, and whether it is modest or not is a subject of debate by many groups, religious and secular.

Competitive swimwear is built so that the wearer can swim faster and more efficiently. Modern competitive swimwear is skintight and lightweight. There are many kinds of competitive swimwear for each gender. It is used in aquatic competitions, such as water polo, swim racing, diving, and rowing.

Wetsuits provide both thermal insulation and flotation. Many swimmers lack buoyancy in the leg. The wetsuit provides additional volume at a lower density and therefore improves buoyancy and trim while swimming. It provides insulation between the skin and water which reduces heat loss. The wetsuit is the usual choice for those who swim in cold water for long periods of time, as it reduces susceptibility to hypothermia.

Some people also choose to wear no clothing while swimming. In some European countries public pools allow clothes-free swimming and many countries have beaches where one can swim naked. It is legal to swim naked in the sea at all UK beaches. It was common for males to swim naked in a public setting up to the early 20th century. Today, swimming naked can be a rebellious activity or merely a casual one.

===Accessories===
* Earplugs can prevent water from getting in the ears.
* Noseclips can prevent water from getting in the nose. However, using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause disadvantage, so many competitive swimmers choose not to use one. For this reason, noseclips are primarily used for synchronized swimming and recreational swimming.
* Goggles protect the eyes from chlorinated water, and improve underwater visibility. Tinted goggles protect the eyes from sunlight that reflects from the bottom of the pool.
* Swim caps keep the body streamlined and protect the hair from chlorinated water, though they are not entirely watertight.
* Kickboards are used to keep the upper body afloat while exercising the lower body.
* Pull buoys are used to keep the lower body afloat while exercising the upper body.
* Swimfins are used in training to elongate the kick and improve technique and speed. Fins also build upper calf muscles. Fins provide a significantly greater and more efficient conversion of muscle power to thrust than available from the feet, and allow the powerful leg muscles to be used effectively for propulsion through water. The value of fins as an active aid in the teaching, learning and practice of swimming has long been recognised. In the US, as early as 1947, they were used experimentally to build the confidence of reluctant beginners in swimming, while a 1950 YMCA lifesaving and water safety manual reminded swimming instructors how &quot;flippers can be used to great advantage for treading water, surface diving, towing, underwater searching and supporting a tired swimmer&quot;. In 1967, research was conducted on fin use in teaching the crawl stroke. During the 1970s, the so-called &quot;flipper-float&quot; method came into vogue in Europe with the aim of helping beginners learn to swim faster and more safely.
* Hand paddles are used to increase resistance during arm movements, with the goal of improving technique and power.
* Finger paddles have a similar effect to hand paddles, but create less resistance due to their smaller size. They also help with improving a swimmer&#x27;s &#x27;catch&#x27; in the water.
* Snorkels are used to help improve and maintain a good head position in the water. They may also be used by some during physical therapy.
* Pool noodles are used to keep the user afloat during the time in the water.
* Safety fencing and equipment is mandatory at public pools and a zoning requirement at most residential pools in the United States.
* Swimming parachutes are used in competitive training, adding an element of resistance in the water to help athletes to increase power in the stroke&#x27;s central movements.
* Inflatable armbands are swimming aids designed to provide buoyancy and help the wearer to float.

<text>A simple machine is a mechanical device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force. In general, they can be defined as the simplest mechanisms that use mechanical advantage (also called leverage) to multiply force. Usually the term refers to the six classical simple machines that were defined by Renaissance scientists:
* Lever
* Wheel and axle
* Pulley
* Inclined plane
* Wedge
* Screw
A simple machine uses a single applied force to do work against a single load force. Ignoring friction losses, the work done on the load is equal to the work done by the applied force. The machine can increase the amount of the output force, at the cost of a proportional decrease in the distance moved by the load. The ratio of the output to the applied force is called the &quot;mechanical advantage&quot;.

Simple machines can be regarded as the elementary &quot;building blocks&quot; of which all more complicated machines (sometimes called &quot;compound machines&quot;) are composed. For example, wheels, levers, and pulleys are all used in the mechanism of a bicycle. The mechanical advantage of a compound machine is just the product of the mechanical advantages of the simple machines of which it is composed.

Although they continue to be of great importance in mechanics and applied science, modern mechanics has moved beyond the view of the simple machines as the ultimate building blocks of which all machines are composed, which arose in the Renaissance as a neoclassical amplification of ancient Greek texts. The great variety and sophistication of modern machine linkages, which arose during the Industrial Revolution, is inadequately described by these six simple categories. Various post-Renaissance authors have compiled expanded lists of &quot;simple machines&quot;, often using terms like &quot;basic machines&quot;, &quot;compound machines&quot;, or &quot;machine elements&quot; to distinguish them from the classical simple machines above. By the late 1800s, Franz Reuleaux had identified hundreds of machine elements, calling them &quot;simple machines&quot;. Modern machine theory analyzes machines as kinematic chains composed of elementary linkages called kinematic pairs.

==History==
The idea of a simple machine originated with the Greek philosopher Archimedes around the 3rd century BC, who studied the Archimedean simple machines: lever, pulley, and screw. He discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever. Archimedes&#x27; famous remark with regard to the lever: &quot;Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth,&quot; () expresses his realization that there was no limit to the amount of force amplification that could be achieved by using mechanical advantage. Later Greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines (excluding the inclined plane) and were able to calculate their (ideal) mechanical advantage. For example, Heron of Alexandria (–75 AD) in his work &quot;Mechanics&quot; lists five mechanisms that can &quot;set a load in motion&quot;: lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and screw, and describes their fabrication and uses. However the Greeks&#x27; understanding was limited to the statics of simple machines (the balance of forces), and did not include dynamics, the tradeoff between force and distance, or the concept of work.

During the Renaissance the dynamics of the &quot;mechanical powers&quot;, as the simple machines were called, began to be studied from the standpoint of how far they could lift a load, in addition to the force they could apply, leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work. In 1586 Flemish engineer Simon Stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane, and it was included with the other simple machines. The complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei in 1600 in (&quot;On Mechanics&quot;), in which he showed the underlying mathematical similarity of the machines as force amplifiers. He was the first to explain that simple machines do not create energy, only transform it.

The classic rules of sliding friction in machines were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), but were unpublished and merely documented in his notebooks, and were based on pre-Newtonian science such as believing friction was an ethereal fluid. They were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons (1699) and were further developed by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb (1785).
==Ideal simple machine==
If a simple machine does not dissipate energy through friction, wear or deformation, then energy is conserved and it is called an ideal simple machine. In this case, the power into the machine equals the power out, and the mechanical advantage can be calculated from its geometric dimensions.

Although each machine works differently mechanically, the way they function is similar mathematically. In each machine, a force formula_1 is applied to the device at one point, and it does work moving a load formula_2 at another point. Although some machines only change the direction of the force, such as a stationary pulley, most machines multiply the magnitude of the force by a factor, the mechanical advantage

formula_3

that can be calculated from the machine&#x27;s geometry and friction.

Simple machines do not contain a source of energy, so they cannot do more work than they receive from the input force. A simple machine with no friction or elasticity is called an &quot;ideal machine&quot;. Due to conservation of energy, in an ideal simple machine, the power output (rate of energy output) at any time formula_4 is equal to the power input formula_5

formula_6

The power output equals the velocity of the load formula_7 multiplied by the load force formula_8. Similarly the power input from the applied force is equal to the velocity of the input point formula_9 multiplied by the applied force formula_10. Therefore,

formula_11

So the mechanical advantage of an ideal machine formula_12 is equal to the &quot;velocity ratio&quot;, the ratio of input velocity to output velocity

formula_13

The &quot;velocity ratio&quot; is also equal to the ratio of the distances covered in any given period of time

formula_14

Therefore, the mechanical advantage of an ideal machine is also equal to the &quot;distance ratio&quot;, the ratio of input distance moved to output distance moved
 = {d_\text{in} \over d_\text{out}}\,&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding = 0
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour = transparent
This can be calculated from the geometry of the machine. For example, the mechanical advantage and distance ratio of the lever is equal to the ratio of its lever arms.

The mechanical advantage can be greater or less than one:
* If formula_15, the output force is greater than the input, the machine acts as a force amplifier, but the distance moved by the load formula_16 is less than the distance moved by the input force formula_17.
* If formula_18, the output force is less than the input, but the distance moved by the load is greater than the distance moved by the input force.

In the screw, which uses rotational motion, the input force should be replaced by the torque, and the velocity by the angular velocity the shaft is turned.

==Friction and efficiency==
All real machines have friction, which causes some of the input power to be dissipated as heat. If formula_19 is the power lost to friction, from conservation of energy

formula_20

The mechanical efficiency formula_21 of a machine (where formula_22) is defined as the ratio of power out to the power in, and is a measure of the frictional energy losses

formula_23

As above, the power is equal to the product of force and velocity, so

formula_24

Therefore,
 = \eta {v_\text{in} \over v_\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt;
So in non-ideal machines, the mechanical advantage is always less than the velocity ratio by the product with the efficiency formula_21. So a machine that includes friction will not be able to move as large a load as a corresponding ideal machine using the same input force.

==Compound machines==
A &quot;compound machine&quot; is a machine formed from a set of simple machines connected in series with the output force of one providing the input force to the next. For example, a bench vise consists of a lever (the vise&#x27;s handle) in series with a screw, and a simple gear train consists of a number of gears (wheels and axles) connected in series.

The mechanical advantage of a compound machine is the ratio of the output force exerted by the last machine in the series divided by the input force applied to the first machine, that is

formula_26

Because the output force of each machine is the input of the next, formula_27, this mechanical advantage is also given by

formula_28

Thus, the mechanical advantage of the compound machine is equal to the product of the mechanical advantages of the series of simple machines that form it

formula_29

Similarly, the efficiency of a compound machine is also the product of the efficiencies of the series of simple machines that form it

formula_30

==Self-locking machines==
In many simple machines, if the load force formula_31 on the machine is high enough in relation to the input force formula_32, the machine will move backwards, with the load force doing work on the input force. So these machines can be used in either direction, with the driving force applied to either input point. For example, if the load force on a lever is high enough, the lever will move backwards, moving the input arm backwards against the input force. These are called &quot;reversible&quot;, &quot;non-locking&quot; or &quot;overhauling&quot; machines, and the backward motion is called &quot;overhauling&quot;.

However, in some machines, if the frictional forces are high enough, no amount of load force can move it backwards, even if the input force is zero. This is called a &quot;self-locking&quot;, &quot;nonreversible&quot;, or &quot;non-overhauling&quot; machine. These machines can only be set in motion by a force at the input, and when the input force is removed will remain motionless, &quot;locked&quot; by friction at whatever position they were left.

Self-locking occurs mainly in those machines with large areas of sliding contact between moving parts: the screw, inclined plane, and wedge:
* The most common example is a screw. In most screws, one can move the screw forward or backward by turning it, and one can move the nut along the shaft by turning it, but no amount of pushing the screw or the nut will cause either of them to turn.
* On an inclined plane, a load can be pulled up the plane by a sideways input force, but if the plane is not too steep and there is enough friction between load and plane, when the input force is removed the load will remain motionless and will not slide down the plane, regardless of its weight.
* A wedge can be driven into a block of wood by force on the end, such as from hitting it with a sledge hammer, forcing the sides apart, but no amount of compression force from the wood walls will cause it to pop back out of the block.

A machine will be self-locking if and only if its efficiency formula_21 is below 50%:

formula_34

Whether a machine is self-locking depends on both the friction forces (coefficient of static friction) between its parts, and the distance ratio formula_35 (ideal mechanical advantage). If both the friction and ideal mechanical advantage are high enough, it will self-lock.

===Proof===
When a machine moves in the forward direction from point 1 to point 2, with the input force doing work on a load force, from conservation of energy the input work formula_36 is equal to the sum of the work done on the load force formula_37 and the work lost to friction formula_38
If the efficiency is below 50% 

formula_39

From 
formula_40

When the machine moves backward from point 2 to point 1 with the load force doing work on the input force, the work lost to friction formula_41 is the same

formula_42

So the output work is
formula_43

Thus the machine self-locks, because the work dissipated in friction is greater than the work done by the load force moving it backwards even with no input force.

==Modern machine theory==
Machines are studied as mechanical systems consisting of actuators and mechanisms that transmit forces and movement, monitored by sensors and controllers. The components of actuators and mechanisms consist of links and joints that form kinematic chains.

===Kinematic chains===
Simple machines are elementary examples of kinematic chains that are used to model mechanical systems ranging from the steam engine to robot manipulators. The bearings that form the fulcrum of a lever and that allow the wheel and axle and pulleys to rotate are examples of a kinematic pair called a hinged joint. Similarly, the flat surface of an inclined plane and wedge are examples of the kinematic pair called a sliding joint. The screw is usually identified as its own kinematic pair called a helical joint.

Two levers, or cranks, are combined into a planar four-bar linkage by attaching a link that connects the output of one crank to the input of another. Additional links can be attached to form a six-bar linkage or in series to form a robot.

===Classification of machines===
The identification of simple machines arises from a desire for a systematic method to invent new machines. Therefore, an important concern is how simple machines are combined to make more complex machines. One approach is to attach simple machines in series to obtain compound machines.

However, a more successful strategy was identified by Franz Reuleaux, who collected and studied over 800 elementary machines. He realized that a lever, pulley, and wheel and axle are in essence the same device: a body rotating about a hinge. Similarly, an inclined plane, wedge, and screw are a block sliding on a flat surface.

This realization shows that it is the joints, or the connections that provide movement, that are the primary elements of a machine. Starting with four types of joints, the revolute joint, sliding joint, cam joint and gear joint, and related connections such as cables and belts, it is possible to understand a machine as an assembly of solid parts that connect these joints.

===Kinematic synthesis===
The design of mechanisms to perform required movement and force transmission is known as kinematic synthesis. This is a collection of geometric techniques for the mechanical design of linkages, cam and follower mechanisms and gears and gear trains.

<doc id="28005" wikidata="Q1935523" url="?curid=28005" title="Semi-Automatic Ground Environment">
<text>The Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) was a system of large computers and associated networking equipment that coordinated data from many radar sites and processed it to produce a single unified image of the airspace over a wide area. SAGE directed and controlled the NORAD response to a possible Soviet air attack, operating in this role from the late 1950s into the 1980s. Its enormous computers and huge displays remain a part of Cold War lore, and after decommissioning were common props in movies such as &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and , and on science fiction TV series such as &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot;.

The processing power behind SAGE was supplied by the largest discrete component-based computer ever built, the AN/FSQ-7, manufactured by IBM. Each SAGE Direction Center (DC) housed an FSQ-7 which occupied an entire floor, approximately not including supporting equipment. The FSQ-7 was actually two computers, &quot;A&quot; side and &quot;B&quot; side. Computer processing was switched from &quot;A&quot; side to &quot;B&quot; side on a regular basis, allowing maintenance on the unused side. Information was fed to the DCs from a network of radar stations as well as readiness information from various defense sites. The computers, based on the raw radar data, developed &quot;tracks&quot; for the reported targets, and automatically calculated which defenses were within range. Operators used light guns to select targets on-screen for further information, select one of the available defenses, and issue commands to attack. These commands would then be automatically sent to the defense site via teleprinter.

Connecting the various sites was an enormous network of telephones, modems and teleprinters. Later additions to the system allowed SAGE&#x27;s tracking data to be sent directly to CIM-10 Bomarc missiles and some of the US Air Force&#x27;s interceptor aircraft in-flight, directly updating their autopilots to maintain an intercept course without operator intervention. Each DC also forwarded data to a Combat Center (CC) for &quot;supervision of the several sectors within the division&quot; (&quot;each combat center [had] the capability to coordinate defense for the whole nation&quot;).

SAGE became operational in the late 1950s and early 1960s at a combined cost of billions of dollars. It was noted that the deployment cost more than the Manhattan Project—which it was, in a way, defending against. Throughout its development, there were continual concerns about its real ability to deal with large attacks, and the Operation Sky Shield tests showed that only about one-fourth of enemy bombers would have been intercepted. Nevertheless, SAGE was the backbone of NORAD&#x27;s air defense system into the 1980s, by which time the tube-based FSQ-7s were increasingly costly to maintain and completely outdated. Today the same command and control task is carried out by microcomputers, based on the same basic underlying data.

==Background==

===Earlier systems===

Just prior to World War II, Royal Air Force (RAF) tests with the new Chain Home (CH) radars had demonstrated that relaying information to the fighter aircraft directly from the radar sites was not feasible. The radars determined the map coordinates of the enemy, but could generally not see the fighters at the same time. This meant the fighters had to be able to determine where to fly to perform an interception but were often unaware of their own exact location and unable to calculate an interception while also flying their aircraft.

The solution was to send all of the radar information to a central control station where operators collated the reports into single &quot;tracks&quot;, and then reported these tracks to the airbases, or &quot;sectors&quot;. The sectors used additional systems to track their own aircraft, plotting both on a single large map. Operators viewing the map could then see what direction their fighters would have to fly to approach their targets and relay that simply by telling them to fly along a certain heading or &quot;vector&quot;. This Dowding system was the first ground-controlled interception (GCI) system of large scale, covering the entirety of the UK. It proved enormously successful during the Battle of Britain, and is credited as being a key part of the RAF&#x27;s success.

The system was slow, often providing information that was up to five minutes out of date. Against propeller driven bombers flying at perhaps this was not a serious concern, but it was clear the system would be of little use against jet-powered bombers flying at perhaps . The system was extremely expensive in manpower terms, requiring hundreds of telephone operators, plotters and trackers in addition to the radar operators. This was a serious drain on manpower, making it difficult to expand the network.

The idea of using a computer to handle the task of taking reports and developing tracks had been explored beginning late in the war. By 1944, analog computers had been installed at the CH stations to automatically convert radar readings into map locations, eliminating two people. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy began experimenting with the Comprehensive Display System (CDS), another analog computer that took X and Y locations from a map and automatically generated tracks from repeated inputs. Similar systems began development with the Royal Canadian Navy, DATAR, and the US Navy, the Naval Tactical Data System. A similar system was also specified for the Nike SAM project, specifically referring to a US version of CDS, coordinating the defense over a battle area so that multiple batteries did not fire on a single target. All of these systems were relatively small in geographic scale, generally tracking within a city-sized area.

===Valley Committee===


When the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in August 1949, the topic of air defense of the US became important for the first time. A study group, the &quot;Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee&quot; was set up under the direction of Dr. George Valley to consider the problem, and is known to history as the &quot;Valley Committee&quot;.

Their December report noted a key problem in air defense using ground-based radars. A bomber approaching a radar station would detect the signals from the radar long before the reflection off the bomber was strong enough to be detected by the station. The committee suggested that when this occurred, the bomber would descend to low altitude, thereby greatly limiting the radar horizon, allowing the bomber to fly past the station undetected. Although flying at low altitude greatly increased fuel consumption, the team calculated that the bomber would only need to do this for about 10% of its flight, making the fuel penalty acceptable.

The only solution to this problem was to build a huge number of stations with overlapping coverage. At that point the problem became one of managing the information. Manual plotting was ruled out as too slow, and a computerized solution was the only possibility. To handle this task, the computer would need to be fed information directly, eliminating any manual translation by phone operators, and it would have to be able to analyze that information and automatically develop tracks. A system tasked with defending cities against the predicted future Soviet bomber fleet would have to be dramatically more powerful than the models used in the NTDS or DATAR.

The Committee then had to consider whether or not such a computer was possible. The Valley Committee was introduced to Jerome Wiesner, associate director of the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT. Wiesner noted that the Servomechanisms Laboratory had already begun development of a machine that might be fast enough. This was the Whirlwind I, originally developed for the Office of Naval Research as a general purpose flight simulator that could simulate any current or future aircraft by changing its software.

Wiesner introduced the Valley Committee to Whirlwind&#x27;s project lead, Jay Forrester, who convinced him that Whirlwind was sufficiently capable. In September 1950, an early microwave early-warning radar system at Hanscom Field was connected to Whirlwind using a custom interface developed by Forrester&#x27;s team. An aircraft was flown past the site, and the system digitized the radar information and successfully sent it to Whirlwind. With this demonstration, the technical concept was proven. Forrester was invited to join the committee.

===Project Charles===
With this successful demonstration, Louis Ridenour, chief scientist of the Air Force, wrote a memo stating &quot;It is now apparent that the experimental work necessary to develop, test, and evaluate the systems proposals made by ADSEC will require a substantial amount of laboratory and field effort.&quot; Ridenour approached MIT President James Killian with the aim of beginning a development lab similar to the war-era Radiation Laboratory that made enormous progress in radar technology. Killian was initially uninterested, desiring to return the school to its peacetime civilian charter. Ridenour eventually convinced Killian the idea was sound by describing the way the lab would lead to the development of a local electronics industry based on the needs of the lab and the students who would leave the lab to start their own companies. Killian agreed to at least consider the issue, and began Project Charles to consider the size and scope of such a lab.

Project Charles was placed under the direction of Francis Wheeler Loomis and included 28 scientists, about half of whom were already associated with MIT. Their study ran from February to August 1951, and in their final report they stated that &quot;We endorse the concept of a centralized system as proposed by the Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee, and we agree that the central coordinating apparatus of this system should be a high-speed electronic digital computer.&quot; The report went on to describe a new lab that would be used for generic technology development for the Air Force, Army and Navy, and would be known as Project Lincoln.

===Project Lincoln===
Loomis took over direction of Project Lincoln and began planning by following the lead of the earlier RadLab. By September 1951, only months after the Charles report, Project Lincoln had more than 300 employees. By the end of the summer of 1952 this had risen to 1300, and after another year, 1800. The only building suitable for classified work at that point was Building 22, suitable for a few hundred people at most, although some relief was found by moving the non-classified portions of the project, administration and similar, to Building 20. But this was clearly insufficient space. After considering a variety of suitable locations, a site at Laurence G. Hanscom Field was selected, with the groundbreaking taking place in 1951.

The terms of the National Security Act were formulated during 1947, leading to the creation of the US Air Force out of the former US Army Air Force. During April of the same year, US Air Force staff were identifying specifically the requirement for the creation of automatic equipment for radar-detection which would relay information to an air defence control system, a system which would function without the inclusion of persons for its operation. The December 1949 &quot;Air Defense Systems Engineering Committee&quot; led by Dr. George Valley had recommended computerized networking for &quot;radar stations guarding the northern air approaches to the United States&quot; (e.g., in Canada). After a January 1950 meeting, Valley and Jay Forrester proposed using the Whirlwind I (completed 1951) for air defense. On August 18, 1950, when the &quot;1954 Interceptor&quot; requirements were issued, the USAF &quot;noted that manual techniques of aircraft warning and control would impose &quot;intolerable&quot; delays&quot; (Air Materiel Command (AMC) published &quot;Electronic Air Defense Environment for 1954&quot; in December .) During February–August 1951 at the new Lincoln Laboratory, the USAF conducted Project Claude which concluded an improved air defense system was needed.

In a test for the US military at Bedford, Massachusetts on 20 April 1951, data produced by a radar was transmitted through telephone lines to a computer for the first time, showing the detection of a mock enemy aircraft. This first test was directed by C. Robert Wieser.

The &quot;Summer Study Group&quot; of scientists in 1952 recommended &quot;computerized air direction centers…to be ready by 1954.&quot;

IBM&#x27;s &quot;Project High&quot; assisted under their October 1952 Whirlwind subcontract with Lincoln Laboratory, and a 1952 USAF Project Lincoln &quot;fullscale study&quot; of &quot;a large scale integrated ground control system&quot; resulted in the SAGE approval &quot;first on a trial basis in 1953&quot;. The USAF had decided by April 10, 1953, to cancel the competing ADIS (based on CDS), and the University of Michigan&#x27;s Aeronautical Research Center withdrew in the spring. Air Research and Development Command (ARDC) planned to &quot;finalize a production contract for the Lincoln Transition System&quot;. Similarly, the July 22, 1953, report by the Bull Committee (NSC 159) identified completing the Mid-Canada Line radars as the top priority and &quot;on a second-priority-basis: the Lincoln automated system&quot; (the decision to control Bomarc with the automated system was also in 1953.)

The Priority Permanent System with the initial (priority) radar stations was completed in 1952 as a &quot;manual air defense system&quot; (e.g., NORAD/ADC used a &quot;Plexiglas plotting board&quot; at the Ent command center.) The Permanent System radar stations included 3 subsequent phases of deployments and by June 30, 1957, had 119 &quot;Fixed CONUS&quot; radars, 29 &quot;Gap-filler low altitude&quot; radars, and 23 control centers&quot;. At &quot;the end of 1957, ADC operated 182 radar stations [and] 17 control centers … 32 [stations] had been added during the last half of the year as low-altitude, unmanned gap-filler radars. The total consisted of 47 gap-filler stations, 75 Permanent System radars, 39 semimobile radars, 19 Pinetree stations,…1 Lashup -era radar and a single Texas Tower&quot;. &quot;On 31 December 1958, USAF ADC had 187 operational land-based radar stations&quot; (74 were &quot;P-sites&quot;, 29 &quot;M-sites&quot;, 13 &quot;SM-sites&quot;, &amp; 68 &quot;ZI Gap Fillers&quot;).

==Development==
Systems scientist Jay Forrester was instrumental in directing the development of the key concept of an interception system during his work at Servomechanisms Laboratory of MIT. The concept of the system, according to the Lincoln Laboratory site was to 
&quot;develop a digital computer that could receive vast quantities of data from multiple radars and perform real-time processing to produce targeting information for intercepting aircraft and missiles.&quot;

The AN/FSQ-7 was developed by the Lincoln Laboratory&#x27;s Digital Computer Laboratory and Division 6, working closely with IBM as the manufacturer. Each FSQ-7 actually consisted of two nearly identical computers operating in &quot;duplex&quot; for redundancy. The design used an improved version of the Whirlwind I magnetic core memory and was an extension of the Whirlwind II computer program, renamed AN/FSQ-7 in 1953 to comply with Air Force nomenclature. It has been suggested the FSQ-7 was based on the IBM 701 but, while the 701 was investigated by MIT engineers, its design was ultimately rejected due to high error rates and generally being &quot;inadequate to the task.&quot; IBM&#x27;s contributions were essential to the success of the FSQ-7, and IBM benefited immensely from its association with the SAGE project, most evidently during development of the IBM 704.

On October 28, 1953, the Air Force Council recommended 1955 funding for &quot;ADC to convert to the Lincoln automated system&quot; (&quot;redesignated the SAGE System in 1954&quot;). The &quot;experimental SAGE subsector, located in Lexington, Mass., was completed in 1955…with a prototype AN/FSQ-7…known as XD-1&quot; (single computer system in Building F). In 1955, Air Force personnel began IBM training at the Kingston, New York, prototype facility, and the &quot;4620th Air Defense Wing (experimental SAGE) was established at Lincoln Laboratory&quot;

On May 3, 1956, General Partridge presented &quot;CINCNORAD&#x27;s Operational Concept for Control of Air Defense Weapons&quot; to the Armed Forces Policy Council, and a June 1956 symposium presentation identified advanced programming methods of SAGE code. For SAGE consulting Western Electric and Bell Telephone Laboratories formed the Air Defense Engineering Service (ADES), which was contracted in January 1954. IBM delivered the FSQ-7 computer&#x27;s prototype in June 1956, and Kingston&#x27;s XD-2 with dual computers guided a Cape Canaveral BOMARC to a successful aircraft intercept on August 7, 1958. Initially contracted to RCA, the AN/FSQ-7 production units were started by IBM in 1958 (32 DCs were planned for networking NORAD regions.) IBM&#x27;s production contract developed 56 SAGE computers for $.5 billion (~$18 million per computer pair in each FSQ-7)—cf. the $2 billion WWII Manhattan Project.

General Operational Requirements (GOR) 79 and 97 were &quot;the basic USAF documents guiding development and improvement of [the semi-automatic] ground environment. Prior to fielding the AN/FSQ-7 centrals, the USAF initially deployed &quot;pre-SAGE semiautomatic intercept systems&quot; (AN/GPA-37) to Air Defense Direction Centers, ADDCs (e.g., at &quot;NORAD Control Centers&quot;). On April 22, 1958, NORAD approved Nike AADCPs to be collocated with the USAF manual ADDCs at Duncanville Air Force Station TX, Olathe Air Force Station KS, Belleville Air Force Station IL, and Osceola Air Force Station KS.

==Deployment==
In 1957, SAGE System groundbreaking at McChord AFB was for DC-12 where the &quot;electronic brain&quot; began arriving in November 1958, and the &quot;first SAGE regional battle post [CC-01] began operating in Syracuse, New York in early 1959&quot;. BOMARC &quot;crew training was activated January 1, 1958&quot;, and AT&amp;T &quot;hardened many of its switching centers, putting them in deep underground bunkers&quot;, The North American Defense Objectives Plan (NADOP 59–63) submitted to Canada in December 1958 scheduled 5 Direction Centers and 1 Combat Center to be complete in Fiscal Year 1959, 12 DCs and 3 CCs complete at the end of FY 60, 19 DC/4 CC FY 61, 25/6 FY 62, and 30/10 FY 63. On June 30 NORAD ordered that &quot;Air Defense Sectors (SAGE) were to be designated as NORAD sectors&quot;, (the military reorganization had begun when effective April 1, 1958, CONAD &quot;designated four SAGE sectors – New York, Boston, Syracuse, and Washington – as CONAD Sectors&quot;.)

SAGE Geographic Reorganization: The SAGE Geographic Reorganization Plan of July 25, 1958, by NORAD was &quot;to provide a means for the orderly transition and phasing from the manual to the SAGE system.&quot; The plan identified deactivation of the Eastern, Central, and Western Region/Defense Forces on July 1, 1960, and &quot;current manual boundaries&quot; were to be moved to the new &quot;eight SAGE divisions&quot; (1 in Canada, &quot;the 35th&quot;) as soon as possible. Manual divisions &quot;not to get SAGE computers were to be phased out&quot; along with their Manual Air Defense Control Centers at the headquarters base: &quot;9th [at] Geiger Field… 32d, Syracuse AFS… 35th, Dobbins AFB… 58th, Wright-Patterson AFB… 85th, Andrews AFB&quot;. The 26th SAGE Division (New York, Boston, Syracuse &amp; Bangor SAGE sectors)--the 1st of the SAGE divisions—became operational at Hancock Field on 1 January 1959 after the redesignation started for AC&amp;W Squadrons (e.g., the Highlands P-9 unit became the 646th Radar Squadron (SAGE) October 1.) Additional sectors included the Los Angeles Air Defense Sector (SAGE) designated in February 1959. A June 23 JCS memorandum approved the new &quot;March 1959 Reorganization Plan&quot; for HQ NORAD/CONAD/ADC.

Project Wild Goose teams of Air Materiel Command personnel installed the Ground Air Transmit Receive stations for the SAGE TDDL (in April 1961, Sault Ste Marie was the first operational sector with TDDL). By the middle of 1960, AMC had determined that about 800,000 man-hours (involving 130 changes) would be required to bring the F-106 fleet to the point where it would be a valuable adjunct to the air defense system. Part of the work (Project Broad Jump) was accomplished by Sacramento Air Materiel Area. The remainder (Project Wild Goose) was done at ADC bases by roving AMC field assistance teams supported by ADC maintenance personnel. (cited by Volume I p. 271 &amp; Schaffel p. 325) After a September 1959 experimental ATABE test between an &quot;abbreviated&quot; AN/FSQ-7 staged at Fort Banks and the Lexington XD-1, the 1961 &quot;SAGE/Missile Master test program&quot; conducted large-scale field testing of the ATABE &quot;mathematical model&quot; using radar tracks of actual SAC and ADC aircraft flying mock penetrations into defense sectors. Similarly conducted was the joint SAC-NORAD Sky Shield II exercise followed by Sky Shield III on 2 September 1962 On July 15, 1963, ESD&#x27;s CMC Management Office assumed &quot;responsibilities in connection with BMEWS, Space Track, SAGE, and BUIC.&quot; The Chidlaw Building&#x27;s computerized NORAD/ADC Combined Operations Center in 1963 became the highest echelon of the SAGE computer network when operations moved from Ent AFB&#x27;s 1954 manual Command Center to the partially underground &quot;war room&quot;. Also in 1963, radar stations were renumbered (e.g., Cambria AFS was redesignated from P-2 to Z-2 on July 31) and the vacuum-tube SAGE System was completed (and obsolete).

On &quot;June 26, 1958,…the New York sector became operational&quot; and on December 1, 1958, the Syracuse sector&#x27;s DC-03 was operational (&quot;the SAGE system [did not] become operational until January 1959.&quot;) Construction of CFB North Bay in Canada was started in 1959 for a bunker ~ underground (operational October 1, 1963), and by 1963 the system had 3 Combat Centers. The 23 SAGE centers included 1 in Canada, and the &quot;SAGE control centers reached their full 22 site deployments in 1961 (out of 46 originally planned).&quot; The completed Minot AFB blockhouse received an AN/FSQ-7, but never received the FSQ-8 (the April 1, 1959, Minot Air Defense Sector consolidated with the Grand Forks ADS on March 1, 1963).

===SAGE sites===
The SAGE system included a direction center (DC) assigned to air defense sectors as they were defined at the time.
*

==Description==
The environment allowed radar station personnel to monitor the radar data and systems&#x27; status (e.g., Arctic Tower radome pressure) and to use the range height equipment to process height requests from Direction Center (DC) personnel. DCs received the Long Range Radar Input from the sector&#x27;s radar stations, and DC personnel monitored the radar tracks and IFF data provided by the stations, requested height-finder radar data on targets, and monitored the computer&#x27;s evaluation of which fighter aircraft or Bomarc missile site could reach the threat first. The DC&#x27;s &quot;NORAD sector commander&#x27;s operational staff&quot; could designate fighter intercept of a target or, using the Senior Director&#x27;s keyed console in the Weapons Direction room, launch a Bomarc intercept with automatic Q-7 guidance of the surface-to-air missile to a final homing dive (equipped fighters eventually were automatically guided to intercepts).

The &quot;NORAD sector direction center (NSDC) [also had] air defense artillery director (ADAD) consoles [and an Army] ADA battle staff officer&quot;, and the NSDC automatically communicated crosstelling of &quot;SAGE reference track data&quot; to/from adjacent sectors&#x27; DCs and to 10 Nike Missile Master AADCPs. Forwardtelling automatically communicated data from multiple DCs to a 3-story Combat Center (CC) usually at one of the sector&#x27;s DCs (cf. planned Hamilton AFB CC-05 near the Beale AFB DC-18) for coordinating the air battle in the NORAD region (multiple sectors) and which forwarded data to the NORAD Command Center (Ent AFB, 1963 Chidlaw Building, &amp; 1966 Cheyenne Mountain). NORAD&#x27;s integration of air warning data (at the ADOC) along with space surveillance, intelligence, and other data allowed attack assessment of an Air Defense Emergency for alerting the SAC command centers (465L SACCS nodes at Offutt AFB &amp; The Notch), The Pentagon/Raven Rock NMCC/ANMCC, and the public via CONELRAD radio stations.

The Burroughs 416L SAGE component (ESD Project 416L, Semi Automatic Ground Environment System) was the Cold War network connecting IBM supplied computer system at the various DC and that created the display and control environment for operation of the separate radars and to provide outbound command guidance for ground-controlled interception by air defense aircraft in the &quot;SAGE Defense System&quot; (&quot;Air Defense Weapons System&quot;). Burroughs Corporation was a prime contractor for SAGE network interface equipment which included 134 Burroughs AN/FST-2 Coordinate Data Transmitting Sets (CDTS) at radar stations and other sites, the IBM supplied AN/FSQ-7 at 23 Direction Centers, and the AN/FSQ-8 Combat Control Computers at 8 Combat Centers. The 2 computers of each AN/FSQ-7 together weighing used about ⅓ of the DC&#x27;s 2nd floor space and at ~$50 per instruction had approximately 125,000 &quot;computer instructions support[ing] actual operational air-defense mission&quot; processing. The AN/FSQ-7 at Luke AFB had additional memory (32K total) and was used as a &quot;computer center for all other&quot; DCs. Project 416L was the USAF predecessor of NORAD, SAC, and other military organizations&#x27; &quot;Big L&quot; computer systems (e.g., 438L Air Force Intelligence Data Handling System &amp; 496L Space Detection and Tracking System).

Network communications: The SAGE network of computers connected by a &quot;Digital Radar Relay&quot; (SAGE data system) used AT&amp;T voice lines, microwave towers, switching centers (e.g., SAGE NNX 764 was at Delta, Utah &amp; 759 at Mounds, Oklahoma), etc.; and AT&amp;T&#x27;s &quot;main underground station&quot; was in Kansas (Fairview) with other bunkers in Connecticut (Cheshire), California (Santa Rosa), Iowa (Boone) and Maryland (Hearthstone Mountain). CDTS modems at automated radar stations transmitted range and azimuth, and the Air Movements Identification Service (AMIS) provided air traffic data to the SAGE System. Radar tracks by telephone calls (e.g., from Manual Control Centers in the Albuquerque, Minot, and Oklahoma City sectors) could be entered via consoles of the 4th floor &quot;Manual Inputs&quot; room adjacent to the &quot;Communication Recording-Monitoring and VHF&quot; room. In 1966, SAGE communications were integrated into the AUTOVON Network.

SAGE Sector Warning Networks (cf. NORAD Division Warning Networks) provided the radar netting communications for each DC and eventually also allowed transfer of command guidance to autopilots of TDDL-equipped interceptors for vectoring to targets via the Ground to Air Data Link Subsystem and the Ground Air Transmit Receive (GATR) network of radio sites for &quot;HF/VHF/UHF voice &amp; TDDL&quot; each generally co-located at a CDTS site. SAGE Direction Centers and Combat Centers were also nodes of NORAD&#x27;s Alert Network Number 1, and SAC Emergency War Order Traffic included &quot;Positive Control/Noah&#x27;s Ark instructions&quot; through northern NORAD radio sites to confirm or recall SAC bombers if &quot;SAC decided to launch the alert force before receiving an execution order from the JCS&quot;.

A SAGE System ergonomic test at Luke AFB in 1964 &quot;showed conclusively that the wrong timing of human and technical operations was leading to frequent truncation of the flight path tracking system&quot; (Harold Sackman). SAGE software development was &quot;grossly underestimated&quot; (60,000 lines in September 1955): &quot;the biggest mistake [of] the SAGE computer program was [underestimating the] jump from the 35,000 [WWI] instructions … to the more than 100,000 instructions on the&quot; AN/FSQ-8. NORAD conducted a &quot;Sage/Missile Master Integration/ECM-ECCM Test&quot; in 1963, and although SAGE used AMIS input of air traffic information, the 1959 plan developed by the July 1958 USAF Air Defense Systems Integration Division for SAGE Air Traffic Integration (SATIN) was cancelled by the DoD.

===Radar stations===
SAGE radar stations, including 78 DEW Line sites in December 1961, provided radar tracks to DCs and had frequency diversity (FD) radars United States Navy picket ships also provided radar tracks, and seaward radar coverage was provided. By the late 1960s EC-121 Warning Star aircraft based at Otis AFB MA and McClellan AFB CA provided radar tracks via automatic data link to the SAGE System. Civil Aeronautics Administration radars were at some stations (e.g., stations of the Joint Use Site System), and the ARSR-1 Air Route Surveillance Radar rotation rate had to be modified &quot;for SAGE [IFF/SIF] Modes III and IV&quot; (&quot;antenna gear box modification&quot; for compatibility with FSQ-7 &amp; FSG-1 centrals.)

===Interceptors===
ADC aircraft such as the F-94 Starfire, F-89 Scorpion, F-101B Voodoo, and F-4 Phantom were controlled by SAGE GCI. The F-104 Starfighter was &quot;too small to be equipped with [SAGE] data link equipment&quot; and used voice-commanded GCI, but the F-106 Delta Dart was equipped for the automated data link (ADL). The ADL was designed to allow Interceptors that reached targets to transmit real-time tactical friendly and enemy movements and to determine whether sector defence reinforcement was necessary.

Familiarization flights allowed SAGE weapons directors to fly on two-seat interceptors to observe GCI operations. Surface-to-air missile installations for CIM-10 Bomarc interceptors were displayed on SAGE consoles.

==Improvements==

Partially solid-state AN/FST-2B and later AN/FYQ-47 computers replaced the AN/FST-2, and sectors without AN/FSQ-7 centrals requiring a &quot;weapon direction control device&quot; for USAF air defense used the solid-state AN/GSG-5 CCCS instead of the AN/GPA-73 recommended by ADC in June 1958. Back-Up Interceptor Control (BUIC) with CCCS dispersed to radar stations for survivability allowed a diminished but functional SAGE capability. In 1962, Burroughs &quot;won the contract to provide a military version of its D825&quot; modular data processing system for BUIC II. BUIC II was first used at North Truro Z-10 in 1966, and the Hamilton AFB BUIC II was installed in the former MCC building when it was converted to a SAGE Combat Center in 1966 (CC-05). On June 3, 1963, the Direction Centers at Marysville CA, Marquette/K I Sawyer AFB (DC-14) MI, Stewart AFB NY (DC-02), and Moses Lake WA (DC-15) were planned for closing and at the end of 1969, only 6 CONUS SAGE DCs remained (DC-03, -04, -10, -12, -20, &amp; -21) all with the vacuum tube AN/FSQ-7 centrals. In 1966, NORAD Combined Operations Center operations at Chidlaw transferred to the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center (425L System) and in December 1963, the DoD approved solid state replacement of Martin AN/FSG-1 centrals with the AN/GSG-5 and subsequent Hughes AN/TSQ-51. The &quot;416L/M/N Program Office&quot; at Hanscom Field had deployed the BUIC III by 1971 (e.g., to Fallon NAS), and the initial BUIC systems were phased out 1974–5. ADC had been renamed Aerospace Defense Command on January 15, 1968, and its general surveillance radar stations transferred to ADTAC in 1979 when the ADC major command was broken up (space surveillance stations went to SAC and the Aerospace Defense Center was activated as a DRU.)

==Replacement and disposition==

For airborne command posts, &quot;as early as 1962 the Air Force began exploring possibilities for an Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS)&quot;, and the Strategic Defense Architecture (SDA-2000) planned an integrated air defense and air traffic control network. The USAF declared full operational capability of the first seven Joint Surveillance System ROCCs on December 23, 1980, with Hughes AN/FYQ-93 systems, and many of the SAGE radar stations became Joint Surveillance System (JSS) sites (e.g., San Pedro Hill Z-39 became FAA Ground Equipment Facility J-31.) The North Bay AN/FSQ-7 was dismantled and sent to Boston&#x27;s Computer Museum. In 1996, AN/FSQ-7 components were moved to Moffett Federal Airfield for storage and later moved to the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California. The last AN/FSQ-7 centrals were demolished at McChord AFB (August 1983) and Luke AFB (February 1984). Decommissioned AN/FSQ-7 equipment was also used as science fiction cinema and TV series props (e.g., Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, amongst others).

==Historiography==
SAGE histories include a 1983 special issue of the &quot;Annals of the History of Computing&quot;, and various personal histories were published, e.g., Valley in 1985 and Jacobs in 1986. In 1998, the SAGE System was identified as 1 of 4 &quot;Monumental Projects&quot;, and a SAGE lecture presented the vintage film &quot;In Your Defense&quot; followed by anecdotal information from Les Earnest, Jim Wong, and Paul Edwards. In 2013, a copy of a 1950s cover girl image programmed for SAGE display was identified as the &quot;earliest known figurative computer art&quot;. Company histories identifying employees&#x27; roles in SAGE include the 1981 &quot;System Builders: The Story of SDC&quot; and the 1998 &quot;Architects of Information Advantage: The MITRE Corporation Since 1958&quot;.

<doc id="28011" wikidata="Q466109" url="?curid=28011" title="Subgroup">
<text>In group theory, a branch of mathematics, a subset of a group G is a subgroup of G if the members of that subset form a group with respect to the group operation in G. 

Formally, given a group under a binary operation ∗, a subset of is called a subgroup of if also forms a group under the operation ∗. More precisely, is a subgroup of if the restriction of ∗ to is a group operation on . This is often denoted , read as &quot; is a subgroup of &quot;.

The trivial subgroup of any group is the subgroup {&quot;e&quot;} consisting of just the identity element.

A proper subgroup of a group is a subgroup which is a proper subset of (that is, ). This is often represented notationally by , read as &quot; is a proper subgroup of &quot;. Some authors also exclude the trivial group from being proper (that is, ).

If is a subgroup of , then is sometimes called an overgroup of .

The same definitions apply more generally when is an arbitrary semigroup, but this article will only deal with subgroups of groups.

==Subgroup tests==

Suppose that is a group, and is a subset of . For now, assume that the group operation of is written multiplicatively, denoted by juxtaposition.
*Then is a subgroup of if and only if is nonempty and closed under products and inverses. &quot;Closed under products&quot; means that for every and in , the product is in . &quot;Closed under inverses&quot; means that for every in , the inverse is in . These two conditions can be combined into one, that for every and in , the element is in , but it is more natural and usually just as easy to test the two closure conditions separately.
*When is &quot;finite&quot;, the test can be simplified: is a subgroup if and only if it is nonempty and closed under products. These conditions alone imply that every element of generates a finite cyclic subgroup of , say of order , and then the inverse of is .
If the group operation is instead denoted by addition, then &quot;closed under products&quot; should be replaced by &quot;closed under addition&quot;, which is the condition that for every and in , the sum is in , and &quot;closed under inverses&quot; should be edited to say that for every in , the inverse is in .

==Basic properties of subgroups==

*The identity of a subgroup is the identity of the group: if is a group with identity , and is a subgroup of with identity , then .
*The inverse of an element in a subgroup is the inverse of the element in the group: if is a subgroup of a group , and and are elements of such that , then .
*If is a subgroup of , then the inclusion map sending each element of to itself is a homomorphism.
*The intersection of subgroups and of is again a subgroup of . For example, the intersection of the -axis and -axis in under addition is the trivial subgroup. More generally, the intersection of an arbitrary collection of subgroups of is a subgroup of .
*The union of subgroups and is a subgroup if and only if or . A non-example: is not a subgroup of because 2 and 3 are elements of this subset whose sum, 5, is not in the subset. Similarly, the union of the -axis and the -axis in is not a subgroup of 
*If is a subset of , then there exists a smallest subgroup containing , namely the intersection of all of subgroups containing ; it is denoted by and is called the subgroup generated by. An element of is in if and only if it is a finite product of elements of and their inverses, possibly repeated.
*Every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup . If is isomorphic to (the integers) for some positive integer , then is the smallest positive integer for which , and is called the &quot;order&quot; of . If is isomorphic to then is said to have &quot;infinite order&quot;.
*The subgroups of any given group form a complete lattice under inclusion, called the lattice of subgroups. (While the infimum here is the usual set-theoretic intersection, the supremum of a set of subgroups is the subgroup &quot;generated by&quot; the set-theoretic union of the subgroups, not the set-theoretic union itself.) If is the identity of , then the trivial group is the minimum subgroup of , while the maximum subgroup is the group itself.

==Cosets and Lagrange&#x27;s theorem==

Given a subgroup and some in , we define the left coset Because is invertible, the map given by is a bijection. Furthermore, every element of is contained in precisely one left coset of ; the left cosets are the equivalence classes corresponding to the equivalence relation if and only if is in . The number of left cosets of is called the index of in and is denoted by .

Lagrange&#x27;s theorem states that for a finite group and a subgroup , 
: formula_1
where and denote the orders of and , respectively. In particular, the order of every subgroup of (and the order of every element of ) must be a divisor of .

Right cosets are defined analogously: They are also the equivalence classes for a suitable equivalence relation and their number is equal to .

If for every in , then is said to be a normal subgroup. Every subgroup of index 2 is normal: the left cosets, and also the right cosets, are simply the subgroup and its complement. More generally, if is the lowest prime dividing the order of a finite group , then any subgroup of index (if such exists) is normal.

==Example: Subgroups of Z8==
Let be the cyclic group whose elements are
:formula_2
and whose group operation is addition modulo 8. Its Cayley table is

This group has two nontrivial subgroups: and , where is also a subgroup of . The Cayley table for is the top-left quadrant of the Cayley table for ; The Cayley table for is the top-left quadrant of the Cayley table for . The group is cyclic, and so are its subgroups. In general, subgroups of cyclic groups are also cyclic.

==Example: Subgroups of S4==
 is the symmetric group whose elements correspond to the permutations of 4 elements.&lt;br&gt;
Below are all its subgroups, ordered by cardinality.&lt;br&gt;
Each group is represented by its Cayley table.

===24 elements===
Like each group, is a subgroup of itself.

===12 elements===
The alternating group contains only the .&lt;br&gt;
It is one of the two nontrivial proper normal subgroups of . 

===8 elements===

===6 elements===

===4 elements===

===3 elements===

===2 elements===
Each permutation of order 2 generates a subgroup }.
These are the permutations that have only 2-cycles:&lt;br&gt;
* There are the 6 transpositions with one 2-cycle.   
* And 3 permutations with two 2-cycles.   

===1 element===
The trivial subgroup is the unique subgroup of order 1.

==Other examples==
*The even integers form a subgroup of the integer ring the sum of two even integers is even, and the negative of an even integer is even.
*An ideal in a ring is a subgroup of the additive group of .
*A linear subspace of a vector space is a subgroup of the additive group of vectors.
*In an abelian group, the elements of finite order form a subgroup called the torsion subgroup.

<text>Silicon Graphics, Inc. (stylized as SiliconGraphics before 1999, later rebranded SGI, historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American high-performance computing manufacturer, producing computer hardware and software. Founded in Mountain View, California, in November 1981 by James H. Clark, the computer scientist and entrepreneur perhaps best known for founding Netscape (with Marc Andreessen). Its initial market was 3D graphics computer workstations, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.

Early systems were based on the Geometry Engine that Clark and Marc Hannah had developed at Stanford University, and were derived from Clark&#x27;s broader background in computer graphics. The Geometry Engine was the first very-large-scale integration (VLSI) implementation of a geometry pipeline, specialized hardware that accelerated the &quot;inner-loop&quot; geometric computations needed to display three-dimensional images. For much of its history, the company focused on 3D imaging and was a major supplier of both hardware and software in this market.

Silicon Graphics reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in January 1990. Through the mid to late-1990s, the rapidly improving performance of commodity Wintel machines began to erode SGI&#x27;s stronghold in the 3D market. The porting of Maya to other platforms was a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing MIPS platforms to the Intel Itanium, as well as introducing their own Linux-based Intel IA-32 based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor, a move that also failed.

On April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems, a deal finalized on May 11, 2009, with Rackable assuming the name Silicon Graphics International. The remnants of Silicon Graphics, Inc. became Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.

==History==
===Early years===
James H. Clark left his position as an electrical engineering associate professor at Stanford University to found SGI in 1982 along with a group of seven graduate students and research staff from Stanford University: Kurt Akeley, David J. Brown, Tom Davis, Rocky Rhodes, Marc Hannah, Herb Kuta, and Mark Grossman; along with Abbey Silverstone and a few others.

===Growth===
Ed McCracken was CEO of Silicon Graphics from 1984 to 1997. During those years, SGI grew from annual revenues of $5.4 million to $3.7 billion.

===Decline===
The addition of 3D graphic capabilities to PCs, and the ability of clusters of Linux- and BSD-based PCs to take on many of the tasks of larger SGI servers, ate into SGI&#x27;s core markets. The porting of Maya to Linux, Mac OS and Microsoft Windows further eroded the low end of SGI&#x27;s product line.

In response to challenges faced in the marketplace and a falling share price, Ed McCracken was fired and SGI brought in Richard Belluzzo to replace him. Under Belluzzo&#x27;s leadership a number of initiatives were taken which are considered to have accelerated the corporate decline.

One such initiative was trying to sell workstations running Windows NT called Visual Workstations in addition to workstations running IRIX, the company&#x27;s version of UNIX. This put the company in even more direct competition with the likes of Dell, making it more difficult to justify a price premium. The product line was unsuccessful and abandoned a few years later.

SGI&#x27;s premature announcement of its migration from MIPS to Itanium and its abortive ventures into IA-32 architecture systems (the Visual Workstation line, the ex-Intergraph Zx10 range and the SGI 1000-series Linux servers) damaged SGI&#x27;s credibility in the market.

In 1999, in an attempt to clarify their current market position as more than a graphics company, Silicon Graphics Inc. changed its corporate identity to &quot;SGI&quot;, although its legal name was unchanged.

At the same time, SGI announced a new logo consisting of only the letters &quot;sgi&quot; in a proprietary font called &quot;SGI&quot;, created by branding and design consulting firm Landor Associates, in collaboration with designer Joe Stitzlein. SGI continued to use the &quot;Silicon Graphics&quot; name for its workstation product line, and later re-adopted the cube logo for some workstation models.

In November 2005, SGI announced that it had been delisted from the New York Stock Exchange because its common stock had fallen below the minimum share price for listing on the exchange. SGI&#x27;s market capitalization dwindled from a peak of over seven billion dollars in 1995 to just $120 million at the time of delisting. In February 2006, SGI noted that it could run out of cash by the end of the year.

===Re-emergence===

In mid-2005, SGI hired Alix Partners to advise it on returning to profitability and received a new line of credit. SGI announced it was postponing its scheduled annual December stockholders meeting until March 2006. It proposed a reverse stock split to deal with the de-listing from the New York Stock Exchange.

In January 2006, SGI hired Dennis McKenna as its new CEO and chairman of the board of directors. Mr. McKenna succeeded Robert Bishop, who remained vice chairman of the board of directors.

On May 8, 2006, SGI announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for itself and U.S. subsidiaries as part of a plan to reduce debt by $250 million. Two days later, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved its first day motions and its use of a $70 million financing facility provided by a group of its bondholders. Foreign subsidiaries were unaffected.

On September 6, 2006, SGI announced the end of development for the MIPS/IRIX line and the IRIX operating system. Production would end on December 29 and the last orders would be fulfilled by March 2007. Support for these products would end after December 2013.

SGI emerged from bankruptcy protection on October 17, 2006. Its stock symbol on Pink Sheets at that point, &quot;SGID&quot;, was canceled, and new stock was issued on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol &quot;SGIC&quot;. This new stock was distributed to the company&#x27;s creditors, and the SGID common stockholders were left with worthless shares. At the end of that year, the company moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale. Its earlier North Shoreline headquarters is now occupied by the Computer History Museum; the newer Amphitheatre Parkway headquarters was sold to Google (which had already subleased and moved into the facility in 2003). Both of these locations were award-winning designs by Studios Architecture.

In April 2008, SGI re-entered the visualization market with the SGI Virtu range of visualization servers and workstations, which were re-badged systems from BOXX Technologies based on Intel Xeon or AMD Opteron processors and Nvidia Quadro graphics chipsets, running Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server or Windows Compute Cluster Server.

===Final bankruptcy and acquisition by Rackable Systems===
In December 2008, SGI received a delisting notification from NASDAQ, as its market value had been below the minimum $35 million requirement for 10 consecutive trading days, and also did not meet NASDAQ&#x27;s alternative requirements of a minimum stockholders&#x27; equity of $2.5 million or annual net income from continuing operations of $500,000 or more.

On April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 again, and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems for $25 million. The sale, ultimately for $42.5 million, was finalized on May 11, 2009; at the same time, Rackable announced their adoption of &quot;Silicon Graphics International&quot; as their global name and brand. The Bankruptcy Court scheduled continuing proceedings and hearings for June 3 and 24, 2009, and July 22, 2009.

After the Rackable acquisition, &quot;Vizworld&quot; magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of SGI.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise acquired Silicon Graphics International in November 2016, which allowed HPE to place the SGI Pleiades, a TOP500 supercomputer at NASA Ames Research Center, in its portfolio.

===Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc. era===
During Silicon Graphics Inc.&#x27;s second bankruptcy phase, it was renamed to Graphics Properties Holdings, Inc.(GPHI) in June 2009.

In 2010, GPHI announced it had won a significant favorable ruling in its litigation with ATI Technologies and AMD in June 2010, following the patent lawsuit originally filed during the Silicon Graphics, Inc. era. Following the 2008 appeal by ATI over the validity of (&#x27;327) and Silicon Graphics Inc&#x27;s voluntary dismissal of the (&#x27;376) patent from the lawsuit, the Federal Circuit upheld the jury verdict on the validity of GPHI&#x27;s U.S. Patent No. 6,650,327, and furthermore found that AMD had lost its right to challenge patent validity in future proceedings. On January 31, 2011, the District Court entered an order that permits AMD to pursue its invalidity affirmative defense at trial and does not permit SGI to accuse AMD&#x27;s Radeon R700 series of graphics products of infringement in this case. On April 18, 2011, GPHI and AMD had entered into a confidential Settlement and License Agreement that resolved this litigation matter for an immaterial amount and that provides immunity under all GPHI patents for alleged infringement by AMD products, including components, software and designs. On April 26, 2011, the Court entered an order granting the parties&#x27; agreed motion for dismissal and final judgment.

In November 2011, GPHI filed another patent infringement lawsuit against Apple Inc. in Delaware involving more patents than their original patent infringement case against Apple last November, for alleged violation of U.S. patents 6,650,327 (&#x27;327), (&#x27;145) and (&#x27;881).

In 2012, GPHI filed lawsuit against Apple, Sony, HTC Corp, LG Electronics Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co., Research in Motion Ltd. for allegedly violating patent relating to a computer graphics process that turns text and images into pixels to be displayed on screens. Affected devices include Apple iPhone, HTC EVO4G, LG Thrill, Research in Motion Torch, Samsung Galaxy S and Galaxy S II, and Sony Xperia Play smartphones.

==Technology==

===Motorola 680x0-based systems===
SGI&#x27;s first generation products, starting with the IRIS (Integrated Raster Imaging System) 1000 series of high-performance graphics terminals, were based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors. The later IRIS 2000 and 3000 models developed into full UNIX workstations.&lt;ref name=sgi/iptable&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====IRIS 1000 series====
The first entries in the 1000 series (models 1000 and 1200, introduced in 1984) were graphics terminals, peripherals to be connected to a general-purpose computer such as a Digital Equipment Corporation VAX, to provide graphical raster display abilities. They used 8 MHz Motorola 68000 CPUs with of RAM and had no disk drives. They booted over the network (via an Excelan EXOS/101 Ethernet card) from their controlling computer. They used the &quot;PM1&quot; CPU board, which was a variant of the board that was used in Stanford University&#x27;s SUN workstation and later in the Sun-1 workstation from Sun Microsystems. The graphics system was composed of the GF1 frame buffer, the UC3 &quot;Update Controller&quot;, DC3 &quot;Display Controller&quot;, and the BP2 bitplane. The 1000-series machines were designed around the Multibus standard.

Later 1000-series machines, the 1400 and 1500, ran at 10 MHz and had 1.5 MB of RAM. The 1400 had a 72 MB ST-506 disk drive, while the 1500 had a 474 MB SMD-based disk drive with a Xylogics 450 disk controller. They may have used the PM2 CPU and PM2M1 RAM board from the 2000 series. The usual monitor for the 1000 series ran at 30 Hz interlaced. Six beta-test units of the 1400 workstation were produced, and the first production unit (SGI&#x27;s first commercial computer) was shipped to Carnegie-Mellon University&#x27;s Electronic Imaging Laboratory in 1984.

====IRIS 2000 and 3000 series====
SGI rapidly developed its machines into workstations with its second product line — the IRIS 2000 series, first released in August 1985. SGI began using the UNIX System V operating system. There were five models in two product ranges, the 2000/2200/2300/2400/2500 range which used 68010 CPUs (the PM2 CPU module), and the later &quot;Turbo&quot; systems, the 2300T, 2400T and 2500T, which had 68020s (the IP2 CPU module). All used the Excelan EXOS/201 Ethernet card, the same graphics hardware (GF2 Frame Buffer, UC4 Update Controller, DC4 Display Controller, BP3 Bitplane). Their main differences were the CPU, RAM, and Weitek Floating Point Accelerator boards, disk controllers and disk drives (both ST-506 and SMD were available). These could be upgraded, for example from a 2400 to a 2400T. The 2500 and 2500T had a larger chassis, a standard 6&#x27; 19&quot; EIA rack with space at the bottom for two SMD disk drives weighing approximately each. The non-Turbo models used the Multibus for the CPU to communicate with the floating point accelerator, while the Turbos added a ribbon cable dedicated for this. 60 Hz monitors were used for the 2000 series.

The height of the machines using Motorola CPUs was reached with the IRIS 3000 series (models 3010/3020/3030 and 3110/3115/3120/3130, the 30s both being full-size rack machines). They used the same graphics subsystem and Ethernet as the 2000s, but could also use up to 12 &quot;geometry engines&quot;, the first widespread use of hardware graphics accelerators. The standard monitor was a 19&quot; 60 Hz non-interlaced unit with a tilt/swivel base; 19&quot; 30 Hz interlaced and a 15&quot; 60 Hz non-interlaced (with tilt/swivel base) were also available.

The IRIS 3130 and its smaller siblings were impressive for the time, being complete UNIX workstations. The 3130 was powerful enough to support a complete 3D animation and rendering package without mainframe support. With large capacity hard drives by standards of the day (two 300 MB drives), streaming tape and Ethernet, it could be the centerpiece of an animation operation.

The line was formally discontinued in November 1989, with about 3,500 systems shipped of all 2000 and 3000 models combined.

===RISC era===
With the introduction of the IRIS 4D series, SGI switched to MIPS microprocessors. These machines were more powerful and came with powerful on-board floating-point capability. As 3D graphics became more popular in television and film during this time, these systems were responsible for establishing much of SGI&#x27;s reputation.

SGI produced a broad range of MIPS-based workstations and servers during the 1990s, running SGI&#x27;s version of UNIX System V, now called IRIX. These included the massive Onyx visualization systems, the size of refrigerators and capable of supporting up to 64 processors while managing up to three streams of high resolution, fully realized 3D graphics.

In October 1991, MIPS announced the first commercially available 64-bit microprocessor, the R4000. SGI used the R4000 in its Crimson workstation. IRIX 6.2 was the first fully 64-bit IRIX release, including 64-bit pointers.

To secure the supply of future generations of MIPS microprocessors (the 64-bit R4000), SGI acquired the company in 1992 for $333 million and renamed it as MIPS Technologies Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SGI.

In 1993, Silicon Graphics (SGI) signed a deal with Nintendo to develop the Reality Coprocessor (RCP) GPU used in the Nintendo 64 (N64) video game console. The deal was signed in early 1993, and it was later made public in August of that year. The console itself was later released in 1996. The RCP was developed by SGI&#x27;s Nintendo Operations department, led by engineer Dr. Wei Yen. In 1997, twenty SGI employees, led by Yen, left SGI and founded ArtX (later acquired by ATI Technologies in 2000).

In 1998, SGI relinquished some ownership of MIPS Technologies, Inc in a Re-IPO, and fully divested itself in 2000.

In the late 1990s, when much of the industry expected the Itanium to replace both CISC and RISC architectures in non-embedded computers, SGI announced their intent to phase out MIPS in their systems. Development of new MIPS microprocessors stopped, and the existing R12000 design was extended multiple times until 2003 to provide existing customers more time to migrate to Itanium.

In August 2006, SGI announced the end of production for MIPS/IRIX systems, and by the end of the year MIPS/IRIX products were no longer generally available from SGI.

===IRIS GL and OpenGL===
Until the second generation Onyx Reality Engine machines, SGI offered access to its high performance 3D graphics subsystems through a proprietary API known as &quot;IRIS Graphics Library&quot; (IRIS GL). As more features were added over the years, IRIS GL became harder to maintain and more cumbersome to use. In 1992, SGI decided to clean up and reform IRIS GL and made the bold move of allowing the resulting OpenGL API to be cheaply licensed by SGI&#x27;s competitors, and set up an industry-wide consortium to maintain the OpenGL standard (the OpenGL Architecture Review Board).

This meant that for the first time, fast, efficient, cross-platform graphics programs could be written. For over 20 years – until the introduction of the Vulkan API – OpenGL remained the only real-time 3D graphics standard to be portable across a variety of operating systems.

===ACE Consortium===
SGI was part of the Advanced Computing Environment initiative, formed in the early 1990s with 20 other companies, including Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation, MIPS Computer Systems, Groupe Bull, Siemens, NEC, NeTpower, Microsoft and Santa Cruz Operation. Its intent was to introduce workstations based on the MIPS architecture and able to run Windows NT and SCO UNIX. The group produced the Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) specification, but began to unravel little more than a year after its formation.

===Entertainment industry===
For eight consecutive years (1995–2002), all films nominated for an Academy Award for Distinguished Achievement in Visual Effects were created on Silicon Graphics computer systems. The technology was also used in commercials for a host of companies.

An SGI Crimson system with the fsn three-dimensional file system navigator appeared in the 1993 movie &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

In the movie &quot;Twister&quot;, protagonists can be seen using an SGI laptop computer; however, the unit shown was not an actual working computer, but rather a fake laptop shell built around an SGI Corona LCD flat screen display.

The 1995 film &quot;Congo&quot; also features an SGI laptop computer being used by Dr. Ross (Laura Linney) to communicate via satellite to TraviCom HQ.

The purple, lowercased &quot;sgi&quot; logo can be seen at the beginning of the opening credits of the HBO series &quot;Silicon Valley&quot;, before being taken down and replaced by the Google logo as the intro graphics progress. Google leased the former SGI buildings in 2003 for their headquarters in Mountain View, CA until they purchased the buildings outright in 2006.

Once inexpensive PCs began to have graphics performance close to the more expensive specialized graphical workstations which were SGI&#x27;s core business, SGI shifted its focus to high performance servers for digital video and the Web. Many SGI graphics engineers left to work at other computer graphics companies such as ATI and Nvidia, contributing to the PC 3D graphics revolution.

===Free software===
SGI was a promoter of free software, supporting several projects such as Linux and Samba, and opening some of its own previously proprietary code such as the XFS filesystem and the Open64 compiler.

SGI was also important in its contribution to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) with many useful extensions in the MIT-like licensed SGI STL implementation. The extension keeps being carried by the direct descendant STLport and GNU&#x27;s libstdc++.

===Acquisition of Alias, Wavefront, Cray and Intergraph===
In 1995, SGI purchased Alias Research, Kroyer Films, and Wavefront Technologies in a deal totaling approximately $500 million and merged the companies into Alias|Wavefront. In June 2004 SGI sold the business, later renamed to Alias/Wavefront, to the private equity investment firm Accel-KKR for $57.5 million. In October 2005, Autodesk announced that it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Alias for $182 million in cash.

In February 1996, SGI purchased the well-known supercomputer manufacturer Cray Research for $740 million, and began to use marketing names such as &quot;CrayLink&quot; for (SGI-developed) technology integrated into the SGI server line. Three months later, it sold the Cray Business Systems Division, responsible for the CS6400 SPARC/Solaris server, to Sun Microsystems for an undisclosed amount (acknowledged later by a Sun executive to be &quot;significantly less than $100 million&quot;). Many of the Cray T3E engineers designed and developed the SGI Altix and NUMAlink technology. SGI sold the Cray brand and product lines to Tera Computer Company on March 31, 2000, for $35 million plus one million shares. SGI also distributed its remaining interest in MIPS Technologies through a spin-off effective June 20, 2000.

In September 2000, SGI acquired the Zx10 series of Windows workstations and servers from Intergraph Computer Systems (for a rumored $100 million), and rebadged them as SGI systems. The product line was discontinued in June 2001.

===SGI Visual Workstations===
Another attempt by SGI in the late 1990s to introduce its own family of Intel-based workstations running Windows NT or Red Hat Linux (see also SGI Visual Workstation) proved to be a financial disaster, and shook customer confidence in SGI&#x27;s commitment to its own MIPS-based line.

===Switch to Itanium===
In 1998, SGI announced that future generations of its machines would be based not on their own MIPS processors, but the upcoming &quot;super-chip&quot; from Intel, code-named &quot;Merced&quot; and later called Itanium. Funding for its own high-end processors was reduced, and it was planned that the R10000 would be the last MIPS mainstream processor. MIPS Technologies would focus entirely on the embedded market, where it was having some success, and SGI would no longer have to fund development of a CPU that, since the failure of ARC, found use only in their own machines. This plan quickly went awry. As early as 1999, it was clear the Itanium was going to be delivered very late and would have nowhere near the performance originally expected. As the production delays increased, MIPS&#x27; existing R10000-based machines grew increasingly uncompetitive. It was eventually forced to introduce faster MIPS processors, the R12000, R14000 and R16000, which were used in a series of models from 1999 through 2006.

SGI&#x27;s first Itanium-based system was the short-lived SGI 750 workstation, launched in 2001. SGI&#x27;s MIPS-based systems were not to be superseded until the launch of the Itanium 2-based Altix servers and Prism workstations some time later. Unlike the MIPS systems, which ran IRIX, the Itanium systems used SuSE Linux Enterprise Server with SGI enhancements as their operating system. SGI used Transitive Corporation&#x27;s QuickTransit software to allow their old MIPS/IRIX applications to run (in emulation) on the new Itanium/Linux platform.

In the server market, the Itanium 2-based Altix eventually replaced the MIPS-based Origin product line. In the workstation market, the switch to Itanium was not completed before SGI exited the market.

The Altix was the most powerful computer in the world in 2006, assuming that a &quot;computer&quot; is defined as a collection of hardware running under a single instance of an operating system. The Altix had 512 Itanium processors running under a single instance of Linux. A cluster of 20 machines was then the eighth-fastest supercomputer. All faster supercomputers were clusters, but none have as many FLOPS per machine. However, more recent supercomputers are very large clusters of machines that are individually less capable. SGI acknowledged this and in 2007 moved away from the &quot;massive NUMA&quot; model to clusters.

===Switch to Xeon===
Although SGI continued to market Itanium-based machines, its more recent machines were based on the Intel Xeon processor. The first Altix XE systems were relatively low-end machines, but by December 2006 the XE systems were more capable than the Itanium machines by some measures (e.g., power consumption in FLOPS/W, density in FLOPS/m3, cost/FLOPS). The XE1200 and XE1300 servers used a cluster architecture. This was a departure from the pure NUMA architectures of the earlier Itanium and MIPS servers.

In June 2007, SGI announced the Altix ICE 8200, a blade-based Xeon system with up to 512 Xeon cores per rack. An Altix ICE 8200 installed at New Mexico Computing Applications Center (with 14336 processors) ranked at number 3 on the TOP500 list of November 2007.

==User base and core market==
Conventional wisdom holds that SGI&#x27;s core market has traditionally been Hollywood visual effects studios. In fact, SGI&#x27;s largest revenue has always been generated by government and defense applications, energy, and scientific and technical computing. In one case Silicon Graphics&#x27; largest single sale ever was to the United States Postal Service. SGI&#x27;s servers powered an artificial intelligence program to mechanically read, tag and sort the mail (hand-written and block) at a number of USPS&#x27;s key mail centers. The rise of cheap yet powerful commodity workstations running Linux, Windows and Mac OS X, and the availability of diverse professional software for them, effectively pushed SGI out of the visual effects industry in all but the most niche markets.

==High-end server market==
SGI continued to enhance its line of servers (including some supercomputers) based on the SN architecture. SN, for Scalable Node, is a technology developed by SGI in the mid-1990s that uses cache-coherent non-uniform memory access (cc-NUMA). In an SN system, processors, memory, and a bus- and memory-controller are coupled together into an entity called a node, usually on a single circuit board. Nodes are connected by a high-speed interconnect called NUMAlink (originally marketed as CrayLink). There is no internal bus, and instead access between processors, memory, and I/O devices is done through a switched fabric of links and routers.

Thanks to the cache coherence of the distributed shared memory, SN systems scale along several axes at once: as CPU count increases, so does memory capacity, I/O capacity, and system bisection bandwidth. This allows the combined memory of all the nodes to be accessed under a single OS image using standard shared-memory synchronization methods. This makes an SN system far easier to program and able to achieve higher sustained-to-peak performance than non-cache-coherent systems like conventional clusters or massively parallel computers which require applications code to be written (or re-written) to do explicit message-passing communication between their nodes.

The first SN system, known as SN-0, was released in 1996 under the product name Origin 2000. Based on the MIPS R10000 processor, it scaled from 2 to 128 processors and a smaller version, the Origin 200 (SN-00), scaled from 1 to 4. Later enhancements enabled systems of as large as 512 processors.

The second generation system, originally called SN-1 but later SN-MIPS, was released in July 2000, as the Origin 3000. It scaled from 4 to 512 processors, and 1,024-processor configurations were delivered by special order to some customers. A smaller, less scalable implementation followed, called Origin 300.

In November 2002, SGI announced a repackaging of its SN system, under the name Origin 3900. It quadrupled the processor area density of the SN-MIPS system, from 32 up to 128 processors per rack while moving to a &quot;fat tree&quot; interconnect topology.

In January 2003, SGI announced a variant of the SN platform called the Altix 3000 (internally called SN-IA). It used Intel Itanium 2 processors and ran the Linux operating system kernel. At the time it was released, it was the world&#x27;s most scalable Linux-based computer, supporting up to 64 processors in a single system node. Nodes could be connected using the same NUMAlink technology to form what SGI predictably termed &quot;superclusters&quot;.

In February 2004, SGI announced general support for 128 processor nodes to be followed by 256 and 512 processor versions that year.

In April 2004, SGI announced the sale of its Alias software business for approximately $57 million.

In October 2004, SGI built the supercomputer Columbia, which broke the world record for computer speed, for the NASA Ames Research Center. It was a cluster of 20 Altix supercomputers each with 512 Intel Itanium 2 processors running Linux, and achieved sustained speed of 42.7 trillion floating-point operations per second (teraflops), easily topping Japan&#x27;s famed Earth Simulator&#x27;s record of 35.86 teraflops. (A week later, IBM&#x27;s upgraded Blue Gene/L clocked in at 70.7 teraflops.)

In July 2006, SGI announced an SGI Altix 4700 system with 1,024 processors and 4 TB of memory running a single Linux system image.

<text>In combinatorial mathematics, a Steiner system (named after Jakob Steiner) is a type of block design, specifically a t-design with λ = 1 and &quot;t&quot; = 2 or (recently) &quot;t&quot; ≥ 2.

A Steiner system with parameters &quot;t&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, written S(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;n&quot;), is an &quot;n&quot;-element set &quot;S&quot; together with a set of &quot;k&quot;-element subsets of &quot;S&quot; (called blocks) with the property that each &quot;t&quot;-element subset of &quot;S&quot; is contained in exactly one block. In an alternate notation for block designs, an S(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) would be a &quot;t&quot;-(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;,1) design.

This definition is relatively new. The classical definition of Steiner systems also required that &quot;k&quot; = &quot;t&quot; + 1. An S(2,3,&quot;n&quot;) was (and still is) called a &quot;Steiner triple&quot; (or &quot;triad&quot;) &quot;system&quot;, while an S(3,4,&quot;n&quot;) is called a &quot;Steiner quadruple system&quot;, and so on. With the generalization of the definition, this naming system is no longer strictly adhered to.

Long-standing problems in design theory were whether there exist any nontrivial Steiner systems (nontrivial meaning &quot;t&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;) with &quot;t&quot; ≥ 6; also whether infinitely many have &quot;t&quot; = 4 or 5. Both existences were proved by Peter Keevash in 2014. His proof is non-constructive and, as of 2019, no actual Steiner systems are known for large values of &quot;t&quot;.

== Types of Steiner systems==

A finite projective plane of order , with the lines as blocks, is an , since it has points, each line passes through points, and each pair of distinct points lies on exactly one line.

A finite affine plane of order , with the lines as blocks, is an . An affine plane of order can be obtained from a projective plane of the same order by removing one block and all of the points in that block from the projective plane. Choosing different blocks to remove in this way can lead to non-isomorphic affine planes.

An S(3,4,&quot;n&quot;) is called a Steiner quadruple system. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an S(3,4,&quot;n&quot;) is that &quot;n&quot; formula_1 2 or 4 (mod 6). The abbreviation SQS(&quot;n&quot;) is often used for these systems. Up to isomorphism, SQS(8) and SQS(10) are unique, there are 4 SQS(14)s and 1,054,163 SQS(16)s.

An S(4,5,&quot;n&quot;) is called a Steiner quintuple system. A necessary condition for the existence of such a system is that &quot;n&quot; formula_1 3 or 5 (mod 6) which comes from considerations that apply to all the classical Steiner systems. An additional necessary condition is that &quot;n&quot; formula_3 4 (mod 5), which comes from the fact that the number of blocks must be an integer. Sufficient conditions are not known. There is a unique Steiner quintuple system of order 11, but none of order 15 or order 17. Systems are known for orders 23, 35, 47, 71, 83, 107, 131, 167 and 243. The smallest order for which the existence is not known (as of 2011) is 21.

===Steiner triple systems===
An S(2,3,&quot;n&quot;) is called a Steiner triple system, and its blocks are called triples. It is common to see the abbreviation STS(&quot;n&quot;) for a Steiner triple system of order &quot;n&quot;. The total number of pairs is &quot;n(n-1)/2&quot;, of which three appear in a triple, and so the total number of triples is &quot;n&quot;(&quot;n&quot;−1)/6. This shows that &quot;n&quot; must be of the form &quot;6k+1&quot; or &quot;6k + 3&quot; for some &quot;k&quot;. The fact that this condition on &quot;n&quot; is sufficient for the existence of an S(2,3,&quot;n&quot;) was proved by Raj Chandra Bose and T. Skolem. The projective plane of order 2 (the Fano plane) is an STS(7) and the affine plane of order 3 is an STS(9). Up to isomorphism, the STS(7) and STS(9) are unique, there are two STS(13)s, 80 STS(15)s, and 11,084,874,829 STS(19)s.

We can define a multiplication on the set &quot;S&quot; using the Steiner triple system by setting &quot;aa&quot; = &quot;a&quot; for all &quot;a&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;ab&quot; = &quot;c&quot; if {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;} is a triple. This makes &quot;S&quot; an idempotent, commutative quasigroup. It has the additional property that &quot;ab&quot; = &quot;c&quot; implies &quot;bc&quot; = &quot;a&quot; and &quot;ca&quot; = &quot;b&quot;. Conversely, any (finite) quasigroup with these properties arises from a Steiner triple system. Commutative idempotent quasigroups satisfying this additional property are called &quot;Steiner quasigroups&quot;.

===Resolvable Steiner systems===
Some of the S(2,3,n) systems can have their triples partitioned into (n-1)/2 sets each having (n/3) pairwise disjoint triples. This is called &quot;resolvable&quot; and such systems are called &quot;Kirkman triple systems&quot; after Thomas Kirkman, who studied such resolvable systems before Steiner. Dale Mesner, Earl Kramer, and others investigated collections of Steiner triple systems that are mutually disjoint (i.e., no two Steiner systems in such a collection share a common triplet). It is known (Bays 1917, Kramer &amp; Mesner 1974) that seven different S(2,3,9) systems can be generated to together cover all 84 triplets on a 9-set; it was also known by them that there are 15360 different ways to find such 7-sets of solutions, which reduce to two non-isomorphic solutions under relabeling, with multiplicities 6720 and 8640 respectively.

The corresponding question for finding thirteen different disjoint S(2,3,15) systems was asked by James Sylvester in 1860 as an extension of the Kirkman&#x27;s schoolgirl problem, namely whether Kirkman&#x27;s schoolgirls could march for an entire term of 13 weeks with no triplet of girls being repeated over the whole term. The question was solved by RHF Denniston in 1974, who constructed Week 1 as follows:

for girls labeled A to O, and constructed each subsequent week&#x27;s solution from its immediate predecessor by changing A to B, B to C, ... L to M and M back to A, all while leaving N and O unchanged. The Week 13 solution, upon undergoing that relabeling, returns to the Week 1 solution. Denniston reported in his paper that the search he employed took 7 hours on an Elliott 4130 computer at the University of Leicester, and he immediately ended the search on finding the solution above, not looking to establish uniqueness. The number of non-isomorphic solutions to Sylvester&#x27;s problem remains unknown as of 2021.

== Properties ==
It is clear from the definition of that formula_4. (Equalities, while technically possible, lead to trivial systems.)

If exists, then taking all blocks containing a specific element and discarding that element gives a &quot;derived system&quot; . Therefore, the existence of is a necessary condition for the existence of .

The number of -element subsets in is formula_5, while the number of -element subsets in each block is formula_6. Since every -element subset is contained in exactly one block, we have formula_7, or 
:formula_8
where is the number of blocks. Similar reasoning about -element subsets containing a particular element gives us formula_9, or 
:formula_10 =formula_11
where is the number of blocks containing any given element. From these definitions follows the equation formula_12. It is a necessary condition for the existence of that and are integers. As with any block design, Fisher&#x27;s inequality formula_13 is true in Steiner systems.

Given the parameters of a Steiner system and a subset of size formula_14, contained in at least one block, one can compute the number of blocks intersecting that subset in a fixed number of elements by constructing a Pascal triangle. In particular, the number of blocks intersecting a fixed block in any number of elements is independent of the chosen block.

The number of blocks that contain any &quot;i&quot;-element set of points is:
:formula_15

It can be shown that if there is a Steiner system , where is a prime power greater than 1, then formula_1 1 or . In particular, a Steiner triple system must have . And as we have already mentioned, this is the only restriction on Steiner triple systems, that is, for each natural number , systems and exist.

== History ==
Steiner triple systems were defined for the first time by Wesley S. B. Woolhouse in 1844 in the Prize question #1733 of Lady&#x27;s and Gentlemen&#x27;s Diary. The posed problem was solved by . In 1850 Kirkman posed a variation of the problem known as Kirkman&#x27;s schoolgirl problem, which asks for triple systems having an additional property (resolvability). Unaware of Kirkman&#x27;s work, reintroduced triple systems, and as this work was more widely known, the systems were named in his honor.

In 1910 Geoffrey Thomas Bennett gave a graphical representation for Steiner triple systems.

== Mathieu groups ==
Several examples of Steiner systems are closely related to group theory. In particular, the finite simple groups called Mathieu groups arise as automorphism groups of Steiner systems:

* The Mathieu group M11 is the automorphism group of a S(4,5,11) Steiner system
* The Mathieu group M12 is the automorphism group of a S(5,6,12) Steiner system
* The Mathieu group M22 is the unique index 2 subgroup of the automorphism group of a S(3,6,22) Steiner system
* The Mathieu group M23 is the automorphism group of a S(4,7,23) Steiner system
* The Mathieu group M24 is the automorphism group of a S(5,8,24) Steiner system.

== The Steiner system S(5, 6, 12) ==
There is a unique S(5,6,12) Steiner system; its automorphism group is the Mathieu group M12, and in that context it is denoted by W12.

=== Projective line construction ===
This construction is due to Carmichael (1937).

Add a new element, call it , to the 11 elements of the finite field 11 (that is, the integers mod 11). This set, , of 12 elements can be formally identified with the points of the projective line over 11. Call the following specific subset of size 6,
:formula_17
a &quot;block&quot; (it contains together with the 5 nonzero squares in 11). From this block, we obtain the other blocks of the (5,6,12) system by repeatedly applying the linear fractional transformations:
:formula_18
where are in 11 and .
With the usual conventions of defining and , these functions map the set onto itself. In geometric language, they are projectivities of the projective line. They form a group under composition which is the projective special linear group (2,11) of order 660. There are exactly five elements of this group that leave the starting block fixed setwise, namely those such that and so that . So there will be 660/5 = 132 images of that block. As a consequence of the multiply transitive property of this group acting on this set, any subset of five elements of will appear in exactly one of these 132 images of size six.

=== Kitten construction ===
An alternative construction of W12 is obtained by use of the &#x27;kitten&#x27; of R.T. Curtis, which was intended as a &quot;hand calculator&quot; to write down blocks one at a time. The kitten method is based on completing patterns in a 3x3 grid of numbers, which represent an affine geometry on the vector space F3xF3, an S(2,3,9) system.

=== Construction from K6 graph factorization ===
The relations between the graph factors of the complete graph K6 generate an S(5,6,12). A K6 graph has 6 vertices, 15 edges, 15 perfect matchings, and 6 different 1-factorizations (ways to partition the edges into disjoint perfect matchings). The set of vertices (labeled 123456) and the set of factorizations (labeled &quot;ABCDEF&quot;) provide one block each. Every pair of factorizations has exactly one perfect matching in common. Suppose factorizations &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; have the common matching with edges 12, 34 and 56. Add three new blocks &quot;AB&quot;3456, 12&quot;AB&quot;56, and 1234&quot;AB&quot;, replacing each edge in the common matching with the factorization labels in turn. Similarly add three more blocks 12&quot;CDEF&quot;, 34&quot;CDEF&quot;, and 56&quot;CDEF&quot;, replacing the factorization labels by the corresponding edge labels of the common matching. Do this for all 15 pairs of factorizations to add 90 new blocks. Finally, take the full set of formula_19 combinations of 6 objects out of 12, and discard any combination that has 5 or more objects in common with any of the 92 blocks generated so far. Exactly 40 blocks remain, resulting in blocks of the S(5,6,12). This method works because there is an outer automorphism on the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;6, which maps the vertices to factorizations and the edges to partitions. Permuting the vertices causes the factorizations to permute differently, in accordance with the outer automorphism.

== The Steiner system S(5, 8, 24) ==
The Steiner system S(5, 8, 24), also known as the Witt design or Witt geometry, was first described by and rediscovered by . This system is connected with many of the sporadic simple groups and with the exceptional 24-dimensional lattice known as the Leech lattice. The automorphism group of S(5, 8, 24) is the Mathieu group M24, and in that context the design is denoted W24 (&quot;W&quot; for &quot;Witt&quot;)

=== Direct lexicographic generation ===
All 8-element subsets of a 24-element set are generated in lexicographic order, and any such subset which differs from some subset already found in fewer than four positions is discarded.

The list of octads for the elements 01, 02, 03, ..., 22, 23, 24 is then:

:: 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08
:: 01 02 03 04 09 10 11 12
:: 01 02 03 04 13 14 15 16
:: . (next 753 octads omitted)
:: 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
:: 13 14 15 16 21 22 23 24
:: 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

Each single element occurs 253 times somewhere in some octad. Each pair occurs 77 times. Each triple occurs 21 times. Each quadruple (tetrad) occurs 5 times. Each quintuple (pentad) occurs once. Not every hexad, heptad or octad occurs.

=== Construction from the binary Golay code ===
The 4096 codewords of the 24-bit binary Golay code are generated, and the 759 codewords with a Hamming weight of 8 correspond to the S(5,8,24) system.

The Golay code can be constructed by many methods, such as generating all 24-bit binary strings in lexicographic order and discarding those that differ from some earlier one in fewer than 8 positions. The result looks like this:

The codewords form a group under the XOR operation.

=== Projective line construction ===
This construction is due to Carmichael (1931).

Add a new element, call it , to the 23 elements of the finite field 23 (that is, the integers mod 23). This set, , of 24 elements can be formally identified with the points of the projective line over 23. Call the following specific subset of size 8,
:formula_20
a &quot;block&quot;. (We can take any octad of the extended binary Golay code, seen as a quadratic residue code.) From this block, we obtain the other blocks of the (5,8,24) system by repeatedly applying the linear fractional transformations:
:formula_18
where are in 23 and .
With the usual conventions of defining and , these functions map the set onto itself. In geometric language, they are projectivities of the projective line. They form a group under composition which is the projective special linear group (2,23) of order 6072. There are exactly 8 elements of this group that leave the initial block fixed setwise. So there will be 6072/8 = 759 images of that block. These form the octads of S(5,8,24).

=== Construction from the Miracle Octad Generator ===
The Miracle Octad Generator (MOG) is a tool to generate octads, such as those containing specified subsets. It consists of a 4x6 array with certain weights assigned to the rows. In particular, an 8-subset should obey three rules in order to be an octad of S(5,8,24). First, each of the 6 columns should have the same parity, that is, they should all have an odd number of cells or they should all have an even number of cells. Second, the top row should have the same parity as each of the columns. Third, the rows are respectively multiplied by the weights 0, 1, 2, and 3 over the finite field of order 4, and column sums are calculated for the 6 columns, with multiplication and addition using the finite field arithmetic definitions. The resulting column sums should form a valid &quot;hexacodeword&quot; of the form where &quot;a, b, c&quot; are also from the finite field of order 4. If the column sums&#x27; parities don&#x27;t match the row sum parity, or each other, or if there do not exist &quot;a, b, c&quot; such that the column sums form a valid hexacodeword, then that subset of 8 is not an octad of S(5,8,24).

The MOG is based on creating a bijection (Conwell 1910, &quot;The three-space PG(3,2) and its group&quot;) between the 35 ways to partition an 8-set into two different 4-sets, and the 35 lines of the Fano 3-space PG(3,2). It is also geometrically related (Cullinane, &quot;Symmetry Invariance in a Diamond Ring&quot;, Notices of the AMS, pp A193-194, Feb 1979) to the 35 different ways to partition a 4x4 array into 4 different groups of 4 cells each, such that if the 4x4 array represents a four-dimensional finite affine space, then the groups form a set of parallel subspaces.

<text>Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky. Its name is derived from the Greek word (Latin script: ), meaning &#x27;glowing&#x27; or &#x27;scorching&#x27;. The star is designated Canis Majoris, Latinized to Alpha Canis Majoris, and abbreviated CMa or Alpha CMa. With a visual apparent magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is almost twice as bright as Canopus, the next brightest star. Sirius is a binary star consisting of a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 or A1, termed Sirius A, and a faint white dwarf companion of spectral type DA2, termed Sirius B. The distance between the two varies between 8.2 and 31.5 astronomical units as they orbit every 50 years.

Sirius appears bright because of its intrinsic luminosity and its proximity to the Solar System. At a distance of , the Sirius system is one of Earth&#x27;s nearest neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System and it is expected to increase in brightness slightly over the next 60,000 years to reach a peak magnitude of −1.68.
Coincidentally, at about the same time, Sirius will take its turn as the southern Pole Star, around the year 66,270 AD. In that year, Sirius will come to within 1.6 degrees of the south celestial pole. This is due to axial precession and proper motion of Sirius itself which moves slowly in the SSW direction, so it will be visible from the southern hemisphere only.
After that time, its distance will begin to increase, and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be the brightest star in the Earth&#x27;s night sky for approximately the next 210,000 years, at which point Vega, another A-type star that is intrinsically more luminous than Sirius, becomes the brightest star.

Sirius A is about twice as massive as the Sun () and has an absolute visual magnitude of +1.43. It is 25 times as luminous as the Sun, but has a significantly lower luminosity than other bright stars such as Canopus, Betelgeuse, or Rigel. The system is between 200 and 300 million years old. It was originally composed of two bright bluish stars. The initially more massive of these, Sirius B, consumed its hydrogen fuel and became a red giant before shedding its outer layers and collapsing into its current state as a white dwarf around 120 million years ago.

Sirius is colloquially known as the &quot;Dog Star&quot;, reflecting its prominence in its constellation, Canis Major (the Greater Dog). The heliacal rising of Sirius marked the flooding of the Nile in Ancient Egypt and the &quot;dog days&quot; of summer for the ancient Greeks, while to the Polynesians, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere, the star marked winter and was an important reference for their navigation around the Pacific Ocean.

== Observational history ==

As the brightest star in the night sky, Sirius appears in some of the earliest astronomical records. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes its heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This rising occurs at Cairo on 19 July (Julian), placing it just before the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity. Owing to the flood&#x27;s own irregularity, the extreme precision of the star&#x27;s return made it important to the ancient Egyptians, who worshipped it as the goddess Sopdet (, &quot;Triangle&quot;; }, &quot;Sō̂this&quot;), guarantor of the fertility of their land.

The ancient Greeks observed that the appearance of Sirius as the morning star heralded the hot and dry summer and feared that the star caused plants to wilt, men to weaken, and women to become aroused. Owing to its brightness, Sirius would have been seen to twinkle more in the unsettled weather conditions of early summer. To Greek observers, this signified emanations that caused its malignant influence. Anyone suffering its effects was said to be &quot;star-struck&quot; (, &quot;astrobólētos&quot;). It was described as &quot;burning&quot; or &quot;flaming&quot; in literature. The season following the star&#x27;s reappearance came to be known as the &quot;dog days&quot;. The inhabitants of the island of Ceos in the Aegean Sea would offer sacrifices to Sirius and Zeus to bring cooling breezes and would await the reappearance of the star in summer. If it rose clear, it would portend good fortune; if it was misty or faint then it foretold (or emanated) pestilence. Coins retrieved from the island from the 3rd century BC feature dogs or stars with emanating rays, highlighting Sirius&#x27;s importance.

The Romans celebrated the heliacal setting of Sirius around 25 April, sacrificing a dog, along with incense, wine, and a sheep, to the goddess Robigo so that the star&#x27;s emanations would not cause wheat rust on wheat crops that year.

Bright stars were important to the ancient Polynesians for navigation of the Pacific Ocean. They also served as latitude markers; the declination of Sirius matches the latitude of the archipelago of Fiji at 17°S and thus passes directly over the islands each sidereal day. Sirius served as the body of a &quot;Great Bird&quot; constellation called &quot;Manu&quot;, with Canopus as the southern wingtip and Procyon the northern wingtip, which divided the Polynesian night sky into two hemispheres. Just as the appearance of Sirius in the morning sky marked summer in Greece, it marked the onset of winter for the Māori, whose name &quot;Takurua&quot; described both the star and the season. Its culmination at the winter solstice was marked by celebration in Hawaii, where it was known as &quot;Ka&#x27;ulua&quot;, &quot;Queen of Heaven&quot;. Many other Polynesian names have been recorded, including &quot;Tau-ua&quot; in the Marquesas Islands, &quot;Rehua&quot; in New Zealand, and &quot;Ta&#x27;urua-fau-papa&quot; &quot;Festivity of original high chiefs&quot; and &quot;Ta&#x27;urua-e-hiti-i-te-tara-te-feiai&quot; &quot;Festivity who rises with prayers and religious ceremonies&quot; in Tahiti.

=== Kinematics ===
In 1717, Edmond Halley discovered the proper motion of the hitherto presumed &quot;fixed stars&quot; after comparing contemporary astrometric measurements with those from the second century AD given in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;. The bright stars Aldebaran, Arcturus and Sirius were noted to have moved significantly; Sirius had progressed about 30 arcminutes (about the diameter of the Moon) to the southwest.

In 1868, Sirius became the first star to have its velocity measured, the beginning of the study of celestial radial velocities. Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of the star and observed a red shift. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40 km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5 km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus sign (−) means that it is approaching the Sun.

=== Distance ===
In his 1698 book, &quot;Cosmotheoros&quot;, Christiaan Huygens estimated the distance to Sirius at 27,664 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun (about 0.437 light-year, translating to a parallax of roughly 7.5 arcseconds). There were several unsuccessful attempts to measure the parallax of Sirius: by Jacques Cassini (6 seconds); by some astronomers (including Nevil Maskelyne) using Lacaille&#x27;s observations made at the Cape of Good Hope (4 seconds); by Piazzi (the same amount); using Lacaille&#x27;s observations made at Paris, more numerous and certain than those made at the Cape (no sensible parallax); by Bessel (no sensible parallax).

Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson used his observations made in 1832–1833 and South African astronomer Thomas Maclear&#x27;s observations made in 1836–1837, to determine that the value of the parallax was 0.23 arcsecond, and error of the parallax was estimated not to exceed a quarter of a second, or as Henderson wrote in 1839, &quot;On the whole we may conclude that the parallax of Sirius is not greater than half a second in space; and that it is probably much less.&quot; Astronomers adopted a value of 0.25 arcsecond for much of the 19th century. It is now known to have a parallax of nearly .

The Hipparcos parallax for Sirius is only accurate to about  light years, giving a distance of . Sirius B is generally assumed to be at the same distance. Sirius B has a Gaia Data Release 3 parallax with a much smaller statistical margin of error, giving a distance of , but it is flagged as having a very large value for astrometric excess noise, which indicates that the parallax value may be unreliable.

=== Discovery of Sirius B ===
In a letter dated 10 August 1844, the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel deduced from changes in the proper motion of Sirius that it had an unseen companion. On 31 January 1862, American telescope-maker and astronomer Alvan Graham Clark first observed the faint companion, which is now called Sirius B. This happened during testing of an aperture great refractor telescope for Dearborn Observatory, which was one of the largest refracting telescope lenses in existence at the time, and the largest telescope in the United States. Sirius B&#x27;s sighting was confirmed on 8 March with smaller telescopes.

The visible star is now sometimes known as Sirius A. Since 1894, some apparent orbital irregularities in the Sirius system have been observed, suggesting a third very small companion star, but this has never been confirmed. The best fit to the data indicates a six-year orbit around Sirius A and a mass of . This star would be five to ten magnitudes fainter than the white dwarf Sirius B, which would make it difficult to observe. Observations published in 2008 were unable to detect either a third star or a planet. An apparent &quot;third star&quot; observed in the 1920s is now believed to be a background object.

In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a reflector at Mount Wilson Observatory, observed the spectrum of Sirius B and determined that it was a faint whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude that it was a white dwarf—the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers determined that Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun&#x27;s.

=== Colour controversy ===

Around the year 150 AD, Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria, an ethnic Greek Egyptian astronomer of the Roman period, mapped the stars in Books VII and VIII of his &quot;Almagest&quot;, in which he used Sirius as the location for the globe&#x27;s central meridian. He described Sirius as reddish, along with five other stars, Betelgeuse, Antares, Aldebaran, Arcturus, and Pollux, all of which are at present observed to be of orange or red hue. The discrepancy was first noted by amateur astronomer Thomas Barker, squire of Lyndon Hall in Rutland, who prepared a paper and spoke at a meeting of the Royal Society in London in 1760. The existence of other stars changing in brightness gave credibility to the idea that some may change in colour too; Sir John Herschel noted this in 1839, possibly influenced by witnessing Eta Carinae two years earlier. Thomas J.J. See resurrected discussion on red Sirius with the publication of several papers in 1892, and a final summary in 1926. He cited not only Ptolemy but also the poet Aratus, the orator Cicero, and general Germanicus all calling the star red, though acknowledging that none of the latter three authors were astronomers, the last two merely translating Aratus&#x27;s poem &quot;Phaenomena&quot;. Seneca had described Sirius as being of a deeper red than Mars. It is therefore possible that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune. In 1985, German astronomers Wolfhard Schlosser and Werner Bergmann published an account of an 8th-century Lombardic manuscript, which contains &quot;De cursu stellarum ratio&quot; by St. Gregory of Tours. The Latin text taught readers how to determine the times of nighttime prayers from positions of the stars, and a bright star described as &quot;rubeola&quot; (&quot;reddish&quot;) was claimed to be Sirius. The authors proposed this as evidence that Sirius B had been a red giant at the time of observation. Other scholars replied that it was likely St. Gregory had been referring to Arcturus.

It is notable that not all ancient observers saw Sirius as red. The 1st-century poet Marcus Manilius described it as &quot;sea-blue&quot;, as did the 4th-century Avienius. Furthermore, Sirius was consistently reported as a white star in ancient China: a detailed re-evaluation of Chinese texts from the 2nd century BC up to the 7th century AD concluded that all such reliable sources are consistent with Sirius being white.

Nevertheless, historical accounts referring to Sirius as red are sufficiently extensive to lead researchers to seek possible physical explanations. Proposed theories fall into two categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic theories postulate a real change in the Sirius system over the past two millennia, of which the most widely discussed is the proposal that the white dwarf Sirius B was a red giant as recently as 2000 years ago. Extrinsic theories are concerned with the possibility of transient reddening in an intervening medium through which the star is observed, such as might be caused by dust in the interstellar medium, or by particles in the terrestrial atmosphere.

The possibility that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could be responsible for the discrepancy has been rejected on the grounds that the timescale of thousands of years is orders of magnitude too short and that there is no sign of the nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. Similarly, the presence of a third star sufficiently luminous to affect the visible colour of the system in recent millennia is inconsistent with observational evidence. Intrinsic theories may therefore be disregarded. Extrinsic theories based on reddening by interstellar dust are similarly implausible. A transient dust cloud passing between the Sirius system and an observer on Earth would, indeed redden the appearance of the star to some degree, but reddening sufficient to cause it to appear similar in colour to intrinsically red bright stars such as Betelgeuse and Arcturus would also dim the star by several magnitudes, inconsistent with historical accounts: indeed, the dimming would be sufficient to render the colour of the star imperceptible to the human eye without the aid of a telescope.

Extrinsic theories based on optical effects in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are better supported by available evidence. Scintillations caused by atmospheric turbulence result in rapid, transient changes in the apparent colour of the star, especially when observed near the horizon, although with no particular preference for red. However, systematic reddening of the star&#x27;s light results from absorption and scattering by particles in the atmosphere, exactly analogous to the redness of the Sun at sunrise and sunset. Because the particles that cause reddening in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere are different (typically much smaller) than those that cause reddening in the interstellar medium, there is far less dimming of the starlight, and in the case of Sirius the change in colour can be seen without the aid of a telescope. There may be cultural reasons to explain why some ancient observers might have reported the colour of Sirius preferentially when it was situated low in the sky (and therefore apparently red). In several Mediterranean cultures, the local visibility of Sirius at heliacal rising and setting (whether it appeared bright and clear or dimmed) was thought to have astrological significance and was thus subject to systematic observation and intense interest. Thus Sirius, more than any other star, was observed and recorded while close to the horizon. Other contemporary cultures, such as Chinese, lacking this tradition, recorded Sirius only as white.

== Observation ==
With an apparent magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky, almost twice as bright as the second-brightest star, Canopus. From Earth, Sirius always appears dimmer than Jupiter and Venus, and at certain times also dimmer than Mercury and Mars. Sirius is visible from almost everywhere on Earth, except latitudes north of 73° N, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities (reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg). Because of its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, Sirius forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere.

Sirius can be observed in daylight with the naked eye under the right conditions. Ideally, the sky should be very clear, with the observer at a high altitude, the star passing overhead, and the Sun low on the horizon. These conditions are most easily met around sunset in March and April, and around sunrise in September and October. Observing conditions are more favorable in the Southern Hemisphere, owing to the southerly declination of Sirius.

The orbital motion of the Sirius binary system brings the two stars to a minimum angular separation of 3 arcseconds and a maximum of 11 arcseconds. At the closest approach, it is an observational challenge to distinguish the white dwarf from its more luminous companion, requiring a telescope with at least aperture and excellent seeing conditions. After a periastron occurred in 1994,
the pair moved apart, making them easier to separate with a telescope. Apoastron occurred in 2019,
but from the Earth&#x27;s vantage point, the greatest observational separation occurred in 2023, with an angular separation of 11.333″.

At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), the Sirius system contains two of the eight nearest stars to the Sun, and it is the fifth closest stellar system to the Sun. This proximity is the main reason for its brightness, as with other near stars such as Alpha Centauri, Procyon and Vega and in contrast to distant, highly luminous supergiants such as Canopus, Rigel or Betelgeuse (although Canopus may be a bright giant). It is still around 25 times more luminous than the Sun. The closest large neighbouring star to Sirius is Procyon, 1.61 parsecs (5.24 ly) away. The &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft, launched in 1977 to study the four giant planets in the Solar System, is expected to pass within of Sirius in approximately 296,000 years.

== Stellar system ==

Sirius is a binary star system consisting of two white stars orbiting each other with a separation of about 20 AU
(roughly the distance between the Sun and Uranus) and a period of 50.1 years. The brighter component, termed Sirius A, is a main-sequence star of spectral type early A, with an estimated surface temperature of 9,940 K. Its companion, Sirius B, is a star that has already evolved off the main sequence and become a white dwarf. Currently 10,000 times less luminous in the visual spectrum, Sirius B was once the more massive of the two. The age of the system has been estimated at 230 million years. Early in its life, it is thought to have been two bluish-white stars orbiting each other in an elliptical orbit every 9.1 years. The system emits a higher than expected level of infrared radiation, as measured by IRAS space-based observatory. This might be an indication of dust in the system, which is considered somewhat unusual for a binary star. The Chandra X-ray Observatory image shows Sirius B outshining its partner as an X-ray source.

In 2015, Vigan and colleagues used the VLT Survey Telescope to search for evidence of substellar companions, and were able to rule out the presence of giant planets 11 times more massive than Jupiter at 0.5 AU distance from Sirius A, 6–7 times the mass of Jupiter at 1–2 AU distance, and down to around 4 times the mass of Jupiter at 10 AU distance. Similarly, Lucas and colleagues did not detect any companions around Sirius B.

=== Sirius A ===
Sirius A, also known as the Dog Star, has a mass of . The radius of this star has been measured by an astronomical interferometer, giving an estimated angular diameter of 5.936±0.016 mas. The projected rotational velocity is a relatively low 16 km/s, which does not produce any significant flattening of its disk. This is at marked variance with the similar-sized Vega, which rotates at a much faster 274 km/s and bulges prominently around its equator. A weak magnetic field has been detected on the surface of Sirius A.

Stellar models suggest that the star formed during the collapsing of a molecular cloud and that, after 10 million years, its internal energy generation was derived entirely from nuclear reactions. The core became convective and used the CNO cycle for energy generation. It is calculated that Sirius A will have completely exhausted the store of hydrogen at its core within a billion () years of its formation, and will then evolve away from the main sequence. It will pass through a red giant stage and eventually become a white dwarf.

Sirius A is classed as a type because the spectrum shows deep metallic absorption lines, indicating an enhancement of its surface layers in elements heavier than helium, such as iron. The spectral type has been reported as which indicates that it would be classified as A1 from hydrogen and helium lines, but A0 from the metallic lines that cause it to be grouped with the Am stars. When compared to the Sun, the proportion of iron in the atmosphere of Sirius A relative to hydrogen is given by formula_1 meaning iron is 316% as abundant as in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere. The high surface content of metallic elements is unlikely to be true of the entire star; rather the iron-peak and heavy metals are radiatively levitated towards the surface.

=== Sirius B ===
Sirius B, also known as the Pup Star, is one of the most massive white dwarfs known. With a mass of , it is almost double the average. This mass is packed into a volume roughly equal to the Earth&#x27;s. The current surface temperature is 25,200 K. Because there is no internal heat source, Sirius B will steadily cool as the remaining heat is radiated into space over the next two billion years or so.

A white dwarf forms after a star has evolved from the main sequence and then passed through a red giant stage. This occurred when Sirius B was less than half its current age, around 120 million years ago. The original star had an estimated and was a B-type star (most likely B5V for ) when it was still on the main sequence, potentially burning around 600–1200 times more luminous than the sun. While it passed through the red giant stage, Sirius B may have enriched the metallicity of its companion, explaining the very high metallicity of Sirius A.

This star is primarily composed of a carbon–oxygen mixture that was generated by helium fusion in the progenitor star. This is overlaid by an envelope of lighter elements, with the materials segregated by mass because of the high surface gravity. The outer atmosphere of Sirius B is now almost pure hydrogen—the element with the lowest mass—and no other elements are seen in its spectrum.

Although Sirius A and B compose a binary system that is reminiscent of those that can undergo Type Ia supernova, the two stars are believed to be too far apart for it to occur, even if Sirius A swells into a red giant. Novas, however, may be possible.

=== Apparent third star ===

Since 1894, irregularities have been tentatively observed in the orbits of Sirius A and B with an apparent periodicity of 6–6.4 years. A 1995 study concluded that such a companion likely exists, with a mass of roughly 0.05 solar mass—a small red dwarf or large brown dwarf, with an apparent magnitude of more than 15, and less than 3 arcseconds from Sirius A.

In 2017, more accurate astrometric observations by the Hubble Space Telescope ruled out the existence of a stellar mass sized Sirius C, while still allowing a substellar mass candidate such as a lower mass Brown dwarf. The 1995 study predicted an astrometric movement of roughly 90 mas (0.09 arcsecond), but Hubble was unable to detect any location anomaly to an accuracy of 5 mas (0.005 arcsec). This ruled out any objects orbiting Sirius A with more than 0.033 solar mass (35 Jupiter masses) in 0.5 years, and 0.014 (15 Jupiter masses) in 2 years. The study was also able to rule out any companions to Sirius B with more than 0.024 solar mass (25 Jupiter masses) orbiting in 0.5 year, and 0.0095 (10 Jupiter masses) orbiting in 1.8 years. Effectively, there are almost certainly no additional bodies in the Sirius system larger than a small brown dwarf or large exoplanet.

=== Star cluster membership ===
In 1909, Ejnar Hertzsprung was the first to suggest that Sirius was a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group, based on his observations of the system&#x27;s movements across the sky. The Ursa Major Group is a set of 220 stars that share a common motion through space. It was once a member of an open cluster, but has since become gravitationally unbound from the cluster. Analyses in 2003 and 2005 found Sirius&#x27;s membership in the group to be questionable: the Ursa Major Group has an estimated age of 500 ± 100 million years, whereas Sirius, with metallicity similar to the Sun&#x27;s, has an age that is only half this, making it too young to belong to the group. Sirius may instead be a member of the proposed Sirius Supercluster, along with other scattered stars such as Beta Aurigae, Alpha Coronae Borealis, Beta Crateris, Beta Eridani and Beta Serpentis. This would be one of three large clusters located within of the Sun. The other two are the Hyades and the Pleiades, and each of these clusters consists of hundreds of stars.

=== Distant star cluster ===
In 2017, a massive star cluster was discovered only 10 arcminutes from Sirius, making the two appear to be visually close to one other when viewed from the point of view of the Earth. It was discovered during a statistical analysis of &quot;Gaia&quot; data. The cluster is over a thousand times further away from us than the star system, but given its size it still appears at magnitude 8.3.

== Etymology ==

The proper name &quot;Sirius&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;Sīrius&quot;, from the Ancient Greek (&quot;Seirios&quot;, &quot;glowing&quot; or &quot;scorcher&quot;). The Greek word itself may have been imported from elsewhere before the Archaic period, one authority suggesting a link with the Egyptian god Osiris. The name&#x27;s earliest recorded use dates from the 7th century BC in Hesiod&#x27;s poetic work &quot;Works and Days&quot;. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Sirius&quot; for the star α Canis Majoris A. It is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

Sirius has over 50 other designations and names attached to it. In Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s essay &quot;Treatise on the Astrolabe&quot;, it bears the name &quot;Alhabor&quot; and is depicted by a hound&#x27;s head. This name is widely used on medieval astrolabes from Western Europe. In Sanskrit it is known as &quot;Mrgavyadha&quot; &quot;deer hunter&quot;, or &quot;Lubdhaka&quot; &quot;hunter&quot;. As Mrgavyadha, the star represents Rudra (Shiva). The star is referred to as &quot;Makarajyoti&quot; in Malayalam and has religious significance to the pilgrim center Sabarimala. In Scandinavia, the star has been known as &quot;Lokabrenna&quot; (&quot;burning done by Loki&quot;, or &quot;Loki&#x27;s torch&quot;). In the astrology of the Middle Ages, Sirius was a Behenian fixed star, associated with beryl and juniper. Its astrological symbol was listed by Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa.

==Cultural significance==
Many cultures have historically attached special significance to Sirius, particularly in relation to dogs. It is often colloquially called the &quot;Dog Star&quot; as the brightest star of Canis Major, the &quot;Great Dog&quot; constellation. Canis Major was classically depicted as Orion&#x27;s dog. The Ancient Greeks thought that Sirius&#x27;s emanations could affect dogs adversely, making them behave abnormally during the &quot;dog days&quot;, the hottest days of the summer. The Romans knew these days as , and the star Sirius was called Canicula, &quot;little dog&quot;. The excessive panting of dogs in hot weather was thought to place them at risk of desiccation and disease. In extreme cases, a foaming dog might have rabies, which could infect and kill humans they had bitten. Homer, in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, describes the approach of Achilles toward Troy in these words:

In a little-attested Greek myth, the star-god that personified Sirius fell in love with a fertility goddess named Opora, but he was unable to have her. Thus he began to burn hot, making humans suffer, who prayed to the gods. The god of the north wind, Boreas, solved the problem by ordering his sons to deliver Opora to Sirius, while he cooled down the earth with blasts of his own cold wind.

In Iranian mythology, especially in Persian mythology and in Zoroastrianism, the ancient religion of Persia, Sirius appears as &quot;Tishtrya&quot; and is revered as the rain-maker divinity (Tishtar of New Persian poetry). Beside passages in the sacred texts of the Avesta, the Avestan language &quot;Tishtrya&quot; followed by the version &quot;Tir&quot; in Middle and New Persian is also depicted in the Persian epic &quot;Shahnameh&quot; of Ferdowsi. Because of the concept of the yazatas, powers which are &quot;worthy of worship&quot;, Tishtrya is a divinity of rain and fertility and an antagonist of apaosha, the demon of drought. In this struggle, Tishtrya is depicted as a white horse.

In Chinese astronomy Sirius is known as the star of the &quot;celestial wolf&quot; ( Chinese romanization: Tiānláng; Japanese romanization: Tenrō; Korean and romanization: 천랑 /Cheonrang) in the Mansion of Jǐng (井宿). Many nations among the indigenous peoples of North America also associated Sirius with canines; the Seri and Tohono Oʼodham of the southwest note the star as a dog that follows mountain sheep, while the Blackfoot called it &quot;Dog-face&quot;. The Cherokee paired Sirius with Antares as a dog-star guardian of either end of the &quot;Path of Souls&quot;. The Pawnee of Nebraska had several associations; the Wolf (Skidi) tribe knew it as the &quot;Wolf Star&quot;, while other branches knew it as the &quot;Coyote Star&quot;. Further north, the Alaskan Inuit of the Bering Strait called it &quot;Moon Dog&quot;.

Several cultures also associated the star with a bow and arrows. The ancient Chinese visualized a large bow and arrow across the southern sky, formed by the constellations of Puppis and Canis Major. In this, the arrow tip is pointed at the wolf Sirius. A similar association is depicted at the Temple of Hathor in Dendera, where the goddess Satet has drawn her arrow at Hathor (Sirius). Known as &quot;Tir&quot;, the star was portrayed as the arrow itself in later Persian culture.

Sirius is mentioned in &quot;Surah&quot;, &quot;An-Najm&quot; (&quot;The Star&quot;), of the Qur&#x27;an, where it is given the name (transliteration: &quot;aš-ši&#x27;rā&quot; or &quot;ash-shira&quot;; the leader). The verse is: &quot;&quot;, &quot;That He is the Lord of Sirius (the Mighty Star).&quot; (An-Najm:49) Ibn Kathir said in his commentary &quot;that it is the bright star, named Mirzam Al-Jawza&#x27; (Sirius), which a group of Arabs used to worship&quot;. The alternate name &quot;Aschere&quot;, used by Johann Bayer, is derived from this.

In theosophy, it is believed the &quot;Seven Stars of the Pleiades&quot; transmit the spiritual energy of the Seven Rays from the &quot;Galactic Logos&quot; to the &quot;Seven Stars of the Great Bear&quot;, then to Sirius. From there is it sent via the Sun to the god of Earth (Sanat Kumara), and finally through the seven Masters of the Seven Rays to the human race.

The midnight culmination of Sirius in the northern hemisphere coincides with the beginning of the New Year of the Gregorian calendar during the decades around the year 2000. Over the years, its midnight culmination moves slowly, owing to the combination of the star&#x27;s proper motion and the precession of the equinoxes. At the time of the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in the year 1582, its culmination occurred 17 minutes before midnight into the new year under the assumption of a constant motion. According to Richard Hinckley Allen its midnight culmination was celebrated at the Temple of Demeter at Eleusis.

=== Dogon ===
The Dogon people are an ethnic group in Mali, West Africa, reported by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible without the use of telescopes. According to Marcel Griaule, they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers.

Doubts have been raised about the validity of Griaule and Dieterlein&#x27;s work. In 1991, anthropologist Walter van Beek concluded about the Dogon, &quot;Though they do speak about &quot;sigu tolo&quot; [which is what Griaule claimed the Dogon called Sirius] they disagree completely with each other as to which star is meant; for some it is an invisible star that should rise to announce the &quot;sigu&quot; [festival], for another it is Venus that, through a different position, appears as &quot;sigu tolo&quot;. All agree, however, that they learned about the star from Griaule.&quot; According to Noah Brosch cultural transfer of relatively modern astronomical information could have taken place in 1893, when a French expedition arrived in Central West Africa to observe the total eclipse on 16 April.

=== Serer religion ===

In the religion of the Serer people of Senegal, the Gambia and Mauritania, Sirius is called &quot;Yoonir&quot; from the Serer language (and some of the Cangin language speakers, who are all ethnically Serers). The star Sirius is one of the most important and sacred stars in Serer religious cosmology and symbolism. The Serer high priests and priestesses (Saltigues, the hereditary &quot;rain priests&quot;) chart &quot;Yoonir&quot; to forecast rainfall and enable Serer farmers to start planting seeds. In Serer religious cosmology, it is the symbol of the universe.

=== Modern significance ===


Sirius features on the coat of arms of Macquarie University, and is the name of its alumnae journal. Seven ships of the Royal Navy have been called since the 18th century, with the first being the flagship of the First Fleet to Australia in 1788. The Royal Australian Navy subsequently named a vessel in honor of the flagship. American vessels include the as well as a monoplane model—the Lockheed Sirius, the first of which was flown by Charles Lindbergh. The name was also adopted by Mitsubishi Motors as the Mitsubishi Sirius engine in 1980. The name of the North American satellite radio company CD Radio was changed to Sirius Satellite Radio in November 1999, being named after &quot;the brightest star in the night sky&quot;. Sirius is one of the 27 stars on the flag of Brazil, where it represents the state of Mato Grosso.

Composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who wrote a piece called &quot;Sirius&quot;, is claimed to have said on several occasions that he came from a planet in the Sirius system. To Stockhausen, Sirius stood for &quot;the place where music is the highest of vibrations&quot; and where music had been developed in the most perfect way.

Sirius has been the subject of poetry. Dante and John Milton reference the star, and it is the &quot;powerful western fallen star&quot; of Walt Whitman&#x27;s &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot;, while Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Princess&quot; describes the star&#x27;s scintillation:
Throughout the 1990s, several members of the occult group the Order of the Solar Temple committed mass murder-suicide with the goal of leaving their bodies and spiritually &quot;transiting&quot; to Sirius. In total, 74 people died in all of the suicides and murders.

<text>Simon Magus (Greek Σίμων ὁ μάγος, Latin: Simon Magus), also known as Simon the Sorcerer or Simon the Magician, was a religious figure whose confrontation with Peter is recorded in the Acts of the Apostles. The act of simony, or paying for position, is named after Simon, who tried to buy his way into the power of the Apostles.

According to Acts, Simon was a Samaritan magus or religious figure of the 1st century AD and a convert to Christianity, baptised by Philip the Evangelist. Simon later clashed with Peter. Accounts of Simon by writers of the second century exist, but are not considered verifiable. Surviving traditions about Simon appear in orthodox texts, such as those of Irenaeus, Justin Martyr, Hippolytus, and Epiphanius, where he is often described as the founder of Gnosticism, which has been accepted by some modern scholars, while others reject claims that he was a Gnostic, maintaining that he was merely considered to be one by the Church Fathers.

Justin, who was himself a 2nd-century native of Samaria, wrote that nearly all the Samaritans in his time were adherents of a certain Simon of Gitta, a village not far from Flavia Neapolis. Irenaeus believed him to have been the founder of the sect of the Simonians. Hippolytus quotes from a work he attributes to Simon or his followers the Simonians, &quot;Apophasis Megale&quot;, or &quot;Great Declaration&quot;. According to the early church heresiologists, Simon is also supposed to have written several lost treatises, two of which bear the titles &quot;The Four Quarters of the World&quot; and &quot;The Sermons of the Refuter&quot;.

In apocryphal works including the &quot;Acts of Peter&quot;, Pseudo-Clementines, and the &quot;Epistle of the Apostles&quot;, Simon also appears as a formidable sorcerer with the ability to levitate and fly at will. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Bad Samaritan&quot; due to his malevolent character. The &quot;Apostolic Constitutions&quot; also accuses him of &quot;lawlessness&quot; (antinomianism).

==History==
===Acts of the Apostles===
The canonical Acts of the Apostles features a short narrative about Simon Magus; this is his only appearance in the New Testament.

===Josephus===
Josephus mentions a magician named Atomus (Simon in Latin manuscripts) as being involved with the procurator Felix, King Agrippa II and his sister Drusilla, where Felix has Simon convince Drusilla to marry him instead of the man she was engaged to. Some scholars have considered the two to be identical, although this is not generally accepted, as the Simon of Josephus is a Jew rather than a Samaritan. Robert McNair Price has spoken on the speculation by academics Ferdinand Christian Baur and Hermann Detering that Simon may be identified with Paul the Apostle.

===Justin Martyr and Irenaeus===
Justin Martyr (in his &quot;Apologies&quot;, and in a lost work against heresies, which Irenaeus used as his main source) and Irenaeus (&quot;Adversus Haereses&quot;) record that after being cast out by the Apostles, Simon Magus came to Rome where, having joined to himself a profligate woman of the name of Helen, he gave out that it was he who appeared among the Jews as the Son, in Samaria as the Father and among other nations as the Holy Spirit. He performed such signs by magic acts during the reign of Claudius that he was regarded as a god and honored with a statue on the island in the Tiber which the two bridges cross, with the inscription &quot;Simoni Deo Sancto&quot;, &quot;To Simon the Holy God&quot; (). However, in the 16th century, a statue was unearthed on the island in question, inscribed to Semo Sancus, a Sabine deity, leading some scholars to conclude that Justin Martyr confused &quot;Semoni Sancus&quot; with Simon.

====Myth of Simon and Helen====
Justin and Irenaeus are the first to recount the myth of Simon and Helen, which became the center of Simonian doctrine. Epiphanius of Salamis also makes Simon speak in the first person in several places in his &quot;Panarion&quot;, and the implication is that he is quoting from a version of it, though perhaps not verbatim.

As described by Epiphanius, in the beginning God had his first thought, his &quot;Ennoia&quot;, which was female, and that thought was to create the angels. The First Thought then descended into the lower regions and created the angels. But the angels rebelled against her out of jealousy and created the world as her prison, imprisoning her in a female body. Thereafter, she was reincarnated many times, each time being shamed. Her many reincarnations included Helen of Troy, among others, and she finally was reincarnated as Helen, a slave and prostitute in the Phoenician city of Tyre. God then descended in the form of Simon Magus, to rescue his &quot;Ennoia&quot;, and to confer salvation upon men through knowledge of himself.

For as the angels were mismanaging the world, owing to their individual lust for rule, he had come to set things straight, and had descended under a changed form, likening himself to the Principalities and Powers through whom he passed, so that among men he appeared as a man, though he was not a man, and was thought to have suffered in Judaea, though he had not suffered.

But the prophets had delivered their prophecies under the inspiration of the world-creating angels: wherefore those who had their hope in him and in Helen minded them no more, and, as being free, did what they pleased; for men were saved according to his grace, but not according to just works. For works were not just by nature, but only by convention, in accordance with the enactments of the world-creating angels, who by precepts of this kind sought to bring men into slavery. Wherefore he promised that the world should be dissolved, and that those who were his should be freed from the dominion of the world-creators.

In this account of Simon there is a large portion common to almost all forms of Gnostic myths, together with something special to this form. They have in common the place in the work of creation assigned to the female principle, the conception of the Deity; the ignorance of the rulers of this lower world with regard to the Supreme Power; the descent of the female (Sophia) into the lower regions, and her inability to return. Special to the Simonian tale is the identification of Simon himself with the Supreme, and of his consort Helena with the female principle.

===Hippolytus===
In &quot;Philosophumena&quot;, Hippolytus retells the narrative on Simon written by Irenaeus (who in his turn based it on the lost &quot;Syntagma&quot; of Justin). Upon the story of &quot;the lost sheep&quot;, Hippolytus comments as follows:

Also, Hippolytus demonstrates acquaintance with the folk tradition on Simon which depicts him rather as a magician than Gnostic, and in constant conflict with Peter (also present in the apocrypha and Pseudo-Clementine literature). Reduced to despair by the curse laid upon him by Peter in the Acts, Simon soon abjured the faith and embarked on the career of a sorcerer:

====Simonians====

Hippolytus gives a much more doctrinally detailed account of Simonianism, including a system of divine emanations and interpretations of the Old Testament, with extensive quotations from the &quot;Apophasis Megale&quot;. Some believe that Hippolytus&#x27; account is of a later, more developed form of Simonianism, and that the original doctrines of the group were simpler, close to the account given by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus (this account however is also included in Hippolytus&#x27; work).

Hippolytus says the free love doctrine was held by them in its purest form, and speaks in language similar to that of Irenaeus about the variety of magic arts practiced by the Simonians, and also of their having images of Simon and Helen under the forms of Zeus and Athena. But he also adds, &quot;if any one, on seeing the images either of Simon or Helen, shall call them by those names, he is cast out, as showing ignorance of the mysteries.&quot;

===Epiphanius===
Epiphanius writes that there were some Simonians still in existence in his day (c. AD 367), but he speaks of them as almost extinct. Gitta, he says, had sunk from a town into a village. Epiphanius further charges Simon with having tried to wrest the words of St. Paul about the armour of God into agreement with his own identification of the with Athena. He tells us also that he gave barbaric names to the &quot;principalities and powers&quot;, and that he was the beginning of the Gnostics. The Law, according to him, was not of God, but of &quot;the sinister power&quot;. The same was the case with the prophets, and it was death to believe in the Old Testament.

===Cyril of Jerusalem===
Cyril of Jerusalem (346 AD) in the sixth of his Catechetical Lectures prefaces his history of the Manichaeans by a brief account of earlier heresies: Simon Magus, he says, had given out that he was going to be translated to heaven, and was actually careening through the air in a chariot drawn by demons when Peter and Paul knelt down and prayed, and their prayers brought him to earth a mangled corpse.

==Apocrypha==
===&quot;Acts of Peter&quot;===
The apocryphal &quot;Acts of Peter&quot; gives a more elaborate tale of Simon Magus&#x27; death. Simon is performing magic in the Forum, and, in order to prove himself to be a god, he levitates into the air above the Forum. The apostle Peter prays to God to stop his flying, and he stops mid-air and falls into a place called &quot;the &quot;Sacra Via&quot;&quot; (meaning &quot;Holy Way&quot; in Latin), breaking his legs &quot;in three parts&quot;. The previously non-hostile crowd then stones him. Now gravely injured, he has some people carry him on a bed at night from Rome to Ariccia, and is brought from there to Terracina to a person named Castor, who has been banished from Rome, on account of accusations of sorcery levelled against him. The Acts then continue to say that he died &quot;while being sorely cut by two physicians&quot;.

===&quot;Acts of Peter and Paul&quot;===
Another apocryphal document, the &quot;Acts of Peter and Paul&quot; gives a slightly different version of the above incident, which was shown in the context of a debate in front of the Emperor Nero. In this version, Paul the Apostle is present along with Peter, Simon levitates from a high wooden tower made upon his request, and dies &quot;divided into four parts&quot; due to the fall. Peter and Paul are then imprisoned by Nero, who further orders that Simon&#x27;s body be kept carefully for three days, in case, Christ-like, the magician should rise again.

===Pseudo-Clementine literature===
The Pseudo-Clementine &quot;Recognitions&quot; and &quot;Homilies&quot; give an account of Simon Magus and some of his teachings in regards to the Simonians. They are of uncertain date and authorship, and seem to have been worked over by several hands in the interest of diverse forms of belief.

Simon was a Samaritan, and a native of Gitta. The name of his father was Antonius, that of his mother Rachel. He studied Greek literature in Alexandria, and, having in addition to this great power in magic, became so ambitious that he wished to be considered a highest power, higher even than the God who created the world. And sometimes he &quot;darkly hinted&quot; that he himself was Christ, calling himself the Standing One. Which name he used to indicate that he would stand for ever, and had no cause in him for bodily decay. He did not believe that the God who created the world was the highest, nor that the dead would rise. He denied Jerusalem, and introduced Mount Gerizim in its stead. In place of the Christ of the Christians he proclaimed himself; and the Law he allegorized in accordance with his own preconceptions. He did indeed preach righteousness and judgment to come.

There was one John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Jesus in accordance with the law of parity; and as Jesus had twelve Apostles, bearing the number of the twelve solar months, so had he thirty leading men, making up the monthly tale of the moon. One of these thirty leading men was a woman called Helen, and the first and most esteemed by John was Simon. But on the death of John, he was away in Egypt for the practice of magic, and one Dositheus, by spreading a false report of Simon&#x27;s death, succeeded in installing himself as head of the sect. Simon on coming back thought it better to dissemble, and, pretending friendship for Dositheus, accepted the second place. Soon, however, he began to hint to the thirty that Dositheus was not as well acquainted as he might be with the doctrines of the school.

The encounter between Dositheus and Simon Magus was the beginnings of the sect of Simonians. The narrative goes on to say that Simon, having fallen in love with Helen, took her about with him, saying that she had come down into the world from the highest heavens, and was his mistress, inasmuch as she was Sophia, the Mother of All. It was for her sake, he said, that the Greeks and Barbarians fought the Trojan War, deluding themselves with an image of truth, for the real being was then present with the First God. By such allegories Simon deceived many, while at the same time he astounded them by his magic. A description is given of how he made a familiar spirit for himself by conjuring the soul out of a boy and keeping his image in his bedroom, and many instances of his feats of magic are given.

====Anti-Paulinism====
The Pseudo-Clementine writings were used in the 4th century by members of the Ebionite sect, one characteristic of which was hostility to Paul, whom they refused to recognize as an apostle. Ferdinand Christian Baur (1792–1860), founder of the Tübingen School, drew attention to the anti-Pauline characteristic in the Pseudo-Clementines, and pointed out that in the disputations between Simon and Peter, some of the claims Simon is represented as making (e.g. that of having seen the Lord, though not in his lifetime, yet subsequently in vision) were really the claims of Paul; and urged that Peter&#x27;s refutation of Simon was in some places intended as a polemic against Paul. The enmity between Peter and Simon is clearly shown. Simon&#x27;s magical powers are juxtaposed with Peter&#x27;s powers in order to express Peter&#x27;s authority over Simon through the power of prayer, and in the , the identification of Paul with Simon Magus is effected. Simon is there made to maintain that he has a better knowledge of the mind of Jesus than the disciples, who had seen and conversed with Jesus in person. His reason for this strange assertion is that visions are superior to waking reality, as divine is superior to human. Peter has much to say in reply to this, but the passage which mainly concerns us is as follows:

The anti-Pauline context of the Pseudo-Clementines is recognised, but the association with Simon Magus is surprising, according to Jozef Verheyden, since they have little in common. However the majority of scholars accept Baur&#x27;s identification, though others, including Lightfoot, argued extensively that the &quot;Simon Magus&quot; of the Pseudo-Clementines was not meant to stand for Paul. More recently, Berlin pastor Hermann Detering (1995) has made the case that the veiled anti-Pauline stance of the Pseudo-Clementines has historical roots, that the Acts 8 encounter between Simon the magician and Peter is itself based on the conflict between Peter and Paul. Detering&#x27;s belief has not found general support among scholars, but Robert M. Price argues much the same case in &quot;The Amazing Colossal Apostle:The Search for the Historical Paul&quot; (2012).

===Identification of Simon as the Apostle Paul===
Since Ferdinand Christian Baur in the 19th century, scholars including Hermann Detering and Margaret Barket have concluded that the attacks on &quot;Simon Magus&quot; in the 4th-century Pseudo-Clementines may be attacks on Paul. Detering takes the attacks of the Pseudo-Clementines as literal and historical, and suggests that the attacks of the Pseudo-Clementines are correct in identifying &quot;Simon Magus&quot; as a for Paul of Tarsus, with Simon-Paul originally having been detested by the church, and the name changed to Paul when he was rehabilitated by virtue of forged Epistles &quot;correcting&quot; the genuine ones. Robert Price has stated his agreement with this assertion.

====Anti-Marcionism====
There are other features in the portrait which are reminiscent of Marcion. The first thing mentioned in the &quot;Homilies&quot; about Simon&#x27;s opinions is that he denied that God was just. By &quot;God&quot; he meant the creator god. But he undertakes to prove from the Jewish scriptures that there is a higher god, who really possesses the perfections which are falsely ascribed to the lower god. On these grounds Peter complains that, when he was setting out for the gentiles to convert them from their worship of &quot;many gods upon earth&quot;, Satan had sent Simon before him to make them believe that there were &quot;many gods in heaven&quot;.

== Druidism ==
In Irish legend, Simon Magus came to be associated with Druidism. He is said to have come to the aid of the Druid Mog Ruith. The fierce denunciation of Christianity by Irish Druids appears to have resulted in Simon Magus being associated with Druidism. The word Druid was sometimes translated into Latin as &quot;magus&quot;, and Simon Magus was also known in Ireland as &quot;Simon the Druid&quot;.

==Medieval legends, later interpretations==
The church of Santa Francesca Romana, Rome, is claimed to have been built on the spot where Simon fell. Within the Church is a dented slab of marble that purports to bear the imprints of the knees of Peter and Paul during their prayer. The fantastic stories of Simon the Sorcerer persisted into the later Middle Ages, becoming a possible inspiration for the &quot;Faustbuch&quot; and Goethe&#x27;s Faust.

The opening story in Danilo Kiš&#x27;s 1983 collection &quot;The Encyclopedia of the Dead&quot;, &quot;Simon Magus&quot;, retells the confrontation between Simon and Peter agreeing with the account in the &quot;Acts of Peter&quot;, and provides an additional alternative ending in which Simon asks to be buried alive in order to be resurrected three days later (after which his body is found putrefied).

<text>A school is the educational institution (and, in the case of in-person learning, the building) designed to provide learning environments for the teaching of students, usually under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory. In these systems, students progress through a series of schools that can be built and operated by both government and private organization. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the &quot;Regional terms&quot; section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or university.

In addition to these core schools, students in a given country may also attend schools before and after primary (elementary in the U.S.) and secondary (middle school in the U.S.) education. Kindergarten or preschool provide some schooling to very young children (typically ages 3–5). University, vocational school, college, or seminary may be available after secondary school. A school may be dedicated to one particular field, such as a school of economics or dance. Alternative schools may provide nontraditional curriculum and methods.

Non-government schools, also known as private schools, may be required when the government does not supply adequate or specific educational needs. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, gurukula (Hindu schools), madrasa (Arabic schools), hawzas (Shi&#x27;i Muslim schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training, and business schools.

Critics of school often accuse the school system of failing to adequately prepare students for their future lives, of encouraging certain temperaments while inhibiting others, of prescribing students exactly what to do, how, when, where and with whom, which would suppress creativity, and of using extrinsic measures such as grades and homework, which would inhibit children&#x27;s natural curiosity and desire to learn.

In homeschooling and distance education, teaching and learning take place independent from the institution of school or in a virtual school outside a traditional school building, respectively. Schools are organized in several different organizational models, including departmental, small learning communities, academies, integrated, and schools-within-a-school.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;school&quot; derives from Greek &quot;(&quot;), originally meaning &quot;leisure&quot; and also &quot;that in which leisure is employed&quot;, but later &quot;a group to whom lectures were given, school&quot;.

==History and development==
The concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since Classical antiquity. Formal schools have existed at least since ancient Greece (see Academy), ancient Rome (see Education in Ancient Rome) ancient India (see Gurukul), and ancient China (see History of education in China). The Byzantine Empire had an established schooling system beginning at the primary level. According to &quot;Traditions and Encounters&quot;, the founding of the primary education system began in 425 AD and &quot;... military personnel usually had at least a primary education ...&quot;. The sometimes efficient and often large government of the Empire meant that educated citizens were a must. Although Byzantium lost much of the grandeur of Roman culture and extravagance in the process of surviving, the Empire emphasized efficiency in its war manuals. The Byzantine education system continued until the empire&#x27;s collapse in 1453 AD.

In Western Europe, a considerable number of cathedral schools were founded during the Early Middle Ages in order to teach future clergy and administrators, with the oldest still existing, and continuously operated, cathedral schools being The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury (established 597 CE), King&#x27;s School, Rochester (established 604 CE), St Peter&#x27;s School, York (established 627 CE) and Thetford Grammar School (established 631 CE). Beginning in the 5th century CE, monastic schools were also established throughout Western Europe, teaching religious and secular subjects.

In Europe, universities emerged during the 12th century; here, scholasticism was an important tool, and the academicians were called &quot;schoolmen&quot;. During the Middle Ages and much of the Early Modern period, the main purpose of schools (as opposed to universities) was to teach the Latin language. This led to the term grammar school, which in the United States informally refers to a primary school, but in the United Kingdom means a school that selects entrants based on ability or aptitude. The school curriculum has gradually broadened to include literacy in the vernacular language and technical, artistic, scientific, and practical subjects.

Obligatory school attendance became common in parts of Europe during the 18th century. In Denmark-Norway, this was introduced as early as in 1739–1741, the primary end being to increase the literacy of the &quot;almue&quot;, i.e., the &quot;regular people&quot;. Many of the earlier public schools in the United States and elsewhere were one-room schools where a single teacher taught seven grades of boys and girls in the same classroom. Beginning in the 1920s, one-room schools were consolidated into multiple classroom facilities with transportation increasingly provided by kid hacks and school buses.

Islam was another culture that developed a school system in the modern sense of the word. Emphasis was put on knowledge, which required a systematic way of teaching and spreading knowledge and purpose-built structures. At first, mosques combined religious performance and learning activities. However, by the 9th century, the madrassa was introduced, a school that was built independently from the mosque, such as al-Qarawiyyin, founded in 859 CE. They were also the first to make the &quot;Madrassa&quot; system a public domain under Caliph&#x27;s control.

Under the Ottomans, the towns of Bursa and Edirne became the main centers of learning. The Ottoman system of Külliye, a building complex containing a mosque, a hospital, madrassa, and public kitchen and dining areas, revolutionized the education system, making learning accessible to a broader public through its free meals, health care, and sometimes free accommodation.

==Regional terms==
The term &quot;school&quot; varies by country, as do the names of the various levels of education within the country.

===United Kingdom and Commonwealth of Nations===
In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;school&quot; refers primarily to pre-university institutions, and these can, for the most part, be divided into pre-schools or nursery schools, primary schools (sometimes further divided into infant school and junior school), and secondary schools. Various types of secondary schools in England and Wales include grammar schools, comprehensives, secondary moderns, and city academies. While they may have different names in Scotland, there is only one type of secondary school. However, they may be funded either by the state or independently funded. Scotland&#x27;s school performance is monitored by Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Education. Ofsted reports on performance in England and Estyn reports on performance in Wales.

In the United Kingdom, most schools are publicly funded and known as state schools or maintained schools in which tuition is provided for free. There are also private schools or private schools that charge fees. Some of the most selective and expensive private schools are known as public schools, a usage that can be confusing to speakers of North American English. In North American usage, a public school is publicly funded or run.

In much of the Commonwealth of Nations, including Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Kenya, and Tanzania, the term &quot;school&quot; refers primarily to pre-university institutions.

===India===
In ancient India, schools were in the form of Gurukuls. Gurukuls were traditional Hindu residential learning schools, typically the teacher&#x27;s house or a monastery. Schools today are commonly known by the Sanskrit terms &quot;Vidyashram&quot;, &quot;Vidyalayam&quot;, &quot;Vidya&quot; &quot;Mandir&quot;, &quot;Vidya Bhavan&quot; in India. In southern languages, it is known as &quot;Pallikoodam&quot; or &quot;PaadaSaalai&quot;. During the Mughal rule, Madrasahs were introduced in India to educate the children of Muslim parents. British records show that indigenous education was widespread in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque, or village in most regions. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science, and Religion.

Under British rule, Christian missionaries from England, the United States, and other countries established missionary and boarding schools in India. Later as these schools gained popularity, more were started, and some gained prestige. These schools marked the beginning of modern schooling in India. The syllabus and calendar they followed became the benchmark for schools in modern India. Today most schools follow the missionary school model for tutoring, subject/syllabus, and governance, with minor changes.

Schools in India range from large campuses with thousands of students and hefty fees to schools where children are taught under a tree with a small / no campus and are free of cost. There are various boards of schools in India, namely Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE), Madrasa Boards of various states, Matriculation Boards of various states, State Boards of various boards, Anglo Indian Board, among others. Today&#x27;s typical syllabus includes language(s), mathematics, science – physics, chemistry, biology, geography, history, general knowledge, and information technology/computer science. Extracurricular activities include physical education/sports and cultural activities like music, choreography, painting, and theatre/drama.

===Europe===

In much of continental Europe, the term &quot;school&quot; usually applies to primary education, with primary schools that last between four and nine years, depending on the country. It also applies to secondary education, with secondary schools often divided between &quot;Gymnasiums&quot; and vocational schools, which again, depending on country and type of school, educate students for between three and six years. In Germany, students graduating from Grundschule are not allowed to progress into a vocational school directly. Instead, they are supposed to proceed to one of Germany&#x27;s general education schools such as Gesamtschule, Hauptschule, Realschule or Gymnasium. When they leave that school, which usually happens at age 15–19, they may proceed to a vocational school. The term school is rarely used for tertiary education, except for some &quot;upper&quot; or &quot;high&quot; schools (German: Hochschule), which describe colleges and universities.

In Eastern Europe modern schools (after World War II), of both primary and secondary educations, often are combined. In contrast, secondary education might be split into accomplished or not. The schools are classified as middle schools of general education. For the technical purposes, they include &quot;degrees&quot; of the education they provide out of three available: the first – primary, the second – unaccomplished secondary, and the third – accomplished secondary. Usually, the first two degrees of education (eight years) are always included. In contrast, the last one (two years) permits the students to pursue vocational or specialized educations.

===North America and the United States===
In North America, the term &quot;school&quot; can refer to any educational institution at any level and covers all of the following: preschool (for toddlers), kindergarten, elementary school, middle school (also called intermediate school or junior high school, depending on specific age groups and geographic region), high school (or in some cases senior high school), college, university, and graduate school.

In the United States, school performance through high school is monitored by each state&#x27;s department of education. Charter schools are publicly funded elementary or secondary schools that have been freed from some of the rules, regulations, and statutes that apply to other public schools. The terms grammar school and &quot;grade school&quot; are sometimes used to refer to a primary school due to British colonial legacies. In addition, there are tax-funded magnet schools which offer different programs and instruction not available in traditional schools.

===Africa===
In West Africa, &quot;school&quot; can also refer to &quot;bush&quot; schools, Quranic schools, or apprenticeships. These schools include formal and informal learning.

Bush schools are training camps that pass down cultural skills, traditions, and knowledge to their students. Bush schools are semi-similar to traditional western schools because they are separated from the larger community. These schools are located in forests outside of the towns and villages, and the space used is solely for these schools. Once the students have arrived in the forest, they cannot leave until their training is complete. Visitors are prohibited from these areas.
Instead of being separated by age, Bush schools are separated by gender. Women and girls cannot enter the boys&#x27; bush school territory and vice versa. Boys receive training in cultural crafts, fighting, hunting, and community laws among other subjects. Girls are trained in their own version of the boys&#x27; bush school. They practice domestic affairs such as cooking, childcare, and being a good wife. Their training is focused on how to be a proper woman by societal standards.Qur&#x27;anic schools are the principal way of teaching the Quran and knowledge of the Islamic faith. These schools also fostered literacy and writing during the time of colonization. Today, the emphasis is on the different levels of reading, memorizing, and reciting the Quran. Attending a Qur&#x27;anic school is how children become recognized members of the Islamic faith. Children often attend state schools and a Qur&#x27;anic school.

In Mozambique, specifically, there are two kinds of Qur&#x27;anic schools. They are the tariqa based and the Wahhabi-based schools. What makes these schools different is who controls them. Tariqa schools are controlled at the local level. In contrast, the Wahhabi are controlled by the Islamic Council. Within the Qur&#x27;anic school system, there are levels of education. They range from a basic level of understanding, called chuo and kioni in local languages, to the most advanced, which is called ilimu.

In Nigeria, the term &quot;school&quot; broadly covers daycares, nursery schools, primary schools, secondary schools and tertiary institutions. Primary and secondary schools are either privately funded by religious institutions and corporate organisations or government-funded. Government-funded schools are commonly referred to as public schools. Students spend six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary school, and three years in senior secondary school. The first nine years of formal schooling is compulsory under the Universal Basic Education Program (UBEC). Tertiary institutions include public and private universities, polytechnics, and colleges of education. Universities can be funded by the federal government, state governments, religious institutions, or individuals and organisations.

==Ownership and operation==
Many schools are owned or funded by states. Private schools operate independently from the government. Private schools usually rely on fees from families whose children attend the school for funding; however, sometimes such schools also receive government support (for example, through School vouchers). Many private schools are affiliated with a particular religion; these are known as parochial schools.

==Components of most schools==
Schools are organized spaces purposed for teaching and learning. The classrooms where teachers teach and students learn are of central importance. Classrooms may be specialized for certain subjects, such as laboratory classrooms for science education and workshops for industrial arts education.

Typical schools have many other rooms and areas, which may include:
* Cafeteria (Commons), dining hall or canteen where students eat lunch and often breakfast and snacks.
* Athletic field, playground, gym, or track place where students participating in sports or physical education practice
* Schoolyards, all-purpose playfields typically in elementary schools, often made of concrete.
* Auditorium or hall where student theatrical and musical productions can be staged and where all-school events such as assemblies are held
* Office where the administrative work of the school is done
* Library where students ask librarians reference questions, check out books and magazines, and often use computers
* Computer labs where computer-based work is done and the internet accessed
*Cultural activities where the students uphold their cultural practice through activities like games, dance, and music

=== Architecture ===
=== Education facilities in low-income countries ===
In low-income countries, only 32% of primary, 43% of lower secondary and 52% of upper secondary schools have access to electricity. This affects access to the internet, which is just 37% in upper secondary schools in low-income countries, as compared to 59% in those in middle-income countries and 93% in those in high-income countries.

Access to basic water, sanitation and hygiene is also far from universal. Among upper secondary schools, only 53% in low-income countries and 84% in middle-income countries have access to basic drinking water. Access to water and sanitation is universal in high-income countries.

== Security ==
The safety of staff and students is increasingly becoming an issue for school communities, an issue most schools are addressing through improved security. Some have also taken measures such as installing metal detectors or video surveillance. Others have even taken measures such as having the children swipe identification cards as they board the school bus. These plans have included door numbering to aid public safety response for some schools.

Other security concerns faced by schools include bomb threats, gangs, and vandalism. In recognition of these threats, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 4 advocates for upgrading education facilities to provide a safe, non-violent learning environment.

==Health services==
School health services are services from medical, teaching and other professionals applied in or out of school to improve the health and well-being of children and, in some cases, whole families. These services have been developed in different ways around the globe. However, the fundamentals are constant: the early detection, correction, prevention, or amelioration of disease, disability, and abuse from which school-aged children can suffer.

==Online schools and classes==

Some schools offer remote access to their classes over the internet. Online schools also can provide support to traditional schools, as in the case of the School Net Namibia. Some online classes also provide experience in a class. When people take them, they have already been introduced to the subject and know what to expect. Classes provide high school/college credit, allowing students to take the classes at their own pace. Many online classes cost money to take, but some are offered free.

Internet-based distance learning programs are offered widely through many universities. Instructors teach through online activities and assignments. Online classes are taught the same as in-person, with the same curriculum. The instructor offers the syllabus with their fixed requirements like any other class. Students can virtually turn their assignments in to their instructors according to deadlines. This being through via email or on the course webpage. This allows students to work at their own pace yet meet the correct deadlines. Students taking an online class have more flexibility in their schedules to take their classes at a time that works best.

Conflicts with taking an online class may include not being face to face with the instructor when learning or being in an environment with other students. Online classes can also make understanding the content challenging, especially when unable to get in quick contact with the instructor. Online students have the advantage of using other online sources with assignments or exams for that specific class. Online classes also have the advantage of students not needing to leave their house for a morning class or worrying about their attendance for that class. Students can work at their own pace to learn and achieve within that curriculum.

The convenience of learning at home has been an attraction point for enrolling online. Students can attend class anywhere a computer can go – at home, in a library, or while traveling internationally. Online school classes are designed to fit a student&#x27;s needs while allowing students to continue working and tending to their other obligations. Online school education is divided into three subcategories: Online Elementary School, Online Middle School, Online High school.

==Stress==

As a profession, teaching has levels of work-related stress (WRS) that are among the highest of any profession in some countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States. The degree of this problem is becoming increasingly recognized and support systems are being put into place.

Stress sometimes affects students more severely than teachers, up to the point where the students are prescribed stress medication. This stress is claimed to be related to standardized testing, and the pressure on students to score above average.

According to a 2008 mental health study by the Associated Press and mtvU, eight in 10 U.S. college students said they had sometimes or frequently experienced stress in their daily lives. This was an increase of 20% from a survey five years previously. Thirty-four percent had felt depressed at some point in the past three months, 13 percent had been diagnosed with a mental health condition such as an anxiety disorder or depression, and 9 percent had seriously considered suicide.

==Discipline towards students==

Schools and their teachers have always been under pressure – for instance, pressure to cover the curriculum, perform well compared to other schools, and avoid the stigma of being &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;spoiling&quot; toward students. Forms of discipline, such as control over when students may speak, and normalized behaviour, such as raising a hand to speak, are imposed in the name of greater efficiency. Practitioners of critical pedagogy maintain that such disciplinary measures have no positive effect on student learning. Indeed, some argue that disciplinary practices detract from learning, saying that they undermine students&#x27; dignity and sense of self-worth – the latter occupying a more primary role in students&#x27; hierarchy of needs.

<text>The Sontarans ( ) are a fictional race of extraterrestrial humanoids principally portrayed in the British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-off series &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. A warrior race characterised by their ruthlessness and fearlessness of death, they were conceived by writer and future story editor Robert Holmes and first appeared in the 1973 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;.

==Characteristics==
===Culture===
The Sontarans are a race of humanoids with a stocky build, a distinctive dome-shaped head, and they have only three fingers on each hand, though some members of their species do have five fingers. Their musculature is designed for load-bearing rather than leverage, because of the high gravity on their home planet. Ross Jenkins in &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; describes the main Sontaran villain, General Staal, as resembling &quot;a talking baked potato&quot;, whilst in sequel episode &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, Colonel Alan Mace likens the Sontarans to &quot;trolls&quot;. Sontarans come from a large, dense planet named Sontar in the &quot;southern spiral arm of the galaxy&quot; which has a very strong gravitational field, which explains their compact stocky form. They are far stronger than humans and, in the recent series, are shorter than the average human male.

The Sontarans have an extremely militaristic culture which prizes discipline and honour as its highest virtues; every aspect of their draconian society is geared toward warfare, and every experience is viewed in terms of its martial relevance. In &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;, the Fourth Doctor comments that &quot;Sontarans never do anything without a military reason.&quot; In fact, to die heroically in battle is their ultimate goal. Aside from a ritualistic chant (&quot;Son-tar-ha!&quot;) in &quot;The Sontaran Strategem&quot;/&quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, they are never seen to engage in any activity that would be considered recreation, though a few offhand comments by Commander Skorr in &quot;The Poison Sky&quot; suggest they do consider hunting a sport. According to their creator Robert Holmes, Sontarans do have a highly developed artistic culture, but have put it on hold for the duration of the war, while the opening chapter of the novelisation of &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, based on Holmes&#x27; incomplete draft, refers to Linx listening to the Sontaran anthem while his spaceship is in flight.

The Sontarans depicted in the series have detached, smug personalities, and a highly developed sense of honour; on multiple occasions, the Doctor has used his knowledge of their pride in their species to manipulate them. In &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;, the Doctor nevertheless referred to them as &quot;the finest soldiers in the galaxy&quot;.

Although physically formidable, the Sontarans&#x27; weak spot is the &quot;probic vent&quot; at the back of their neck, through which they draw nutrition. It is also part of their cloning process. In Earthlike atmospheres, the Sontaran armour suit requires a change of gases every 27 hours, also conducted through the probic vent. The vent also provides an incentive to continue moving forward in battle since retreat would expose this area to their enemies. They have been killed by targeting that location with a knife (&quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;), a screwdriver (&quot;&quot;), and an arrow (&quot;The Time Warrior&quot;). Even something as simple as a squash ball aimed at that point (&quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;), contact by the heel of a shoe (&quot;The Last Sontaran&quot;), or a blow from a hammer or a wok (&quot;War of the Sontarans&quot;) is capable of incapacitating them temporarily. They are also vulnerable to &quot;coronic acid&quot; (&quot;The Two Doctors&quot;). While the Sontarans wear protective helmets in battle, to fight without their helmets, or to be &quot;open-skinned,&quot; is an honour for the Sontarans.

In the episode &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, it is revealed that the Sontaran Empire have been at war with the Rutan Host for more than 50,000 years, and which, at a time around 2008, they are losing. The war is still raging at least 20,000 years later, in the serial &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;. It was joked that the two species have been at war for so long, they had almost forgotten the reason why. (&quot;The Two Doctors&quot;)

Most of the Sontarans depicted in the television series have had short names, many beginning with an initial &#x27;st&#x27; sound. Examples include Styre (&quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;), Stor (&quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;), Stike (&quot;The Two Doctors&quot;), Staal (&quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; / &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;), Stark (&quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot;), Strax and Stenck (&quot;The Vanquishers&quot;); others are Skorr (&quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; / &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;), Ritskaw and Kragar (&quot;The Halloween Apocalypse&quot;), Skaak (&quot;War of the Sontarans&quot;), Linx (&quot;The Time Warrior&quot;), Varl (&quot;The Two Doctors&quot;), Jask (&quot;The End of Time&quot;) and Kaagh (&quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;). Elements of the Sontaran military structure mentioned in the series include the &quot;Sontaran G3 Military Assessment Survey&quot; and the &quot;Grand Strategic Council&quot;, the Ninth Sontaran Battle Group, the &quot;Fifth Army Space Fleet of the Sontaran Army Space Corps&quot;, and the &quot;Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet&quot;. Military titles include Commander, Group Marshal, Field Major, and General. Agnomens include &quot;the Undefeated&quot;, &quot;the Bloodbringer&quot;, &quot;the Avenger&quot;, and &quot;the Slayer&quot;.

===Reproduction and gender identity===
The Sontarans are a monogender-asexual (a &quot;male gender-only&quot; species); they reproduce by means of cloning rather than sexual reproduction, and thus for the most part are extremely similar in appearance. Human characters in both &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; and &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; comment on how closely individual Sontarans resemble one another; however, their height, skin tone, facial features, vocal timbre and accent, hair, spacing of teeth and even number of fingers have varied from story to story, and sometimes within stories. When Luke Rattigan asks how they can tell each other apart in &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;, General Staal remarks that they say the same of humans.

In &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, Linx states that &quot;at the Sontaran Military Academy we have hatchings of a million cadets at each muster parade.&quot; The Doctor also comments in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; that Sontarans can mass-clone themselves at rates up to a million embryos every four minutes. Thereafter the clones take just ten minutes to grow to adulthood. When the Sontaran reach adulthood, under the charge of the Sontaran High Command, each warrior is immediately given a rank and dispatched on a battle mission. From day one, the Sontarans are sent to battle. The audio &quot;The King of Sontar&quot; introduces a unique occasion where one Sontaran is the only result of a clone batch, the resulting Sontaran being essentially a million Sontarans in one, making him far taller than the average for his species and lacking a probic vent.

Sontarans reproduce asexually and all the Sontarans depicted in the television series are of one gender; referred to with masculine pronouns, however it is not known if they possess distinctly male physiologies. General Staal comments that &quot;words are the weapons of womenfolk&quot; and that the clone of Martha Jones performed well &quot;for a female&quot; as commentary on the gender inequalities of other species. This typifies a Sontaran trait: interested only in the strongest fighters in any group or race. Despite this, Strax appeared perfectly comfortable with the prospect of wearing dresses in &quot;The Battle of Demon&#x27;s Run - Two Days Later&quot;; he ultimately dressed in human gentleman&#x27;s attire, nevertheless. In &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, when Linx examines Sarah Jane, he comments on how the human reproduction system is &#x27;inefficient&#x27; and that humans &#x27;should change it&#x27;. As multiple genders are foreign to them, Sontarans are known to confuse the human male and female sexes; Strax routinely addresses young women as &quot;Boy&quot; and vice versa, and claims not to have known that River Song was a woman.

In &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot;, the Sontarans are seen to create human clones by growing them in tubs of green fluid. &quot;Enemy of the Bane&quot; confirms that Sontarans are cloned in the same way. In a human clone, the umbilical corresponds to the probic vent on the back of a Sontaran&#x27;s neck, suggesting that the vent is not unlike the human navel, albeit clearly more complex.

===Technology===
The Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet in the new series consists of a Command Ship and a number of capsules that can be moved into position when Battle Status is enjoined. Sontaran ships are impervious to nuclear missiles, however in War of the Sontarans they are vulnerable to both ramming by another Sontaran ship and also to explosions of barrels of gunpowder. In both the classic and new series, Sontarans are depicted using spherical or semi-spherical single-occupant spacecraft known as capsules. Each capsule is small enough to avoid detection by radar and is piloted by an individual Sontaran. &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; also saw the introduction of a large mothership from which the small Sontaran capsules could be seen to originate. The Doctor notes that the one ship by itself is enough to completely wipe out Earth.

The Sontarans have a variety of weapons. Their distinctive weapon is a small rod with two handles and a plunger at one end, giving it a syringe style. This is so it can be held and fired using three fingers. This weapon fires a disabling beam that can temporarily render a person useless and emits an energy pulse that can repair systems like the teleport, and has appeared in every Sontaran story except &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;. When first used by Commander Linx in &quot;The Time Warrior&quot;, it shows the ability to fire a beam which can disarm by knocking the weapon out of the wielder&#x27;s hand, hypnotise, as well as cutting through wood, disabling limbs and killing.

In &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;, Field Major Styre instead used a small red laser pistol which only killed (although it did not kill the Doctor, because of a small metal plate the Doctor had been keeping in his inside pocket). &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot; saw Commander Stor using the small rod again, but also in episode six, a Sontaran trooper uses a short black rifle-like laser to try to burn through a lock on a door inside the TARDIS. &quot;The Two Doctors&quot; introduced a weapon called the Meson Gun (as named in the &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; sketch, &quot;A Fix with Sontarans&quot;), a large silver rifle with a red fuel tank in the centre which was used by Group Marshal Stike and Varl in the third episode. It seemed to be some kind of flamethrower as it fired a jet of flames very briefly. Group Marshal Stike was also seen carrying a baton.

It would not be until &quot;The Sontaran Stratagem&quot; that General Staal would show that the baton can fire an orange beam that could stun the target. In &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, Commander Skorr and his troops carry large laser rifles into battle. These rifles are the Sontaran gun of the Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet. Each rifle has a laser beam that kills instantly and is designed for a three-fingered grip. In &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;, their armour is shown to be resistant to Time Lord stasers and K-9&#x27;s blaster. However, their armour is vulnerable to standard human firearms in &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, but the Sontarans in that episode used a &#x27;cordolane signal&#x27; which caused the copper-lined bullets to expand, jamming most firearms instantly. UNIT troops overcame this by switching to steel-lined bullets.

&quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;The Last Sontaran&quot; showed further technological advancements of the modern Sontarans. Commander Kaagh, a surviving pilot from the Tenth Sontaran Battle Fleet, had slightly different armour due to being from the special forces. His suit featured no gloves, so his bare hands were visible, and on his left arm was a control panel for his suit and ship. His helmet could fold up and retract and both his suit and ship featured cloaking devices, turning them both invisible. While the soldiers of the Tenth Fleet were armed with large laser rifles, Kaagh has a smaller laser carbine. Rather than hypnotising humans (as Sarah pointed out they usually do), instead, Kaagh fixed neural control devices to the back of the necks of his human agents. A red light flashes when it is operational, and Kaagh can activate and deactivate them when he wants with his control panel.

A pair of Sontarans that tried to invade Trenzalore in &quot;Time of the Doctor&quot; used a two-man craft with an invisibility field.

==Appearances==
===Television===
During rehearsals for their first appearance, Kevin Lindsay, who portrayed the original Sontaran, Linx, pronounced the race&#x27;s name as &quot;&quot;son-TAR-an&quot;.&quot; Alan Bromly, the director, tried to correct him by saying it should be pronounced with the stress on the first syllable. Lindsay declared &quot;Well, I think it&#x27;s &quot;son-TAR-an&quot;, and since I&#x27;m from the place, I should know.&quot; His preferred pronunciation was retained.

The Sontarans made their first appearance in 1973 in the serial &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; by Robert Holmes, where Linx is stranded in the Middle Ages. Linx uses a projector to bring back human scientists from the future to fix his spacecraft.

Another Sontaran named Styre appears in &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; (1975), experimenting on captured astronauts on a far future Earth. Their third appearance is in &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;, where they successfully invade Gallifrey, but are driven out again after less than a day. They appeared for the final time in the original series in &quot;The Two Doctors&quot;. The Sontarans also appeared in a skit for the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; titled &quot;A Fix with Sontarans&quot;, along with Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor and Janet Fielding as Tegan Jovanka. References are made in Sontaran episodes to the Rutan Host, an equally militaristic race with whom the Sontarans have been at war for thousands of years; a Rutan is seen in &quot;Horror of Fang Rock&quot; (1977), which does not feature the Sontarans, but have not featured in the television series again.

Sporting an updated design, Sontarans returned to the revived series in the Series 4 episodes &quot;The Sontaran Strategem&quot; and &quot;The Poison Sky&quot; (2008). The Sontarans plan to terraform the Earth into a new clone world, but their plans are averted by the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant). It is also revealed that the race was excluded from the Last Great Time War of the revived series&#x27; backstory. In &quot;Turn Left&quot; (2008), the same events are depicted in a parallel universe, where Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) describes their plan as foiled by Torchwood (characters from the spin-off show of that name), at the cost of their lives, with Torchwood leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) being captured by the Sontarans. In &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; (2008), UNIT is revealed to have developed a teleportation device based on Sontaran technology. A lone survivor from the events of &quot;The Poison Sky&quot;, Commander Kaagh (Anthony O&#x27;Donnell), next appears in &quot;The Last Sontaran&quot; (2008), from spin-off series &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. Kaagh appears again in &quot;Enemy of the Bane&quot; (2008). In &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s &quot;The End of Time, Part Two&quot; (2010), a Sontaran sniper (Dan Starkey) briefly appears pursuing the Doctor&#x27;s former companions Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and his wife Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), but is defeated by the Doctor before he can assassinate them. Alongside the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), Sontaran battle fleets are seen in Series 5 finale episode, &quot;The Pandorica Opens&quot; (2010), as part of an alliance of the Doctor&#x27;s enemies. Series 6 episode &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; (2011) introduces Commander Strax (Starkey), a Sontaran nurse who has been assigned this role as a means of making penance. He fights on the side of the Doctor and his allies, which include the Silurian warrior Madame Vastra (Neve McIntosh) and her wife, Jenny Flint (Catrin Stewart). Strax then appears alongside Vastra and Jenny in &quot;The Snowmen&quot; (2012), &quot;The Crimson Horror&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Doctor&quot; (both 2013), and &quot;Deep Breath&quot; (2014). A troop of Sontarans is also shown among Trenzalore&#x27;s invaders in the 2013 Christmas special &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;. A Sontaran appears briefly in the 2015 episode &quot;Face the Raven&quot; as a refugee.

The appearance of the Sontarans was redesigned for the Thirteenth Doctor&#x27;s final season, &#x27;Flux&#x27;, where they reappeared in their first major antagonistic role since 2008. First appearing in the season premiere, &#x27;Chapter 1: The Halloween Apocalypse&#x27;, the Sontarans plan to exploit the Flux crisis to take over Earth in its various time periods. They sent a group back in time to Crimean War-era Sevastopol in &#x27;Chapter 2: The War of the Sontarans&#x27; as a trial run, only to be defeated by the Doctor while Dan and Karvanista take out the main fleet. The Sontarans reappear in the cliffhanger for &#x27;Chapter Five: Survivors of the Flux&#x27;, where they invade and take over earth during the flux crisis thanks to the intervention of their ally the Grand Serpent. In &#x27;Chapter Six: The Vanquishers&#x27;, the Doctor and her allies learn the Sontarans plan to trick the Cybermen and Daleks into being consumed by the flux while staying safe themselves by hijacking the Lupari ships, however the Doctor hijacks the ships herself and uses the flux event to destroy the Sontaran army as well.

===Games===

The origins of the Sontarans have not been revealed in the television series. The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; role-playing game published by FASA claimed that they were all descended from the genetic stock of General Sontar (or Sontaris), who used newly developed bioengineering techniques to clone millions of duplicates of himself and annihilated the non-clone population. He renamed the race after himself and turned the Sontarans into an expansionist and warlike society set on universal conquest. However, this origin has no basis in anything seen in the television series.

The Sontarans have also appeared as a character in the PC game &quot;Destiny of the Doctors&quot; released on 5 December 1997, by BBC Multimedia. They can be defeated by firing the occupants of an angry beehive at them.

The Sontarans appear in the &quot;Doctor Who: The Adventure Games&quot; episode, &quot;The Gunpowder Plot&quot;.

===Other appearances===
Big Finish Productions first used the Sontarans for their audio drama &quot;Heroes of Sontar&quot;, a 2011 Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) story, depicting the Doctor and his companions being forced to aid a Sontaran attack squad against a dangerous enemy that has threatened the Sontaran race by compromising their strategic methods. They next featured in The Five Companions and were stuck in an alternative version of the Death Zone with the Fifth Doctor and various companions. In 2012, &quot;The First Sontarans&quot; was released. A Sixth Doctor Lost Story from the mid-1980s, written by Andrew Smith, it features the Sontarans and the Rutans on nineteenth century Earth, tracking down a scientist named Jacob, who escaped through time and space. It is revealed that Jacob is from Sontar, and was responsible for genetically creating the Sontarans as a defence against a Rutan invasion. They were first developed on Sontar&#x27;s gravity-heavy moon and quickly proved themselves to be at least on par with the unstoppable Rutan horde. However, believing themselves to be superior, the Sontarans turned on their creators to prevent their knowledge of Sontaran weaknesses being discovered and exploited by their enemies, conquering the planet Sontar and changing it to suit their biology. The audio ends with the Doctor and Peri helping Jacob and his wife fake their deaths so that they can go into hiding on a primitive, isolated planet to get away from their need for revenge on the Sontarans. The Sontarans also feature in the Early Adventures audio &quot;The Sontarans&quot;, which depicts the First Doctor (William Hartnell), Steven Taylor and Sara Kingdom encountering the Sontarans during an invasion of an asteroid colony at some point before Sara&#x27;s time, prompting Sara to observe that she is aware of how this confrontation will end from her own histories; this audio serves as the Doctor&#x27;s chronologically earliest encounter with the Sontarans. The audio &quot;Terror of the Sontarans&quot; saw the Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) and Mel Bush (Bonnie Langford) meet the Sontarans on an old mining colony that had been used as a Sontaran outpost, until a complex chain of events unintentionally created a new life form that was psychically tortured by the pain of the Sontarans&#x27; victims, forcing the Doctor to destroy the colony in the hope that the non-corporeal entity will reform into something more benevolent. They also appear in the 2014 story &quot;The Sontaran Ordeal&quot; as part of the Classic Doctors New Monsters range. In this story, the Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) comes against a group of Sontarans led by General Stenk (Christopher Ryan) who try to get into the greatest of all wars: the Time War.

Other appearances by the Sontarans include the spin-off videos &quot;Mindgame&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Do You Have A License To Save This Planet?&quot;; three audio plays by BBV: &quot;Silent Warrior&quot;, &quot;Old Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot;; the Faction Paradox audio &quot;The Shadow Play&quot;; and a cameo appearance in &quot;Infidel&#x27;s Comet&quot;. &quot;Shakedown&quot; marks the only occasion in which the Sontarans and their Rutan foes appear on screen together, and was adapted into a Virgin New Adventures novel where the Seventh Doctor must prevent the Sontarans gained a clear advantage in the conflict.

They have also appeared in several spin-off novels, including &quot;Lords of the Storm&quot; by David A. McIntee, where the Fifth Doctor and Turlough have to stop a Sontaran scheme to take control of a colony world where Tzun technology has been hidden. In &quot;The Infinity Doctors&quot; by Lance Parkin, an apparently alternate version of the Doctor negotiated a peace between the Sontarans and the Rutan Host when two of them were left trapped in a TARDIS for several hours and got to talking due to their inability to kill each other. General Sontar also made an appearance in that novel. In &quot;The Crystal Bucephalus&quot; by Craig Hinton, the name of their planet was given as Sontara. The Sontarans also briefly appear in &quot;The Eight Doctors&quot;, sent to the Eye of Orion by an agent of the Celestial Intervention Agency to kill the Fifth and Eighth Doctors. The novel &quot;Warmonger&quot; sees the Sontarans join an alliance of alien races assembled by the Fifth Doctor to defeat the mercenary army of renegade Time Lord Morbius, although the Sontarans are unaware that they follow the Doctor as he adopts the alias of &#x27;Supreme Coordinator&#x27;, which is shortened to &#x27;Supremo&#x27; by his Ogron bodyguards.

In 1982, Jean Airey&#x27;s novella &quot;The Doctor and the Enterprise&quot; featured a crossover between the universes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in which the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) finds himself on the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; is attacked by a Sontaran fleet (which is unrecognizable to Captain Kirk and crew), prompting the Doctor to urgently warn the crew to flee the area.

They appear in 2009, in the novella &quot;The Sontaran Games&quot; by Jacqueline Rayner, featuring the Tenth Doctor and appeared in the New Series Adventures (Doctor Who) book &quot;The Taking of Chelsea 426&quot; by David Llewellyn, featuring the Tenth Doctor, fighting both times against the Rutan Host.

In 2008, as part of Character options first series 4 2008 wave of action figures, they released some Sontaran action figures. These include General Staal, Commander Skorr and several Sontaran soldiers.

The Sontarans are mentioned in the audio book Wraith World, when Clyde Langer (Daniel Anthony) remarks he cannot understand why Luke Smith (Tommy Knight) and Rani Chandra (Anjli Mohindra) would want to read about made up adventures, when they have faced Sontarans.

===Comic books===
The Sontarans have also appeared several times in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip, both as adversaries of the Doctor and in strips not involving the Doctor. In &quot;The Outsider&quot; (DWM #25-26), by Steve Moore and David Lloyd, a Sontaran named Skrant invaded the world of Brahtilis with the unwitting help of Demimon, a local astrologer. The Fourth Doctor faced the Sontarans in &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Claw&quot; (DWM #39-#45), by Steve Moore and Dave Gibbons, where a crew of Sontarans menaced China in 1522 AD.

In Steven Moffat&#x27;s short story &quot;What I Did on My Christmas Holidays by Sally Sparrow&quot; (the basis for the Tenth Doctor episode &quot;Blink&quot;), the Ninth Doctor has a rooftop sword fight with two Sontarans in 21st century Istanbul, defeating them with the help of spy Sally Sparrow, apparently before the events of &quot;Rose&quot; in his personal timeline.

The Sontaran homeworld was destroyed in the future during the events of the Seventh Doctor strip &quot;Pureblood&quot; (DWM #193-196) but the Sontaran race pool survived, allowing for further cloning; the strip introduced the concept of &quot;pureblood&quot; Sontarans not born of cloning. The Sontarans also feature in the Kroton solo strip &quot;Unnatural Born Killers&quot; (DWM #277) and the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s comic strip debut &quot;The Betrothal of Sontar&quot; (DWM #365-#368), by John Tomlinson and Nick Abadzis, where a Sontaran mining rig on the ice planet Serac comes under attack by a mysterious force.

<text>Skateboarding is an action sport that involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation. Originating in the United States, skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding would be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male and female teams. Skateboarding made its Olympic debut in 2020 and was included in the 2024 games.

Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and more recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, although legal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and parks.

==History==
===1940s–1960s===
The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today.

Skateboarding, as it exists today, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called &quot;sidewalk surfing&quot; – a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted &quot;sidewalk surfing&quot; and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.

By the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack&#x27;s, Kips&#x27;, Hobie, Bing&#x27;s and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha&#x27;s founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and it was held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.

As the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, &quot;The Quarterly Skateboarder&quot; was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:

The magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as &quot;Skateboarder&quot; in 1975. The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.

Animated cartoons of the time occasionally featured skateboard gags. Two Road Runner cartoons made in 1965, &quot;Shot and Bothered&quot; and &quot;Out and Out Rout&quot;, feature Wile E. Coyote riding a skateboard.

One of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs—&quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;—which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time. Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, and Jim Fitzpatrick.

The growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $4 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965. By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly and &quot;Skateboarder Magazine&quot; had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, Frank Nasworthy started to develop a skateboard wheel made of polyurethane, calling his company Cadillac Wheels. Prior to this new material, skateboards wheels were metal or &quot;clay&quot; wheels. The improvement in traction and performance was so immense that from the wheel&#x27;s release in 1972 the popularity of skateboarding started to rise rapidly again, causing companies to invest more in product development. Nasworthy commissioned artist Jim Evans to do a series of paintings promoting Cadillac Wheels, they were featured as ads and posters in the resurrected &quot;Skateboarder Magazine&quot;, and proved immensely popular in promoting the new style of skateboarding.

In the early 1970s, the precursors to the modern skateparks for skateboarding would be the repurposing of urban hydro and storm water infrastructure such as the Escondido reservoir in San Diego, California. &quot;Skateboarding&quot; magazine would publish the location and skateboarders made up nicknames for each location such as the Tea Bowl, the Fruit Bowl, Bellagio, the Rabbit Hole, Bird Bath, the Egg Bowl, Upland Pool and the Sewer Slide. Some of the development concepts in the terrain of skateparks were actually taken from the Escondido reservoir. Many companies started to manufacture trucks (axles) specially designed for skateboarding, reached in 1976 by Tracker Trucks. As the equipment became more maneuverable, the decks started to get wider, reaching widths of and over, thus giving the skateboarder even more control. A banana board is a skinny, flexible skateboard made of polypropylene with ribs on the underside for structural support. These were very popular during the mid-1970s and were available in a myriad of colors, bright yellow probably being the most memorable, hence the name.

In 1975, skateboarding had risen back in popularity enough to have one of the largest skateboarding competitions since the 1960s, the Del Mar National Championships, which is said to have had up to 500 competitors. The competition lasted two days and was sponsored by Bahne Skateboards and Cadillac Wheels. While the main event was won by freestyle spinning skate legend Russ Howell, a local skate team from Santa Monica, California, the Zephyr team, ushered in a new era of surfer style skateboarding during the competition that would have a lasting impact on skateboarding&#x27;s history. With a team of 12, including skating legends such as Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Peggy Oki and Stacy Peralta, they brought a new progressive style of skateboarding to the event, based on the style of Hawaiian surfers Larry Bertlemann, Buttons Kaluhiokalani and Mark Liddell. Craig Stecyk, a photo journalist for &quot;Skateboarder Magazine&quot;, wrote about and photographed the team, along with Glen E. Friedman, and shortly afterwards ran a series on the team called the Dogtown articles, which eventually immortalized the Zephyr skateboard team. The team became known as the Z-Boys and would go on to become one of the most influential teams in skateboarding&#x27;s history.

Soon, skateboarding contests for cash and prizes, using a professional tier system, began to be held throughout California, such as the California Free Former World Professional Skateboard Championships, which featured freestyle and slalom competitions.

A precursor to the extreme sport of street luge, that was sanctioned by the United States Skateboarding Association (USSA), also took place during the 1970s in Signal Hill, California. The competition was called &quot;The Signal Hill Skateboarding Speed Run&quot;, with several competitors earning entries into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, at the time clocking speeds of over on a skateboard. Due to technology and safety concerns at the time, when many competitors crashed during their runs, the sport did not gain popularity or support during this time.

In March 1976, Skateboard City skatepark in Port Orange, Florida and Carlsbad Skatepark in San Diego County, California would be the first two large size US skateparks to be opened to the public, just a week apart. They were the first of some 200 skateparks that would be built through 1982. This was due in part to articles that were running in the investment journals at the time, stating that skateparks were a good investment. Notable skateboarders from the 1970s also include Ty Page, Tom Inouye, Laura Thornhill, Ellen O&#x27;Neal, Kim Cespedes, Bob Biniak, Jana Payne, Waldo Autry, Robin Logan, Bobby Piercy, Russ Howell, Ellen Berryman, Shogo Kubo, Desiree Von Essen, Henry Hester, Robin Alaway, Paul Hackett, Michelle Matta, Bruce Logan, Steve Cathey, Edie Robertson, Mike Weed, David Hackett, Gregg Ayres, Darren Ho, and Tom Sims.

Manufacturers started to experiment with more exotic composites and metals, like fiberglass and aluminum, but the common skateboards were made of maple plywood. The skateboarders took advantage of the improved handling of their skateboards and started inventing new tricks. Skateboarders, most notably Ty Page, Bruce Logan, Bobby Piercy, Kevin Reed, and the Z-Boys started to skate the vertical walls of swimming pools that were left empty in the 1976 California drought. This started the &quot;vert&quot; trend in skateboarding. With increased control, vert skaters could skate faster and perform more dangerous tricks, such as slash grinds and frontside/backside airs. This caused liability concerns and increased insurance costs to skatepark owners, and the development (first by Norcon, then more successfully by Rector) of improved knee pads that had a hard sliding cap and strong strapping proved to be too-little-too-late. During this era, the &quot;freestyle&quot; movement in skateboarding began to splinter off and develop into a much more specialized discipline, characterized by the development of a wide assortment of flat-ground tricks.

As a result of the &quot;vert&quot; skating movement, skate parks had to contend with high liability costs that led to many park closures. In response, vert skaters started making their own ramps, while freestyle skaters continued to evolve their flatland style. Thus, by the beginning of the 1980s, skateboarding had once again declined in popularity.

===1980s===

This period was fueled by skateboard companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in Florida in 1976, and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California, made it possible for skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period did not ride vert ramps. As most people could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.

Freestyle skating remained healthy throughout this period, with pioneers such as Rodney Mullen inventing many of the basic tricks that would become the foundation of modern street skating, such as the &quot;Impossible&quot; and the &quot;kickflip&quot;. The influence that freestyle exerted upon street skating became apparent during the mid-1980s; however, street skating was still performed on wide vert boards with short noses, slide rails, and large soft wheels. In response to the tensions created by this confluence of skateboarding &quot;genres&quot;, a rapid evolution occurred in the late 1980s to accommodate the street skater. Since few skateparks were available to skaters at this time, street skating pushed skaters to seek out shopping centers and public and private property as their &quot;spot&quot; to skate. (Public opposition, in which businesses, governments, and property owners have banned skateboarding on properties under their jurisdiction or ownership, would progressively intensify over the following decades.) By 1992, only a small fraction of skateboarders continuing to take part in a highly technical version of street skating, combined with the decline of vert skating, produced a sport that lacked the mainstream appeal to attract new skaters.

During this period, numerous skateboarders—as well as companies in the industry—paid tribute to the scenes of Marty McFly skateboarding in the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; for its influence in this regard. Examples can be seen in promotional material, in interviews in which professional skateboarders cite the film as an initiation into the action sport, and in the public&#x27;s recognition of the film&#x27;s influence. Tony Hawk has stated that “there are plenty of legendary pros that I know of that started skating because they saw that [film].” 

===1990s===
Skateboarding during the 1990s became dominated by street skateboarding. Most boards are about wide and long. The wheels are made of an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. The wheel sizes are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels&#x27; inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed dramatically since the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard is derived from the freestyle boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This form had become standard by the mid-1990s.

===2000s===
By 2001, skateboarding had gained so much popularity that more American people under the age of 18 rode skateboards (10.6 million) than played baseball (8.2 million), although traditional organized team sports still dominated youth programs overall. Skateboarding and skateparks began to be viewed and used in a variety of new ways to complement academic lessons in schools, including new non-traditional physical education skateboarding programs, like Skatepass and Skateistan, to encourage youth to have better attendance, self-discipline and confidence. This was also based on the healthy physical opportunities skateboarding was understood to bring participants for muscle &amp; bone strengthening and balance, as well as the positive impacts it can have on youth in teaching them mutual respect, social networking, artistic expression and an appreciation of the environment.

In 2003, Go Skateboarding Day was founded in southern California by the International Association of Skateboard Companies (IASC) to promote skateboarding throughout the world. It is celebrated annually on June 21 &quot;to define skateboarding as the rebellious, creative celebration of independence it continues to be.&quot;
According to market research firm American Sports Data the number of skateboarders worldwide increased by more than 60 percent between 1999 and 2002—from 7.8 million to 12.5 million.

Many cities also began implementing recreation plans and statutes during this time period, as part of their vision for local parks and communities to make public lands more available, in particular, for skateboarding, inviting skateboarders to come in off of the city streets and into organized skateboarding activity areas. By 2006, there were over 2,400 skateparks worldwide and the design of skateparks themselves had made a transition, as skaters turned designers. Many new places to skateboard designed specifically for street skaters, such as the Buszy in Milton Keynes, UK, and the Safe Spot Skate Spot program, first initiated by professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek throughout many cities, allowed for the creation of smaller alternative safe skate plazas to be built at a lower cost. One of the largest locations ever built to skateboard in the world, SMP Skatepark in China, at 12,000 square meters in size, was built complete with a 5,000-seat stadium.

In 2009, Skatelab opened the Skateboarding Hall of Fame &amp; Skateboard Museum. Nominees are chosen by the IASC.

===2010spresent===
Efforts have been taken to improve recognition of the cultural heritage as well as the positive effects of encouraging skateboarding within designated spaces. In 2015, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., hosted an event at which skateboarders accompanied by music did tricks on a ramp constructed for a festival of American culture. The event was the climax of a ten-day project that transformed a federal institution formerly off-limits to the skateboarding community into a platform for that community to show its relevance through shared cultural action in a cultural common space.

By raising £790,000, the Long Live Southbank initiative managed in 2017 to curb the destruction of a forty year old spot in London, the Southbank Undercroft, a popular skate park, due to urban planning, a salvaging operation whose effect extends beyond skateboarding. The presence of a designated skating area within this public space keeps the space under nearly constant watch and drives homeless people away, increasing the feeling of safety in and near the space. The activity attracts artists such as photographers and film makers, as well as a significant number of tourists, which in turn drives economic activity in the neighborhood.

Recently, barefoot skating has been experiencing a revival. Many skaters ride barefoot, particularly in summer and in warmer countries, such as South Africa, Australia, Spain and South America. The plastic penny board is intended to be ridden barefoot, as is the surfboard-inspired hamboard.

Electric skateboards became popular during the 2010s, as did self-balancing unicycles in a board format. The sport of skateboarding made its Olympics debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events. Competitions took place during July and August 2021 in two disciplines: street and park (see Skateboarding at the 2020 Summer Olympics).
==Trick skating==

With the evolution of skateparks and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional freestyle maneuveres like riding on only two wheels (&quot;wheelie&quot; or &quot;manual&quot;), spinning only on the back wheels (a &quot;pivot&quot;), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, also known as a &quot;hippie jump&quot;, long jumping from one board to another, (often over small barrels or fearless teenagers), or slalom. Another popular trick was the Bertlemann slide, named after Larry Bertelemann&#x27;s surfing maneuveres.

In 1976, skateboarding was transformed by the invention of the ollie by Alan &quot;Ollie&quot; Gelfand. It remained largely a unique Florida trick until the summer of 1978, when Gelfand made his first visit to California. Gelfand and his revolutionary maneuvers caught the attention of the West Coast skaters and the media where it began to spread worldwide. The ollie was adapted to flat ground by Rodney Mullen in 1982. Mullen also invented the &quot;Magic Flip&quot;, which was later renamed the kickflip, as well as many other tricks including the 360 Kickflip, which is a 360 pop shove-it and a kickflip in the same motion. The flat ground ollie forms the basis of many street skating tricks, allowing skateboarders to perform tricks in mid-air without any more equipment than the skateboard itself. A recent development in the world of trick skating is the 1080, which was first ever landed by Tom Schaar in 2012.

==Culture==

=== Film ===
Skateboarding was popularized by the 1986 skateboarding cult classic &quot;Thrashin&#x27;&quot;. Directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin, it features appearances from many famous skaters such as Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero. &quot;Thrashin&#x27;&quot; also had a direct impact on &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot;, as Catherine Hardwicke, who directed &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot;, was hired by Winters to work on &quot;Thrashin″&quot; as a production designer where she met, worked with and befriended many famous skaters including the real Alva, Hawk, Hosoi and Caballero.

Skateboarding was, at first, tied to the culture of surfing. As skateboarding spread across the United States to places unfamiliar with surfing or surfer culture, it developed an image of its own. For example, the classic film short &quot;Video Days&quot; (1991) portrayed skateboarders as &quot;reckless rebels&quot;.

California duo Jan and Dean recorded the song &quot;Sidewalk Surfin&#x27;&quot; in 1964, which is the Beach Boys song &quot;Catch a Wave&quot; with new lyrics associated with skateboarding instead of surfing.

=== Skate parks ===
Certain cities still oppose the building of skate parks in their neighborhoods, for fear of increased crime and drugs in the area. The rift between the old image of skateboarding and a newer one is quite visible: magazines such as &quot;Thrasher&quot; portray skateboarding as dirty, rebellious, and still firmly tied to punk, while other publications, &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; as an example, paint a more diverse and controlled picture of skateboarding. As more professional skaters use hip hop, reggae, or hard rock music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport&#x27;s punk image.

Group spirit supposedly influences the members of this community. In presentations of this sort, showcasing of criminal tendencies is absent, and no attempt is made to tie extreme sports to any kind of illegal activity. Female based skateboarding groups also exist, such as Brujas which is based in New York City. Many women use their participation in skate crews to perform an alternative form of femininity. These female skate crews offer a safe haven for women and girls in cities, where they can skate and bond without male expectations or competition.

=== Video ===
The increasing availability of technology is apparent within the skateboarding community. Many skateboarders record and edit videos of themselves and friends skateboarding. However, part of this culture is to not merely replicate but to innovate; emphasis is placed on finding new places and landing new tricks.

=== Video games ===
Skateboarding video games have also become very popular in skateboarding culture. Some of the most popular are the &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; series and &quot;Skate&quot; series for various consoles (including hand-held) and personal computer.

===Skate shoe===

Whilst early skateboarders generally rode barefoot, preferring direct foot-to-board contact, and some skaters continue to do so, one of the early leading trends associated with the sub-culture of skateboarding itself, was the sticky-soled slip-on skate shoe, most popularized by Sean Penn&#x27;s skateboarding character from the 1982 film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. Because early skateboarders were actually surfers trying to emulate the sport of surfing, at the time when skateboards first came out on the market, many skateboarded barefoot. But skaters often lacked traction, which led to foot injuries. This necessitated the need for a shoe that was specifically designed and marketed for skateboarding, such as the Randy &quot;720&quot;, manufactured by the Randolph Rubber Company, and Vans sneakers, which eventually became cultural iconic signifiers for skateboarders during the 1970s and &#x27;80s as skateboarding became more widespread.

While the skate shoes design afforded better connection and traction with the deck, skaterboarders themselves could often be identified when wearing the shoes, with Tony Hawk once saying, &quot;If you were wearing Vans shoes in 86, you were a skateboarder&quot;. Because of its connection with skateboarding, Vans financed the legendary skateboarding documentary &quot;Dogtown and Z-Boys&quot; and was the first sneaker company to endorse a professional skateboarder Stacy Peralta. Vans has a long history of being a major sponsor of many of skateboarding&#x27;s competitions and events throughout skateboarding&#x27;s history as well, including the Vans Warped Tour and the Vans Triple Crown Series.

As it eventually became more apparent that skateboarding had a particular identity with a style of shoe, other brands of shoe companies began to specifically design skate shoes for functionality and style to further enhance the experience and culture of skateboarding including such brands as; Converse, Nike, DC Shoes, Globe, Adidas, Zoo York and World Industries. Many professional skateboarders are designed a pro-model skate shoe, with their name on it, once they have received a skateboarding sponsorship after becoming notable skateboarders. Some shoe companies involved with skateboarding, like Sole Technology, an American footwear company that makes the Etnies skate shoe brand, further distinguish themselves in the market by collaborating with local cities to open public skateparks, such as the etnies Skatepark in Lake Forest, California.

===Skateboard deck===

Individuality and a self-expressed casual style have always been cultural values for skateboarders, as uniforms and jerseys are not typically worn. This type of personal style for skateboarders is often reflected in the graphical designs illustrated on the bottom of the deck of skateboards, since its initial conception in the mid-seventies, when Wes Humpston and Jim Muri first began doing design work for Dogtown Skateboards out of their garage by hand, creating the very first iconic skateboard-deck art with the design of the &quot;Dogtown Cross&quot;.

Prior to the mid-seventies many early skateboards were originally based upon the concept of “Sidewalk Surfing” and were tied to the surf culture, skateboards were surfboard like in appearance with little to no graphics located under the bottom of the skateboard-deck. Some of the early manufactured skateboards such as &quot;Roller Derby&quot;, the &quot;Duraflex Surfer&quot; and the &quot;Banana board&quot; are characteristic. Some skateboards during that time were manufactured with company logo&#x27;s or stickers across the top of the deck of the skateboard, as griptape was not initially used for construction. But as skateboarding progressed and evolved, and as artists began to design and add influence to the artwork of skateboards, designs and themes began to change.

There were several artistic skateboarding pioneers that had an influence on the culture of skateboarding during the 1980s, that transformed skateboard-deck art like Jim Phillips, whose edgy comic-book style &quot;Screaming Hand&quot;, not only became the main logo for Santa Cruz Skateboards, but eventually transcended into tattoos of the same image for thousands of people and vinyl collectible figurines over the years. Artist Vernon Courtlandt Johnson is said to have used his artwork of skeletons and skulls, for Powell Peralta, during the same time that the music genres of punk rock and new wave music were beginning to mesh with the culture of skateboarding. Some other notable skateboard artists that made contributions to the culture of skateboarding also include Andy Jenkins, Todd Bratrud, Neil Blender, Marc McKee, Tod Swank, Mark Gonzales, Lance Mountain, Natas Kaupas and Jim Evans.

Over the years skateboard-deck art has continued to influence and expand the culture of skateboarding, as many people began collecting skateboards based on their artistic value and nostalgia. Productions of limited editions with particular designs and types of collectible prints that can be hung on the wall, have been created by such famous artists as Andy Warhol and Keith Haring. Most professional skateboarders today have their own signature skateboard decks, with their favorite artistic designs printed on them using computer graphics.

===High value and collectible skateboards===
In January 2019, Sotheby&#x27;s in New York auctioned the full set of the 248 skateboard deck designs ever sold by Supreme, collected by Ryan Fuller. The full set sold for $800,000 to 17 year old Carson Guo from Vancouver who plans to exhibit them in a local gallery.

New York based SHUT Skateboards had a goldplated skateboard for sale at $15,000 in 2014, then the most expensive skateboard in the world.

In 2019, artist Adrian Wilson created the SUPREME Mundi, a cross between an artist palette and a skateboard as a commentary on the record bids at auction of the Supreme decks and the restored &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; which was sold by a New York art gallery for $20,000

==Safety==
Skateboards, along with other small-wheeled transportation such as in-line skates and scooters, suffer a safety problem: riders may easily be thrown from small cracks and outcroppings in pavement, especially where the cracks run across the direction of travel. Hitting such an irregularity is the major cause of falls and injuries. The risk may be reduced at higher travel speeds.

Severe injuries are relatively rare. Commonly, a skateboarder who falls suffers from scrapes, cuts, bruises, and sprains. Among injuries reported to a hospital, about half involve broken bones, usually the long bones in the leg or arm. One third of skateboarders with reported injuries are very new to the sport, having started skating within one week of the injury. Although less common, involving 3.5–9 percent of reported injuries, traumatic head injuries and death are possible severe outcomes.

Skating as a form of transportation exposes the skateboarder to the dangers of other traffic. Skateboarders on the street may be hit by other vehicles or may fall into vehicular traffic.

Skateboarders also occasionally pose a risk to other pedestrians and traffic. If the skateboarder falls, the skateboard may roll or fly into another person. A skateboarder who collides with a person who is walking or biking may injure or, rarely, kill that person.

Many jurisdictions require skateboarders to wear bicycle helmets to reduce the risk of head injuries and death. Other protective gear, such as wrist guards, also reduce injury. Some medical researchers have proposed restricting skateboarding to designated, specially designed areas, to reduce the number and severity of injuries, and to eliminate injuries caused by motor vehicles or to other pedestrians.

The use, ownership and sale of skateboards were forbidden in Norway from 1978 to 1989 because of the high number of injuries caused by boards. The ban led skateboarders to construct ramps in the forest and other secluded areas to avoid the police. There was, however, one legal skatepark in the country in Frogner Park in Oslo.

==Other uses and styles==
===Transportation===
The use of skateboards solely as a form of transportation is often associated with the longboard. Depending on local laws, using skateboards as a form of transportation outside residential areas may or may not be legal. Backers cite portability, exercise, and environmental friendliness as some of the benefits of skateboarding as an alternative to automobiles.

===Military===

The United States Marine Corps tested the usefulness of commercial off-the-shelf skateboards during urban combat military exercises in the late 1990s in a program called Urban Warrior &#x27;99. Their special purpose was &quot;for maneuvering inside buildings in order to detect tripwires and sniper fire&quot;.

===Trampboarding===
Trampboarding is a variant of skateboarding that uses a board without the trucks and the wheels on a trampoline. Using the bounce of the trampoline gives height to perform tricks, whereas in skateboarding one needs to make the height by performing an ollie. Trampboarding is seen on YouTube in numerous videos.

===Swing boarding===
Swing boarding is the activity where a skateboard deck is suspended from a pivot point above the rider which allows the rider to swing about that pivot point. The board swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a harness and frame allows the rider to perform turns and spins all while flying through the air.

==Controversy==
Skateboarding damages urban terrain features such as curbs, benches, and ledges when skateboarders perform &quot;grinds&quot; and other tricks on these surfaces. Private industry has responded to this problem by using skate deterrent devices, such as the Skatestopper, in efforts to prevent further damage and to reduce skateboarding on these surfaces.

The enactment of ordinances and the posting of signs stating &quot;Skateboarding is not allowed&quot; have also become common methods to discourage skateboarding in public areas in many cities, to protect pedestrians and property. In the area of street skating, tickets and arrest from police for trespassing and vandalism are not uncommon.

Skateboarding has become an important problem in Freedom Plaza, a National Park within the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site in Washington, D.C. The Plaza has become a popular location for skateboarding, although the activity is illegal and has resulted in police actions. The Plaza contains copies of portions of Pierre (Peter) Charles L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s 1791 plan for the nation&#x27;s capital city that have been inscribed in the park&#x27;s raised marble surface. A 2016 National Park Service management plan for the Historic Site states that skateboarding has damaged stonework, sculptures, walls, benches, steps, and other surfaces in some areas of the Plaza. The management plan further states that skateboarding presents a persistent law enforcement and management challenge, as popular websites advertise the Plaza&#x27;s attractiveness for the activity. The plan notes that vandals have removed &quot;No Skateboarding&quot; signs and recommends the replacement of those signs.

A professional skateboarder promoted on Facebook the use of governmental sites for the prohibited activity during the 2013 federal government shutdown in the United States.

<text>Speed skating is a competitive form of ice skating in which the competitors race each other in travelling a certain distance on skates. Types of speed skating are long-track speed skating, short-track speed skating, and marathon speed skating. In the Olympic Games, long-track speed skating is usually referred to as just &quot;speed skating&quot;, while short-track speed skating is known as &quot;short track&quot;. The International Skating Union (ISU), the governing body of competitive ice sports, refers to long track as &quot;speed skating&quot; and short track as &quot;short track skating&quot;. Long track speed skating takes place on a 400m ice track, while short track takes place on a 111m track.

An international federation was founded in 1892, the first for any winter sport. The sport enjoys large popularity in the Netherlands, Norway and South Korea. There are top international rinks in a number of other countries, including Canada, the United States, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Kazakhstan, China, Belarus and Poland. A World Cup circuit is held with events in those countries plus two events in the Thialf ice hall in Heerenveen, Netherlands.

==Overview==
The standard rink for long track is 400 meters long, but tracks of 200, 250 and 333 meters are used occasionally. It is one of two Olympic forms of the sport and the one with the longer history.

ISU rules allow some leeway in the size and radius of curves.

Short track speed skating takes place on a smaller rink, normally the size of an ice hockey rink, on a 111.12 m oval track. Distances are shorter than in long-track racing, with the longest Olympic individual race being 1500 meters (the women&#x27;s relay is 3000 meters and the men&#x27;s relay 5000 meters). Events are usually held with a knockout format, with the best two in heats of four or five qualifying for the final race, where medals are awarded. Disqualifications and falls are not uncommon.


There are variations on the mass-start races. In the regulations of roller sports, eight different types of mass starts are described. Among them are elimination races, where one or more competitors are eliminated at fixed points during the course; simple distance races, which may include preliminary races; endurance races with time limits instead of a fixed distance; points races; and individual pursuits.

Races usually have rules about disqualification if an opponent is unfairly hindered; these rules vary between the disciplines. In long track speed skating, almost any infringement on the pairmate is punished, though skaters are permitted to change from the inner to the outer lane out of the final curve if they are not able to hold the inner curve, as long as they are not interfering with the other skater. In mass-start races, skaters will usually be allowed some physical contact.

Team races are also held; in long track speed skating, the only team race at the highest level of competition is the team pursuit, though athletics-style relay races are held at children&#x27;s competitions. Relay races are also held in short track and inline competitions, but here exchanges may take place at any time during the race, though exchanges may be banned during the last couple of laps.

Most speed skating races are held on an oval course, but there are exceptions. Oval sizes vary; in short track speed skating, the rink must be an oval of 111.12 metres, while long track speed skating uses a similarly standardized 400 m rink. Inline skating rinks are between 125 and 400 metres, though banked tracks can only be 250 metres long. Inline skating can also be held on closed road courses between 400 and 1,000 metres, as well as open-road competitions where starting and finishing lines do not coincide. This is also a feature of outdoor marathons.

In the Netherlands, marathon competitions may be held on natural ice on canals, and bodies of water such as lakes and rivers, but may also be held on artificially frozen 400 m tracks, with skaters circling the track 100 times, for example.

== History ==


The origins of speed skating date back over a millennium in the North of Europe, especially Scandinavia and the Netherlands, where the natives added bones to their shoes and used them to travel on frozen rivers, canals and lakes. Later, in Norway, King Eystein Magnusson, later King Eystein I of Norway, boasts of his skills racing on bone skates, so called &quot;ice legs&quot;.

However, skating and speed skating was not limited to the Netherlands and Scandinavia; in 1592, a Scotsman designed a skate with an iron blade. It was iron-bladed skates that led to the spread of skating and, in particular, speed skating.
By 1642, the first known skating club, The Skating Club of Edinburgh, was born, and, in 1763, the first speed skating race known in any detail was held from Wisbech to Whittlesey on the Fens in England for a prize sum of 20 guineas, won by John Lamb of Wisbech.
While in the Netherlands, people began touring the waterways connecting the 11 cities of Friesland, a challenge which eventually led to the Elfstedentocht.

The first known speed skating competition for women was in Heerenveen, the Netherlands from 1 to 2 February 1805. The competition was won by Trijntje Pieters Westra.

By 1851, North Americans had discovered a love of the sport, and the all-steel blade was later developed there. In Norway speed skating also became popular, as there was a huge interest in the 1885 speed skating race at Frognerkilen between Axel Paulsen and Renke van der Zee.
The Netherlands came back to the fore in 1889 with the organization of the first world championships. The ISU (International Skating Union) was also born in the Netherlands in 1892.
By the start of the 20th century, skating and speed skating had come into its own as a major popular sporting activity.

===ISU development===
Organized races on ice skates developed in the 19th century. Norwegian clubs hosted competitions from 1863, with races in Christiania drawing five-digit crowds. In 1884, the Norwegian Axel Paulsen was named Amateur Champion Skater of the World after winning competitions in the United States. Five years later, a sports club in Amsterdam held an ice-skating event they called a world championship, with participants from Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom, as well as the host country. The &quot;Internationale Eislauf Vereinigung&quot;, now known as the International Skating Union, was founded at a meeting of 15 national representatives in Scheveningen in 1892, the first international winter sports federation. The Nederlandse Schaatsrijderbond was founded in 1882 and organised the world championships of 1890 and 1891. Competitions were held around tracks of varying lengths—the 1885 match between Axel Paulsen and Remke van der Zee was skated on a track of 6/7 mile (1400 metres)—but the 400 metre track was standardised by the ISU in 1892, along with the standard distances for world championships, 500 m, 1500 m, 5000 m and 10,000 m. Skaters started in pairs, each to their own lane, and changed lanes for every lap to ensure that each skater completed the same distance. This is what is now known as long track speed skating. Competitions were exclusively for amateur skaters, which was enforced. Peter Sinnerud was disqualified for professionalism in 1904 and lost his world title.

Long track world records were first registered in imperial distances and since 1880 in metrical distances. The latter ones improved rapidly since their adoption as standard distances by the ISU, with Jaap Eden lowering the world 5000-metre record by half a minute during the Hamar European Championships in 1894. However, the record stood for 17 years, and it took over 50 years to lower it by further half a minute.

===Elfstedentocht===
The Elfstedentocht was organized as a competition in 1909 and has been held at irregular intervals, whenever the ice on the course is deemed good enough. Other outdoor races developed later, with Friesland in the northern Netherlands hosting a race in 1917, but the Dutch natural ice conditions have rarely been conducive to skating. The Elfstedentocht has been held 15 times in the nearly 100 years since 1909, and, before artificial ice was available in 1962, national championships had been held in 25 of the years between 1887, when the first championship was held in Slikkerveer, and 1961. Since artificial ice became common in the Netherlands, Dutch speed skaters have been among the world top in long track ice skating and marathon skating. Another solution to still be able to skate marathons on natural ice became the Alternative Elfstedentocht. The Alternative Elfstedentocht races take part in other countries, such as Austria, Finland or Canada, and all top marathon skaters, as well as thousands of recreative skaters, travel from the Netherlands to the location where the race is held. According to the NRC Handelsblad journalist Jaap Bloembergen, the country &quot;takes a carnival look&quot; during international skating championships.

=== Olympic Games ===
At the 1914 Olympic Congress, the delegates agreed to include ice speed skating in the 1916 Olympics, after figure skating had featured in the 1908 Olympics. However, World War I put an end to the plans of Olympic competition, and it was not until the winter sports week in Chamonix in 1924—retroactively awarded Olympic status—that ice speed skating reached the Olympic programme. Charles Jewtraw from Lake Placid, New York, won the first Olympic gold medal, though several Norwegians in attendance claimed Oskar Olsen had clocked a better time. Timing issues on the 500 were a problem within the sport until electronic clocks arrived in the 1960s; during the 1936 Olympic 500–metre race, it was suggested that Ivar Ballangrud&#x27;s 500-metre time was almost a second too good. Finland won the remaining four gold medals at the 1924 Games, with Clas Thunberg winning 1,500 metres, 5,000 metres, and allround. It was the first and only time an allround Olympic gold medal has been awarded in speed skating. Speed Skating is also a sport in today&#x27;s Olympics.

Norwegian and Finnish skaters won all the gold medals in world championships between the world wars, with Latvians and Austrians visiting the podium in the European Championships. However, North American races were usually conducted pack-style, similar to the marathon races in the Netherlands, but the Olympic races were to be held over the four ISU-approved distances. The ISU approved the suggestion that the speed skating at the 1932 Winter Olympics should be held as pack-style races, and Americans won all four gold medals. Canada won five medals, all silver and bronze, while defending World Champion Clas Thunberg stayed at home, protesting against this form of racing. At the World Championships held immediately after the games, without the American champions, Norwegian racers won all four distances and occupied the three top spots in the allround standings.

Norwegians, Swedes, Finns, and Japanese skating leaders protested to the USOC, condemning the manner of competition and expressing the wish that mass-start races were never to be held again at the Olympics. However, the ISU adopted the short track speed skating branch, with mass-start races on shorter tracks, in 1967, arranged international competitions from 1976, and brought them back to the Olympics in 1992.

===Technical developments===
Artificial ices entered the long track competitions with the 1960 Winter Olympics, and the competitions in 1956 on Lake Misurina were the last Olympic competitions on natural ice. 1960 also saw the first Winter Olympic competitions for women. Lidia Skoblikova won two gold medals in 1960 and four in 1964.

More aerodynamic skating suits were also developed, with Swiss skater Franz Krienbühl (who finished 8th on the Olympic 10,000 m at the age of 46) at the front of development. After a while, national teams took over development of bodysuits, which are also used in short track skating, though without headcover attached to the suit—short trackers wear helmets instead, as falls are more common in mass-start races. Suits and indoor skating, as well as the clap skate, has helped to lower long track world records considerably; from 1971 to 2009, the average speed on the men&#x27;s 1500 metres has been raised from 45 to 52 km/h. Similar speed increases are shown in the other distances.

===Professionalism===
After the 1972 season, European long track skaters founded a professional league, International Speedskating League, which included Ard Schenk, three-time Olympic gold medallist in 1972, as well as five Norwegians, four other Dutchmen, three Swedes, and a few other skaters. Jonny Nilsson, 1963 world champion and Olympic gold medallist, was the driving force behind the league, which folded in 1974 for economic reasons, and the ISU also excluded tracks hosting professional races from future international championships. The ISU later organised its own World Cup circuit with monetary prizes, and full-time professional teams developed in the Netherlands during the 1990s, which led them to a dominance on the men&#x27;s side only challenged by Japanese 500 m racers and American inline skaters who changed to long tracks to win Olympic gold.

===North American professionals===
During the 20th century, roller skating also developed as a competitive sport. Roller-skating races were professional from an early stage. Professional World Championships were arranged in North America between the competitors on that circuit. Later, roller derby leagues appeared, a professional contact sport that originally was a form of racing. FIRS World Championships of inline speed skating go back to the 1980s, but many world champions, such as Derek Parra and Chad Hedrick, have switched to ice in order to win Olympic medals.

Like roller skating, ice speed skating was also professional in North America. Oscar Mathisen, five-time ISU world champion and three-time European champion, renounced his amateur status in 1916 and travelled to America, where he won many races but was beaten by Bobby McLean of Chicago, four-time American champion, in one of the races. Chicago was a centre of ice speed skating in America; the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; sponsored a competition called the Silver Skates from 1912 to 2014.

===Short track enters the Olympics===
In 1992, short track speed skating was accepted as an Olympic sport. Short track speed skating had little following in the long track speed skating countries of Europe, such as Norway, the Netherlands and the former Soviet Union, with none of these nations having won official medals (though the Netherlands won two gold medals when the sport was a demonstration event in 1988). The Norwegian publication &quot;Sportsboken&quot; spent ten pages detailing the long track speed skating events at the Albertville Games in 1993, but short track was not mentioned by word, though the results pages appeared in that section.

Although this form of speed skating is newer, it is growing faster than long-track speed skating, largely because short track can be done on an ice hockey rink rather than a long-track oval.

==Rules==

===Short track===

Races are run counter-clockwise on a 111-meter track. Short track races are almost always run in a mass start format in which two to six skaters may race at once. Skaters may be disqualified for false starts, impeding, and cutting inside the track. False starts occur when a skater moves before the gun goes off at the start of a race. Skaters are disqualified for impeding when one skater cuts in front of another skater and causes the first skater to stand up to avoid collision or fall. Cutting inside the track occurs when a skater&#x27;s skates goes inside the blocks which mark the track on the ice. If disqualified the skater will be given last place in their heat or final.

===Long track===
Races are run counter-clockwise on a 400-meter oval. In all individual competition forms, only two skaters are allowed to race at once. Skaters must change lanes every lap. The skater changing from the outside lane to the inside has right-of-way. Skaters may be disqualified for false starts, impeding, and cutting inside the track. If a skater misses their race or falls they have the option to race their distance again. There are no heats or finals in long track, all rankings are by time.

The starting procedure in long-track speed skating consists of three parts. First, the referee tells the athletes to &quot;Go to the start&quot;. Second, the referee cues the athletes to get &quot;Ready&quot;, and waits until the skaters have stopped moving. Finally, the referee waits for a random duration between 1 and 1.5 seconds, and then fires the starting shot. Some argue that this inherent timing variability could disadvantage athletes that start after longer pauses, due to the alerting effect.

In the only non-individual competition form, the team pursuit, two teams of each three to four skaters are allowed to race at once. Both teams remain in the inner lane for the duration of the race; they start on opposite sides of the rink. If four skaters are racing one skater is allowed to drop off and stop racing. The clock stops when the third skater crosses the finish line.

===Team pursuit===

The team pursuit is a team event in speed skating and is skated by teams of three skaters. Races resemble the team pursuit event in track cycling. Two teams race at a time, starting at a line in the middle of the straightaway. One team starts on each side of the track. Only the inner lane is used. The distance is eight laps for men and six for women. The team&#x27;s time is the third skater to cross the finish line.

There are several formats for the team pursuit. The Olympic format is unusual in that it is a cup format, with several rounds of exclusion between two teams. In the World Cup and World Championships, one race is skated and the teams are ranked by their finishing time. In the Olympic format, a team that overtakes the other has automatically won the race and the remaining distance is not skated. In practice, the distance is so short that this rarely happens unless one team has a fall.

The team pursuit is a new event in major international competitions. The event was introduced at international level at the world junior championships around the turn of the millennium, and to the World Cup in 2003, but it was not considered an official ISU event until around 2004, and eventually introduced at the Olympics in 2006.

==Equipment==

Speed skates Speed skates differ greatly from hockey skates and figure skates. Unlike hockey skates and figure skates, speed skates cut off at the ankle and are built more like a shoe than a boot to allow for more ankle compression. The blades range in length from 30 to 45 cm depending on the age and height of the skater. Short track blades are fixed to the boot in at the heel and immediately behind the ball of the foot. Long track skates, also called clap skates, attach to a hinge at the front of the boot. The heel of the boot detaches from the blade on every stroke, through a spring mechanism located at the front connector. This extends the skater&#x27;s stroke by keeping the blade on the ice longer. Speed skates are manually sharpened using a jig to hold them in place.

Short track
All short track skaters must have speed skates, a spandex skin suit, protective helmet, specific cut proof skating gloves, knee pads and shin pads (in suit), neck guard (bib style) and ankle protection. Protective eyewear is mandatory. Many skaters wear smooth ceramic or carbon fiber tips on the left hand glove to reduce friction when their hand is on the ice at corners. All skaters who race at a national level must wear a cutproof kevlar suit to protect against being cut from another skater&#x27;s blade.

Long track
For long track skaters the same equipment should be worn as short track racers but with the exception of a helmet, shin pads, knee pads, and neck guard which are not required; along with their blades. Long track skaters skate on what are called &quot;clap blades&quot;. These blades have hinges under the boot towards the back. It is described in more detail above. Protective eyewear is not mandatory. The suit also does not need to be kevlar. Long track skaters wear a hood that is built into the suit.

Skate Sharpening
To sharpen their skates, skaters must place their skates on a jig and move diamond or stone stones back and forth. The diamond stones will have different colors that will be assigned to them depending on how much they eat into the blade, black as the one that affects the blades the most and gold as the one that affects the least.

<text>A scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a type of electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the surface topography and composition of the sample. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the position of the beam is combined with the intensity of the detected signal to produce an image. In the most common SEM mode, secondary electrons emitted by atoms excited by the electron beam are detected using a secondary electron detector (Everhart–Thornley detector). The number of secondary electrons that can be detected, and thus the signal intensity, depends, among other things, on specimen topography. Some SEMs can achieve resolutions better than 1 nanometer.

Specimens are observed in high vacuum in a conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in a variable pressure or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.

==History==
An account of the early history of scanning electron microscopy has been presented by McMullan. Although Max Knoll produced a photo with a 50 mm object-field-width showing channeling contrast by the use of an electron beam scanner, it was Manfred von Ardenne who in 1937 invented a microscope with high resolution by scanning a very small raster with a demagnified and finely focused electron beam. In the same year, Cecil E. Hall also completed the construction of the first emission microscope in North America, just two years after being tasked by his supervisor, E. F. Burton at the University of Toronto. Ardenne applied scanning of the electron beam in an attempt to surpass the resolution of the transmission electron microscope (TEM), as well as to mitigate substantial problems with chromatic aberration inherent to real imaging in the TEM. He further discussed the various detection modes, possibilities and theory of SEM, together with the construction of the first high resolution SEM. Further work was reported by Zworykin&#x27;s group, followed by the Cambridge groups in the 1950s and early 1960s headed by Charles Oatley, all of which finally led to the marketing of the first commercial instrument by Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company as the &quot;Stereoscan&quot; in 1965, which was delivered to DuPont.

==Principles and capacities==
The signals used by a SEM to produce an image result from interactions of the electron beam with atoms at various depths within the sample. Various types of signals are produced including secondary electrons (SE), reflected or back-scattered electrons (BSE), characteristic X-rays and light (cathodoluminescence) (CL), absorbed current (specimen current) and transmitted electrons. Secondary electron detectors are standard equipment in all SEMs, but it is rare for a single machine to have detectors for all other possible signals.

Secondary electrons have very low energies on the order of 50 eV, which limits their mean free path in solid matter. Consequently, SEs can only escape from the top few nanometers of the surface of a sample. The signal from secondary electrons tends to be highly localized at the point of impact of the primary electron beam, making it possible to collect images of the sample surface with a resolution of below 1 nm. Back-scattered electrons (BSE) are beam electrons that are reflected from the sample by elastic scattering. Since they have much higher energy than SEs, they emerge from deeper locations within the specimen and, consequently, the resolution of BSE images is less than SE images. However, BSE are often used in analytical SEM, along with the spectra made from the characteristic X-rays, because the intensity of the BSE signal is strongly related to the atomic number (Z) of the specimen. BSE images can provide information about the distribution, but not the identity, of different elements in the sample. In samples predominantly composed of light elements, such as biological specimens, BSE imaging can image colloidal gold immuno-labels of 5 or 10 nm diameter, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to detect in secondary electron images. Characteristic X-rays are emitted when the electron beam removes an inner shell electron from the sample, causing a higher-energy electron to fill the shell and release energy. The energy or wavelength of these characteristic X-rays can be measured by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy or Wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and used to identify and measure the abundance of elements in the sample and map their distribution.

Due to the very narrow electron beam, SEM micrographs have a large depth of field yielding a characteristic three-dimensional appearance useful for understanding the surface structure of a sample. This is exemplified by the micrograph of pollen shown above. A wide range of magnifications is possible, from about 10 times (about equivalent to that of a powerful hand-lens) to more than 500,000 times, about 250 times the magnification limit of the best light microscopes.

==Sample preparation==
SEM samples have to be small enough to fit on the specimen stage, and may need special preparation to increase their electrical conductivity and to stabilize them, so that they can withstand the high vacuum conditions and the high energy beam of electrons. Samples are generally mounted rigidly on a specimen holder or stub using a conductive adhesive. SEM is used extensively for defect analysis of semiconductor wafers, and manufacturers make instruments that can examine any part of a 300 mm semiconductor wafer. Many instruments have chambers that can tilt an object of that size to 45° and provide continuous 360° rotation.

Nonconductive specimens collect charge when scanned by the electron beam, and especially in secondary electron imaging mode, this causes scanning faults and other image artifacts. For conventional imaging in the SEM, specimens must be electrically conductive, at least at the surface, and electrically grounded to prevent the accumulation of electrostatic charge. Metal objects require little special preparation for SEM except for cleaning and conductively mounting to a specimen stub. Non-conducting materials are usually coated with an ultrathin coating of electrically conducting material, deposited on the sample either by low-vacuum sputter coating, electroless deposition or by high-vacuum evaporation. Conductive materials in current use for specimen coating include gold, gold/palladium alloy, platinum, iridium, tungsten, chromium, osmium, and graphite. Coating with heavy metals may increase signal/noise ratio for samples of low atomic number (Z). The improvement arises because secondary electron emission for high-Z materials is enhanced.

An alternative to coating for some biological samples is to increase the bulk conductivity of the material by impregnation with osmium using variants of the OTO staining method (O-osmium tetroxide, T-thiocarbohydrazide, O-osmium).

Nonconducting specimens may be imaged without coating using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen is placed in a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an instrument with a field emission guns (FEG) which is capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outgoing secondary and backscattered electron currents, a condition that is most often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.

Embedding in a resin with further polishing to a mirror-like finish can be used for both biological and materials specimens when imaging in backscattered electrons or when doing quantitative X-ray microanalysis.

The main preparation techniques are not required in the environmental SEM outlined below, but some biological specimens can benefit from fixation.

===Biological samples===
Since the SEM specimen chamber is under high vacuum, a SEM specimen must be completely dry or cryogenically cooled. Hard, dry materials such as wood, bone, feathers, dried insects, or shells (including egg shells) can be examined with little further treatment, but living cells and tissues and whole, soft-bodied organisms require chemical fixation to preserve and stabilize their structure.

Fixation is usually performed by incubation in a solution of a buffered chemical fixative, such as glutaraldehyde, sometimes in combination with formaldehyde and other fixatives, and optionally followed by postfixation with osmium tetroxide. The fixed tissue is then dehydrated. Because air-drying causes collapse and shrinkage, this is commonly achieved by replacement of water in the cells with organic solvents such as ethanol or acetone, and replacement of these solvents in turn with a transitional fluid such as liquid carbon dioxide by critical point drying. The carbon dioxide is finally removed while in a supercritical state, so that no gas–liquid interface is present within the sample during drying.

The dry specimen is usually mounted on a specimen stub using an adhesive such as epoxy resin or electrically conductive double-sided adhesive tape, and sputter-coated with gold or gold/palladium alloy before examination in the microscope. Samples may be sectioned (with a microtome) if information about the organism&#x27;s internal ultrastructure is to be exposed for imaging.

If the SEM is equipped with a cold stage for cryo microscopy, cryofixation may be used and low-temperature scanning electron microscopy performed on the cryogenically fixed specimens. Cryo-fixed specimens may be cryo-fractured under vacuum in a special apparatus to reveal internal structure, sputter-coated and transferred onto the SEM cryo-stage while still frozen. Low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LT-SEM) is also applicable to the imaging of temperature-sensitive materials such as ice and fats.

Freeze-fracturing, freeze-etch or freeze-and-break is a preparation method particularly useful for examining lipid membranes and their incorporated proteins in &quot;face on&quot; view. The preparation method reveals the proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer.

===Materials===
Back-scattered electron imaging, quantitative X-ray analysis, and X-ray mapping of specimens often requires grinding and polishing the surfaces to an ultra-smooth surface. Specimens that undergo WDS or EDS analysis are often carbon-coated. In general, metals are not coated prior to imaging in the SEM because they are conductive and provide their own pathway to ground. Fractography is the study of fractured surfaces that can be done on a light microscope or, commonly, on an SEM. The fractured surface is cut to a suitable size, cleaned of any organic residues, and mounted on a specimen holder for viewing in the SEM. Integrated circuits may be cut with a focused ion beam (FIB) or other ion beam milling instrument for viewing in the SEM. The SEM in the first case may be incorporated into the FIB, enabling high-resolution imaging of the result of the process. Metals, geological specimens, and integrated circuits all may also be chemically polished for viewing in the SEM. Special high-resolution coating techniques are required for high-magnification imaging of inorganic thin films.

==Scanning process and image formation==

In a typical SEM, an electron beam is thermionically emitted from an electron gun fitted with a tungsten filament cathode. Tungsten is normally used in thermionic electron guns because it has the highest melting point and lowest vapor pressure of all metals, thereby allowing it to be electrically heated for electron emission, and because of its low cost. Other types of electron emitters include lanthanum hexaboride () cathodes, which can be used in a standard tungsten filament SEM if the vacuum system is upgraded, or field emission guns (FEG), which may be of the cold-cathode type using tungsten single crystal emitters or the thermally assisted Schottky type, that use emitters of tungsten single crystals coated in zirconium oxide.

The electron beam, which typically has an energy ranging from 0.2 keV to 40 keV, is focused by one or two condenser lenses to a spot about 0.4 nm to 5 nm in diameter. The beam passes through pairs of scanning coils or pairs of deflector plates in the electron column, typically in the final lens, which deflect the beam in the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; axes so that it scans in a raster fashion over a rectangular area of the sample surface.

When the primary electron beam interacts with the sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100 nm to approximately 5 μm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron&#x27;s landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen, and the specimen&#x27;s density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, the emission of secondary electrons by inelastic scattering, and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each of which can be detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a cathode-ray tube). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is, therefore, a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. Older microscopes captured images on film, but most modern instruments collect digital images.

===Magnification===
Magnification in an SEM can be controlled over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 3,000,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not a function of the power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the electron gun can generate a beam with a sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses. However, it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the raster on the display device and dimensions of the raster on the specimen. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.

==Detection of secondary electrons==
The most common imaging mode collects low-energy (&lt;50 eV) secondary electrons that are ejected from conduction or valence bands of the specimen atoms by inelastic scattering interactions with beam electrons. Due to their low energy, these electrons originate from within a few nanometers below the sample surface. The electrons are detected by an Everhart–Thornley detector, which is a type of collector-scintillator-photomultiplier system. The secondary electrons are first collected by attracting them towards an electrically biased grid at about +400 V, and then further accelerated towards a phosphor or scintillator positively biased to about +2,000 V. The accelerated secondary electrons are now sufficiently energetic to cause the scintillator to emit flashes of light (cathodoluminescence), which are conducted to a photomultiplier outside the SEM column via a light pipe and a window in the wall of the specimen chamber. The amplified electrical signal output by the photomultiplier is displayed as a two-dimensional intensity distribution that can be viewed and photographed on an analogue video display, or subjected to analog-to-digital conversion and displayed and saved as a digital image. This process relies on a raster-scanned primary beam. The brightness of the signal depends on the number of secondary electrons reaching the detector. If the beam enters the sample perpendicular to the surface, then the activated region is uniform about the axis of the beam and a certain number of electrons &quot;escape&quot; from within the sample. As the angle of incidence increases, the interaction volume increases and the &quot;escape&quot; distance of one side of the beam decreases, resulting in more secondary electrons being emitted from the sample. Thus steep surfaces and edges tend to be brighter than flat surfaces, which results in images with a well-defined, three-dimensional appearance. Using the signal of secondary electrons image resolution less than 0.5 nm is possible.

==Detection of backscattered electrons==
Backscattered electrons (BSE) consist of high-energy electrons originating in the electron beam, that are reflected or back-scattered out of the specimen interaction volume by elastic scattering interactions with specimen atoms. Since heavy elements (high atomic number) backscatter electrons more strongly than light elements (low atomic number), and thus appear brighter in the image, BSEs are used to detect contrast between areas with different chemical compositions. The Everhart–Thornley detector, which is normally positioned to one side of the specimen, is inefficient for the detection of backscattered electrons because few such electrons are emitted in the solid angle subtended by the detector, and because the positively biased detection grid has little ability to attract the higher energy BSE. Dedicated backscattered electron detectors are positioned above the sample in a &quot;doughnut&quot; type arrangement, concentric with the electron beam, maximizing the solid angle of collection. BSE detectors are usually either of scintillator or of semiconductor types. When all parts of the detector are used to collect electrons symmetrically about the beam, atomic number contrast is produced. However, strong topographic contrast is produced by collecting back-scattered electrons from one side above the specimen using an asymmetrical, directional BSE detector; the resulting contrast appears as illumination of the topography from that side. Semiconductor detectors can be made in radial segments that can be switched in or out to control the type of contrast produced and its directionality.

Backscattered electrons can also be used to form an electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) image that can be used to determine the crystallographic structure of the specimen.

==Beam-injection analysis of semiconductors==
The nature of the SEM&#x27;s probe, energetic electrons, makes it uniquely suited to examining the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor materials. The high-energy electrons from the SEM beam will inject charge carriers into the semiconductor. Thus, beam electrons lose energy by promoting electrons from the valence band into the conduction band, leaving behind holes.

In a direct bandgap material, recombination of these electron-hole pairs will result in cathodoluminescence; if the sample contains an internal electric field, such as is present at a p-n junction, the SEM beam injection of carriers will cause electron beam induced current (EBIC) to flow. Cathodoluminescence and EBIC are referred to as &quot;beam-injection&quot; techniques, and are very powerful probes of the optoelectronic behavior of semiconductors, in particular for studying nanoscale features and defects.

==Cathodoluminescence==
Cathodoluminescence, the emission of light when atoms excited by high-energy electrons return to their ground state, is analogous to UV-induced fluorescence, and some materials such as zinc sulfide and some fluorescent dyes, exhibit both phenomena. Over the last decades, cathodoluminescence was most commonly experienced as the light emission from the inner surface of the cathode-ray tube in television sets and computer CRT monitors. In the SEM, CL detectors either collect all light emitted by the specimen or can analyse the wavelengths emitted by the specimen and display an emission spectrum or an image of the distribution of cathodoluminescence emitted by the specimen in real color.

==X-ray microanalysis==
Characteristic X-rays that are produced by the interaction of electrons with the sample may also be detected in an SEM equipped for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy or wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Analysis of the x-ray signals may be used to map the distribution and estimate the abundance of elements in the sample.

==Resolution of the SEM==

A SEM is not a camera and the detector is not continuously image-forming like a CCD array or film. Unlike in an optical system, the resolution is not limited by the diffraction limit, fineness of lenses or mirrors or detector array resolution. The focusing optics can be large and coarse, and the SE detector is fist-sized and simply detects current. Instead, the spatial resolution of the SEM depends on the size of the electron spot, which in turn depends on both the wavelength of the electrons and the electron-optical system that produces the scanning beam. The resolution is also limited by the size of the interaction volume, the volume of specimen material that interacts with the electron beam. The spot size and the interaction volume are both large compared to the distances between atoms, so the resolution of the SEM is not high enough to image individual atoms, as is possible with a transmission electron microscope (TEM). The SEM has compensating advantages, though, including the ability to image a comparatively large area of the specimen; the ability to image bulk materials (not just thin films or foils); and the variety of analytical modes available for measuring the composition and properties of the specimen. Depending on the instrument, the resolution can fall somewhere between less than 1 nm and 20 nm. As of 2009, The world&#x27;s highest resolution conventional (≤30 kV) SEM can reach a point resolution of 0.4 nm using a secondary electron detector.

==Environmental SEM==

Conventional SEM requires samples to be imaged under vacuum, because a gas atmosphere rapidly spreads and attenuates electron beams. As a consequence, samples that produce a significant amount of vapour, e.g. wet biological samples or oil-bearing rock, must be either dried or cryogenically frozen. Processes involving phase transitions, such as the drying of adhesives or melting of alloys, liquid transport, chemical reactions, and solid-air-gas systems, in general cannot be observed with conventional high-vacuum SEM. In environmental SEM (ESEM), the chamber is evacuated of air, but water vapor is retained near its saturation pressure, and the residual pressure remains relatively high. This allows the analysis of samples containing water or other volatile substances. With ESEM, observations of living insects have been possible.

The first commercial development of the ESEM in the late 1980s allowed samples to be observed in low-pressure gaseous environments (e.g. 1–50 Torr or 0.1–6.7 kPa) and high relative humidity (up to 100%). This was made possible by the development of a secondary-electron detector capable of operating in the presence of water vapour and by the use of pressure-limiting apertures with differential pumping in the path of the electron beam to separate the vacuum region (around the gun and lenses) from the sample chamber. The first commercial ESEMs were produced by the ElectroScan Corporation in USA in 1988. ElectroScan was taken over by Philips (who later sold their electron-optics division to FEI Company) in 1996.

ESEM is especially useful for non-metallic and biological materials because coating with carbon or gold is unnecessary. Uncoated plastics and elastomers can be routinely examined, as can uncoated biological samples. This is useful because coating can be difficult to reverse, may conceal small features on the surface of the sample and may reduce the value of the results obtained. X-ray analysis is difficult with a coating of a heavy metal, so carbon coatings are routinely used in conventional SEMs, but ESEM makes it possible to perform X-ray microanalysis on uncoated non-conductive specimens; however some specific for ESEM artifacts are introduced in X-ray analysis. ESEM may be the preferred for electron microscopy of unique samples from criminal or civil actions, where forensic analysis may need to be repeated by several different experts. It is possible to study specimens in liquid with ESEM or with other liquid-phase electron microscopy methods.

==Transmission SEM==
The SEM can also be used in transmission mode by simply incorporating an appropriate detector below a thin specimen section. Detectors are available for bright field, dark field, as well as segmented detectors for mid-field to high angle annular dark-field. Despite the difference in instrumentation, this technique is still commonly referred to as scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

== SEM in Forensic Science ==
The SEM is used often in Forensic Science for magnified analysis of microscopic things such as diatoms and gunshot residue. Because SEM is a nondestructive force on the sample, it can be used to analyze evidence without damaging it. The SEM shoots a beam of high energy electrons to the sample which bounce off of the sample without changing or destroying it. This is great when it comes to analyzing diatoms. When a person dies by drowning, they inhale the water which causes what is in the water (diatoms) to get in the blood stream, brain, kidneys, and more. These diatoms in the body can be magnified with the SEM to determine the type of diatoms which aid in understanding how and where the person died. By using the images produced by the SEM, forensic scientists can compare diatoms types to confirm the body of water a person died in.

Gunshot residue (GSR) analysis can be done with many different analytical instruments, but SEM is a common way to analyze inorganic compounds because of the way it can closely analyze the types of elements (mostly metals) through its three detectors: backscatter electron detector, secondary electron detector, and X-ray detector. GSR can be collected from the crime scene, victim, or shooter and analyzed with the SEM. This can help scientists determine proximity and or contact with the discharged firearm.

==Color in SEM==
Electron microscopes do not naturally produce color images. A secondary electron detector produces a single value per pixel that corresponds to the number of electrons received by the detector during the short period of time when the beam is targeted to the (x, y) pixel position. For each pixel, this single value is represented by a grey level, forming a monochrome image. However, several methods can used to get color electron microscopy images.

===False color using a single detector===
* On compositional images of flat surfaces (typically BSE):
The easiest way to get color is to replace each grey level with an arbitrary color, using a color look-up table. This method is known as false color imaging and can help to distinguish phases of the sample with similar properties or composition.

* On textured-surface images:
As an alternative to simply replacing each grey level by a color, a sample observed by an oblique beam allows researchers to create an approximative topography image (see further section &quot;Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image&quot;). Such topography can then be processed by 3D-rendering algorithms for a more natural rendering of the surface texture.
===SEM image coloring===
Very often, published SEM images are artificially colored. This may be done for aesthetic effect, to clarify structure or to add a realistic appearance to the sample and generally does not add information about the specimen.

Coloring may be performed manually with photo-editing software, or semi-automatically with dedicated software using feature-detection or object-oriented segmentation.

===Color built using multiple electron detectors===
In some configurations more information is gathered per pixel, often by the use of multiple detectors.

As a common example, secondary electron and backscattered electron detectors are superimposed and a color is assigned to each of the images captured by each detector, with a result of a combined color image where colors are related to the density of the components. This method is known as density-dependent color SEM (DDC-SEM). Micrographs produced by DDC-SEM retain topographical information, which is better captured by the secondary electrons detector and combine it to the information about density, obtained by the backscattered electron detector.

===Analytical signals based on generated photons===
Measurement of the energy of photons emitted from the specimen is a common method to get analytical capabilities. Examples are the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detectors used in elemental analysis and cathodoluminescence microscope (CL) systems that analyse the intensity and spectrum of electron-induced luminescence in (for example) geological specimens. In SEM systems using these detectors it is common to color code these extra signals and superimpose them in a single color image, so that differences in the distribution of the various components of the specimen can be seen clearly and compared. Optionally, the standard secondary electron image can be merged with the one or more compositional channels, so that the specimen&#x27;s structure and composition can be compared. Such images can be made while maintaining the full integrity of the original signal data, which is not modified in any way.

==3D in SEM==
SEMs do not naturally provide 3D images contrary to SPMs. However 3D data can be obtained using an SEM with different methods as follows.

===3D SEM reconstruction from a stereo pair===
* photogrammetry is the most metrologically accurate method to bring the third dimension to SEM images. Contrary to photometric methods (next paragraph), photogrammetry calculates absolute heights using triangulation methods. The drawbacks are that it works only if there is a minimum texture, and it requires two images to be acquired from two different angles, which implies the use of a tilt stage. (Photogrammetry is a software operation that calculates the shift (or &quot;disparity&quot;) for each pixel, between the left image and the right image of the same pair. Such disparity reflects the local height).

===Photometric 3D SEM reconstruction from a four-quadrant detector by &quot;shape from shading&quot;===
This method typically uses a four-quadrant BSE detector (alternatively for one manufacturer, a 3-segment detector). The microscope produces four images of the same specimen at the same time, so no tilt of the sample is required. The method gives metrological 3D dimensions as far as the slope of the specimen remains reasonable. Most SEM manufacturers now (2018) offer such a built-in or optional four-quadrant BSE detector, together with proprietary software to calculate a 3D image in real time.

Other approaches use more sophisticated (and sometimes GPU-intensive) methods like the optimal estimation algorithm and offer much better results at the cost of high demands on computing power.

In all instances, this approach works by integration of the slope, so vertical slopes and overhangs are ignored; for instance, if an entire sphere lies on a flat, little more than the upper hemisphere is seen emerging above the flat, resulting in wrong altitude of the sphere apex. The prominence of this effect depends on the angle of the BSE detectors with respect to the sample, but these detectors are usually situated around (and close to) the electron beam, so this effect is very common.

===Photometric 3D rendering from a single SEM image===
This method requires an SEM image obtained in oblique low angle lighting. The grey-level is then interpreted as the slope, and the slope integrated to restore the specimen topography. This method is interesting for visual enhancement and the detection of the shape and position of objects; however the vertical heights cannot usually be calibrated, contrary to other methods such as photogrammetry.
===Other types of 3D SEM reconstruction===
* Inverse reconstruction using electron-material interactive models
* Multi-Resolution reconstruction using single 2D File: High-quality 3D imaging may be an ultimate solution for revealing the complexities of any porous media, but acquiring them is costly and time-consuming. High-quality 2D SEM images, on the other hand, are widely available. Recently, a novel three-step, multiscale, multiresolution reconstruction method is presented that directly uses 2D images in order to develop 3D models. This method, based on a Shannon Entropy and conditional simulation, can be used for most of the available stationary materials and can build various stochastic 3D models just using a few thin sections.
* Ion-abrasion SEM (IA-SEM) is a method of nanoscale 3D imaging that uses a focused beam of gallium to repeatedly abrade the specimen surface 20 nanometres at a time. Each exposed surface is then scanned to compile a 3D image.

===Applications of 3D SEM===
One possible application is measuring the roughness of ice crystals. This method can combine variable-pressure environmental SEM and the 3D capabilities of the SEM to measure roughness on individual ice crystal facets, convert it into a computer model and run further statistical analysis on the model. Other measurements include fractal dimension, examining fracture surface of metals, characterization of materials, corrosion measurement, and dimensional measurements at the nano scale (step height, volume, angle, flatness, bearing ratio, coplanarity, etc.).

SEM is also used by art conservationists to discern threats to paintings&#x27; surface stability due to aging, such as the formations of complexes of zinc ions with fatty acids. Forensic scientists use SEM to detect art forgeries.

<doc id="28045" wikidata="Q3709182" url="?curid=28045" title="Hijackers in the September 11 attacks">
<text>The aircraft hijackers in the September 11 attacks were 19 men affiliated with jihadist organization al-Qaeda. They hailed from four countries; 15 of them were citizens of Saudi Arabia, two were from the United Arab Emirates, one was from Egypt, and one from Lebanon. To carry out the attacks, the hijackers were organized into four teams each led by a pilot-trained hijacker who would commandeer the flight with three or four &quot;muscle hijackers&quot; who were trained to help subdue the pilots, passengers, and crew. Each team was assigned to a different flight and given a unique target to crash their respective planes into. Mohamed Atta was the assigned ringleader over all four groups.

The first hijackers to arrive in the United States were Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, who settled in San Diego County, California, in January 2000. They were followed by three hijacker-pilots, Hamburg cell members Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah in mid-2000 to undertake flight training at Huffman Aviation flight-training school in Venice, Florida. The fourth hijacker-pilot, Hani Hanjour, who was not a member of the Hamburg Cell, arrived in San Diego in December 2000. The rest of the &quot;muscle hijackers&quot; arrived in early- and mid-2001.

==Selection==
Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi were both experienced and respected jihadists in the eyes of al-Qaeda&#x27;s leader Osama bin Laden.

As for the pilots who would go on to participate in the attacks, three of them were original members of the Hamburg cell (Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah). Following their training at al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan, they were chosen by Bin Laden and al-Qaeda&#x27;s military wing due to their extensive knowledge of western culture and language skills, increasing the mission&#x27;s operational security and its chances for success. Mohamed Atta himself was immediately given command over the planning and execution of the attack upon his arrival in Afghanistan in January 2000. The fourth intended pilot, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, a member of the Hamburg cell, was also chosen to participate in the attacks, but he was unable to obtain a visa for entry into the United States. He was later replaced by Hani Hanjour, a Saudi national.

Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were also potential pilot hijackers but did not do well in their initial pilot lessons in San Diego. Both were kept on as &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers, who would help overpower the passengers and crew and allow the pilot hijackers to take control of the flights. In addition to al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi, 13 other muscle hijackers were selected in late 2000 or early 2001. All were from Saudi Arabia, with the exception of Fayez Banihammad, who was from the United Arab Emirates.

Shortly after the attacks the FBI concluded that the majority of the &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers did not know that they were on a suicide mission, as unlike the pilots they had not prepared last wills and testaments or given other indications that they expected their lives to end. According to an audio recording of Osama Bin Laden from 2001, the &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers were not in contact with the pilot hijackers and were not told the true nature of their mission until the day of the attacks.

===Hijackers===


==Hijacked aircraft==
===American Airlines Flight 11: One World Trade Center, North Tower===
: N.B.: Bold text notes the hijackers who piloted the planes.

Hijackers: Mohamed Atta (Egyptian), Abdulaziz al-Omari (Saudi Arabian), Wail al-Shehri (Saudi Arabian), Waleed al-Shehri (Saudi Arabian), Satam al-Suqami (Saudi Arabian).

Two flight attendants called the American Airlines reservation desk during the hijacking. Betty Ong reported that &quot;the five hijackers had come from first-class seats: 2A, 2B, 9A, 9C and 9B.&quot; Flight attendant Amy Sweeney called a flight services manager at Logan Airport in Boston and described them as Middle Eastern. She gave the staff the seat numbers and they pulled up the ticket and credit card information of the hijackers, identifying Mohamed Atta.

Mohamed Atta&#x27;s voice was heard over the air traffic control system, broadcasting messages thought to be intended for the passengers.

===United Airlines Flight 175: Two World Trade Center, South Tower===
Hijackers: Marwan al-Shehhi (Emirati), Fayez Banihammad (Emirati), Mohand al-Shehri (Saudi Arabian), Hamza al-Ghamdi (Saudi Arabian), Ahmed al-Ghamdi (Saudi Arabian).

A United Airlines mechanic was called by a flight attendant who stated the crew had been murdered and the plane hijacked.

===American Airlines Flight 77: Pentagon===
Hijackers: Hani Hanjour (Saudi Arabian), Khalid al-Mihdhar (Saudi Arabian), Majed Moqed (Saudi Arabian), Nawaf al-Hazmi (Saudi Arabian), Salem al-Hazmi (Saudi Arabian).

Two hijackers, Hani Hanjour and Majed Moqed were identified by clerks as having bought single, first-class tickets for Flight 77 from Advance Travel Service in Totowa, New Jersey with $1,842.25 in cash.

Renee May, a flight attendant on Flight 77, used a cell phone to call her mother in Las Vegas. She said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals who had moved them to the rear of the plane. Unlike the other flights, there was no report of stabbings or bomb threats. According to the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, it is possible that pilots were not stabbed to death and were sent to the rear of the plane. One of the hijackers, most likely Hanjour, announced on the intercom that the flight had been hijacked.
Passenger Barbara Olson called her husband, Theodore Olson, the Solicitor General of the United States, stating the flight had been hijacked and the hijackers had knives and box cutters.

Two of the hijackers had been on the FBI&#x27;s watch list: Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. Al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi flew to Los Angeles in January 2000 and later took flying lessons in San Diego, during which time they were allegedly assisted by Omar al-Bayoumi and Saudi diplomats Fahad al-Thumairy and Mussaed Ahmed al-Jarrah.

===United Airlines Flight 93: Shanksville, Pennsylvania===


Hijackers: Ziad Jarrah (Lebanese), Ahmed al-Haznawi (Saudi Arabian), Ahmed al-Nami (Saudi Arabian), Saeed al-Ghamdi (Saudi Arabian).

Passenger Jeremy Glick stated that the hijackers were Arabic-looking, wearing red headbands, and carrying knives.

Spoken messages (from Jarrah) intended for passengers were mistakenly broadcast over the air traffic control system.

Jarrah is also heard on the cockpit voice recorder. In addition, DNA samples submitted by his girlfriend were matched to remains recovered in Shanksville.

==Investigation==

===Before the attacks===
Before the attacks, FBI agent Robert Wright, Jr. had written vigorous criticisms of FBI&#x27;s alleged incompetence in investigating suspected extremists residing within the United States. Wright was part of the Bureau&#x27;s Chicago counter-terrorism task force and involved in project Vulgar Betrayal, which was linked to Yasin al-Qadi.

According to James Bamford, the NSA had picked up communications of al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi back in 1999, but had been hampered by internal bureaucratic conflicts between itself and the CIA, and did not do a full analysis of the information it passed on to the agency. For example, it only passed on the first names, Nawaf and Khalid.

Bamford also claims that the CIA&#x27;s Alec Station (a unit assigned to bin Laden) knew that al-Mihdhar was planning to come to New York as far back as January 2000. Doug Miller, one of three FBI agents working inside the CIA station, tried to send a message (a CIR) to the FBI to alert them about this, so they could put al-Mihdhar on a . His CIA boss, Tom Wilshire, deputy station chief, allegedly denied permission to Miller. Miller asked his associate Mark Rossini for advice; Rossini pressed Wilshire&#x27;s deputy but was rebuffed also.

Bamford also claims that al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi wound up living with Abdussattar Shaikh for a time to save money. Shaikh was, coincidentally, an FBI informant, but since they never acted suspiciously around him, he never reported them. The CIA Bangkok station told Alec Station that al-Hazmi had gone to Los Angeles. None of this information made it back to the FBI headquarters.

On August 23, 2001, less than three weeks before the attacks, the Mossad gave the American government the names of 19 residents suspected of intending to perpetrate an attack against the United States. Among the names were those of Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Nawaf al-Hazmi. It is not known if the list contained all the names of the hijackers or if the list length itself were a coincidence; only those four have been made known.

===Attacks===

Within minutes of the attacks, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened the largest FBI investigation in United States history, operation PENTTBOM. The suspects were identified within 72 hours because few made any attempt to disguise their names on flight and credit card records. They were also among the few non-US citizens and nearly the only passengers with Arabic names on their flights, enabling the FBI to identify them using such details as dates of birth, known or possible residences, visa status, and specific identification of the suspected pilots. On September 14, three days after the attacks, the FBI announced the names of 19 hijackers, and on September 27, they released photos of the hijackers, along with information about their possible nationalities and aliases. Fifteen of the suspected hijackers hailed from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, and one each from Lebanon and Egypt.

The passport of Satam al-Suqami was reportedly recovered &quot;a few blocks from where the World Trade Center&#x27;s twin towers once stood&quot;; a passerby picked it up and gave it to an NYPD detective shortly before the towers collapsed. The passports of two other hijackers, Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi, were recovered from the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93 in Pennsylvania, and a fourth passport, that of Abdulaziz al-Omari was recovered from luggage that did not make it onto American Airlines Flight 11.

According to the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, 26 al-Qaeda conspirators sought to enter the United States to carry out a suicide mission. In the end, the FBI reported that there were 19 hijackers in all: five on three of the flights, and four on the fourth. After a controversy about an earlier remark, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano stated in May 2009 that the 9/11 Commission found that none of the hijackers entered the United States through Canada.

Nawaf al-Hazmi and Hani Hanjour, attended the Dar al-Hijrah Falls Church, Virginia, Islamic Center where the Imam Anwar al-Awlaki preached, in early April 2001. Through interviews with the FBI, it was discovered that Awlaki had previously met Nawaf al-Hazmi several times while the two lived in San Diego. At the time, al-Hazmi was living with al-Mihdhar. The hijackers of the same plane often had very strong ties as many of them attended school together or lived together prior to the attacks.

===Recovery of the hijackers&#x27; remains===
After the 9/11 attacks, remains of the victims and attackers were recovered from the World Trade Center site, from the Pentagon, and in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.

In New York, the remains of two hijackers, potentially from Flight11, were identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan and turned over to the FBI as evidence. The remains of the other hijackers on Flight 11 and Flight 175 have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at this park.

The remains of the five hijackers on Flight 77 were identified through a process of elimination by October 2, 2001, and were turned over to the FBI as evidence.

For Flight 93, the remains of Ziad Jarrah were identified and turned over to the FBI as evidence after DNA samples submitted by his girlfriend were matched to remains recovered in Shanksville. The rest of the remains of the hijackers were identified by the process of elimination, and were turned over to the FBI as evidence.

==Possible cases of mistaken identity==
Soon after the attacks and before the FBI had released the pictures of all the hijackers, several reports claimed some of the men named as hijackers on 9/11 were alive and had their identities stolen.

<doc id="28046" wikidata="Q5135455" url="?curid=28046" title="Closings and cancellations following the September 11 attacks">
<text>Many closings and cancellations followed the September 11 attacks, including major landmarks, buildings, restrictions on access to Lower Manhattan, as well as postponement or cancellation of major sporting and other events. Landmarks were closed primarily because of fears that they may be attacked. At some places, streets leading up to the institutions were also closed. When they reopened, there was heightened security. Many U.S. states declared a state of emergency.

==Lower Manhattan==

Speaking at a press conference at 11:02 a.m. on the morning of the attacks, Mayor Rudy Giuliani told New Yorkers: &quot;If you are south of Canal Street, get out. Walk slowly and carefully. If you can&#x27;t figure what else to do, just walk north.&quot; The neighborhood was covered in dust and debris, and electrical failures caused traffic light outages. Emergency vehicles were given priority to respond to ongoing fires, building collapses, and expected mass casualties. Over a million workers and residents south of Canal Street were evacuated, and police stopped pedestrians from entering Lower Manhattan. With subways shut down, vehicle traffic restricted, and tunnels closed, they mainly fled on foot, pouring over bridges and ferries to Brooklyn and New Jersey.

On September 12, vehicle traffic was banned south of 14th Street, subway stations south of Canal Street were bypassed, and pedestrians were not permitted below Chambers Street. Vehicle traffic below Canal Street was not allowed until October 13.

The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) did not open on September 11 even as CNBC showed futures numbers early in the day. As Wall Street was covered in debris from the World Trade Center (WTC) and suffered infrastructure damage, it remained closed until September 17.

===Bridges and tunnels===

For at least a full day after the attacks, bridges and tunnels to Manhattan were closed to non-emergency traffic in both directions. Among other things, this interrupted scheduled deliveries of food and other perishables, leading to shortages in restaurants. From September 27, one-occupant cars were banned from crossing into Lower Manhattan from Midtown on weekday mornings in an effort to relieve some of the crush of traffic in the city (the morning rush hour lasts from 5:30 a.m. to noon), caused largely by the increased security measures and closure of major vehicle and transit crossings.

===Mass transit===

====New York City Subway====
The tracks and stations under the World Trade Center were shut down within minutes of the first plane crash. All remaining New York City Subway service was suspended from 10:20 a.m. to 12:48 p.m. Immediately after the attacks and more so after the collapses of the Twin Towers, many trains running in Lower Manhattan lost power and had to be evacuated through the tunnels. Some trains had power but the signals did not, requiring special operating procedures to ensure safety.

The IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, which ran below the World Trade Center between Chambers Street and Rector Street, was the most crippled. This section of the tunnel, including Cortlandt Street station (located directly underneath the World Trade Center), was badly damaged, and had to be rebuilt. Service was immediately suspended south of Chambers Street and then cut back to 14th Street. There was also subsequent flooding on the line south of 34th Street–Penn Station. After the flood was cleaned up, express service was able to resume on September 17 with trains running between Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street and 14th Street, making local stops north of and express stops south of 96th Street, while and trains made all stops in Manhattan (but bypassed all stations between Canal Street and Fulton Street until October 1). 1/9 skip-stop service was suspended.

After a few switching delays at 96th Street, service was changed on September 19. The train resumed local service in Manhattan, but was extended to New Lots Avenue in Brooklyn (switching onto the express tracks at Chambers Street) to replace the 3, which now terminated at 14th Street as an express. The train continued to make local stops in Manhattan and service between Chambers Street and South Ferry as well as skip-stop service remained suspended. Normal service on all four trains was restored September 15, 2002, but Cortlandt Street remained closed until September 8, 2018.

Service on the BMT Broadway Line was also disrupted because the tracks from the Montague Street Tunnel run adjacent to the World Trade Center and there were concerns that train movements could cause unsafe settling of the debris pile. Cortlandt Street station, which sits under Church Street, sustained significant damage in the collapse of the towers. It was closed until September 15, 2002 for removal of debris, structural repairs, and restoration of the track beds, which had suffered flood damage in the aftermath of the collapse. Starting September 17, 2001, and service was suspended and respectively replaced by the (which was extended to Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue via the BMT Montague Street Tunnel, BMT Fourth Avenue Line, and BMT Sea Beach Line) and the (also extended via Fourth Avenue to Bay Ridge–95th Street). In Queens, the replaced the while the replaced the . All service on the BMT Broadway Line ran local north of Canal Street except for the &lt;Q&gt;, which ran normally from 57th Street to Brighton Beach via Broadway and Brighton Express. J/Z skip-stop service was suspended at this time. Normal service on all seven trains resumed on October 28.

The only subway line running between Midtown and Lower Manhattan was the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, which was overcrowded before the attacks and at crush density until the BMT Broadway Line reopened. Wall Street was closed until September 21.

The IND Eighth Avenue Line, which has a stub terminal serving the train under Five World Trade Center, was undamaged, but covered in soot. E trains were extended to Euclid Avenue, Brooklyn, replacing the then suspended train (the and trains replaced it as the local north of 59th Street–Columbus Circle on nights and weekends, respectively. The train, which ran normally from 145th Street or Bedford Park Boulevard to 34th Street–Herald Square via Central Park West Local, also replaced C trains on weekdays). Service was cut back to Canal Street when C service resumed on September 21, but Chambers Street and Broadway–Nassau Street remained closed until October 1. World Trade Center remained closed until January 2002.

There were no reported casualties on the subway or loss of train cars, but a Motor Coach Industries coach bus was destroyed. Another bus was damaged, but was repaired and returned to normal service with a special commemoration livery.

====PATH====
PATH started evacuating passengers from its Manhattan trains and tracks within minutes of the first plane crash. The PATH station at World Trade Center was heavily damaged (a train parked in the station was crushed by debris and was removed during the excavation process in January 2002) and all service there was suspended. For several hours, PATH did not run any trains to Manhattan, but was able to restore service on the Uptown Hudson Tubes to 33rd Street by the afternoon. Exchange Place was unusable since the switch configuration at the time required all trains to continue to World Trade Center. As a result, PATH ran a modified service: Hoboken-Journal Square, Hoboken-33rd Street, and Newark-33rd Street. Exchange Place reopened with modifications on June 29, 2003; a temporary station replacing World Trade Center opened on November 23.

====Ferries====
Liberty Water Taxi and NY Waterway had a ferry terminal at the World Financial Center. As the area around the terminal was in the restricted zone, NY Waterway suspended service to the terminal with alternate service going to Midtown and Wall Street and Liberty Water Taxi service was suspended. Free ad-hoc ferry service to New Jersey, Brooklyn, and Queens began by evening, with about half a million evacuees transported by Circle Line Tours, NY Waterway, privately owned dining boats, tug boats, and at least one fire boat.

====Buses====
Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses were temporarily suspended south of Canal Street, and MTA and NJ Transit buses were re-routed to serve passengers arriving in Brooklyn and New Jersey by walking and taking ferries out of Manhattan.

====Intercity transit====
The Port Authority Bus Terminal was closed until September 13. Amtrak suspended all of its rail service nationwide until 6pm. Greyhound Bus Lines cancelled its bus service in the Northeast, but was running normally by September 13.

==North American airspace==

The entire airspaces of the United States and Canada were closed (&quot;ground stop&quot;) by order of FAA National Operations Manager Ben Sliney (who was working his first day in that position) except for military, police, and medical flights. The unprecedented implementation of Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids (SCATANA) was the first unplanned closure in the U.S.; military exercises known as Operation Skyshield had temporarily closed the airspace in the early 1960s. Domestic planes were diverted to the nearest available airport. All non-military flights needed specific approval from the United States Air Force and the FAA. There were only a few dozen private aircraft which received approvals in that time period. Civil Air Patrol&#x27;s aerial photography unit was the earliest non-military flight granted approval. United Airlines cancelled all flights worldwide temporarily. Grounded passengers and planes were searched for security threats. Amtrak was closed until 6 p.m. on September 11, but by September 13 it had increased its capacity by 30% to deal with an influx of stranded plane passengers. President George W. Bush was transported to a secure location via Air Force One.

Many incoming international flights were diverted to Atlantic Canada to avoid proximity to potential targets in the United States and large cities in Canada. Some international flights that departed from South America were diverted to Mexico; however, its airspace was not shut down. On Thursday night, the New York area airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark) were closed again and reopened the next morning. The only traffic from LaGuardia during the closure was a single C-9C government VIP jet, departing at approximately 5:15 p.m. on the 12th.

Civilian air traffic was allowed to resume on September 13, with stricter airport security checks, disallowing for example the box cutting knives that were used by the hijackers. (Reinforcement of cockpit doors began in October 2001, and was required for larger airlines by 2003.) First, stranded planes were allowed to fly to their intended destinations, then limited service resumed. The backlog of delayed passengers took several days to clear.

Due to a translation error, controllers believed Korean Air Flight 85 might have been hijacked. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and U.S. authorities ordered the United States Air Force to surround the plane and force it to land in Whitehorse, Yukon and to shoot down the plane if the pilots did not cooperate. Alaska Governor Tony Knowles ordered the evacuation of large hotels and government buildings in Anchorage. Also in Alaska at nearby Valdez, the U.S. Coast Guard ordered all tankers filling up with oil to head out to sea. Canadian officials evacuated all schools and large buildings in Whitehorse before the plane landed safely.

==Precautionary building closings and evacuations==
Many businesses across the United States closed after the intentional nature of the events became clear, and many national landmarks and financial district skyscrapers were evacuated out of fear of further attacks.

==Government and cultural cancellations and postponements==
In an atmosphere reminiscent of the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963, everyday life in many places around the world came to a standstill in the days after the September 11 attacks. For this reason, as well as for reasons of perceived threat associated with large gatherings, many events were postponed or cancelled. Other events were also cancelled, postponed, or modified:
*Voting on September 11 in the New York City mayoral primary was halted. Elections in Syracuse and Buffalo, New York were also delayed.
*The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), with the Heads of Government of the Commonwealth of Nations to be held in Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, Australia, was postponed. The organizers of the meeting claimed it was not so much a fear of terrorist attack on the meeting itself, but a desire by many Commonwealth leaders to stay at home in case of any further crisis-making world events (such as the commencement of overt military action in Afghanistan or elsewhere). The CHOGM was eventually convened at Coolum Beach, Queensland.
*The Mexican Independence Parade scheduled for September 16 in Mexico City was delayed one day in a show of compassion; many other independence celebrations were held on the 16th without fireworks.
*Clothing retailer Abercrombie &amp; Fitch canceled its Christmas 2001 issue of &quot;A&amp;F Quarterly&quot; because the company felt the tone of the publication was not suitable for the mood at that time.
