<text>Søren Aabye Kierkegaard ( , ; ; 5 May 1813 – 11 November 1855) was a Danish theologian, philosopher, poet, social critic, and religious author who is widely considered to be the first Christian existentialist philosopher. He wrote critical texts on organized religion, Christianity, morality, ethics, psychology, and the philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony, and parables. Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as a &quot;single individual&quot;, giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment.

Kierkegaard&#x27;s theological work focuses on Christian ethics, the institution of the Church, the differences between purely objective proofs of Christianity, the infinite qualitative distinction between man and God, and the individual&#x27;s subjective relationship to the God-Man Jesus the Christ, which came through faith. Much of his work deals with Christian love. He was extremely critical of the doctrine and practice of Christianity as a state-controlled religion (Caesaropapism) like the Church of Denmark. His psychological work explored the emotions and feelings of individuals when faced with life choices. Unlike Jean-Paul Sartre and the atheistic existentialism paradigm, Kierkegaard focused on Christian existentialism.

Kierkegaard&#x27;s early work was written using pseudonyms to present distinctive viewpoints interacting in complex dialogue. He explored particularly complex problems from different viewpoints, each under a different pseudonym. He wrote &quot;Upbuilding Discourses&quot; under his own name and dedicated them to the &quot;single individual&quot; who might want to discover the meaning of his works. He wrote: &quot;Science and scholarship want to teach that becoming objective is the way. Christianity teaches that the way is to become subjective, to become a subject.&quot; While scientists learn about the world by observation, Kierkegaard emphatically denied that observation alone could reveal the inner workings of the world of the spirit.

Some of Kierkegaard&#x27;s key ideas include the concept of &quot;subjective and objective truths&quot;, the knight of faith, the recollection and repetition dichotomy, angst, the infinite qualitative distinction, faith as a passion, and the three stages on life&#x27;s way. Kierkegaard wrote in Danish and the reception of his work was initially limited to Scandinavia, but by the turn of the 20th century his writings were translated into French, German, and other major European languages. By the mid-20th century, his thought exerted a substantial influence on philosophy, theology, and Western culture in general.

==Early years (1813–1836)==

Kierkegaard was born to an affluent family in Copenhagen. His mother, Ane Sørensdatter Lund Kierkegaard (1768–1834), had served as a maid in the household before marrying his father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard (1756–1838). She was an unassuming figure: quiet, and not formally educated. They had seven children. Her granddaughter, Henriette Lund, wrote that she &quot;wielded the sceptre with joy and protected [Søren and Peter] like a hen protecting her chicks&quot;. She also wielded influence on her children so that later Peter Christian Kierkegaard said that his brother preserved many of their mother&#x27;s words in his writings. His father, on the other hand, was a well-to-do wool merchant from Jutland. He was a &quot;very stern man, to all appearances dry and prosaic, but under his &#x27;rustic cloak&#x27; demeanor he concealed an active imagination which not even his great age could blunt&quot;. He was also interested in philosophy and often hosted intellectuals at his home. He was devoted to the rationalist philosophy of Christian Wolff, and he eventually retired partly to pursue more of Wolff&#x27;s writings. Kierkegaard, who followed his father&#x27;s beliefs as a child, was heavily influenced by Michael&#x27;s devotion to Wolffian rationalism. He also enjoyed the comedies of Ludvig Holberg, the writings of Johann Georg Hamann, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Edward Young, and Plato. The figure of Socrates, whom Kierkegaard encountered in Plato&#x27;s dialogues, would prove to be a phenomenal influence on the philosopher&#x27;s later interest in irony, as well as his frequent deployment of indirect communication.

Kierkegaard loved to walk along the crooked streets of 19th century Copenhagen, where carriages rarely went. In 1848, Kierkegaard wrote, &quot;I had real Christian satisfaction in the thought that, if there were no other, there was definitely one man in Copenhagen whom every poor person could freely accost and converse with on the street; that, if there were no other, there was one man who, whatever the society he most commonly frequented, did not shun contact with the poor, but greeted every maidservant he was acquainted with, every manservant, every common laborer.&quot; Our Lady&#x27;s Church was at one end of the city, where Bishop Mynster preached the Gospel. At the other end was the Royal Theatre where Fru Heiberg performed.
Based on a speculative interpretation of anecdotes in Kierkegaard&#x27;s unpublished journals, especially a rough draft of a story called &quot;The Great Earthquake&quot;, some early Kierkegaard scholars argued that Michael believed he had earned God&#x27;s wrath and that none of his children would outlive him. He is said to have believed that his personal sins, perhaps indiscretions such as cursing the name of God in his youth or impregnating Ane out of wedlock, necessitated this punishment. Though five of his seven children died before he did, both Søren and his brother Peter outlived him. Peter, who was seven years older, later became bishop in Aalborg. Julia Watkin thought Michael&#x27;s early interest in the Moravian Church could have led him to a deep sense of the devastating effects of sin.

From 1821 to 1830, Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue, Østre Borgerdyd Gymnasium when the school was situated in Klarebodeme, where Kierkegaard studied and learned Latin, Greek and history among other subjects. During his time there he was described as &quot;very conservative&quot;; someone who would &quot;honour the King, love the church and respect the police&quot;. He frequently got into altercations with fellow students and was ambivalent towards his teachers. He went on to study theology at the University of Copenhagen. He had little interest in historical works, philosophy dissatisfied him, and he couldn&#x27;t see &quot;dedicating himself to Speculation&quot;. He said, &quot;What I really need to do is to get clear about &quot;what am I to do&quot;, not what I must know.&quot; He wanted to &quot;lead a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge&quot;. Kierkegaard didn&#x27;t want to be a philosopher in the traditional or Hegelian sense and he didn&#x27;t want to preach a Christianity that was an illusion. &quot;But he had learned from his father that one can do what one wills, and his father&#x27;s life had not discredited this theory.&quot;

One of the first physical descriptions of Kierkegaard comes from an attendee, Hans Brøchner, at his brother Peter&#x27;s wedding party in 1836: &quot;I found [his appearance] almost comical. He was then twenty-three years old; he had something quite irregular in his entire form and had a strange coiffure. His hair rose almost six inches above his forehead into a tousled crest that gave him a strange, bewildered look.&quot; Another comes from Kierkegaard&#x27;s niece, Henriette Lund (1829–1909). When Søren Kierkegaard was a little boy he &quot;was of slender and delicate appearance, and ran about in a little coat of red-cabbage color. He used to be called &#x27;fork&#x27; by his father, because of his tendency, developed quite early, toward satirical remarks. Although a serious, almost austere tone pervaded the Kierkegaards&#x27; house, I have the firm impression that there was a place for youthful vivacity too, even though of a more sedate and home-made kind than one is used to nowadays. The house was open for an &#x27;old-fashioned hospitality he was also described &quot;quaintly attired, slight and small&quot;.

Kierkegaard&#x27;s mother &quot;was a nice little woman with an even and happy disposition,&quot; according to a grandchild&#x27;s description. She was never mentioned in Kierkegaard&#x27;s works. Ane died on 31 July 1834, age 66, possibly from typhus. His father died on 8 August 1838, age 82. On 11 August, Kierkegaard wrote: &quot;My father died on Wednesday (the 8th) at 2:00 a.m. I so deeply desired that he might have lived a few years more... Right now I feel there is only one person (E. Boesen) with whom I can really talk about him. He was a &#x27;faithful friend. Troels Frederik Lund, his nephew, was instrumental in providing biographers with much information regarding Søren Kierkegaard. Lund was a good friend of Georg Brandes and Julius Lange. Here is an anecdote about his father from Kierkegaard&#x27;s journals. 

===Journals===
According to Samuel Hugo Bergmann, &quot;Kierkegaard&#x27;s journals are one of the most important sources for an understanding of his philosophy&quot;. Kierkegaard wrote over 7,000 pages in his journals on events, musings, thoughts about his works and everyday remarks. The entire collection of Danish journals (&quot;&quot;) was edited and published in 13 volumes consisting of 25 separate bindings including indices. The first English edition of the journals was edited by Alexander Dru in 1938. The style is &quot;literary and poetic [in] manner&quot;.

Kierkegaard wanted to have Regine, his fiancée (see below), as his confidant but considered it an impossibility for that to happen so he left it to &quot;&quot;my reader&quot;, that single individual&quot; to become his confidant. His question was whether or not one can have a spiritual confidant. He wrote the following in his &quot;Concluding Postscript&quot;: &quot;With regard to the essential truth, a direct relation between spirit and spirit is unthinkable. If such a relation is assumed, it actually means that the party has ceased to be spirit.&quot;

Kierkegaard&#x27;s journals were the source of many aphorisms credited to the philosopher. The following passage, from 1 August 1835, is perhaps his most oft-quoted aphorism and a key quote for existentialist studies:
He wrote this way about indirect communication in the same journal entry:
One must first learn to know himself before knowing anything else (γνῶθι σεαυτόν). Not until a man has inwardly understood himself and then sees the course he is to take does his life gain peace and meaning; only then is he free of that irksome, sinister traveling companion—that irony of life, which manifests itself in the sphere of knowledge and invites true knowing to begin with a not-knowing (Socrates) just as God created the world from nothing. But in the waters of morality it is especially at home to those who still have not entered the tradewinds of virtue. Here it tumbles a person about in a horrible way, for a time lets him feel happy and content in his resolve to go ahead along the right path, then hurls him into the abyss of despair. Often it lulls a man to sleep with the thought, &quot;After all, things cannot be otherwise,&quot; only to awaken him suddenly to a rigorous interrogation. Frequently it seems to let a veil of forgetfulness fall over the past, only to make every single trifle appear in a strong light again. When he struggles along the right path, rejoicing in having overcome temptation&#x27;s power, there may come at almost the same time, right on the heels of perfect victory, an apparently insignificant external circumstance which pushes him down, like Sisyphus, from the height of the crag. Often when a person has concentrated on something, a minor external circumstance arises which destroys everything. (As in the case of a man who, weary of life, is about to throw himself into the Thames and at the crucial moment is halted by the sting of a mosquito.) Frequently a person feels his very best when the illness is the worst, as in tuberculosis. In vain he tries to resist it but he has not sufficient strength, and it is no help to him that he has gone through the same thing many times; the kind of practice acquired in this way does not apply here.
* (Søren Kierkegaard&#x27;s Journals &amp; Papers IA Gilleleie, 1 August 1835)

Although his journals clarify some aspects of his work and life, Kierkegaard took care not to reveal too much. Abrupt changes in thought, repetitive writing, and unusual turns of phrase are some among the many tactics he used to throw readers off track. Consequently, there are many varying interpretations of his journals. Kierkegaard did not doubt the importance his journals would have in the future. In December 1849, he wrote: &quot;Were I to die now the effect of my life would be exceptional; much of what I have simply jotted down carelessly in the Journals would become of great importance and have a great effect; for then people would have grown reconciled to me and would be able to grant me what was, and is, my right.&quot;

===Regine Olsen and graduation (1837–1841)===
An important aspect of Kierkegaard&#x27;s life – generally considered to have had a major influence on his work — was his broken engagement to Regine Olsen (1822–1904).

Kierkegaard and Olsen met on 8 May 1837 and were instantly attracted to each other. In his journals, Kierkegaard wrote idealistically about his love for her. After passing his theological examinations in July 1840, Kierkegaard formally proposed to Olsen on 8 September. He soon felt disillusioned about his prospects. He broke off the engagement on 11 August 1841, though it is generally believed that the two were deeply in love. In his journals, Kierkegaard mentions his belief that his &quot;melancholy&quot; made him unsuitable for marriage, but his precise motive for ending the engagement remains unclear.

It was also during this period that Kierkegaard dedicated himself to authoring a dissertation. Upon submitting it in June 1841, a panel of faculty judged that his work demonstrated considerable intellect while criticizing its informal tone; however, Kierkegaard was granted permission to proceed with its defense. He defended &quot;On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates&quot; over seven and a half hours on 29 September 1841. As the title suggests, the thesis dealt with irony and Socrates; the influence of Kierkegaard&#x27;s friend Poul Martin Møller, who had died in 1838, is evident in the subject matter. Kierkegaard graduated from the University of Copenhagen on 20 October 1841 with a degree in philosophy. His inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler enabled him to fund his work and living expenses.

==Authorship (1843–1846)==
Kierkegaard published some of his works using pseudonyms and for others he signed his own name as author. Whether being published under pseudonym or not, Kierkegaard&#x27;s central writing on religion was &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;, and &quot;Either/Or&quot; is considered to be his magnum opus. Pseudonyms were used often in the early 19th century as a means of representing viewpoints other than the author&#x27;s own. Kierkegaard employed the same technique as a way to provide examples of indirect communication. In writing under various pseudonyms to express sometimes contradictory positions, Kierkegaard is sometimes criticized for playing with various viewpoints without ever committing to one in particular. He has been described by those opposing his writings as indeterminate in his standpoint as a writer, though he himself has testified to all his work deriving from a service to Christianity. After &quot;On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates&quot;, his 1841 PhD dissertation under , he wrote his first book under the pseudonym &quot;Johannes Climacus&quot; (after John Climacus) between 1841 and 1842. &quot;De omnibus dubitandum est&quot; (Latin: &quot;Everything must be doubted&quot;) was not published until after his death.

Kierkegaard&#x27;s magnum opus &quot;Either/Or&quot; was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard&#x27;s stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Revelation&quot;. &quot;Either/Or&quot; includes essays of literary and music criticism and a set of romantic-like aphorisms, as part of his larger theme of examining the reflective and philosophical structure of faith. Edited by &quot;Victor Eremita&quot;, the book contained the papers of an unknown &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; which the pseudonymous author claimed to have discovered in a secret drawer of his secretary. Eremita had a hard time putting the papers of &quot;A&quot; in order because they were not straightforward. &quot;Bs papers were arranged in an orderly fashion. Both of these characters are trying to become religious individuals. Each approached the idea of first love from an aesthetic and an ethical point of view. The book is basically an argument about faith and marriage with a short discourse at the end telling them they should stop arguing. Eremita thinks &quot;B&quot;, a judge, makes the most sense. Kierkegaard stressed the &quot;how&quot; of Christianity as well as the &quot;how&quot; of book reading in his works rather than the &quot;what&quot;.

Three months after the publication of &quot;Either/Or&quot;, 16 May 1843, he published &quot;Two Upbuilding Discourses, 1843&quot; and continued to publish discourses along with his pseudonymous books. These discourses were published under Kierkegaard&#x27;s own name and are available as &quot;Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses&quot; today. David F. Swenson first translated the works in the 1940s and titled them the &quot;Edifying Discourses&quot;; however, in 1990, Howard V. and Edna H. Hong translated the works again but called them the &quot;Upbuilding Discourses&quot;. The word &quot;upbuilding&quot; was more in line with Kierkegaard&#x27;s thought after 1846, when he wrote Christian deliberations about Works of Love. An upbuilding discourse or edifying discourse isn&#x27;t the same as a sermon because a sermon is preached to a congregation while a discourse can be carried on between several people or even with oneself. The discourse or conversation should be &quot;upbuilding&quot;, which means one would build up the other person, or oneself, rather than tear down to build up. Kierkegaard said: &quot;Although this little book (which is called &#x27;discourses&#x27;, not sermons, because its author does not have authority to &quot;preach&quot;, &#x27;upbuilding discourses&#x27;, not discourses for upbuilding, because the speaker by no means claims to be a &quot;teacher&quot;) wishes to be only what it is, a , and desires only to remain in hiding&quot;.

On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard published three more books about love and faith and several more discourses. &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. &quot;Repetition&quot; is about a Young Man (Søren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love for a girl (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries to see if the new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published &quot;Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843&quot; under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard&#x27;s method of indirect communication.

Kierkegaard questioned whether an individual can know if something is a good gift from God or not and concludes by saying, &quot;it does not depend, then, merely upon what one sees, but what one sees depends upon &quot;how&quot; one sees; all observation is not just a receiving, a discovering, but also a bringing forth, and insofar as it is that, how the observer himself is constituted is indeed decisive.&quot; God&#x27;s love is imparted indirectly just as our own sometimes is.

During 1844, he published two, three, and four more upbuilding discourses just as he did in 1843, but here he discussed how an individual might come to know God. Theologians, philosophers and historians were all engaged in debating about the existence of God. This is direct communication and Kierkegaard thinks this might be useful for theologians, philosophers, and historians (associations) but not at all useful for the &quot;single individual&quot; who is interested in becoming a Christian. Kierkegaard always wrote for &quot;that single individual whom I with joy and gratitude call &quot;my&quot; reader&quot;; the single individual must put what is understood to use or it will be lost. Reflection can take an individual only so far before the imagination begins to change the whole content of what was being thought about. Love is won by being exercised just as much as faith and patience are.

He also wrote several more pseudonymous books in 1844: &quot;Philosophical Fragments&quot;, &quot;Prefaces&quot; and &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot; and finished the year up with &quot;Four Upbuilding Discourses, 1844&quot;. He used indirect communication in the first book and direct communication in the rest of them. He doesn&#x27;t believe the question about God&#x27;s existence should be an opinion held by one group and differently by another no matter how many demonstrations are made. He says it&#x27;s up to the single individual to make the fruit of the Holy Spirit real because love and joy are always just possibilities. Christendom wanted to define God&#x27;s attributes once and for all but Kierkegaard was against this. His love for Regine was a disaster but it helped him because of his point of view.

Kierkegaard believed &quot;each generation has its own task and need not trouble itself unduly by being everything to previous and succeeding generations&quot;. In an earlier book he had said, &quot;to a certain degree every generation and every individual begins his life from the beginning&quot;, and in another, &quot;no generation has learned to love from another, no generation is able to begin at any other point than the beginning&quot;, &quot;no generation learns the essentially human from a previous one.&quot; And, finally, in 1850 he wrote, &quot;those true Christians who in every generation live a life contemporaneous with that of Christ have nothing whatsoever to do with Christians of the preceding generation, but all the more with their contemporary, Christ. His life here on earth attends every generation, and every generation severally, as Sacred History...&quot; But in 1848, &quot;The whole generation and every individual in the generation is a participant in one&#x27;s having faith.&quot;

He was against the Hegelian idea of mediation because it introduces a &quot;third term&quot; that comes between the single individual and the object of desire. Kierkegaard wrote in 1844, &#x27;If a person can be assured of the grace of God without needing temporal evidence as a middleman or as the dispensation advantageous to him as interpreter, then it is indeed obvious to him that the grace of God is the most glorious of all.&quot; He was against mediation and settled instead on the choice to be content with the grace of God or not. It&#x27;s the choice between the possibility of the &quot;temporal and the eternal&quot;, &quot;mistrust and belief, and deception and truth&quot;, &quot;subjective and objective&quot;. These are the &quot;magnitudes&quot; of choice. He always stressed deliberation and choice in his writings and wrote against comparison. This is how Kant put it in 1786 and Kierkegaard put it in 1847: 

===The Inwardness of Christianity===
Kierkegaard believed God comes to each individual mysteriously. He published &quot;Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions&quot; (first called &quot;Thoughts on Crucial Situations in Human Life&quot;, in David F. Swenson&#x27;s 1941 translation) under his own name on 29 April, and &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot; edited by Hilarius Bookbinder, 30 April 1845. The &quot;Stages&quot; is a sequel to &quot;Either/Or&quot; which Kierkegaard did not think had been adequately read by the public and in &quot;Stages&quot; he predicted &quot;that two-thirds of the book&#x27;s readers will quit before they are halfway through, out of boredom they will throw the book away.&quot; He knew he was writing books but had no idea who was reading them. His sales were meager and he had no publicist or editor. He was writing in the dark, so to speak. Many of his readers have been and continue to be in the dark about his intentions. He explained himself in his &quot;Journal&quot;: &quot;What I have understood as the task of the authorship has been done. It is one idea, this continuity from &quot;Either/Or&quot; to Anti-Climacus, the idea of religiousness in reflection. The task has occupied me totally, for it has occupied me religiously; I have understood the completion of this authorship as my duty, as a responsibility resting upon me.&quot; He advised his reader to read his books slowly and also to read them aloud since that might aid in understanding.

He used indirect communication in his writings by, for instance, referring to the religious person as the &quot;knight of hidden inwardness&quot; in which he&#x27;s different from everyone else, even though he looks like everyone else, because everything is hidden within him. He put it this way in 1847: &quot;You are indistinguishable from anyone else among those whom you might wish to resemble, those who in the decision are with the good—they are all clothed alike, girdled about the loins with truth, clad in the armor of righteousness, wearing the helmet of salvation!&quot;

Kierkegaard was aware of the hidden depths inside of each single individual. The hidden inwardness is inventive in deceiving or evading others. Much of it is afraid of being seen and entirely disclosed. &quot;Therefore all calm and, in the intellectual sense, dispassionate observers, who eminently know how to delve searchingly and penetratingly into the inner being, these very people judge with such infinite caution or refrain from it entirely because, enriched by observation, they have a developed conception of the enigmatic world of the hidden, and because as observers they have learned to rule over their passions. Only superficial, impetuous passionate people, who do not understand themselves and for that reason naturally are unaware that they do not know others, judge precipitously. Those with insight, those who know never do this.&quot;

Kierkegaard imagined hidden inwardness several ways in 1848. Imagine hidden in a very plain setting a secret chest in which the most precious is placed—there is a spring that must be pressed, but the spring is concealed, and the pressure must be of a certain force so that an accidental pressure cannot be sufficient. The hope of eternity is concealed within a person&#x27;s innermost being in the same way, and hardship is the pressure. When the pressure is put on the concealed spring, and forcefully enough, the content appears in all its glory! Søren Kierkegaard Christian Discourses 1848 Hong 1997 p. 111Imagine a kernel of grain placed in the earth; if it is to grow, what does it need? First of all space; it must have space. Next, pressure; there must also be pressure—sprouting is making space for itself in opposition. Eternity&#x27;s hope is placed in a person&#x27;s innermost being in the same way. But hardship makes space by setting everything else aside, everything provisional, which is brought to despair; thus hardship&#x27;s pressure is what draws forth! Søren Kierkegaard Christian Discourses 1848 Hong 1997 pp. 111–112 Imagine, as indeed is the case, an animal that has a defense weapon with which it defends itself but which it uses only in mortal danger. Eternity&#x27;s hope is in a person&#x27;s innermost being in the same way; hardship is the mortal danger. Imagine a creeping animal that nevertheless has wings that it can use when it is brought to an extremity, but for everyday use it does not find it worth the trouble to use them. Eternity&#x27;s hope is in a person&#x27;s innermost being in the same way; he has wings but he must be brought to an extremity in order to discover them, or in order to develop them, or in order to use them! Søren Kierkegaard Christian Discourses 1848 Hong 1997 p. 112

He was writing about the subjective inward nature of God&#x27;s encounter with the individual in many of his books, and his goal was to get the single individual away from all the speculation that was going on about God and Christ. Speculation creates quantities of ways to find God and his Goods but finding faith in Christ and putting the understanding to use stops all speculation, because then one begins to actually exist as a Christian, or in an ethical/religious way. He was against an individual waiting until certain of God&#x27;s love and salvation before beginning to try to become a Christian. He defined this as a &quot;special type of religious conflict the Germans call &quot;Anfechtung&quot;&quot; (contesting or disputing).

In Kierkegaard&#x27;s view, the Church should not try to prove Christianity or even defend it. It should help the single individual to make a leap of faith, the faith that God is love and has a task for that very same single individual. He wrote the following about fear and trembling and love as early as 1839, &quot;Fear and trembling is not the &quot;primus motor&quot; in the Christian life, for it is love; but it is what the oscillating balance wheel is to the clock—it is the oscillating balance wheel of the Christian life.&quot; Kierkegaard identified the leap of faith as the good resolution. Kierkegaard discussed the knight of faith in &quot;Works of Love&quot;, 1847 by using the story of Jesus healing the bleeding woman who showed the &quot; originality of faith&quot; by believing that if she touched Jesus&#x27; robe she would be healed. She kept that secret within herself. If doubt is the beginning, then God is lost long before the end, and the individual is released from always having a task, but also from always having the comfort that there is always a task. But if the consciousness of guilt is the beginning, then the beginning of doubt is rendered impossible, and then the joy is that there is always a task. The joy, then, is that it is eternally certain that God is love; more specifically understood, the joy is that there is always a task. As long as there is life there is hope, but as long as there is a task there is life, and as long as there is life there is hope—indeed, the task itself is not merely a hope for a future time but is a joyful present. Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&quot;, Hong pp. 277, 279–280
Kierkegaard wrote his &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments&quot; in 1846 and here he tried to explain the intent of the first part of his authorship. He said, &quot;Christianity will not be content to be an evolution within the total category of human nature; an engagement such as that is too little to offer to a god. Neither does it even want to be the paradox for the believer, and then surreptitiously, little by little, provide him with understanding, because the martyrdom of faith (to crucify one&#x27;s understanding) is not a martyrdom of the moment, but the martyrdom of continuance.&quot; The second part of his authorship was summed up in &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;:

Early Kierkegaardian scholars, such as Theodor W. Adorno and Thomas Henry Croxall, argue that the entire authorship should be treated as Kierkegaard&#x27;s own personal and religious views. This view leads to confusions and contradictions which make Kierkegaard appear philosophically incoherent. Later scholars, such as the post-structuralists, interpreted Kierkegaard&#x27;s work by attributing the pseudonymous texts to their respective authors. Postmodern Christians present a different interpretation of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works. Kierkegaard used the category of &quot;The Individual&quot; to stop the endless &quot;Either/Or&quot;.

* Anti-Climacus, author of &quot;The Sickness unto Death&quot; and &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;

Kierkegaard explained his pseudonyms this way in &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript&quot;:

All of these writings analyze the concept of faith, on the supposition that if people are confused about faith, as Kierkegaard thought the inhabitants of Christendom were, they will not be in a position to develop the virtue. Faith is a matter of reflection in the sense that one cannot have the virtue unless one has the concept of virtue—or at any rate the concepts that govern faith&#x27;s understanding of self, world, and God.

===The &quot;Corsair&quot; affair===

On 22 December 1845, Peder Ludvig Møller, who studied at the University of Copenhagen at the same time as Kierkegaard, published an article indirectly criticizing &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot;. The article complimented Kierkegaard for his wit and intellect, but questioned whether he would ever be able to master his talent and write coherent, complete works. Møller was also a contributor to and editor of &quot;The Corsair&quot;, a Danish satirical paper that lampooned everyone of notable standing. Kierkegaard published a sarcastic response, charging that Møller&#x27;s article was merely an attempt to impress Copenhagen&#x27;s literary elite.

Kierkegaard wrote two small pieces in response to Møller, &quot;The Activity of a Traveling Esthetician&quot; and &quot;Dialectical Result of a Literary Police Action&quot;. The former focused on insulting Møller&#x27;s integrity while the latter was a directed assault on &quot;The Corsair&quot;, in which Kierkegaard, after criticizing the journalistic quality and reputation of the paper, openly asked &quot;The Corsair&quot; to satirize him.

Kierkegaard&#x27;s response earned him the ire of the paper and its second editor, also an intellectual of Kierkegaard&#x27;s own age, Meïr Aron Goldschmidt. Over the next few months, &quot;The Corsair&quot; took Kierkegaard up on his offer to &quot;be abused&quot;, and unleashed a series of attacks making fun of Kierkegaard&#x27;s appearance, voice and habits. For months, Kierkegaard perceived himself to be the victim of harassment on the streets of Denmark. In a journal entry dated 9 March 1846, Kierkegaard made a long, detailed explanation of his attack on Møller and &quot;The Corsair&quot;, and also explained that this attack made him rethink his strategy of indirect communication.

There had been much discussion in Denmark about the pseudonymous authors until the publication of &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments&quot;, 27 February 1846, where he openly admitted to be the author of the books because people began wondering if he was, in fact, a Christian or not. Several Journal entries from that year shed some light on what Kierkegaard hoped to achieve. This book was published under an earlier pseudonym, Johannes Climacus. On 30 March 1846 he published &quot;Two Ages: A Literary Review&quot;, under his own name. A critique of the novel &quot;Two Ages&quot; (in some translations &quot;Two Generations&quot;) written by Thomasine Christine Gyllembourg-Ehrensvärd, Kierkegaard made several insightful observations on what he considered the nature of modernity and its passionless attitude towards life. Kierkegaard writes that &quot;the present age is essentially a sensible age, devoid of passion ... The trend today is in the direction of mathematical equality, so that in all classes about so and so many uniformly make one individual&quot;. In this, Kierkegaard attacked the conformity and assimilation of individuals into &quot;the crowd&quot; which became the standard for truth, since it was the numerical. How can one love the neighbor if the neighbor is always regarded as the wealthy or the poor or the lame?

As part of his analysis of the &quot;crowd&quot;, Kierkegaard accused newspapers of decay and decadence. Kierkegaard stated Christendom had &quot;lost its way&quot; by recognizing &quot;the crowd&quot;, as the many who are moved by newspaper stories, as the court of last resort in relation to &quot;the truth&quot;. Truth comes to a single individual, not all people at one and the same time. Just as truth comes to one individual at a time so does love. One doesn&#x27;t love the crowd but does love their neighbor, who is a single individual. He says, &quot;never have I read in the Holy Scriptures this command: You shall love the crowd; even less: You shall, ethico-religiously, recognize in the crowd the court of last resort in relation to &#x27;the truth.

==Authorship (1847–1855)==
Kierkegaard began to publish under his own name again in 1847: the three-part &quot;Edifying Discourses in Diverse Spirits&quot;. It included &quot;Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing&quot;, &quot;What we Learn from the Lilies in the Field and from the Birds in the Air&quot;, and &quot;The Gospel of Sufferings&quot;. He asked, What does it mean to be a single individual who wants to do the good? What does it mean to be a human being? What does it mean to follow Christ? He now moves from &quot;upbuilding (Edifying) discourses&quot; to &quot; discourses&quot;, however, he still maintains that these are not &quot;sermons&quot;. A sermon is about struggle with oneself about the tasks life offers one and about repentance for not completing the tasks. Later, in 1849, he wrote discourses and Godly discourses.Is it really hopelessness to reject the task because it is too heavy; is it really hopelessness almost to collapse under the burden because it is so heavy; is it really hopelessness to give up hope out of fear of the task? Oh no, but this is hopelessness: to will with all one&#x27;s might—but there is no task. Thus, only if there is nothing to do and if the person who says it were without guilt before God—for if he is guilty, there is indeed always something to do—only if there is nothing to do and this is understood to mean that there is no task, only then is there hopelessness. &quot;Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits&quot;, Hong p. 277

&quot;Works of Love&quot; followed these discourses on (29 September 1847). Both books were authored under his own name. It was written under the themes &quot;Love covers a multitude of sins&quot; and &quot;Love builds up&quot;. (1 Peter 4:8 and 1 Corinthians 8:1) Kierkegaard believed that &quot;all human speech, even divine speech of Holy Scripture, about the spiritual is essentially metaphorical speech&quot;. &quot;To build up&quot; is a metaphorical expression. One can never be all human or all spirit, one must be both.

Later, in the same book, Kierkegaard deals with the question of sin and forgiveness. He uses the same text he used earlier in &quot;Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843&quot;, &quot;Love hides a multitude of sins&quot;. (1 Peter 4:8). He asks if &quot;one who tells his neighbors faults hides or increases the multitude of sins&quot;.


In 1848, he published &quot;Christian Discourses&quot; under his own name and &quot;The Crisis and a Crisis in the Life of an Actress&quot; under the pseudonym Inter et Inter. &quot;Christian Discourses&quot; deals the same theme as &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot;, angst. The text is the Gospel of Matthew 6 verses 24–34. This was the same passage he had used in his &quot;What We Learn From the Lilies in the Field and From the Birds of the Air&quot; of 1847. He wrote: 
Kierkegaard tried to explain his prolific use of pseudonyms again in &quot;The Point of View of My Work as an Author&quot;, his autobiographical explanation for his writing style. The book was finished in 1848, but not published until after his death by his brother Peter Christian Kierkegaard. Walter Lowrie mentioned Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;profound religious experience of Holy Week 1848&quot; as a turning point from &quot;indirect communication&quot; to &quot;direct communication&quot; regarding Christianity. However, Kierkegaard stated that he was a religious author throughout all of his writings and that his aim was to discuss &quot;the problem &#x27;of becoming a Christian&#x27;, with a direct polemic against the monstrous illusion we call Christendom&quot;. He expressed the illusion this way in his 1848 &quot;Christian Address&quot;, &quot;Thoughts Which Wound From Behind – for Edification&quot;. 
He wrote three discourses under his own name and one pseudonymous book in 1849. He wrote &quot;The Lily in the Field and the Bird of the Air. Three Devotional Discourses&quot;, &quot;Three Discourses at the Communion on Fridays&quot; and &quot;Two Ethical–Religious Essays&quot;. The first thing any child finds in life is the external world of nature. This is where God placed his natural teachers. He&#x27;s been writing about confession and now openly writes about Holy Communion which is generally preceded by confession. This he began with the confessions of the esthete and the ethicist in &quot;Either/Or&quot; and the highest good peace in the discourse of that same book. His goal has always been to help people become religious but specifically Christian religious. He summed his position up earlier in his book, &quot;The Point of View of My Work as an Author&quot;, but this book was not published until 1859.


The second edition of &quot;Either/Or&quot; was published early in 1849. Later that year he published &quot;The Sickness unto Death&quot;, under the pseudonym Anti-Climacus. He&#x27;s against Johannes Climacus, who kept writing books about trying to understand Christianity. Here he says, &quot;Let others admire and praise the person who pretends to comprehend Christianity. I regard it as a plain ethical task—perhaps requiring not a little self-denial in these speculative times, when all &#x27;the others&#x27; are busy with comprehending—to admit that one is neither able nor supposed to comprehend it.&quot; Sickness unto death was a familiar phrase in Kierkegaard&#x27;s earlier writings. This sickness is despair and for Kierkegaard despair is a sin. Despair is the impossibility of . Kierkegaard writes: 

In &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;, 25 September 1850, his last pseudonymous work, he stated, &quot;In this book, originating in the year 1848, the requirement for being a Christian is forced up by the pseudonymous author to a supreme ideality.&quot; This work was called &quot;Training in Christianity&quot; when Walter Lowrie translated it in 1941.

He now pointedly referred to the acting single individual in his next three publications; &quot;For Self-Examination&quot;, &quot;Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays&quot;, and in 1852 &quot;Judge for Yourselves!&quot;. &quot;Judge for Yourselves&quot;! was published posthumously in 1876. Here is an interesting quote from &quot;For Self Examination&quot;.If in observing the present state of the world and life in general, from a Christian point of view one had to say (and from a Christian point of view with complete justification): It is a disease. And if I were a physician and someone asked me &quot;What do you think should be done?&quot; I would answer, &quot;The first thing, the unconditional condition for anything to be done, consequently the very first thing that must be done is: create silence, bring about silence; God&#x27;s Word cannot be heard, and if in order to be heard in the hullabaloo it must be shouted deafeningly with noisy instruments, then it is not God&#x27;s Word; create silence!

Ah, everything is noisy; and just as strong drink is said to stir the blood, so everything in our day, even the most insignificant project, even the most empty communication, is designed merely to jolt the senses and to stir up the masses, the crowd, the public, noise!

And man, this clever fellow, seems to have become sleepless in order to invent ever new instruments to increase noise, to spread noise and insignificance with the greatest possible haste and on the greatest possible scale. Yes, everything is soon turned upside-down: communication is indeed soon brought to its lowest point in regard to meaning, and simultaneously the means of communication are indeed brought to their highest with regard to speedy and overall circulation; for what is publicized with such hot haste and, on the other hand, what has greater circulation than—rubbish! Oh, create silence!&quot; Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;For Self-Examination&quot; 1851 pp. 47–48 Hong 1990

In 1851 Kierkegaard wrote his &quot;Two Discourses at the Communion on Fridays&quot; where he once more discussed sin, forgiveness, and authority using that same verse from 1 Peter 4:8 that he used twice in 1843 with his &quot;Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843&quot;. 
Kierkegaard began his 1843 book &quot;Either/Or&quot; with a question: &quot;Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Reason alone baptized?&quot; He didn&#x27;t want to devote himself to Thought or Speculation like Hegel did. Faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self-control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and selfishness. These are the inner passions that Thought knows little about. Hegel begins the process of education with Thought but Kierkegaard thinks we could begin with passion, or a balance between the two, a balance between Goethe and Hegel. He was against endless reflection with no passion involved. But at the same time he did not want to draw more attention to the external display of passion but the internal (hidden) passion of the single individual. Kierkegaard clarified this intention in his &quot;Journals&quot;.

Schelling put Nature first and Hegel put Reason first but Kierkegaard put the human being first and the choice first in his writings. He makes an argument against Nature here and points out that most single individuals begin life as spectators of the visible world and work toward knowledge of the invisible world. 
 Suppose that it were not one man who traveled from Jericho to Jerusalem, but there were two, and both of them were assaulted by robbers and maimed, and no traveler passed by. Suppose, then, that one of them did nothing but moan, while the other forgot and surmounted his own suffering to speak comfortingly, friendly words or, what involved great pain, dragged himself to some water to fetch the other a refreshing drink. Or suppose that they were both bereft of speech, but one of them in his silent prayer sighed to God also for the other—was he then not merciful? If someone has cut off my hands, then I cannot play the zither, and if someone has cut off my feet, then I cannot dance, and if I lie crippled on the shore, then I cannot throw myself into the sea to rescue another person&#x27;s life, and if I myself am lying with a broken arm or leg, then I cannot plunge into the flames to save another&#x27;s life—but I can still be merciful. I have often pondered how a painter might portray mercifulness, but I have decided that it cannot be done. As soon as a painter is to do it, it becomes dubious whether it is mercifulness or it is something else.
* Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;Works of Love&quot;, Hong 1995 p. 324
&quot;Seek Ye First God&#x27;s Kingdom And His Righteousness&quot; Matthew 6:33
But what does this mean, what have I to do, or what sort of effort is it that can be said to seek or pursue the kingdom of God? Shall I try to get a job suitable to my talents and powers in order thereby to exert an influence? No, thou shalt &quot;first&quot; seek God&#x27;s kingdom. Shall I then give all my fortune to the poor? No, thou shalt &quot;first&quot; seek God&#x27;s kingdom. Shall I then go out to proclaim this teaching to the world? No, thou shalt &quot;first&quot; seek God&#x27;s kingdom. But then in a certain sense it is nothing I shall do. Yes, certainly, in a certain it is nothing, thou shalt in the deepest sense make thyself nothing, become nothing before God, learn to keep silent; in this silence is the beginning, which is, &quot;first&quot; to seek God&#x27;s kingdom. In this wise, a godly wise, one gets to the beginning by going, in a sense, backwards. The beginning is not that with which one begins, but at which one arrives at the beginning backwards. The beginning is this art of &quot;becoming&quot; silent; for to be silent, as nature is, is not an art. It is man&#x27;s superiority over the beasts to be able to speak; but in relation to God it can easily become the ruin of man who is able to speak that he is too willing to speak. God is love, man is (as one says to a child) a silly little thing, even so far as his own wellbeing is concerned. Only in much fear and trembling can a man walk with God; in much fear and trembling. But to talk in much fear and trembling is difficult for as a sense of dread causes the bodily voice to fail; so also does much fear and trembling render the voice mute in silence. This the true man of prayer knows well, and he who was not the true man of prayer learned precisely this by praying.
* Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;Christian Discourses&quot;, 1848 Lowrie 1940, 1961 p. 322
Nikolai Berdyaev makes a related argument against reason in his 1945 book &quot;The Divine and the Human&quot;.

===Attack upon the Lutheran State Church===
Kierkegaard&#x27;s final years were taken up with a sustained, outright attack on the Church of Denmark by means of newspaper articles published in &quot;The Fatherland&quot; (&quot;Fædrelandet&quot;) and a series of self-published pamphlets called &quot;The Moment&quot; (&quot;Øjeblikket&quot;), also translated as &quot;The Instant&quot;. These pamphlets are now included in Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Attack Upon Christendom&quot;. &quot;The Moment&quot; was translated into German and other European languages in 1861 and again in 1896.

Kierkegaard first moved to action after Professor (soon Bishop) Hans Lassen Martensen gave a speech in church in which he called the recently deceased Bishop Jacob Peter Mynster a &quot;truth-witness, one of the authentic truth-witnesses&quot;. Kierkegaard explained, in his first article, that Mynster&#x27;s death permitted him—at last—to be frank about his opinions. He later wrote that all his former output had been &quot;preparations&quot; for this attack, postponed for years waiting for two preconditions: 1) both his father and bishop Mynster should be dead before the attack, and 2) he should himself have acquired a name as a famous theologic writer. Kierkegaard&#x27;s father had been Mynster&#x27;s close friend, but Søren had long come to see that Mynster&#x27;s conception of Christianity was mistaken, demanding too little of its adherents. Kierkegaard strongly objected to the portrayal of Mynster as a &#x27;truth-witness&#x27;.

Kierkegaard described the hope the witness to the truth has in 1847 and in his Journals. 

Kierkegaard&#x27;s pamphlets and polemical books, including &quot;The Moment&quot;, criticized several aspects of church formalities and politics. According to Kierkegaard, the idea of congregations keeps individuals as children since Christians are disinclined from taking the initiative to take responsibility for their own relation to God. He stressed that &quot;Christianity is the individual, here, the single individual&quot;. Furthermore, since the Church was controlled by the State, Kierkegaard believed the State&#x27;s bureaucratic mission was to increase membership and oversee the welfare of its members. More members would mean more power for the clergymen: a corrupt ideal. This mission would seem at odds with Christianity&#x27;s true doctrine, which, to Kierkegaard, is to stress the importance of the individual, not the whole. Thus, the state-church political structure is offensive and detrimental to individuals, since anyone can become &quot;Christian&quot; without knowing what it means to be Christian. It is also detrimental to the religion itself since it reduces Christianity to a mere fashionable tradition adhered to by unbelieving &quot;believers&quot;, a &quot;herd mentality&quot; of the population, so to speak. Kierkegaard always stressed the importance of the conscience and the use of it.

However, he showed marked elements of convergence with the medieval Catholicism. Nonetheless, Kierkegaard has been described as &quot;profoundly Lutheran&quot;.

==Death==
Before the tenth issue of his periodical &quot;The Moment&quot; could be published, Kierkegaard collapsed on the street. He stayed in the hospital for over a month and refused communion. At that time he regarded pastors as mere political officials, a niche in society who were clearly not representative of the divine. He told Emil Boesen, a friend since childhood, who kept a record of his conversations with Kierkegaard, that his life had been one of immense suffering, which may have seemed like vanity to others, but he did not think it so.

Kierkegaard died in Frederiks Hospital after over a month, possibly from complications from a fall from a tree in his youth. It has been suggested by professor and philosopher that Kierkegaard died from Pott disease, a form of tuberculosis. He was interred in the Assistens Kirkegård in the Nørrebro section of Copenhagen. At Kierkegaard&#x27;s funeral, his nephew Henrik Lund caused a disturbance by protesting Kierkegaard&#x27;s burial by the official church. Lund maintained that Kierkegaard would never have approved, had he been alive, as he had broken from and denounced the institution. Lund was later fined for his disruption of the funeral.

==Reception==
===19th-century reception===
Fredrika Bremer wrote of Kierkegaard in 1850: &quot;While Martensen with his wealth of genius casts from his central position light upon every sphere of existence, upon all the phenomena of life, Søren Kierkegaard stands like another Simon Stylites, upon his solitary column, with his eye unchangeably fixed upon one point.&quot; In 1855, the Danish National Church published his obituary. Kierkegaard did have an impact there judging from the following quote from their article: &quot;The fatal fruits which Dr. Kierkegaard show to arise from the union of Church and State, have strengthened the scruples of many of the believing laity, who now feel that they can remain no longer in the Church, because thereby they are in communion with unbelievers, for there is no ecclesiastical discipline.&quot;
Changes did occur in the administration of the Church and these changes were linked to Kierkegaard&#x27;s writings. The Church noted that dissent was &quot;something foreign to the national mind&quot;. On 5 April 1855, the Church enacted new policies: &quot;every member of a congregation is free to attend the ministry of any clergyman, and is not, as formerly, bound to the one whose parishioner he is&quot;. In March 1857, compulsory infant baptism was abolished. Debates sprang up over the King&#x27;s position as the head of the Church and over whether to adopt a constitution. Grundtvig objected to having any written rules. Immediately following this announcement the &quot;agitation occasioned by Kierkegaard&quot; was mentioned. Kierkegaard was accused of Weigelianism and Darbyism, but the article continued to say, &quot;One great truth has been made prominent, viz (namely): That there exists a worldly-minded clergy; that many things in the Church are rotten; that all need daily repentance; that one must never be contented with the existing state of either the Church or her pastors.&quot;

Hans Lassen Martensen addressed Kierkegaard&#x27;s ideas extensively in &quot;Christian Ethics&quot;, published in 1871. Martensen accused Kierkegaard and Alexandre Vinet of not giving society its due, saying both of them put the individual above society, and in so doing, above the Church. Another early critic was Magnús Eiríksson, who criticized Martensen and wanted Kierkegaard as his ally in his fight against speculative theology.
August Strindberg was deeply affected by reading Kierkegaard while a student at Uppsala University. Edwin Björkman credited Kierkegaard, as well as Henry Thomas Buckle and Eduard von Hartmann, with shaping Strindberg&#x27;s artistic form &quot;until he was strong enough to stand wholly on his own feet.&quot; The dramatist Henrik Ibsen is said to have been interested in Kierkegaard, as well as the Norwegian national writer and poet Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson.

Otto Pfleiderer, in &quot;The Philosophy of Religion On the Basis of Its History&quot; (1887), claimed that Kierkegaard presented an anti-rational view of Christianity. An entry on Kierkegaard from an 1889 dictionary of religion presents an idea of how he was regarded at that time, stating: &quot;He was the most original thinker and theological philosopher the North ever produced. His fame has been steadily growing since his death, and he bids fair to become the leading religio-philosophical light of Germany. Not only his theological but also his aesthetic works have of late become the subject of universal study in Europe.&quot;

Although not cited by him explicitly, Kierkegaard&#x27;s view of faith would influence Norwegian theologian Gisle Christian Johnson (1822-1894). Johnson&#x27;s system of dogmatic theology contained in his &quot;Grundrids af den Systematisk Theologi&quot; (published posthumously in 1897) differed starkly from those of his contemporaries in its integration of a threefold paradigm for viewing the essence of faith (&quot;Troens Væsen&quot;) as Egotistic, Legalist, and Christian, found in the first part of the work (&quot;Pistiks&quot;), which itself was cast in the Law/Gospel mold of confessional Lutheranism. The final stage is marked in terms of discontinuity and radical change, and thus requires a leap to faith similar to that of Kierkegaard, what Johnson styles an irrefutable claim (&quot;uafviselig Fordring&quot;) of higher existence correlate to True Being (&quot;sande Væsen&quot;). Johnson would have read Kierkegaard in the 1840s during his studies in continental Europe, developing his &quot;Pistiks&quot; in 1853 after his appointment to faculty at the University of Kristiana; as such, Svein Aage Christoffersen has designated Johnson to be the first Kierkegaardian in theology, fusing confessional, theological, and experiential categories of faith into a single dogmatic system. Johnson&#x27;s pietistic emphases merged with Kierkegaard&#x27;s own emphases on genuineness of faith to produce a revivalist movement that swept across Norway, known as the Johnsonian Revivals.

===Early 20th-century reception===

The first academic to draw attention to Kierkegaard was fellow Dane Georg Brandes, who published in German as well as Danish. Brandes gave the first formal lectures on Kierkegaard in Copenhagen and helped bring him to the attention of the European intellectual community. Brandes published the first book on Kierkegaard&#x27;s philosophy and life, &quot;Søren Kierkegaard, ein literarisches Charakterbild. Autorisirte deutsche Ausg&quot; (1879) which Adolf Hult said was a &quot;misconstruction&quot; of Kierkegaard&#x27;s work and &quot;falls far short of the truth&quot;. Brandes compared him to Hegel and Tycho Brahe in &quot;Reminiscences of my Childhood and Youth&quot; (1906). Brandes also discussed the &quot;Corsair Affair&quot; in the same book. Brandes opposed Kierkegaard&#x27;s ideas in the 1911 edition of the &quot;Britannica&quot;. Brandes compared Kierkegaard to Friedrich Nietzsche as well. He also mentioned Kierkegaard extensively in volume 2 of his 6 volume work, &quot;Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature&quot; (1872 in German and Danish, 1906 English).

Swedish author Waldemar Rudin published &quot;Sören Kierkegaards person och författarskap – ett försök&quot; in 1880. During the 1890s, Japanese philosophers began disseminating the works of Kierkegaard. Tetsuro Watsuji was one of the first philosophers outside of Scandinavia to write an introduction on his philosophy, in 1915.

 Harald Høffding&#x27;s work was greatly influenced by Kierkegaard, having himself stated that Kierkegaard&#x27;s thought &quot;has pursued me from my youth, [and] determined the direction of my life.&quot; Høffding was a friend of the American philosopher William James, and although James had not read Kierkegaard&#x27;s works, as they were not yet translated into English, he attended the lectures about Kierkegaard by Høffding and agreed with much of those lectures. James&#x27; favorite quote from Kierkegaard came from Høffding: &quot;We live forwards but we understand backwards&quot;.

One thing James did have in common with Kierkegaard was respect for the single individual, and their respective comments may be compared in direct sequence as follows: &quot;A crowd is indeed made up of single individuals; it must therefore be in everyone&#x27;s power to become what he is, a single individual; no one is prevented from being a single individual, no one, unless he prevents himself by becoming many. To become a crowd, to gather a crowd around oneself, is on the contrary to distinguish life from life; even the most well-meaning one who talks about that, can easily offend a single individual.&quot; In his book &quot;A Pluralistic Universe&quot;, James stated that, &quot;Individuality outruns all classification, yet we insist on classifying every one we meet under some general label. As these heads usually suggest prejudicial associations to some hearer or other, the life of philosophy largely consists of resentments at the classing, and complaints of being misunderstood. But there are signs of clearing up for which both Oxford and Harvard are partly to be thanked.&quot;

&quot;The Encyclopaedia of religion and ethics&quot; had an article about Kierkegaard in 1908. The article began:

Friedrich von Hügel wrote about Kierkegaard in his 1913 book, &quot;Eternal life: a study of its implications and applications&quot;, where he said: &quot;Kierkegaard, the deep, melancholy, strenuous, utterly uncompromising Danish religionist, is a spiritual brother of the great Frenchman, Blaise Pascal, and of the striking English Tractarian, Hurrell Froude, who died young and still full of crudity, yet left an abiding mark upon all who knew him well.&quot;

John George Robertson wrote an article called Søren Kierkegaard in 1914: &quot;Notwithstanding the fact that during the last quarter of a century, we have devoted considerable attention to the literatures of the North, the thinker and man of letters whose name stands at the head of the present article is but little known to the English-speaking world. The Norwegians, Ibsen and Bjørnson, have exerted a very real power on our intellectual life, and for Bjørnson we have cherished even a kind of affection. But Kierkegaard, the writer who holds the indispensable key to the intellectual life of Scandinavia, to whom Denmark in particular looks up as her most original man of genius in the nineteenth century, we have wholly overlooked.&quot; Robertson wrote previously in (1898) about Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. Theodor Haecker wrote an essay titled, &quot;Kierkegaard and the Philosophy of Inwardness&quot; in 1913 and David F. Swenson wrote a biography of Søren Kierkegaard in 1920. Lee M. Hollander translated parts of &quot;Either/Or&quot;, &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;, &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot;, and &quot;Preparations for the Christian Life&quot; (Practice in Christianity) into English in 1923, with little impact. Swenson wrote about Kierkegaard&#x27;s idea of &quot;armed neutrality&quot; in 1918 and a lengthy article about Søren Kierkegaard in 1920. Swenson stated: &quot;It would be interesting to speculate upon the reputation that Kierkegaard might have attained, and the extent of the influence he might have exerted, if he had written in one of the major European languages, instead of in the tongue of one of the smallest countries in the world.&quot;

Austrian psychologist Wilhelm Stekel (1868–1940) referred to Kierkegaard as the &quot;fanatical follower of Don Juan, himself the philosopher of Don Juanism&quot; in his book &quot;Disguises of Love&quot;. German psychiatrist and philosopher Karl Jaspers (1883–1969) stated he had been reading Kierkegaard since 1914 and compared Kierkegaard&#x27;s writings with Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Mind&quot; and the writings of Nietzsche. Jaspers saw Kierkegaard as a champion of Christianity and Nietzsche as a champion for atheism. Later, in 1935, Karl Jaspers emphasized Kierkegaard&#x27;s (and Nietzsche&#x27;s) continuing importance for modern philosophy.

====German and English translators of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works====

The first translation into German of Kierkegaard&#x27;s work appeared in 1861, but it was Albert Bärthold who undertook the first substantial program of translating Kierkegaard into German, beginning in 1873. Hermann Gottsche published Kierkegaard&#x27;s Journals in 1905. It had taken academics 50 years to arrange his journals. Kierkegaard&#x27;s main works were translated into German by Christoph Schrempf from 1909 onwards. Emmanuel Hirsch released a German edition of Kierkegaard&#x27;s collected works from 1950 onwards. Both Harald Hoffding&#x27;s and Schrempf&#x27;s books about Kierkegaard were reviewed in 1892.

In the 1930s, the first academic English translations, by Alexander Dru, David F. Swenson, Douglas V. Steere, and Walter Lowrie appeared, under the editorial efforts of Oxford University Press editor Charles Williams, one of the members of the Inklings. Thomas Henry Croxall, another early translator, Lowrie, and Dru all hoped that people would not just read about Kierkegaard but would actually read his works. Dru published an English translation of Kierkegaard&#x27;s Journals in 1958; Alastair Hannay translated some of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works for Penguin Classics. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong translated his works more than once. The first volume of their first version of the &quot;Journals and Papers&quot; (Indiana, 1967–1978) won the 1968 U.S. National Book Award in category Translation. They both dedicated their lives to the study of Søren Kierkegaard and his works, which are maintained at the Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library. Jon Stewart from the University of Copenhagen has written extensively about Søren Kierkegaard.

====Kierkegaard&#x27;s influence on Karl Barth&#x27;s early theology====
Kierkegaard&#x27;s influence on Karl Barth&#x27;s early theology is evident in &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; 1918, 1921, 1933. &quot;If I have a system it is limited to a recognition of what Kierkegaard called the &#x27;infinite qualitative distinction&#x27; and to my regarding this as possessing negative as well as positive significance: &#x27;God is in heaven. And thou art on earth.&#x27; The relation between such a God and such a man, and the relation between such a man and such a God, is for me the theme of the Bible and the essence of philosophy. Philosophers name this KRISIS of human perception—the Prime Cause: the Bible holds at the same cross-roads-the figure of Jesus Christ. When I am faced by such a document as the Epistle of Paul to the Romans, I embark on its interpretation on the assumption that he is confronted with the same unmistakable and unmeasurable significance of that relation as I myself am confronted with, and that it is this situation which moulds his thought and its expression&quot;. Karl Barth, &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; 1919 Preface (originally published in German) Barth read at least three volumes of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works: &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;, &quot;The Moment&quot;, and an &quot;Anthology&quot; from his journals and diaries. Almost all key terms from Kierkegaard which had an important role in &quot;The Epistle to the Romans&quot; can be found in &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;. The concept of the indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment of &quot;Practice in Christianity&quot;, in particular, confirmed and sharpened Barth&#x27;s ideas on contemporary Christianity and the Christian life.

Wilhelm Pauck wrote in 1931 (&quot;Karl Barth Prophet of a New Christianity&quot;) that Kierkegaard&#x27;s use of the Latin phrase &quot;Finitum Non Capax Infiniti&quot; (the finite does not (or cannot) comprehend the infinite) summed up Barth&#x27;s system. David G. Kingman and Adolph Keller each discussed Barth&#x27;s relationship to Kierkegaard in their books, &quot;The Religious Educational Values in Karl Barth&#x27;s Teachings&quot; (1934) and &quot;Karl Barth and Christian Unity&quot; (1933). Keller notes the splits that happen when a new teaching is introduced and some assume a higher knowledge from a higher source than others.
Students of Kierkegaard became a &quot;group of dissatisfied, excited radicals&quot; when under Barthianism. Eduard Geismar (1871–1939), who gave &quot;Lectures on Kierkegaard&quot; in March 1936, was not radical enough for them. Barthianism was opposed to the objective treatment of religious questions and to the sovereignty of man in the existential meeting with the transcendent God. But just as students of Hegel broke off into Right and Left, so did the German followers of Barth. 

Barth endorses the main theme from Kierkegaard but also reorganizes the scheme and transforms the details. He expands the theory of indirect communication to the field of Christian ethics; he applies the concept of unrecognizability to the Christian life. He coins the concept of the &quot;paradox of faith&quot; since the form of faith entails a contradictory encounter of God and human beings. He also portrayed the contemporaneity of the moment when in crisis a human being desperately perceives the contemporaneity of Christ. In regard to the concept of indirect communication, the paradox, and the moment, the Kierkegaard of the early Barth is a productive catalyst.

===Later-20th-century reception===

William Hubben compared Kierkegaard to Dostoevsky in his 1952 book &quot;Four Prophets of Our Destiny&quot;, later titled &quot;Dostoevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Kafka&quot;.

In 1955, Morton White wrote about the word &quot;exists&quot; and Kierkegaard&#x27;s idea of God&#x27;s &quot;is-ness&quot;.

John Daniel Wild noted as early as 1959 that Kierkegaard&#x27;s works had been &quot;translated into almost every important living language including Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and it is now fair to say that his ideas are almost as widely known and as influential in the world as those of his great opponent Hegel, still the most potent of world philosophers.&quot;
Mortimer J. Adler wrote the following about Kierkegaard in 1962: For Kierkegaard, man is essentially an individual, not a member of a species or race; and ethical and religious truth is known through individual existence and decision—through subjectivity, not objectivity. Systems of thought and a dialectic such as Hegel&#x27;s are matters merely of thought, which cannot comprise individual existence and decision. Such systems leave out, said Kierkegaard, the unique and essential &quot;spermatic point, the individual, ethically and religiously conceived, and existentially accentuated&quot;. Similarly in the works of the American author Henry David Thoreau, writing at the same time as Kierkegaard, there is an emphasis on the solitary individual as the bearer of ethical responsibility, who, when he is right, carries the preponderant ethical weight against the state, government, and a united public opinion, when they are wrong. The solitary individual with right on his side is always &quot;a majority of one&quot;. &quot;Ethics, the study of moral values&quot;, by Mortimer J. Adler and Seymour Cain. Pref. by William Ernest Hocking. 1962 p. 252

In 1964 Life Magazine traced the history of existentialism from Heraclitus (500BC) and Parmenides over the argument over The Unchanging One as the real and the state of flux as the real. From there to the Old Testament Psalms and then to Jesus and later from Jacob Boehme (1575–1624) to René Descartes (1596–1650) and Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) and then on to Nietzsche and Paul Tillich. Dostoevsky and Camus are attempts to rewrite Descartes according to their own lights and Descartes is the forefather of Sartre through the fact that they both used a &quot;literary style&quot;. The article goes on to say,

Kierkegaard&#x27;s comparatively early and manifold philosophical and theological reception in Germany was one of the decisive factors of expanding his works&#x27; influence and readership throughout the world. Important for the first phase of his reception in Germany was the establishment of the journal &quot;Zwischen den Zeiten&quot; (&quot;Between the Ages&quot;) in 1922 by a heterogeneous circle of Protestant theologians: Karl Barth, Emil Brunner, Rudolf Bultmann and Friedrich Gogarten. Their thought would soon be referred to as dialectical theology.
At roughly the same time, Kierkegaard was discovered by several proponents of the Jewish-Christian philosophy of dialogue in Germany, namely by Martin Buber, Ferdinand Ebner, and Franz Rosenzweig. In addition to the philosophy of dialogue, existential philosophy has its point of origin in Kierkegaard and his concept of individuality. Martin Heidegger sparsely refers to Kierkegaard in &quot;Being and Time&quot; (1927), obscuring how much he owes to him. Walter Kaufmann discussed Sartre, Jaspers, and Heidegger in relation to Kierkegaard, and Kierkegaard in relation to the crisis of religion in the 1960s. Later, Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; (Series Two) and &quot;The Sickness Unto Death&quot; (Series Three) were included in the Penguin Great Ideas Series (Two and Three).

==Philosophy and theology==

Kierkegaard has been called a philosopher, a theologian, the Father of Existentialism, both atheistic and theistic variations, a literary critic, a social theorist, a humorist, a psychologist, and a poet. Two of his influential ideas are &quot;subjectivity&quot;, and the notion popularly referred to as &quot;leap of faith&quot;. However, the Danish equivalent to the English phrase &quot;leap of faith&quot; does not appear in the original Danish nor is the English phrase found in current English translations of Kierkegaard&#x27;s works. Kierkegaard does mention the concepts of &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;leap&quot; together many times in his works.
The leap of faith is his conception of how an individual would believe in God or how a person would act in love. Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making that commitment anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith is at the same time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one&#x27;s beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person&#x27;s thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. Someone who does not realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God. Kierkegaard writes, &quot;doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world&quot;.

Kierkegaard also stresses the importance of the self, and the self&#x27;s relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments&quot; that &quot;subjectivity is truth&quot; and &quot;truth is subjectivity.&quot; This has to do with a distinction between what is objectively true and an individual&#x27;s subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in &quot;some sense&quot; believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: &quot;What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the &quot;de te narratur fabula&quot; [the tale is told about you] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of statistical tables one laughs at all of life.&quot; In other words, Kierkegaard says: &quot;Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor&#x27;s distance from everyday life—or the learner who should put it to use?&quot; This is how it was summed up in 1940:

Kierkegaard primarily discusses subjectivity with regard to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that doubt is an element of faith and that it is impossible to gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed &quot;likely&quot; to be true, he or she would not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.

===Philosophical criticism===
Kierkegaard&#x27;s famous philosophical 20th-century critics include Theodor Adorno and Emmanuel Levinas. Non-religious philosophers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger supported many aspects of Kierkegaard&#x27;s philosophical views, but rejected some of his religious views. One critic wrote that Adorno&#x27;s book &quot;Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic&quot; is &quot;the most irresponsible book ever written on Kierkegaard&quot; because Adorno takes Kierkegaard&#x27;s pseudonyms literally and constructs a philosophy that makes him seem incoherent and unintelligible. Another reviewer says that &quot;Adorno is [far away] from the more credible translations and interpretations of the Collected Works of Kierkegaard we have today.&quot;
Levinas&#x27; main attack on Kierkegaard focused on his ethical and religious stages, especially in &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;. Levinas criticises the leap of faith by saying this suspension of the ethical and leap into the religious is a type of violence (the &quot;leap of faith&quot; of course, is presented by a pseudonym, thus not representing Kierkegaard&#x27;s own view, but intending to prompt the exact kind of discussion engaged in by his critics). He states: &quot;Kierkegaardian violence begins when existence is forced to abandon the ethical stage in order to embark on the religious stage, the domain of belief. But belief no longer sought external justification. Even internally, it combined communication and isolation, and hence violence and passion. That is the origin of the relegation of ethical phenomena to secondary status and the contempt of the ethical foundation of being which has led, through Nietzsche, to the amoralism of recent philosophies.&quot;

Levinas pointed to the Judeo-Christian belief that it was God who first commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac and that an angel commanded Abraham to stop. If Abraham were truly in the religious realm, he would not have listened to the angel&#x27;s command and should have continued to kill Isaac. To Levinas, &quot;transcending ethics&quot; seems like a loophole to excuse would-be murderers from their crime and thus is unacceptable. One interesting consequence of Levinas&#x27; critique is that it seemed to reveal that Levinas viewed God as a projection of inner ethical desire rather than an absolute moral agent. However, one of Kierkegaard&#x27;s central points in &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot; was that the religious sphere &quot;entails&quot; the ethical sphere; Abraham had faith that God is always in one way or another ethically in the right, even when He commands someone to kill. Therefore, deep down, Abraham had faith that God, as an absolute moral authority, would never allow him in the end to do something as ethically heinous as murdering his own child, and so he passed the test of blind obedience versus moral choice. He was making the point that God as well as the God-Man Christ doesn&#x27;t tell people everything when sending them out on a mission and reiterated this in &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot;.

I conceive of God as one who approves in a calculated vigilance, I believe that he approves of intrigues, and what I have read in the sacred books of the Old Testament is not of a sort to dishearten me. The Old Testament furnishes examples abundantly of a shrewdness which is nevertheless well pleasing to God, and that at a later period Christ said to His disciples, &quot;These things I said not unto you from the beginning—I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now&quot;—so here is a teleological suspension of the ethical rule of telling the whole truth.
:— Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;Quidam&#x27;s Diary&quot; from &quot;Stages on Life&#x27;s Way&quot;, 1845. Lowrie translation, 1967, pp. 217–218.
Sartre objected to the existence of God: If existence precedes essence, it follows from the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. In &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot;, Sartre&#x27;s phrasing is that God would be a &quot;pour-soi&quot; (a being-for-itself; a consciousness) who is also an &quot;en-soi&quot; (a being-in-itself; a thing) which is a contradiction in terms. Critics of Sartre rebutted this objection by stating that it rests on a false dichotomy and a misunderstanding of the traditional Christian view of God. Kierkegaard has Judge Vilhelm express the Christian hope this way in &quot;Either/Or&quot;:

Either, &quot;the first&quot; contains promise for the future, is the forward thrust, the endless impulse. Or, &quot;the first&quot; does not impel the individual; the power which is in the first does not become the impelling power but the repelling power, it becomes that which thrusts away. ... Thus—for the sake of making a little philosophical flourish, not with the pen but with thought-God only once became flesh, and it would be vain to expect this to be repeated.
:— Søren Kierkegaard, &quot;Either – Or II&quot;, 1843. Lowrie translation 1944, 1959, 1972, pp. 40–41.

Sartre agreed with Kierkegaard&#x27;s analysis of Abraham undergoing anxiety (Sartre calls it anguish), but claimed that God told Abraham to do it. In his lecture, &quot;Existentialism is a Humanism&quot;, Sartre wondered whether Abraham ought to have doubted whether God actually spoke to him. In Kierkegaard&#x27;s view, Abraham&#x27;s certainty had its origin in that &quot;inner voice&quot; which cannot be demonstrated or shown to another (&quot;The problem comes as soon as Abraham wants to be understood&quot;). To Kierkegaard, every external &quot;proof&quot; or justification is merely on the outside and external to the subject. Kierkegaard&#x27;s proof for the immortality of the soul, for example, is rooted in the extent to which one wishes to live forever.
Faith was something that Kierkegaard often wrestled with throughout his writing career; under both his real name and behind pseudonyms, he explored many different aspects of faith. These various aspects include faith as a spiritual goal, the historical orientation of faith (particularly toward Jesus Christ), faith being a gift from God, faith as dependency on a historical object, faith as a passion, and faith as a resolution to personal despair. Even so, it has been argued that Kierkegaard never offers a full, explicit and systematic account of what faith is. &quot;Either/Or&quot; was published 20 February 1843; it was mostly written during Kierkegaard&#x27;s stay in Berlin, where he took notes on Schelling&#x27;s &quot;Philosophy of Revelation&quot;. According to the &quot;Routledge Companion to Philosophy and Religion&quot;, Either/Or (vol. 1) consists of essays of literary and music criticism, a set of romantic-like-aphorisms, a whimsical essay on how to avoid boredom, a panegyric on the unhappiest possible human being, a diary recounting a supposed seduction, and (vol. II) two enormous didactic and hortatory ethical letters and a sermon. This opinion is a reminder of the type of controversy Kierkegaard tried to encourage in many of his writings both for readers in his own generation and for subsequent generations as well.

Kierkegaardian scholar Paul Holmer described Kierkegaard&#x27;s wish in his introduction to the 1958 publication of Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;Edifying Discourses&quot; where he wrote:

Later, Naomi Lebowitz explained them this way: The edifying discourses are, according to Johannes Climacus, &quot;humoristically revoked&quot; (CUP, 244, Swenson, Lowrie 1968) for unlike sermons, they are not ordained by authority. They start where the reader finds himself, in immanent ethical possibilities and aesthetic repetitions, and are themselves vulnerable to the lure of poetic sirens. They force the dialectical movements of the making and unmaking of the self before God to undergo lyrical imitations of meditation while the clefts, rifts, abysses, are everywhere to be seen.

==Political views==
Throughout retrospective analyses Kierkegaard has been viewed as an apolitical philosopher. Despite this, Kierkegaard did publish works of a political nature; this includes his first published essay, criticizing the movement for &quot;women&#x27;s liberation&quot;. Although Kierkegaard&#x27;s earlier works might include some misogynist statements, a negative view of women is not found in his later works. In these later works, he expressed that men and women are equal before God, showed great respect for certain women, and believed that women are also capable of being faithful.

He attacked Hegelianism via elaborate parody throughout his works from &quot;Either/Or&quot; to &quot;Concluding Unscientific Postscript&quot;. Despite his objections to Hegelianism, he expressed an admiration for Hegel personally and would even regard his system favourably if it was proposed as a thought experiment.

Kierkegaard leaned towards conservatism, being a personal friend of Danish king Christian VIII, whom he viewed as the moral superior of every Danish man, woman, and child. He argued against democracy, calling it &quot;the most tyrannical form of government,&quot; arguing in favour of monarchy saying &quot;Is it tyranny when one person wants to rule leaving the rest of us others out? No, but it is tyranny when all want to rule.&quot; Kierkegaard held strong contempt for the media, describing it as &quot;the most wretched, the most contemptible of all tyrannies&quot;. He was critical of the Danish public at the time, labeling them as &quot;the most dangerous of all powers and the most meaningless,&quot; writing further in &quot;Two Ages: A Literary Review&quot; that:

Some interpret Kierkegaard&#x27;s thought as implying that in regards to serving God, sexuality is irrelevant &quot;before God not only for men and women, but also for homosexuals and heterosexuals&quot;.

Kierkegaard&#x27;s political philosophy has been likened to neoconservatism, despite its major influence on radical and anti-traditional thinkers, religious and secular, such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Jean Paul Sartre. It has also been likened to anti-establishment thought and has been described as &quot;a starting point for contemporary political theories&quot;.

==Legacy==
Many 20th-century philosophers, both theistic and atheistic, and theologians drew concepts from Kierkegaard, including the notions of angst, despair, and the importance of the individual. His fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, in large part because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor, although later writers celebrated him as a highly significant and influential thinker in his own right. Since Kierkegaard was raised as a Lutheran, he was commemorated as a teacher in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 11 November.
Philosophers and theologians influenced by Kierkegaard are numerous and include major twentieth century theologians and philosophers. Paul Feyerabend&#x27;s epistemological anarchism in the philosophy of science was inspired by Kierkegaard&#x27;s idea of subjectivity as truth. Ludwig Wittgenstein was immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard, claiming that &quot;Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow. He bewilders me without working the good effects which he would in deeper souls&quot;. Karl Popper referred to Kierkegaard as &quot;the great reformer of Christian ethics, who exposed the official Christian morality of his day as anti-Christian and anti-humanitarian hypocrisy&quot;. Hilary Putnam admired Kierkegaard, &quot;for his insistence on the priority of the question, &#x27;How should I live?. By the early 1930s, Jacques Ellul&#x27;s three primary sources of inspiration were Karl Marx, Søren Kierkegaard, and Karl Barth. According to Ellul, Marx and Kierkegaard were his two greatest influences, and the only two authors of which he read all of their work. Herbert Read wrote in 1945 &quot;Kierkegaard&#x27;s life was in every sense that of a saint. He is perhaps the most real saint of modern times.&quot;

Kierkegaard has also had a considerable influence on 20th-century literature. Figures deeply influenced by his work include W. H. Auden, Jorge Luis Borges, Don DeLillo, Hermann Hesse, Franz Kafka, David Lodge, Flannery O&#x27;Connor, Walker Percy, Rainer Maria Rilke, J.D. Salinger and John Updike. What George Henry Price wrote in his 1963 book &quot;The Narrow Pass&quot; regarding the &quot;who&quot; and the &quot;what&quot; of Kierkegaard still seems to hold true today: &quot;Kierkegaard was the sanest man of his generation...Kierkegaard was a schizophrenic...Kierkegaard was the greatest Dane...the difficult Dane...the gloomy Dane...Kierkegaard was the greatest Christian of the century...Kierkegaard&#x27;s aim was the destruction of the historic Christian faith...He did not attack philosophy as such...He negated reason...He was a voluntarist...Kierkegaard was the Knight of Faith...Kierkegaard never found faith...Kierkegaard possessed the truth...Kierkegaard was one of the damned.&quot;
Kierkegaard had a profound influence on psychology. He is widely regarded as the founder of Christian psychology and of existential psychology and therapy. Existentialist (often called &quot;humanistic&quot;) psychologists and therapists include Ludwig Binswanger, Viktor Frankl, Erich Fromm, Carl Rogers, and Rollo May. May based his &quot;The Meaning of Anxiety&quot; on Kierkegaard&#x27;s &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot;. Kierkegaard&#x27;s sociological work &quot;Two Ages: The Age of Revolution and the Present Age&quot; critiques modernity. Ernest Becker based his 1974 Pulitzer Prize book &quot;The Denial of Death&quot; on the writings of Kierkegaard, Freud and Otto Rank. Kierkegaard is also seen as an important precursor of postmodernism. Danish priest Johannes Møllehave has lectured about Kierkegaard. In popular culture, he was the subject of serious television and radio programmes; in 1984, a six-part documentary, &quot;Sea of Faith&quot;, presented by Don Cupitt, featured an episode on Kierkegaard, while on Maundy Thursday in 2008, Kierkegaard was the subject of a discussion on the BBC Radio 4 programme presented by Melvyn Bragg, &quot;In Our Time&quot;, during which it was suggested that Kierkegaard straddles the analytic/continental divide. Google honoured him with a Google Doodle on his 200th anniversary.
The novel &quot;Therapy&quot; by David Lodge details a man experiencing a mid-life crisis and becoming obsessed with the works of Kierkegaard.

Kierkegaard is considered by some modern theologians to be the &quot;Father of Existentialism&quot;. Because of his influence (and in spite of it), others only consider either Martin Heidegger or Jean-Paul Sartre to be the actual &quot;Father of Existentialism&quot;. Kierkegaard predicted his posthumous fame, and foresaw that his work would become the subject of intense study and research.

<text>Worf, son of Mogh is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, portrayed by actor Michael Dorn. He appears in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot;), seasons four through seven of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;), and the third and final season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, as well as the feature films &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994), &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996), &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998), and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002).

Worf is the first Klingon main character to appear in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 11 seasons as a regular character on &quot;TNG&quot; , &quot;DS9&quot;, and &quot;Picard&quot; Worf has appeared in more &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise episodes than any other character.

== Casting ==
Initially, Worf was not intended to be a regular character, as Gene Roddenberry wanted to avoid &quot;retreads of characters or races featured prominently in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series&quot;. Accordingly, a cast portrait released in June 1987 to promote the upcoming series did not include Worf. Several &quot;tall, slim, black actors&quot; auditioned for Worf before Michael Dorn came along. Not only did the Worf character become a regular on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, he was continued on the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; series for four more seasons (1995–99) and talk of a spin-off Worf show continued even into the 2010s.

He made his debut in 1987 in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, and last appeared in character in 2023 in &quot;Picard&quot; season 3. Dorn as Worf made 283 on-screen appearances, the most of any actor in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

== Family history ==
Worf was orphaned as a child as a result of the Khitomer Massacre, and raised by Helena and Sergey Rozhenko. In one episode, the character says he was raised on the farm world Gault and in others he says he was raised in Russia near the Ural Mountains. He experiences conflicts between his upbringing and his desire to honor his biological heritage. He has two brothers, each with their own respective backstories, as well as two adoptive human parents, and one son. Important &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes for Worf&#x27;s family include &quot;The Bonding&quot;, &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Reunion&quot; and &quot;Homeward&quot; in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and &quot;Sons of Mogh&quot; and &quot;You Are Cordially Invited&quot; in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.

The House of Mogh was a family of high social and political rank, and was for a time represented on the Klingon High Council. In &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (set around 70 years before the &quot;Next Generation&quot; era began), Colonel Worf (also portrayed by Dorn) appears as the legal advocate of Captain James T. Kirk and Dr. Leonard McCoy after they are accused of killing Chancellor Gorkon of the Klingon High Council. He was also a member of the Klingon delegation at Camp Khitomer. Although not explicitly stated, he was intended to be Worf&#x27;s grandfather and namesake.

Worf has a son named Alexander with a half-human half-Klingon woman named K&#x27;Ehleyr, a character introduced in &quot;The Emissary&quot;; however, she is later killed in &quot;Reunion&quot;, a &quot;sequel&quot; to that episode and part of the Worf story arc, leaving Worf as a single parent. Alexander has to live aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D when K&#x27;Ehleyr is killed. After &quot;TNG&quot; ends, Worf gets moved to the Deep Space Nine space station where he eventually marries the Trill symbiont Jadzia Dax. (See &quot;You Are Cordially Invited&quot;.) On &quot;DS9&quot;, Worf misses the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D &quot;family&quot; that he had, often bemoaning the cut-rate work ethic and unfriendliness on the wayward outpost.

The episode &quot;Sins of the Father&quot; introduces Worf&#x27;s long-lost brother Kurn, who is also an orphan of the House of Mogh. Worf&#x27;s adoptive parents have a biological son, Nikolai Rozhenko, with whom Worf grew up. Nikolai and Worf talk in &quot;Homeward&quot;, where it is revealed that Worf will likely have a nephew or niece.

In &quot;The Bonding&quot; (&quot;TNG&quot; S3E5, aired 1989), Worf adopts an orphan boy into the House of Mogh. In the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode written by screenwriter Ron Moore, the orphan Jeremy (played by Gabriel Damon) has a special Klingon ceremony to be adopted into Worf&#x27;s family.Join me in the R&#x27;uustai, the Bonding. You will become part of my family now and for all time. We will be brothers.

:– Worf to Jeremy, &quot;The Bonding&quot;
== Storylines ==

=== Backstory ===
Worf was born in 2340 on Qo&#x27;noS (the Klingon homeworld) as the son of Mogh. Five years later, his parents moved to the Khitomer colony. Worf&#x27;s parents were killed during a surprise attack by the Romulans on the Khitomer outpost. The colony&#x27;s distress call was answered by the Federation starship USS &quot;Intrepid&quot;. Chief Petty Officer Sergey Rozhenko found Worf in the rubble and took him in after failing to find any living relatives. Rozhenko and his wife Helena raised him on a small farm colony on the planet Gault, a world of about 20,000 inhabitants, almost all of them human. Worf also has a human brother, Nikolai, with whom he often quarreled. He also spent time on Earth in his parents&#x27; native city of Minsk, later recommending it to Miles O&#x27;Brien as one of his favorite places on Earth.

Worf did not take the Rozhenkos&#x27; last name, preferring to be addressed by the Klingon designation, &quot;Worf, son of Mogh&quot;. However, his son, Alexander Rozhenko, who was raised by the Rozhenkos after his mother, K&#x27;Ehleyr, died, did use their surname. Although Worf was raised by humans, he considered himself a Klingon at heart and studied in-depth the ways of his people. As an adult, his mannerisms and personality, as well as his innate sense of honor, became more Klingon than human.

Worf&#x27;s brother Kurn, barely a year old at the time of the Khitomer attack, had been left behind on the Klingon homeworld Qo&#x27;noS by his parents. Lorgh, a friend to House of Mogh (appearing only in dialog of the episode &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;), was charged with the care of the younger son, originally expecting Mogh&#x27;s stay at the Khitomer outpost to be short-term. Lorgh adopted Kurn after the attack, but informed Klingon authorities that he had died with the rest of the family. Kurn was not revealed as being alive until both brothers were adults.

In 2357, Worf entered Starfleet Academy. He graduated in 2361 and was commissioned with the rank of Ensign, becoming the first Klingon officer in Starfleet. Although Worf took immense pride and a sense of honor from serving in Starfleet, most other Klingons shunned and belittled his choice of vocation.

In 2359, he became briefly involved with K&#x27;Ehleyr who was the daughter of a Klingon father and a human mother.

=== &quot;The Next Generation&quot; ===

In 2364, Worf was assigned to the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D as relief flight control and tactical officer with the rank of lieutenant junior grade (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;) under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. The next year, he was made Acting Chief of Security following the death of Tasha Yar, even though he believed that a promotion due to the death of a comrade was not honorable (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Skin of Evil&quot;). The next year, he transferred to operations division and was formally made Chief of Security (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Child&quot;).

In 2365, he renewed his relationship with K&#x27;Ehleyr when she came aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a Federation emissary on an urgent mission. He proposed marriage but was rejected (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Emissary&quot;).

In 2366, he was promoted to Lieutenant (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Evolution&quot;). After an accident caused the death of Lt. Marla Astor, Worf brought the orphaned Jeremy Astor into the House of Mogh through the rite of R&#x27;uustai (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Bonding&quot;).

Worf learned of Kurn&#x27;s existence when Kurn was assigned to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as an exchange officer. Kurn specifically asked for the &quot;Enterprise&quot; so he could observe his brother. He then revealed his true identity, informing Worf that the House of Mogh&#x27;s rival Duras accused their father of betraying the Klingon Empire by helping the Romulans attack Khitomer. When they and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew discovered that it was in fact Duras&#x27;s father who betrayed the Empire, Worf, realizing that the powerful House of Duras could not be publicly shamed without throwing the Empire into civil war, accepted a ritual discommendation from the Klingon High Council. While Worf decided to accept this dishonor, it was decided to keep Kurn&#x27;s true identity secret in order to protect his honor (and the House of Mogh as a whole be left alone) (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;).

In 2367, K&#x27;Ehleyr returned with Klingon Chancellor K&#x27;mpec who had come to meet with Captain Picard. When she came aboard, Worf learned he had a son named Alexander. She wanted to marry him but Worf refused because he did not want to share his dishonor with her and their son (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Reunion&quot;).

After K&#x27;mpec&#x27;s death, she assisted Captain Picard with the rite of succession. K&#x27;Ehleyr was eventually murdered by Duras when she found evidence of his involvement in the effort to discredit Worf (and why he was discommended). Exercising his right of vengeance, Worf fought and killed Duras with a bat&#x27;leth in a duel, allowing Duras&#x27;s political opponent Gowron to become chancellor (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Reunion&quot;).

A civil war erupted when the Duras&#x27;s son Toral challenged Gowron. Worf believed Gowron was the legitimate ruler and convinced his brother to bring forces loyal to him into battle on Gowron&#x27;s behalf. Worf resigned from Starfleet to fight for Gowron and served on his brother&#x27;s ship. Gowron won the war after Starfleet exposed Romulan support for the House of Duras. In appreciation of his support, Chancellor Gowron restored Worf&#x27;s honor, allowing Kurn a seat on the High Council as the recognized brother and representative of the House of Mogh (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Redemption, Part I&quot;). Once the war was over, Worf regained his Starfleet commission, recognizing that he did not fully belong to Klingon society (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Redemption, Part II&quot;).

In 2369, while the &quot;Enterprise&quot; was at Deep Space Nine, Worf investigated a claim that his father might still be alive in a Romulan prison camp. His father was not there (having indeed been killed during the battle at Khitomer), but a number of Klingons were living there with the Romulans. Unable to return home with honor, as Klingons are supposed to commit suicide rather than be taken prisoner, they stayed and strayed from their way of life. Worf&#x27;s visit had a profound effect on the children of the prisoners and many chose to leave with him (&quot;TNG&quot;: Birthright).

Worf&#x27;s visit to the camp caused him to reconsider his own beliefs. He visited the monastery at Boreth to meditate. One day, a man appeared before him claiming to be Kahless the Unforgettable who had returned to lead the Empire once more. Worf was willing to consider the idea that Kahless was genuine because he believed the Klingons had lost their ways. Gowron was skeptical. He questioned Kahless about details of his memories, which Kahless could not recall, and then challenged Kahless to combat, defeating him easily. The loss forced the clerics to reveal that they had created a clone of Kahless and implanted ancient scriptures of Kahless&#x27;s battles as his memories. Despite this, Worf became convinced that the Klingons would make a leap of faith and accept him as the legitimate heir of Kahless. He convinced the Klingons to appoint the new Kahless as Emperor. While real power remained with Gowron as head of government, the Emperor would be the formal head of state and teach the stories of Kahless. Gowron was induced to go along with this arrangement when Worf threatened in private otherwise to oppose him publicly, which Gowron, still not fully in control of the Empire, could not afford. (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Rightful Heir&quot;).

Worf avoided romantic attachments with non-Klingons during his first few years onboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. As Worf explained to both Commander Riker and Guinan, he felt that non-Klingon females would be too fragile, and that he would have to restrain himself too much. He eventually developed strong feelings for Counselor Deanna Troi, and explored a relationship with her for a time, which at times strained his relationship with her former romantic interest, Commander Riker. Worf and Troi seemed to end their relationship following the destruction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D at Veridian III and Worf&#x27;s reassignment to Deep Space Nine.

=== &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; ===
In 2371, he was promoted to lieutenant commander (&quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;). After the destruction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, Worf took an extended leave to evaluate his future. He was at a monastery on the Klingon colony of Boreth when he was ordered to go to Deep Space Nine to advise Captain Sisko when a Klingon fleet massed at the station. When he arrived, he was met by former &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D crew member and Deep Space Nine Chief of Operations Miles O&#x27;Brien. (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;).

Worf learned that the Klingons were planning to invade Cardassia because of a coup which they had been led to believe was engineered by the Dominion. Worf reluctantly informed Sisko, knowing this would jeopardize his status in the empire. After the invasion had begun, Gowron traveled to DS9 to ask Worf to join him in battle. Gowron believed the Federation was unworthy of Worf&#x27;s loyalty because they would not fight the Dominion. Worf felt the war was wrong and he could not support it. Gowron punished him by reinstating Worf&#x27;s discommendation, but this time executing it to the full degree, by stripping him and his family of his honor, lands, and titles, effectively bringing down the House of Mogh.

Worf submitted his resignation but Sisko rejected it because he still needed him. He had decided to rescue the members of the Cardassian council from certain death at the hands of the Klingons. In doing so, he was able to prove that there was no Dominion involvement by verifying their identities. The Klingons attacked the station in order to capture the council members but withdrew as Starfleet ships approached, fearing a war on two fronts.

At the end of the immediate crisis, Sisko convinced Worf to join the crew as Strategic Operations officer. In this role, he would coordinate all Starfleet activity in the Bajoran sector and act as executive officer of the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;, meaning he had to adjust to the requirements and obligations that came with the red &quot;command personnel&quot; uniform. For the first months, Worf had difficulties adjusting to life on the station, unintentionally overstepping his boundaries by acting as he did on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, putting him for a while at odds with Chief of Security Odo. For Worf, the station&#x27;s life seemed just too much &#x27;grey&#x27;, subsequently requesting to relocate his quarters aboard &quot;Defiant&quot;.

After the Klingon civil war, Kurn had gained a seat on the High Council. Worf&#x27;s opposition to the war against Cardassia cost Kurn his seat on the council. Four months later, he arrived at DS9 seeking help from his brother to perform a ritual to die with honor. He felt that the ritual, which involved Worf killing him, was the only way to restore his honor. Initially disregarding orders from Sisko not to carry out the honor killing, Worf failed in his first attempt to perform the ritual and later found he could not bring himself to do so again, as he had taken on a human feature of morality and would consider it murdering his brother. Worf arranged for his brother to have cosmetic surgery and his memory wiped so he could start a new life with no ties to the House of Mogh. Kurn now has the identity of Rodek, who believes he lost his memory after being hit by a plasma discharge (&quot;DS9&quot; episode &quot;Sons of Mogh&quot;). When Rodek sees Worf, he asks him whether he is family. Worf bitterly replies that he has no family.

After a year of war between the Federation and the Klingons, Worf joined a team sent to investigate claims that Gowron was a changeling in disguise. Worf nearly killed Gowron in combat but at the last moment the impostor was revealed to be disguised as Gowron&#x27;s military adviser General Martok. The discovery helped restore peace between the Federation and the Klingons and to Worf again being shunned by Gowron for not having killed him when he had the chance, reaffirming his dishonor. (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Broken Link&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;).

In early 2373, Worf became involved with DS9 science officer Jadzia Dax, a Trill woman. She was familiar with Klingon customs due to the experience of the Dax symbiont&#x27;s previous host, Curzon. She was the first non-Klingon that Worf could &quot;physically&quot; be with in the traditional Klingon way, although it still left bruises, cuts and broken bones.

While on a mission to the Gamma Quadrant, Worf was captured by the Dominion and sent to a Jem&#x27;Hadar prison camp where he met the real General Martok and was reunited with the real Dr. Bashir, who had both been captured and replaced by changelings. While the prisoners worked to escape, Worf entered a daily round of combat with each of the guards in turn. He earned the respect and admiration of Martok and even of the guards because he would not yield. Once the prisoners escaped, they managed to warn the station about the Bashir-changeling.

Upon their return, Martok was assigned command of the Klingon detachment on Deep Space Nine and command of the IKS &quot;Rotarran&quot;. Martok asked Worf to be his first officer. The ship had suffered many losses to the Dominion, and morale was low. Martok&#x27;s refusal to engage the enemy, due to his Dominion incarceration, made things worse. Worf challenged him for command, but allowed Martok to win and retain command. This led to Martok regaining his warrior&#x27;s courage and, with renewed vigor, he led the crew to their first victory against the Dominion. Understanding what Worf had done, Martok thanked him for reminding him of his duty as a soldier and offered him a place in his house as his brother. By joining the House of Martok, Worf&#x27;s status in the empire was restored (albeit the House of Mogh remains stricken). Worf&#x27;s son, Alexander, was also assigned to the &quot;Rotarran&quot; after joining the Klingon Defense Force. Though Worf was initially estranged by his now adult son, and skeptical of his son&#x27;s desire to serve the Empire, he eventually reconciled with him, and his son joined the House of Martok as well. Worf continued to serve on the &quot;Rotarran&quot; after Sisko withdrew from DS9 at the beginning of the Dominion War.

When Sisko eventually returned with a fleet of Federation ships to retake the station, Worf and Martok lobbied Gowron to send Klingon ships to join the battle. The entry of the Klingon ships turned the tide and allowed the Defiant to break through and retake the station (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Favor the Bold&quot;, &quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot;).

Having helped liberate the station, Worf and Jadzia decided to get married. The wedding was a traditional Klingon ceremony which included a series of trials on Jadzia&#x27;s part in order to gain the approval of Martok&#x27;s wife to join the House of Martok. This almost ended in disaster, as the free-spirited Jadzia felt forced into a position rather than taking the matter seriously enough. Eventually, realizing its importance to Worf and counseled by Sisko that she needed to mature, Jadzia yielded and she was allowed to marry Worf. (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;You Are Cordially Invited&quot;).

In the &quot;DS9&quot; episode &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, Worf prematurely ended a mission to contact a Cardassian informant inside the Dominion in order to save his injured wife. The informant was subsequently executed by the Dominion, causing Captain Sisko to officially caution that Starfleet might not grant Worf his own command after this incident (being another official reprimand in Worf&#x27;s records of consequence). However, Sisko added that, had he been forced to choose between his duty and his wife, he would have done the same thing.

By late 2374, Worf and Jadzia were married less than a year when they decided to try to have a child, despite the extreme difficulties posed by the disparate biologies of Trill and Klingons. While Worf was away during a mission, Jadzia visited the Bajoran temple on the station where she was attacked and killed by an alien possessing the body of Gul Dukat, who had come aboard the station to destroy an Orb of the Prophet. (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Time&#x27;s Orphan&quot;, &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;)

Julian Bashir was able to save the Dax symbiont, which was sent back to the Trill homeworld to be rejoined with a new host aboard the USS &quot;Destiny&quot;. When the symbiont&#x27;s health worsened, the Dax symbiont was implanted into a new host named Ezri Dax, who was the assistant ship&#x27;s counselor. She had not been trained to be a host, but she was the only available unjoined Trill aboard. Ezri had difficulty making the transition and sought out Ben Sisko on Earth.

In 2375, Worf led a mission to destroy a Dominion shipyard. He dedicated this mission to his late wife, in order to ensure her entry into Sto-Vo-kor, the Valhalla-like realm of the honored dead, being joined by Quark, Bashir and O&#x27;Brien (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Shadows and Symbols&quot;).

Ezri helped Sisko on his mission, and then returned to DS9 with him (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Shadows and Symbols&quot;). She accepted his request to stay on as station counselor. Worf avoided Ezri at first, confused about what to do about this new situation. Her quick posting to DS9 led to a number of awkward moments between her and Worf, since the new host carried all the memories of their former hosts but had its own distinct personality, despite their shared past. Also, it was considered taboo on Trill for new hosts to fraternize with former lovers. After a brief rekindling of their feelings for one another, they decided that things were just too different and, eventually, the two settled into a comfortable friendship, with Ezri eventually becoming romantically involved with Julian Bashir (who previously had feelings for Jadzia). This allowed Worf to accept &#x27;his&#x27; Jadzia to have her place into Sto-Vo-Kor.

In 2375, Worf became concerned with the leadership of Gowron. The entry of the Breen into the war on the side of the Dominion temporarily sidelined the Federation and Romulan fleets, which proved vulnerable to Breen weaponry. This left the Klingons alone to carry on the fight as their ships were not affected in the same manner. Gowron assumed direct command because he feared Martok&#x27;s growing popularity and devised a plan to discredit Martok. He began ordering Martok on near-suicidal missions against Dominion forces, hoping that a string of defeats would weaken Martok&#x27;s popularity and discredit him as a military leader. Recognizing that Gowron was jeopardizing the entire war effort for the sake of his personal pride, Worf tried to convince Martok that he should challenge Gowron for the leadership. After Martok refused, Worf challenged Gowron himself, citing his faulty battle planning, his dishonorable conduct in trying to discredit Martok, and poor strategies at the later stages of the Dominion War. After a brief battle, Worf killed Gowron; by right, he was proclaimed the new chancellor of the Klingon High Council. However, Worf declined in favor of Martok (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Tacking Into the Wind&quot;). Ironically, it was again by Worf&#x27;s hand the next chancellor of the Empire was decided (having slain Duras to allow Gowron&#x27;s ascension after K&#x27;mpec&#x27;s death), and the second time he and Gowron dueled, this time finishing Gowron off. As a token of respect, Worf performed the Klingon Death Howl after Gowron&#x27;s death, essentially forgiving his misdeeds and recognizing a worthy warrior was on his way to Sto-Vo-Kor.

After the conclusion of the Dominion War, Worf was offered the position of the Federation ambassador to Qo&#x27;noS (the Klingon homeworld), as depicted in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; series finale &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek&quot; films===
Worf continued to appear in &quot;TNG&quot; films, which is explained in various ways, such as being rescued from the damaged &quot;Defiant&quot; during a battle with the Borg (&quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;) and taking leave that led to him traveling on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; (&quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;). &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; was released after the conclusion of &quot;DS9&quot; and Worf&#x27;s status at this time is unclear, although the novelization stated that Worf returned to Starfleet as he found life as an ambassador unsatisfying. Worf attended the wedding of William Riker and Deanna Troi on Earth and traveled to Betazed with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew for the second wedding ceremony when the ship was diverted to investigate positronic signals from a system near the Romulan border.

===&quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;===
By the time of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, Worf has become a subcontractor for Starfleet Intelligence, having attained the rank of Captain and briefly commanded the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E beforehand. Worf has mellowed with age, no longer giving in to impulse; even adopting a fondness for meditation and tea in his free time, having seemingly given up Klingon opera. It&#x27;s also revealed that something happened to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E under Worf&#x27;s command that renders it unusable by the time of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, something that Worf insists was not his fault.

A contact (heavily implied to be Odo) has made Worf aware that a group of Changelings objected to the Dominion&#x27;s surrender and began a campaign against the Federation, prompting Worf to mount an investigation into their activities, assisted by Raffi Musiker and supervised by Ro Laren. Worf and Raffi interrogate multiple criminal co-conspirators, including the Ferengi Sneed and the Vulcan Krinn, finding that the Changeling group has infiltrated the highest levels of Starfleet and burgled its most advanced lab the Daystrom Institute to restart the Dominion War. He is reunited with Picard and the rest of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew, including a resurrected Data, throughout the third season, whereupon he helps Picard defeat the Changelings&#x27; collaborators, the Borg, once and for all using the rebuilt &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. Worf also helps Musiker reunite with her estranged family by secretly leaking her heroic deeds to them. He is last seen playing poker with his &quot;Enterprise&quot; crewmates at the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles, content with his life.

=== Alternate versions ===
In 2370 after returning from a tournament, Worf encountered a quantum fissure and began shifting into different realities. In one reality, he became involved with Deanna Troi while recovering from a spinal injury. He asked permission from Commander Riker to court Troi. By the time the events in this episode takes place, he has been married to her for two years. In another reality, Worf is first officer of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, serving under Capt. Riker, who assumed command after Capt. Picard was killed by the Borg. He is married to Deanna Troi and has a daughter Shannara Rozhenko and a son Eric Christopher Rozhenko. However, she doesn&#x27;t know anything about Alexander (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Parallels&quot;).

In an alternate future, Alexander becomes a diplomat instead of a warrior. He wanted to end the feuding among the great houses and declared that the House of Mogh would no longer engage in blood feuds. Worf warned him that this was a show of weakness but Alexander persisted. Shortly after Alexander&#x27;s decision, he witnesses Worf being killed on the floor of the High Council. Had he become a warrior, he thinks perhaps he could have saved his father&#x27;s life. Eventually, he finds a way to travel back in time to try to prevent these events from occurring by convincing his younger self to train to become a warrior while under the assumed name of K&#x27;Mtar, but Worf convinces him to return to the future with assurances that he has already changed his own history (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;Firstborn&quot;).

In an alternate future, Worf had been reluctant to become involved with Troi and her subsequent death led to a rift between Riker and himself as a result. He later served as a member of the Klingon High Council and was governor of the Klingon colony of H&#x27;atoria with his fellow Klingons possibly at the brink of war with the Federation after conquering the Romulan Star Empire. Nevertheless, he helps his old crewmates with the threat of an anti-time eruption, and Riker makes a conciliatory gesture to his old friend, asking for his help on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; bridge during the situation, which Worf accepts (&quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;All Good Things&quot;).

While on a mission in the Gamma Quadrant, the &quot;Defiant&quot; detects an energy barrier surrounding a planet in a nearby solar system. When they enter the barrier, the ship is damaged and they detect a settlement with 8,000 people who are mostly human. When they investigate, they learn they have been expected. The settlers explain they are the descendants of the &quot;Defiant&quot; crew. In a couple of days, when the &quot;Defiant&quot; tries to leave orbit, they will be thrown back in time two centuries and crash land on the planet. Worf learns he married and raised a family. He meets his descendant Brota who leads the Sons of Mogh. The members are descendants of Worf and Jadzia and others who choose to join them. They follow Klingon customs as first taught to them by Worf (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Children of Time&quot;).

In the mirror universe, Worf leads the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance as Regent. After Terran rebels take over Terok Nor, Worf tries to recapture the station but is defeated by the rebels who have a new ship based on the design of the &quot;Defiant&quot; from the prime universe. Enraged, Worf claimed he lost only because he had been betrayed, with the Mirror Garak blaming Intendant Kira Nerys as the likely source (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Shattered Mirror&quot;). Eventually, Worf captured her and Grand Nagus Zek who crossed over to this universe to open new markets. Worf agreed to let Zek go in exchange for a cloaking device, but the device was sabotaged and his ship was disabled, allowing the Terran rebels to capture him (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Cloak&quot;).

== Books and comics ==

Worf&#x27;s character is further developed in non-canon media. In &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the non-live action material is not considered a part of the character&#x27;s story, although it may use elements from the television and film narrative. In other words, live action appearances don&#x27;t take into account the stories written in novels for example.

According to the Pocket Books novels set after &quot;Nemesis&quot;, Worf takes over William T. Riker&#x27;s position of first officer aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E. According to &quot;Death in Winter&quot;, Worf was to transfer with Riker to the &quot;Titan&quot;, but after Data&#x27;s death, Picard asks Worf to stay aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and Worf obliges. In early 2380 in &quot;Resistance&quot;, Starfleet Command approves Picard&#x27;s request to make Worf the permanent first officer, but Worf refuses as he doubts his command skills (due to his choice of love over duty in &quot;Change of Heart&quot;). Soon afterwards, however, Worf successfully leads the rescue of Picard from another Borg crisis, and is sufficiently convinced to accept the permanent promotion. As of 2385 in the novel miniseries &quot;Star Trek: The Fall&quot;, Worf continues to remain first officer of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E. According to the Titan series, he also adopted Data&#x27;s cat Spot.

Worf had a relationship with &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E Chief of Security Jasminder Choudhury in the books until her death in the 2012 novel &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot; by David Mack.

The Pocket Books series continued in the 2016 trilogy &quot;Prey&quot;, written by John Jackson Miller. In it, Worf and the cloned Klingon Emperor Kahless are drawn into battle with a group of discommendated Klingons, all disciples of the late Kruge, the villain from the movie &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;, being manipulated by Kruge&#x27;s secret heir Korgh. By 2386, Worf&#x27;s son Alexander is an Ambassador, working alongside Admiral William Riker. The events of &quot;Prey&quot; conclude with the last survivors of the discommendated Klingons taking on roles as guardians for a planet whose previous guards were killed as part of the conspiracy, with Kahless joining them to help them learn how to be truly Klingon. As acknowledgement of Worf&#x27;s role in helping them redeem themselves, the group name the first child born during this crisis after Worf.

IDW Comics took the character in a different direction in its licensed works. In the official comic book prequel to the 2009 movie &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Worf is a General in the Klingon Empire who is dispatched to deal with Romulan Captain Nero and his significantly altered mining vessel, the &quot;Narada&quot;. When the Klingon forces suffer a crushing defeat, Worf agrees to Nero&#x27;s demand to board a shuttle and come on board the &quot;Narada&quot;. Worf takes the opportunity to surprise Nero, cutting into the &quot;Narada&#x27;s&quot; hull and fighting his way to the main bridge for a confrontation with Nero. Already prepared for such a tactic, Nero succeeds in surprising Worf by impaling him through the back with a large mechanical tentacle. When the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E arrives to do battle with the &quot;Narada&quot;, Nero agrees to beam Worf over if the ship will lower its shields. When Captain Data agrees, Worf is beamed back to the ship, giving the &quot;Narada&quot; time to fire on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. The ship suffers heavy damage, but manages to raise its shields in time to prevent a second attack. Nero then leaves the battle to continue his assault on the planet Vulcan. Worf is assumed to have survived, but this is never explicitly mentioned in the comic.

In Una McCormack&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek: Picard: The Last Best Hope&quot; – a direct prequel to &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; – Worf is promoted to Captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E in 2381 once Picard is promoted to Admiral.

== Spin-off discussions ==
Due to Worf&#x27;s popularity there was some talk of a Captain Worf series before the franchise went into the &quot;Trek&quot; re-boots. Dorn said he had tried to pitch a Captain Worf show in the 2010s, but he was not successful&quot;.&quot; The actor was reportedly offered a role as a Worf-ancestor on &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; but this did not come to fruition.

In 2012 Dorn came up with an idea for Worf show, and has pitched it at various times. He talked about his experiences pitching his idea for the character at the 2019 Keystone Comic Con.

In 2021, actor Michael Dorn said he was still interested in a movie or series with Worf, noting the success of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. He was trying to address rumors that he might appear on the show which is streamed on Paramount+.

== Critical and fan reception ==

Worf is a decidedly popular character among fans. The episode &quot;Heart of Glory&quot; (S1E20 of &quot;TNG&quot;), which focuses on Worf and his relationship to other Klingons, is credited with planting &quot;many seeds for successive Klingon storylines ... and new insights into Klingon culture&quot;.

With &quot;TNG&quot; over in 1995, the writers of &quot;DS9&quot; came up with the idea of adding Worf to the cast in response to pressure to boost ratings.&quot;Screen Rant&quot; has rated the character Worf a number of times, and by several authors, at its site. Author Edward Cambro ranks Worf as the 13th best &quot;Star Trek&quot; character overall, and remarks how Worf had to &quot;walk the line between two cultures, neither of which he entirely understood (nowhere is this more apparent than in episodes like &quot;Sins of the Father,&quot; &quot;Redemption II,&quot; and &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot;).&quot; Said cultures being Klingons and human. Then author Sara Schmidt ranks Worf the 7th most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, in between T&#x27;Pol (&quot;Enterprise&quot;) and Michael Burnham (&quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;), and in another article, she goes on to suggest ideas for a Worf spin-off, saying a young Worf would be &quot;interesting to explore&quot;, as well as a &quot;series about Worf&#x27;s experiences as a Federation ambassador to Qo&#x27;noS.&quot; Dusty Stowe then ranks the top 8 most powerful characters of &quot;Star Trek&quot; and places Worf as the most powerful between Spock and Q.

&quot;TheWrap&quot; rates Worf as the 9th best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, saying that he &quot;started the trend of turning enemies from past series into complex characters who became vital Starfleet crew members despite cultural differences.&quot;

SyFy rated Worf as the 2nd greatest Klingon of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. The author explains that Worf is only in second place because he was raised by humans and relies mostly on honor. He goes on to admit, &quot;Michael Dorn created a &quot;Trek&quot; legend here, there can be no doubt.&quot;

&quot;Den of Geek&quot; places four squarely Worf-centric episodes (one of which is a two-parter) in its list of 25 &quot;must-watch&quot; &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes which include &quot;The Emissary&quot;, &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;, &quot;Reunion&quot;, &quot;Redemption&quot; (Parts I &amp; II).

Worf is ranked the 13th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, beating out such favorites as Uhura. To be included in this list, characters must be Starfleet personnel or crew, plus in original media only.

&quot;IndieWire&quot; ranked Worf as the 7th best character on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in 2017 and &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Worf as the 8th best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; in 2018.

Filk artists Ookla the Mok include a song about Worf entitled &quot;Mr. W&quot; on their 2003 album &quot;Oh Okay LA&quot;. The lyrics are a parody on why Worf would not make a good captain, since he is not afraid to die and how not everyone feels the same about that. It even includes a rap from what sounds like Worf himself, toward the end.

Musician Voltaire wrote a song called &quot;Worf&#x27;s Revenge&quot; whose lyrics detail imaginings of Worf&#x27;s likes and dislikes. In the band&#x27;s view, Worf hates tribbles and calls Barclay a &quot;lowly white P&#x27;tak.&quot;

== Prominent episodes ==
Some shows have a major subplot for the Worf character. The first of these debuted in 1988, &quot;Heart of Glory&quot; (which was S1E20 of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;) This kicked off a long-running story arc that continued until the end of &quot;DS9&quot; in 1999 on television and 2002 on film.

In the 2012 book &quot;Star Trek 101: A Practical Guide to Who, What, Where, and Why&quot; by &quot;Terry J. Erdmann,&quot; they felt &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot; was one of three key episodes for the character Worf, along with &quot;The Sword of Khaless&quot; and &quot;Sons of Mogh&quot;.

<text>Star Trek Generations is a 1994 American science fiction film and the seventh film in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; film series. Malcolm McDowell joins cast members from the 1960s television show &quot;Star Trek&quot; and the 1987 sequel series &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, including William Shatner and Patrick Stewart. In the film, Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D joins forces with Captain James T. Kirk to stop the villain Tolian Soran from destroying a planetary system in his attempt to return to an extra-dimensional realm known as the Nexus.

&quot;Generations&quot; was conceived as a transition from the original cast of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films to the cast of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;. After developing several film ideas concurrently, the producers chose a script written by Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga. Production began while the final season of the television series was being made. The director was David Carson, who previously directed episodes of the television series; photography was by franchise newcomer John A. Alonzo. Filming took place on the Paramount Studios lots, and on location in Valley of Fire State Park, Nevada, and Lone Pine, California. The film&#x27;s climax was revised and reshot following poor reception from test audiences. The film uses a mix of traditional optical effects alongside computer-generated imagery and was scored by regular &quot;Star Trek&quot; composer Dennis McCarthy.

&quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; was released in the United States on November 18, 1994. Paramount promoted the film with merchandising tie-ins, including toys, books, games, and a website—a first for a major motion picture. The film opened at the top of the United States box office its first week of release and grossed a total of $118 million worldwide. Critical reception was mixed, with critics divided on the film&#x27;s characters and comprehensibility to a casual viewer. It was followed by &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; in 1996.

==Plot==
In 2293, retired Starfleet officers James T. Kirk, Montgomery Scott, and Pavel Chekov attend the maiden voyage of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B. During the shakedown cruise, the starship is pressed into a rescue mission to save two El-Aurian refugee ships that have been snared by a massive energy ribbon. &quot;Enterprise&quot; is able to save some of the refugees before their ships are destroyed, but becomes trapped by the ribbon, and Kirk goes to a control room to help the ship escape. While &quot;Enterprise&quot; is freed, Kirk is presumed lost in space and dead after the trailing end of the ribbon tears open the ship&#x27;s hull.

In 2371, the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D is in a holodeck computer simulation, celebrating the promotion of shipmate Worf to lieutenant commander. Captain Jean-Luc Picard learns his brother and nephew have been killed in a fire and is distraught that the Picard family line will end with him. &quot;Enterprise&quot; receives a distress call from a stellar observatory, where an El-Aurian, Dr. Tolian Soran, launches a probe at the nearby star. The probe causes the star to implode, creating a shockwave that destroys its planetary system. Soran kidnaps &quot;Enterprise&quot; engineer Geordi La Forge and is transported off the station by a Klingon Bird of Prey belonging to the Duras sisters.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; crewmember Guinan tells Picard that she and Soran were among the El-Aurians rescued in 2293. Soran—who lost his family when their homeworld was destroyed—is obsessed with returning to the energy ribbon to reach the &quot;Nexus&quot;, an extra-dimensional realm of wish fulfillment that exists outside of normal space-time. Picard and Data determine that Soran, unable to safely fly a ship directly into the ribbon, is altering its path by removing the gravitational effects of nearby stars. Soran plans to destroy another star to bring the ribbon to the planet Veridian III, consequently killing millions on a nearby inhabited planet.

Upon entering the Veridian system, Picard offers himself to the Duras sisters in exchange for La Forge but insists on being transported to Soran directly. La Forge is returned to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but unwittingly exposes the ship&#x27;s defense details through the transmitter installed in his VISOR device. The Duras sisters attack, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; sustains critical damage before destroying the Bird of Prey by triggering its cloaking device, and firing photon torpedoes when its shields drop. When La Forge reports that the starship is about to suffer a warp-core breach as a result of the attack, Commander William Riker evacuates everyone to the forward saucer-section of the starship, which separates from the engineering section just before the breach occurs. The resulting shockwave sends the saucer-section crashing onto the surface of Veridian III.

Picard fails to stop Soran from launching another probe. The resulting destruction of the Veridian star alters the course of the ribbon and Picard and Soran enter the Nexus before the shockwave destroys Veridian III. Picard finds himself surrounded by an idealized family, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an &quot;echo&quot; of Guinan left behind in the Nexus. Guinan sends him to meet James T. Kirk, safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is initially entranced by the opportunity the Nexus offers to atone for past regrets, he realizes it lacks danger and excitement. Having learned that they can travel whenever and wherever desired through the Nexus, Picard convinces Kirk to return with him to Veridian III, shortly before Soran launches the probe.

Working together, Kirk and Picard distract Soran long enough for Picard to lock the probe in place; it explodes on the launchpad and kills Soran. Kirk is fatally injured in the effort and Picard buries him at the site. Three Federation starships arrive to retrieve the &quot;Enterprise&quot; survivors from Veridian III. Picard muses that given the ship&#x27;s legacy, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D will not be the last vessel to carry the name.

==Cast==

The main cast of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; reprise their roles in &quot;Generations&quot;: Patrick Stewart as Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes as Commander William Riker, LeVar Burton as Chief Engineer Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge, Brent Spiner as Lieutenant Commander Data, Gates McFadden as Chief Medical Officer Commander Beverly Crusher, Michael Dorn as Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Marina Sirtis as ship&#x27;s counselor Commander Deanna Troi. Recurring characters from the series return, including Barbara March and Gwynyth Walsh as the villainous Klingon sisters Lursa and B&#x27;Etor Duras, Patti Yasutake as &quot;Enterprise&quot; nurse Lieutenant Alyssa Ogawa, and Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan.

Malcolm McDowell plays Tolian Soran, the film&#x27;s antagonist. McDowell had worked with Stewart on stage decades earlier, and relished the chance to kill Shatner&#x27;s character. He liked his character&#x27;s spiked hair and black ensemble, and requested that his character not have alien features to avoid lengthy makeup sessions.

In the film&#x27;s initial script, the entire principal cast of &quot;The Original Series&quot; was featured, but only three members appear in the film: William Shatner as Kirk, James Doohan as Scott, and Walter Koenig as Chekov. Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley declined to appear as their characters Spock and Leonard McCoy. Nimoy felt there were story problems with the script and that Spock&#x27;s role was extraneous. Producer Rick Berman told the press, &quot;Both Leonard Nimoy and DeForest Kelley felt they made a proper goodbye in the last movie.&quot; Nimoy and Kelley&#x27;s lines were subsequently modified for Doohan and Koenig. The news that not all of the &quot;Original Series&quot; cast was in the film was not passed to all of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; actors. When Goldberg arrived on set on her first day, she immediately asked to see Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Nyota Uhura in &quot;The Original Series&quot;. When told that Nichols was not in the film, she said to Koenig, &quot;The fans have been waiting for years to see Nichelle and me and Uhura and Guinan on screen together.&quot; Patrick Stewart said that he had made an effort to ensure the original cast&#x27;s involvement in the film: &quot;I didn&#x27;t want us to sail into the future just as &quot;The Next Generation&quot; cast.&quot;
Alan Ruck plays &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B captain John Harriman. When approached for the role, Ruck assumed he would play an alien, saying, &quot;Look, when I shave every day, I don&#x27;t look in the mirror and say, &#x27;Hey! There&#x27;s a starship commander.&#x27;&quot; Berman informed him that the character was from a wealthy and connected family, and was placed in command as a stepping stone to a political career. Jacqueline Kim plays &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B helmsman Demora Sulu. Kim consulted with art supervisor Michael Okuda to make sure her hand movements and manipulations of the ships&#x27; controls were consistent and accurate. Glenn Morshower played an &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B navigator; he apologized to the director for a poor first rehearsal, because as a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan he was unused to performing along with actors he had idolized for years.

Many of the minor characters throughout the film appeared in different roles in the television series. Tim Russ, who appears as an &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B bridge officer, played a terrorist in &quot;Starship Mine&quot; and a Klingon in &quot;Invasive Procedures&quot;, and later joined the cast of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; as the Vulcan Tuvok. Various background roles were played by the main cast&#x27;s stunt doubles.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1992, months before the official announcement of a followup to &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;, Paramount Pictures executives approached &quot;The Next Generation&quot; producer Rick Berman about creating another feature film. Berman informed writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga that Paramount had approved a two-picture deal approximately midway through &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s sixth season. Moore and Braga, convinced Berman had called them into his office to tell them &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was cancelled and they were out of a job, were instead given the task of writing the film. Berman also worked with former &quot;Next Generation&quot; producer Maurice Hurley to develop possible story ideas, intending to develop two film scripts simultaneously and prioritize whichever was most promising. Executive producer Michael Piller turned down the opportunity to develop ideas, objecting to what he saw as a competition for the job. Moore and Braga&#x27;s script was ultimately chosen. The writers spent weeks developing the story with Berman, before taking a working vacation in May 1993 to write the first-draft screenplay, completed June 1.

Moore described &quot;Generations&quot; as a project with several required elements. Berman felt that having the original cast of the previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; films felt like a &quot;good way to pass the baton&quot; to the next series. The studio wanted the original cast to only appear in the first minutes and Kirk only recurring at the end of the film. Other requests included a Khan Noonien Singh-like antagonist, Klingons, and a humorous Data plot. At one point, the writers toyed with the idea of pitting the two crews against each other. &quot;We were obsessed with the poster image of the two &quot;Enterprises&quot; locked in combat: &quot;Kirk vs. Picard, One Must Die!&quot;&quot; said Moore. Ultimately, the writers could not come up with a plausible explanation for such a conflict, and abandoned the idea.

In the initial draft of the screenplay, the original series cast appeared in a prologue, and Guinan served as the bridge between the two generations. The opening shot would have been the entire cast crammed into an elevator, happy to be back together. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D&#x27;s destruction also appeared—the saucer crash had first been proposed by Moore as the conclusion to part one of a sixth-season cliffhanger story that was scrapped. Kirk&#x27;s death was developed in Braga, Moore, and Berman&#x27;s story sessions. Moore recalled that &quot;we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, so what are the profound things in a man&#x27;s life he has to face? Mortality tops the list.&quot; After the idea of killing off a &quot;Next Generation&quot; cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. &quot;We all sorta looked around and said, &#x27;That might be it,&#x27; &quot; Moore said. The studio and Shatner had few concerns about the plot point.

Refining the script meant facing the realities of budget constraints. The initial proposal included location shooting in Hawaii, Idaho, and the Midwestern United States, and the total budget was over $30 million. The budget dropped to $25 million after negotiations. A revised version of the script from March 1994 incorporated feedback from the producers, studio, actors, and director. The writers changed one sequence where Harriman trained his predecessors in the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B&#x27;s operation after Shatner felt the scene&#x27;s joke went too far. Picard&#x27;s personal tragedy was written as his brother Robert&#x27;s heart attack, but Stewart suggested the loss of his entire family to add emotional impact. The opening sequence took place on the solar observatory with two Rosencrantz and Guildenstern-influenced characters talking shortly before an enemy attack; &quot;Next Generation&quot; writer Jeri Taylor suggested that the opening should be something &quot;fun&quot;, leading to the switch to the holodeck scene.

Nimoy turned down the chance to direct the feature. The producers chose David Carson. The British director had no feature film experience, but had directed several episodes of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, including the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; and the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; pilot &quot;Emissary&quot;.

===Design===
&quot;Star Trek&quot; veteran Herman Zimmerman served as production designer, collaborating with illustrator John Eaves for many designs. Zimmerman&#x27;s approach to realizing a vision of the future was to take existing designs and use them in a different manner to express living in the future. Taking cues from director Nicholas Meyer&#x27;s approach to &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, Zimmerman noted that future humanity will still have the same furniture needs, so a logical approach was to start with what would remain the same and work from there.

Transitioning from television to film meant that sets and designs needed to be more detailed, with a higher level of polish to stand up on the big screen. Zimmerman felt obliged to improve the sets fans had watched for seven seasons, especially the bridge. Zimmerman repainted the set, added computer consoles, raised the captain&#x27;s chair for a more commanding presence, and reworked the bridge&#x27;s ceiling struts; he had always been unhappy with how the ceiling looked, but never had the time or money to rework it.

The script called for an entirely new location on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D: stellar cartography. The script described the location as a small room with maps on one wall. Finding the concept uninteresting, Zimmerman designed a three-story circular set to give the impression the actors were inside a star map dominated by screens. Zimmerman&#x27;s previous work designing a crisis management center influenced the design. The backlit starmaps that covered three-quarters of the wall would have been infeasible to create in the years before the rise of large-format inkjet printers and computer graphics software. The starmaps were replaced with a bluescreen for scenes where the static images would be replaced by computer-animated star maps by Santa Barbara Studios. Stellar cartography was one of the largest sets ever constructed on a Paramount lot.

The film marked the first appearance of the starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B. The ship was a modification of the &quot;Excelsior&quot;, a model designed and built by Bill George and effects house Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) for &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; a decade earlier. Co-producer Peter Lauritson, illustrator John Eaves, and Zimmerman designed the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B with additions to its hull, some of which were added so that they could depict damage to the ship without harming the underlying model&#x27;s surface, and to improve the look of the ship when it was filmed from angles called for in the script. The ship&#x27;s bridge was based on previous designs for the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A and &quot;Excelsior&quot; sets Zimmerman had created for &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;, using pieces from each. The surrounding spacedock for &quot;Enterprise&quot; maiden voyage was a modification of the model created for &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979), refurbished and modified to better fit the film&#x27;s anamorphic screen frame.

Like Zimmerman, George took the opportunity of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D&#x27;s screen debut to touch up the model. Because &quot;Generations&quot; featured the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D separating into its saucer and engineering sections, the original model built by ILM for the television series was removed from storage. The model was stripped, rewired, and its surface detailed to stand up to scrutiny. George changed the paint job, as he recalled they had been in a rush to prepare the model for television and its green-and-blue color scheme did not properly read on film. The paint scheme was shifted towards a &quot;battleship grey&quot;, with glossy tiled areas reminiscent of the original feature film &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

While &quot;Generations&quot; made use of new sets and props, set decorator John M. Dwyer reused existing props or made new ones out of premade materials where possible, rather than spend money on new items: a torture device was created from a birthing chair, nose hair clippers, and flashlights; packing materials formed the shapes of set walls for the Bird of Prey bridge; and Soran&#x27;s missile used a bird feeder and other garden store supplies for its interior elements. The stellar observatory set was filled with props from &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, with some added in deliberate nods to past episodes. Other reused sets included the Klingon bridge built for &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; and ribbed plastic walls in the Jefferies tubes, repurposed from the sets of &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Original set pieces and props included paintings for the settings in the Nexus.

Robert Blackman, &quot;The Next Generation&quot; long-serving costume designer re-designed the Starfleet uniforms which the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D crew would wear in the film. Blackman crafted militaristic-looking uniforms with rank sleeves inspired by &quot;The Original Series&quot;, high collars, and jackets reminiscent of the uniforms developed for &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot;. The redesign was abandoned, and the cast wore combinations of the uniforms from &quot; The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;; the only new addition was an Eaves-designed angular communications badge that replaced the previous oval shape. Time was so short that Jonathan Frakes and Levar Burton borrowed the costumes from &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; actors Avery Brooks and Colm Meaney. Also created by Blackman was a skydiving outfit worn by Shatner; though the scene was cut from the film, the costume was used in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Extreme Risk&quot;.

===Filming===

Berman backed Carson&#x27;s choice to hire John A. Alonzo, the director of photography for &quot;Chinatown&quot; and &quot;Scarface&quot;. Alonzo was shown more than a dozen &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes to familiarize himself with the franchise. He favored lighting scenes as much as possible from within the sets rather than staging lights and flags for each shot. Carson credited this approach with saving time and allowing more freedom when shooting. He later wrote that the production moved at a &quot;TV-like&quot; pace; principal photography concluded after 51 days.

Filming commenced on March 28, 1994. &quot;Generations&quot; and &quot;The Next Generation&quot; were filmed simultaneously on different soundstages on the Paramount Studios lot. Scenes that did not feature the television series regulars were filmed first, starting with those in the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B deflector room. The scenes of Harriman, Chekov, and Scott reacting to Kirk&#x27;s apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the deflector room to be suitably distressed to visualize the damage.

Stage 7 was where the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B&#x27;s bridge, deflector room, and corridors were built and filmed. The jolts and shocks of the ship in the hold of the energy ribbon were created by camera bumps and motors to shake the set. Filming of the scenes took place in April 1994, while residents were still skittish from the recent 1994 Northridge earthquake; the effects staff deliberately hid the set shakers until cameras were rolling to elicit more genuine reactions. The stellar observatory set was an elaborate redress of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B&#x27;s bridge, with added levels and swapped walls changing the layout. Control panels styled after those in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series helped suggest the age of the station.

The cast of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; started filming their scenes for &quot;Generations&quot; four days after wrapping on the show. After the filming of the series was complete, there were only six months remaining before the film&#x27;s release date. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D crash scenes were filmed mid-May 1994, and were among the last remaining shots before the existing &quot;Next Generation&quot; sets were demolished to make way for &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. As a result, the crew distressed the sets for the crash damage more than would have been normal during the series&#x27; run.
Despite the budget cuts, &quot;Generations&quot; shot many scenes on location. The rushed pace of filming meant that not all locations had been selected before the start of principal photography, and the production was still scouting locations until two weeks before the final scenes. The production exhausted possible options within Los Angeles&#x27; studio zone and looked up to away for suitable locations. The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D promotion ceremony on the holodeck was filmed on , a full-scale replica of the first American sailing ship to visit Japan. Carson fought hard to keep the shoot during budget trims, deciding to sacrifice other days in the schedule to keep the scene. &quot;Lady Washington&quot; was anchored at Marina del Rey and sailed out a few miles from shore over five days of shooting. Some of &quot;Lady Washington&quot; crew appeared amongst &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew members.

Picard&#x27;s house in the Nexus was a private home in Pasadena, California; almost all the furnishings were custom props or outside items. Portions of the scene were shot in May 1994, followed by new shoots five months later. The revisions included adding Picard&#x27;s nephew René to his imagined Christmas celebration with his family. The house of Kirk&#x27;s Nexus recollections was located in Lone Pine, California, with the cabin filled with props to represent Kirk&#x27;s career, from a Klingon bat&#x27;leth to a painting of his &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Carson wanted a suitably remote and alien mountain location for the film&#x27;s climax at Soran&#x27;s compound. The scenes were filmed over eight days on an elevated plateau in the &quot;Valley of Fire&quot;, north-east of Las Vegas, Nevada. The rise&#x27;s height and sloped sides required cast and crew to climb using safety ropes and carry all provisions and equipment with them. The heat was difficult for all involved, especially Shatner, who wore a wool costume. Safety harnesses and wires used to keep performers safe from tumbling off a precipice were removed digitally in postproduction.

As originally filmed, Kirk was shot in the back and killed by Soran. Test audiences reacted negatively to the death, so the scene was rewritten and reshot over two weeks so that Kirk sacrifices himself by leaping across a broken walkway to retrieve Soran&#x27;s control pad and de-cloak the probe. Paramount allowed the film to go over budget to $35 million for the re-shoots. As the production crew had already spent weeks removing traces of their shoot from the Valley of Fire, the set had to be rebuilt under a very tight schedule, followed by effects work to remove wires and rigging in time for the footage to be included in the final cut.

===Effects===
&quot;Generations&quot;″ special effects tasks were split between the television series&#x27; effects vendors and ILM. ILM CG Supervisor John Schlag recalled that it was easy to recruit staff who wanted to work on &quot;Star Trek&quot;; working on the film &quot;gave me a chance to be a part of the whole &quot;Trek&quot; thing ... ILM is practically an entire company filled with &quot;Trek&quot; geeks&quot;. The screenwriters filled the initial drafts with exciting—and expensive—effects. Effects supervisor John Knoll&#x27;s team then storyboarded the effects sequences, figuring out how to best service the script as cheaply as possible. When even those estimates proved too costly, ILM continued cutting shots. &quot;[We had] nothing left to cut, and we still had to cut stuff out,&quot; Knoll recalled.

Previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; films had used conventional motion control techniques to record multiple passes of the starship models and miniatures. For &quot;Generations&quot;, the effects artists began using computer-generated imagery (CGI) and models for certain shots. No physical shooting models were built for the refugee ships, although George recalled that he created a quick physical miniature for CG modeler Rob Coleman to develop his ideas from, rather than try to articulate his feedback without it. Other CG elements included the solar collapses and the Veridian III planet. Knoll used a digital version of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D for the warp effect; the limitations of the motion-control programming and slitscan effect for the original meant that the effect &quot;barely holds up&quot;, Knoll said, whereas the CG recreation could keep consistent lighting throughout. While digital techniques were used for many sequences and ships, a few new models were physically built; these included the observatory, built by model shop foreman John Goodson.

The climactic battle between the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the Klingons over Veridian III was accomplished using traditional motion control, but without the budget for practical explosions and special breakaway models, impacts and battle damage were simulated with practical compositing tricks and computer-generated effects. The destruction of the Bird of Prey was a reuse of footage from &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;. Weapons fire and energy bolts were hand-animated, but Knoll had a different idea for the photon torpedoes. A fan of the impressive, arcing look of the torpedoes from &quot;The Motion Picture&quot;, Knoll scanned in footage from the film and turned to computer-generated effects. A simulator program created a similar look that could be animated from any point the effects artists wanted, without the expense and tedium required—shining lasers through a crystal in a smoky environment—to recreate the look optically.
Carson described the Nexus energy ribbon as the true villain of the film; ILM was responsible for conceiving what the ribbon would look like with no natural frame of reference. &quot;When creating something from scratch, it&#x27;s always important to rough out the whole thing... because there are so many paths you can explore, it&#x27;s easy to get bogged down,&quot; recalled effects co-supervisor Alex Seiden, who had worked as a technical director on the planetary explosion of Praxis from &quot;The Undiscovered Country&quot;. Knoll decided the ribbon was a rip through universes, filled with chaotic energy, taking inspiration from images he had seen of magnetic fields around Uranus from a Jet Propulsion Laboratory simulation. The airfoil-shaped core of the undulating ribbon was enhanced with electrical tendrils. To sell the ribbon&#x27;s vastness in space shots where no sense of scale would be available, Seiden and George created a debris field of embers that trailed the ribbon. The inside of the ribbon was conceptualized as similar to a dense electrical storm, with electricity fogging the screen. Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B should be CG models. To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the physical model appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the physical model, with the computer-generated model&#x27;s textures taken from photos of the physical model, shot in flat light with a long lens. The tendril strike that sends Kirk into the Nexus was simulated with the layering of multiple pieces of animation, including CG explosions Knoll rendered on his personal computer and a recycled explosion effect from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D crash sequence was filmed in a forest floor set extended by matte paintings, built outside so ILM could use natural light. A model &quot;Enterprise&quot; saucer was constructed specifically for the shots; the model&#x27;s size gave it the right sense of scale for flying dirt and debris, an illusion enhanced by shooting with a high-speed camera to give the saucer the expected slow movement of a massive object. ILM shot its crew members walking about their parking lot and matted the footage onto the top of the saucer to represent Starfleet personnel evacuating the saucer section.

===Music===

Dennis McCarthy, the principal composer for &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, was given the task of writing &quot;Generations&quot;″ score. McCarthy became the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; composer to work on both television and film projects. Critic Jeff Bond wrote that while McCarthy&#x27;s score was &quot;tasked with straddling the styles of both series&quot;, it offered the opportunity for the composer to produce stronger dramatic writing. The film&#x27;s opening music is a choral piece that plays while a floating champagne bottle tumbles through space. For the action scenes with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B, McCarthy used low brass chords. Kirk was given a brass motif accented by snare drums (a sound not used on &quot;The Next Generation&quot;), while the scene ends with dissonant notes as Scott and Chekov discover Kirk has been blown into space.

McCarthy expanded his brassy style for the film&#x27;s action sequences, such as the battle over Veridian III and the crash-landing of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. For Picard&#x27;s trip to the Nexus, more choral music and synthesizers accompany Picard&#x27;s discovery of his family. A broad fanfare—the film&#x27;s only distinct theme—first plays when Picard and Kirk meet. This theme blends McCarthy&#x27;s theme for Picard from &quot;The Next Generation&quot; first season, notes from the theme for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, and Alexander Courage&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme. For the final battle of Kirk and Picard against Soran, McCarthy used staccato music to accentuate the fistfight. For Kirk&#x27;s death, McCarthy mated lyrical strings with another statement of the Courage theme, while a shot of Picard standing over Kirk&#x27;s grave is scored with more pomp. The Courage theme plays again at the film&#x27;s close.

The original soundtrack was released in 1994 on cassette tape and CD. In 2013, GNP Crescendo Records rereleased the soundtrack as a two-disc, expanded collector&#x27;s edition including previously unheard tracks.

==Release==
===Marketing===
The marketing of &quot;Generations&quot; included a website, the first to officially publicize a motion picture. The site was a success, being viewed millions of times worldwide in the weeks leading to the film&#x27;s release, at a time when fewer than a million Americans had internet access. Paramount also promoted the film on the Prodigy online service.

Tie-in merchandise released to promote the film included collectible cups and calendars from Jack in the Box, promotional kiosks at Kmart stores, and action figures. Due to production timelines, these figures wore the Blackman-designed Starfleet uniforms that were ultimately unused in the film itself. Other collectibles included a 600,000-run special issue of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; dedicated to the film, and stamps and souvenir sheets produced by Guyana. A novelization of the film written by J. M. Dillard spent three weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. Paramount&#x27;s licensing group estimated promotional partners could add up to $15 million in the film&#x27;s support.

Several tie-in video games were released to tie in with the film&#x27;s release. Absolute Entertainment published &quot;Star Trek VII: Generations: Beyond the Nexus&quot; for the Game Boy and the Game Gear handheld devices. Three years after the film, MicroProse produced &quot;Star Trek VII: Generations&quot;, which featured the film&#x27;s cast as voice actors. The game roughly followed the plot of the film with most of the game played in a first-person perspective.

Versions of the film&#x27;s script leaked out in advance of the film. A bootleg script revealed the energy ribbon and Kirk&#x27;s death; James Doohan confirmed the script&#x27;s authenticity at a fan convention in March 1994, but his agent denied he had seen the finished script. In September, another copy of the film&#x27;s script leaked onto the internet. As a result, news of Kirk&#x27;s death was widespread.

===Box office===
&quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; was previewed in the United States and Canada on November 17, 1994, and grossed $3 million from 1,525 theaters. The film opened to a wide release in 2,659 theaters the following day and grossed $23.1 million during the opening weekend, averaging $8,694 per theatre. It was the highest-grossing film during the first week of its release in the United States, staying in the top ten for a further four weeks. The film went on to gross $75,671,125 in the United States and Canada and $42,400,000 internationally, making $118 million worldwide against a $35 million budget. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Generations&quot; opened on February 10, 1995, at number one with £2,040,000. In Japan, the film grossed $1.2 million its opening weekend, a large amount considering the franchise&#x27;s usual poor performance in that market. Given its moderate budget, &quot;Generations&quot;″s gross was considered a success.

==Reception==
&quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; earned mixed reviews from critics and fans. The film holds a 47% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55 out of 100 based on 22 critics, indicating average reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B+. Writing about the film decades later, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described the film as divisive, and &quot;Tor.com&quot; noted the film had been picked apart for years by fans and the film&#x27;s own writers. In 2001, the BBC gave it 2 of 5 stars, summarizing, &quot;Devotees may find it necessary (if depressing) viewing.&quot;

Critics complained the film felt like an overly-long episode of the television series. The &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; Jay Boyar agreed, but said the film minimized the television series&#x27; tendency to &quot;bog down&quot; by moving to the next scene before boredom could set in. Kenneth Turan called the film safe, and said that it relied heavily on viewers&#x27; appreciation for the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. Jay Carr of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; described the film as &quot;reassuringly predictable&quot;, saying that it featured elements that would be recognizable by the fans of both series but that the lack of surprises was a benefit.

&quot;Cinefantastique&quot; Steve Biodrowski praised some of the big-budget touches the film brought to the franchise, but wrote that most of the attempts such as John Alonzo&#x27;s cinematography seemed to backfire. In contrast, Carrie Rickey of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Chris Cummins praised Alonzo&#x27;s work as one of the few bright spots of the film; &quot;[Alonzo] makes the &quot;Enterprise&quot; look like an actual lived-in starship,&quot; Cummins wrote, and &quot;for the first time ever, the crew of the Enterprise-D looked like they were truly in outer space&quot;. Elizabeth Renzetti from &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; praised the film for its special effects, but felt they were not strong enough to cover the weak plotting.

Opinions were divided on whether or not the film was accessible to non-&quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. Critics such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Janet Maslin suggested that despite being &quot;predictably flabby and impenetrable in places&quot; and suffering from technobabble, there was enough action and spectacle to engage others. Boyar felt that specific plot beats would fly over the heads of casual viewers, but the film&#x27;s innate sense of fun would keep them engaged. Others considered the film inaccessible to neophytes, and too preoccupied with fan-focused elements that detracted from the overall story, with Roger Ebert critiquing the movie as being &quot;...so concerned with in-jokes and updates for Trekkers that it [could] barely tear itself away long enough to tell a story&quot;.

The meeting of Kirk and Picard prompted comparisons between the two respective actors; Stewart&#x27;s performance was often considered superior. James Berardinelli and Ebert wrote that Kirk&#x27;s lack of presence through much of the film was still keenly felt. Biodrowski, in contrast, wrote that Shatner&#x27;s hammy acting was a better fit for the film than Stewart&#x27;s subtle delivery. Boyar thought Shatner did a good job playing a straight man in the final sequences and injecting more fun into the film. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; Stephen Hunter considered Shatner and Stewart emblematic of two different eras of stardom, and that Stewart&#x27;s commanding presence &quot;wipes poor, saintly old Shatner off the screen&quot;. &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; and others criticized the scenes between Kirk and Picard as lacking.

McDowell&#x27;s turn as Soran received differing opinions. Berardinelli and Rickey called Soran a weak and ill-defined villain, and Hunter dismissed Soran as a nemesis unworthy of the titanic meeting of Kirk and Picard. &quot;People&quot; Ralph Novak called Soran a &quot;standard-issue &quot;Trek&quot; villain&quot;, while Maslin, &quot;Newsweek&quot; Michel Marriott, and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum enjoyed the performance. Novak wrote that Data&#x27;s subplot of learning about emotions was a highlight and probably the most enjoyable part of the film for non-fans, while Ebert said that the premise &quot;could have led to some funny scenes, but doesn&#x27;t&quot;. Coates summed up the subplot as &quot;dreary&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Generations&quot; was released on LaserDisc in the United States on July 18, 1995, followed by a September release in Japan. It was also released on the United Kingdom in 1995 in the PAL format. The film was released in the UK on VHS on 28 December 1998. It was given a DVD release in 1998, with a non-anamorphic transfer and no special features. It later received a British DVD release on October 2, 2000. A new anamorphic transfer formed the basis of a 2004 special edition, with audio and text commentaries and special featurettes. The film was released on Blu-ray in 2009 as part of a box set of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; films, along with additional material. The four &quot;Next Generation&quot; feature films were released on Ultra HD Blu-ray on April 4, 2023, in standalone and collected formats.

<text>Odo , played by René Auberjonois, is a fictional character in the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. He is a member of a shape-shifting species called Changelings and serves as the head of security for the space station Deep Space Nine on which the show is set. Intelligent, observant, and taciturn, Odo uses his unique abilities throughout the show to maintain security on the DS9 station and later aids the Bajoran people and the Federation throughout the Dominion War against his own people, the Founders.

==Overview==
=== &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; ===
The original &quot;Writer&#x27;s Bible&quot; from 1992 for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; described Odo as follows:

Actor René Auberjonois describes Odo as &quot;a very unformed being&quot; who was &quot;trying to get some kind of shape to his life&quot;. Co-creator of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, Michael Piller, speaks of Odo&#x27;s role within the show as being prompted by needing &quot;a character who represented the traditions of Spock and Data, the outsider who looks in at humanity.&quot;

Late in the fifth season, in the episode &quot;Children of Time&quot;, an Odo who has lived an additional 200 years tells the &quot;current&quot; Kira Nerys that he has loved her from the time their friendship first began. With this revelation, Kira and the &quot;current&quot; Odo eventually become a couple.

According to the backstory of the series, Odo was found adrift in his natural gelatinous state in the Denorios Belt in the Bajoran system. Doctor Mora Pol studied him for seven years, not initially recognising him as a sentient being. Mora and his fellow Bajoran scientists, not sure of what Odo actually was, initially had placed him in a sample container which they labelled &quot;unknown sample&quot;. This was translated by their Cardassian supervisors as odo&#x27;ital, which literally means &quot;nothing&quot;. Doctor Mora was later compelled to recognise Odo&#x27;s sentience when he copied a beaker on a laboratory table. Even after it became clear that Odo was indeed sentient, the Bajoran scientists kept calling him &quot;odo&#x27;ital&quot;, styling it like a Bajoran name (&quot;Odo Ital&quot;).

Later on the story was slowly developed: Over 200 years before, the Changelings&#x27; Great Link (a planet in the Gamma Quadrant where Changelings exist in their natural gelatinous form) had sent out 100 Changeling infants in containers throughout the universe in order to see how other alien races react to the presence of Changelings. Other than Odo, of those sent out, three have been accounted for:

* An unnamed Changeling which took the shape of a key in a locket, which ended up in possession of Constable Odo (&quot;Vortex&quot;).
* An infant Changeling. Bought by Odo from Quark, Odo tries to teach the infant shapeshifting abilities. However, the infant is dying due to radiation poisoning. It &quot;joins&quot; with Odo so that he can regain his shapeshifting powers (&quot;The Begotten&quot;).
* Laas. Over 200 years old, he ended up on the Valara planet where the name &quot;Laas&quot; means &quot;changeable&quot;. He left when he realized that he was only being tolerated and would never be accepted. He ended up on Deep Space Nine. He killed a Klingon in self-defense who was going to assault him and, with the help of Major Kira, he escaped. He vows to search the Alpha Quadrant in order to find the other missing &quot;Hundred Changelings&quot; like himself, in order to create a new Great Link (&quot;Chimera&quot;).

In a battle with a Changeling spy, Odo ended up killing him and thus breaking the most important rule of the Changelings (no Changeling must ever hurt another). He was punished by being changed by the Great Link into becoming a &quot;solid&quot;. He regained his powers in the process of trying to save a dying Changeling. Although his deepest desire is to rejoin the Great Link, he is reluctant to do so due to the mad crusade of the &quot;Female Changeling / Founder&quot; for total war against every solid in the Alpha Quadrant. In the last episode, Odo rejoins the Great Link, saving them from being totally destroyed (&quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;).

Odo is tacitly mentioned in the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, set two decades after &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, as still being among the Great Link and having informed Worf of a rogue group of Changelings plotting a terrorist attack against the Federation.

In &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;, a holographic version of Odo appears in &quot;Kobayashi&quot; as a part of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D bridge crew during Dal R&#x27;El&#x27;s attempts to beat the Kobayashi Maru test. The other crewmembers that Dal selects are former crewmembers of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D.

====Mirror Universe====
In the Mirror Universe, Odo is the supervisor of the mining complex at Terok Nor. He is a brutal taskmaster over Terran slaves there and tolerates no deviation from his strict rules. Relatively little is known of him, as no one in the Mirror Universe is aware that the wormhole exists or who Odo&#x27;s people are. During a mining accident, Odo begins an evacuation of the Terran workers from the complex. Julian Bashir, seizing the opportunity to escape, destroys him with a disruptor.

In this reality, Odo has his own set of rules called the &quot;Rules of Obedience&quot; and quotes one of the rules in the same way that mainstream universe Quark would quote the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition.

After filming of the episode &quot;Crossover&quot;, which was mirror Odo&#x27;s sole onscreen appearance, actor René Auberjonois liked the mirror universe uniform so much he began wearing it while playing the regular universe version of Odo as well.

===Non-canon===
====Novels====
In the initial &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; relaunch novels, Odo is succeeded as security chief by Ro Laren, who is working for the Bajoran Militia. He also sent a Jem&#x27;Hadar ambassador to the Alpha Quadrant to foster understanding in the Dominion of other cultures, and soon returned to DS9.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine – Millennium&quot; series of novels, it is revealed that Odo rarely shifted into smaller forms such as insects due to a psychological block from his original training under Doctor Mora. The novel series also speculates that the Founders placed a mental block on Odo&#x27;s abilities to make it difficult for him to alter his face, thus explaining why he can never get faces quite right, even after linking with other Changelings on several occasions.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Terok Nor&quot; novel &quot;Night of the Wolves&quot;, Odo was found in a spherical module in the Denorios Belt by the Cardassian vessel &quot;Kevalu&quot;, which was under the command of Dalin Malyn Ocett, in 2345.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Typhon Pact&quot; novel &quot;Raise the Dawn&quot;, Odo returned to the Alpha Quadrant to help Sisko investigate reports that the Typhon Pact, an alliance of the Federation&#x27;s enemies, have stolen Jem&#x27;Hadar technology to perfect their own quantum slipstream drive, only to be trapped in the Alpha Quadrant when the wormhole was seemingly destroyed thanks to Kira&#x27;s attempt to stop a Typhon Pact ship from using it again. Sisko offered Odo a place on his new ship, the &quot;Robinson&quot;, but the novel ends with Odo deciding to remain on Bajor for a time to think about what he will do next.

==== Video games ====
The character Odo, with voice acting by René Auberjonois, also appeared in the computer video games &quot;Harbinger&quot; (1996), &quot;The Fallen&quot; (2000), and &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; (2018 expansion).

==Reception==
In 2009, IGN ranked Odo as the seventh best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. They note the character&#x27;s search for identity, even as he struggles to maintain order on the space station. They highlight his relationships with Sisko, Quark, and Kira on the station, and that he can turn into any shape except a normal human form. In 2016, Odo was ranked as the 15th most important character of Starfleet and related enlisted crews within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by Wired magazine.

In 2018, TheWrap ranked Odo as the 8th best main-cast character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall, noting his struggles with loyalties.

<text>The Cardassians () are a fictional extraterrestrial species in the American science fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. They were devised in 1991 for the series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; before being used in the subsequent series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

The writers of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; introduced the Cardassians for the fourth season episode &quot;The Wounded&quot; as new antagonists for the crew of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D to interact with on a personal level, as the Borg lacked personality or individuality, hindering interpersonal drama.

In the series, set in the 24th century, the Cardassians are presented as living under a military government controlling the Cardassian Union, an interstellar empire occupying other planets, most notably Bajor. When &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; was launched in 1993, its writers set its events in the vicinity of Bajor in the aftermath of the Cardassian occupation.

The Cardassians grew into major antagonists throughout the series, with several recurring characters developed, including Elim Garak (Andrew Robinson) and Gul Dukat (Marc Alaimo).

==Design==
The design of the Cardassians was undertaken by &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s costume designer Bob Blackman and makeup designer Michael Westmore. They sought to give the species a &quot;snakelike&quot; appearance. Cardassians have grayish-white skin, ridges on either side of the neck, and a spoon-shaped structure on the forehead. Westmore was inspired by an abstract painting he had seen in a Ventura Boulevard store of a wide-shouldered woman with what looked like a spoon on her forehead.
Rick Sternbach designed the Cardassian spaceship in &quot;The Wounded&quot;. He initially proposed a pod-shaped vessel, before replacing it with a design resembling a scorpion, then one based on the ankh symbol. Sternbach later noted that &quot;The &quot;Galor&quot; class started with an Egyptian ankh, given how [the Cardassians] were like the Pharaohs to the Bajoran slaves, but you don&#x27;t really see the basic shape unless you look straight down on the vessel. The little disruptor pyramids were a bit more obvious, as were the &#x27;temple&#x27; type structures on the ship&#x27;s backbone, and the sandy yellow shades.&quot;
Ed Miarecki and Tom Hudson built the model used in &quot;The Wounded&quot; from Sternbach&#x27;s design. In the episode, Cardassian weapons fired a pink discharge, changed to amber in later episodes.

Production designer Herman Zimmerman worked on the Cardassian architecture depicted on the shows. His concept had some Art Deco influence, and was based on geometric patterns. Some motifs were ellipses, angles rather than straight lines, and groups of three.

==Depiction in the shows==
===&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;===
====&quot;The Wounded&quot;: 1991====

The Cardassians were invented by the writers of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; for the show&#x27;s fourth season episode &quot;The Wounded&quot;, written by Stuart Charno, Sara Charno, and Cy Chermak, with teleplay by Jeri Taylor. It was first screened in January 1991. The script related that the Cardassian Union and the United Federation of Planets—of which Earth was a part—were involved in skirmishes for many years but had signed a peace treaty.

It begins with the revelation that the USS &quot;Phoenix&quot;, a renegade Federation starship under the command of Captain Benjamin Maxwell (Bob Gunton), has begun attacking Cardassian targets, as Maxwell is convinced the Cardassians are rearming for war against the Federation. The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D, captained by Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart), is sent to stop the &quot;Phoenix&quot;, with the Cardassian Gul Macet (Marc Alaimo) coming aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to assist.

Alaimo&#x27;s appearance as Gul Macet in &quot;The Wounded&quot; made him the second actor, after Mark Lenard, to play three separate alien species in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In earlier episodes he portrayed an Antican (&quot;Lonely Among Us&quot;) and a Romulan (&quot;The Neutral Zone&quot;). He later portrayed a human in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot; before gaining a recurring role as the Cardassian Gul Dukat in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

For this episode, several Cardassians were depicted wearing helmets, something never again done in the franchise; Blackman and Westmore&#x27;s designs also gave Macet facial hair, the only time a Cardassian was shown this way.

====Later episodes: 1991–1994====

In the fifth season episode &quot;Ensign Ro&quot;, written by Rick Berman and Michael Piller and first screened in October 1991, the Bajoran species was introduced. It explained that the Cardassians had annexed the Bajoran homeworld, Bajor, 40 years earlier, with many Bajorans fleeing their planet as refugees and often fighting back with militant tactics. &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; was the first episode where Cardassian warships were introduced as &quot;Galor class&quot; vessels. Although it was not intended at the time, the situation between the Cardassians and Bajorans laid the groundwork for the plot of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

The Cardassians were central to the two-part sixth season episode &quot;Chain of Command&quot;, written by Frank Abatemarco and screened in December 1992. In them, the Federation has gained intelligence that the Cardassians are developing a genetically engineered virus on an uninhabited planet. Picard is sent to infiltrate and destroy the weapon but is apprehended and tortured by the Cardassian Gul Madred (David Warner).
&quot;Chain of Command Part I&quot; included the first mentions that the Cardassians&#x27; homeworld was called &quot;Cardassia&quot;, and the &quot;Cardassian Union&quot; as the name of their interstellar state (previously mentioned only as the &quot;Cardassian Empire&quot;). &quot;Chain of Command PartI&quot; also introduced the news that the Cardassians had withdrawn from Bajor, setting the stage for the events of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, which began airing a month later. The show&#x27;s designers introduced the Cardassians&#x27; hand weapon in this episode, with Sternbach describing it as like a &quot;copper-colored banana&quot;. Part Two of &quot;Chain of Command&quot; provided a brief history of the Cardassians and their military government.

The Cardassians also appeared in the sixth season episode &quot;The Chase&quot;, written by Joe Menosky and Ronald D. Moore and screened in April 1993, where it is revealed that humans and Cardassians—as well as the Klingons and Romulans—are all descended from an ancient species who seeded many planets with life. In the seventh season episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, written by Ronald D. Moore, it is explained that the treaty between the Federation and the Cardassians left various Federation planets in Cardassian territory, and that many of these Federation colonists refused to leave. Their presence and struggle for independence from Cardassian rule was a recurring theme in both &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;. &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; was the first time Cardassian communicators were shown, affixed to the actors&#x27; wrists. The conflict between the Cardassians and the rebel colonists, known as the Maquis, was again used as the basis for the series&#x27; penultimate episode, &quot;Preemptive Strike&quot;, written by Naren Shankar and René Echevarria and directed by Stewart.

===&quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;===

Launching the new series, &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, was the pilot episode &quot;Emissary&quot;, written by Rick Berman and Michael Piller. Focussing on the aftermath of the Cardassian departure from Bajor, the premise of the series revolves around the Federation taking control of Deep Space Nine, a Cardassian-built space station orbiting Bajor, at the request of the Bajoran provisional government.

In &quot;Emissary&quot;, the station&#x27;s new Starfleet commander, Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) is visited by the Cardassian who formerly served as prefect of Bajor, Gul Dukat, played by Marc Alaimo. Alaimo had played a different Cardassian character in &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, but was brought in to replace the actor formerly cast as Dukat, whose performance had dissatisfied the creative team. Ira Behr recalled that &quot;It was either Mike Piller or Rick Berman who finally said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s get Marc Alaimo,&#x27; who had done a bunch of &quot;TNG&quot; episodes for them in the past. Marc came in and, of course, he &quot;was&quot; Gul Dukat.&quot; &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; would go on to introduce several more Cardassians as recurring characters, including the exiled spy-turned-tailor Elim Garak, whose mysterious past and moral ambiguity made him one of the franchise&#x27;s most popular recurring characters.

Late in the first season, the show&#x27;s creative team included another Cardassian-themed episode, &quot;Duet&quot;. Written by Lisa Rich and Jeanne Carrigan-Fauci as a bottle episode, it featured the arrest of a Cardassian believed to be guilty of war crimes against Bajor, Aamin Marritza (Harris Yulin), and the relationship he developed with the station&#x27;s Bajoran second-in-command, Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor). The lengthy speech given to Marritza was an early example of what the writers came to call &quot;Cardassian monologues&quot;. Behr said, &quot;Cardassians love to speak. Garak loves to speak, Enabran Tain loves to speak. Dukat loves to speak—very slowly—and certainly Marritza loves to speak.&quot;

Over the course of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, the Cardassians&#x27; internal politics and their relationships with the Federation and Bajor go through many upheavals. In early seasons, the Cardassians maintain a shaky alliance with the Federation, which comes to their defense against attacks from the Maquis and the Klingons. An ill-advised attack by the Obsidian Order, the Cardassian intelligence agency, against the alien empire known as the Dominion cripples the power of the Cardassian military dictatorship and allows a civilian government to take control. Later in the series, Dukat negotiates Cardassia&#x27;s membership in the Dominion in exchange for his own appointment as ruler of Cardassia, leading to a war against the Federation. When Dominion rule becomes too oppressive for the Cardassians, Dukat&#x27;s successor Damar leads a resistance movement against the Dominion with the support of the Federation and Bajorans, restoring Cardassia&#x27;s independence. However, during the final battle of the war, the Dominion leader ordered a genocidal retaliation for the Cardassian resistance. Although this was ended, at least eight hundred million people were killed and Elim Garrak lamented that their freedom had come at the cost of much of Cardassia&#x27;s rich culture, best people and greatest minds, leaving the Cardassians facing a dire reconstruction effort.

== Cardassian history ==
Within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe, the Cardassians were once a &quot;peaceful people with a rich spiritual life&quot;. However, during this period they also suffered from disease and famine. Nationalistic fervour grew and a military dictatorship was established, under which the citizens became prosperous. The Obsidian Order, an intelligence agency and internal security police force, kept the population under surveillance. The Cardassians became imperialistic, waging war with other races and occupying their territory to exploit resources. The Cardassian empire is known as the Cardassian Union.

=== Occupation of Bajor ===
In 2328, the Cardassians invaded Bajor, occupying it for forty years, during which time they forced many Bajorans into slave labor, using them in their various mining operations. This forced many Bajorans to flee and live in refugee camps away from Cardassian domination, while other Bajorans became involved in the resistance movement, engaged in guerrilla warfare organising terrorist attacks against Cardassian targets.

The Federation would not intervene in the situation, due to Prime Directive considerations.

In 2369, the Bajoran resistance forced the Cardassians off Bajor, after which the Bajoran Provisional Government invited the United Federation of Planets to set up base on the former Cardassian mining station of Terok Nor, renaming it Deep Space Nine.

=== Dominion War ===

During the Dominion War, the Cardassian Union joined the Dominion in opposition to the Federation alliance, taking a main role below the Dominion&#x27;s rulers, the Founders. They were supplanted by the Breen Confederacy and, after some of their territory was promised to the Breen, the Cardassians rebelled against the Dominion, and were instrumental in defeating the Dominion and ending the war. It was a Bajoran, Colonel Kira Nerys of the Bajoran Militia, who trained the Cardassians in guerrilla warfare to defeat their own occupiers.

== Reception ==
In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Cardassians the 4th best aliens of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, behind the Borg but ahead of the Bajorans.

Some of the top-rated television episodes featuring Cardassians in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; include &quot;Improbable Cause&quot;, which features an intriguing story centered on Garak, and also &quot;Duet&quot;.

==In cosmology==

In cosmology, the concept &quot;Cardassian expansion&quot; is a term used for a modification to the Friedmann equations. It is named after the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; race by the original authors, Katherine Freese and Matthew Lewis. In their 2002 paper (which has been cited more than 330 times), a footnote on the &quot;Cardassian term&quot; states: &quot;2 The name Cardassian refers to a humanoid race in &quot;Star Trek&quot; whose goal is to take over the universe, i.e., accelerated expansion. This race looks foreign to us and yet is made entirely of matter.&quot;

<text>Martok, son of Urthog is a recurring character in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, played by actor J. G. Hertzler. Martok is a high-ranking Klingon leader at the Federation-Bajoran space station in the late 2300s. Martok figures prominently in many of the show&#x27;s long running story arcs, and also is an important relationship for Worf.

==Concept and production==

J. G. Hertzler made his first appearance in the franchise in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; pilot episode, &quot;Emissary&quot;, as a Vulcan Captain who is killed when his vessel is destroyed. Following this, he made his first appearance as a Klingon in the video game &quot;Star Trek: Klingon&quot;, directed by Jonathan Frakes and also starring Robert O&#x27;Reilly as Chancellor Gowron. When the producers of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; were casting Martok, Hertzler auditioned after initially not considering the role but found himself getting angry during the interview due to a comment from the director which he felt was insulting. However, this response led to him gaining the role, and it was included as a character trait for Martok.

It took around three hours each day for the make-up to be applied to Hertzler by David Quashnick, who was the &quot;specialist&quot; who did both Hertzler and O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Klingon make-up. Hertzler did not mind the process, but stated that having the prostheses block the sight in his left side could sometimes make filming difficult as he could not see when turning that way. He felt it was important to the character to remind him of the time spent on the Dominion prison world, and turned down the opportunity to have Martok&#x27;s sight restored when it was suggested by executive producer Ira Steven Behr. In particular, Hertzler felt it gave the same air to Martok as Christopher Plummer&#x27;s character in &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;.

In 2020, Hertzler talked about developing the character: &quot;As a stage actor you usually get some weeks to rehearse, if you get lucky, and then you go on. And with Martok, I was able to work on him for four years. Now I am still doing it 25 years later!&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Heavy&quot; in 2021, Hertzler discussed how it was working with the cast of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. He found it was intimidating at first, because the regular cast had worked with each other for years, and the Martok character had to &quot;boss people around.&quot; However, he found the other actors welcomed him and helped him feel like he belonged.

==Appearances==

===Background===
Little backstory is given regarding the early life of Martok, except for a brief history sketched by himself in the &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Once More Unto the Breach&quot;. It is known that he was born into a Klingon house (The House of Martok) that was not part of the aristocracy and was raised in the Ket&#x27;ha lowlands on the Klingon homeworld of Qo&#x27;noS. This area is considered a wasteland by the Klingons.

His family had been reputable soldiers and had loyally served the empire for 15 generations, although not as officers. It had long been the wish of his father Urthog to have young Martok become an officer, so he enlisted the aid of officers he had earned the respect of and eventually was able to get one to sponsor his son&#x27;s application to the Klingon academy. Believing its approval was a mere formality, the application was submitted to the Oversight Committee but was rejected by one member, Kor, due to the elitist views of the legendary Klingon warrior regarding the honor and prestige of the &quot;great houses&quot;. With a rejection on his record from such a legendary officer, Martok could no longer even serve as a common soldier. He opted to serve, regardless, and spent five years as a civilian laborer on General ShiVang&#x27;s flagship. During his service, the General&#x27;s ship came under surprise attack by a Romulan vessel. When the Romulans attempted to board the ship, Martok took up arms and helped repel the attackers, earning a battlefield commission from Shi&#x27;Vang for his skill and bravery; unfortunately, the honour was soured for Martok by the fact his father had died some years earlier and couldn&#x27;t share in his son&#x27;s glory, causing Martok to hold a lifelong grudge against Kor. Martok earned the rank of Lieutenant after the Battle of Tcha&#x27;voth, which earned him a spot as tactical officer aboard the Klingon Cruiser &quot;Gothspar&quot;, captained by Kultan (ST:DS9 Books: &quot;The Left Hand of Destiny&quot;). At Martok&#x27;s introduction to the series, he had attained the rank of General.

===General Martok===
Around 2371, Martok was abducted by agents of the Dominion and replaced with a shapeshifter. The exact date of this is unclear. The changeling was successful at beginning the war with the Cardassians (S4,E1) but inadvertently revealed himself to Odo (who had been misled into believing that Chancellor Gowron was the changeling) at a Klingon award ceremony, and was quickly killed by the Klingons attending the ceremony (S5,E1).

The real Martok spent two years in a Dominion internment camp, forced to fight Jem&#x27;Hadar soldiers daily in hand-to-hand combat for training purposes. Presumably it was during one of these fights that his left eye was gouged out. During his confinement, Martok came to respect the indomitable character and fighting qualities of Worf. In the episode &quot;By Inferno&#x27;s Light&quot;, Martok escapes and returns to the Alpha Quadrant with Elim Garak, Worf and Julian Bashir, and is made commander of the Klingon forces on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;.

Weeks after this new assignment, Martok took command of a Klingon Bird-of-Prey, the &quot;Rotarran&quot;, and made it his personal flagship. Initially, the &quot;Rotarran&#x27;s&quot; crew were beaten and fatalistic, a fact that was made worse by Martok&#x27;s apparent reluctance to engage Jem&#x27;Hadar forces on their first mission. Eventually, a confrontation between Martok and Worf helped rally both the crew&#x27;s warrior spirit as well as Martok&#x27;s. The mission would conclude with the &quot;Rotarran&quot; engaging and destroying a Jem&#x27;Hadar vessel and rescuing thirty-five crewmen from a disabled Klingon ship. A grateful Martok would later invite Worf (who had earlier been stripped of his family name by Gowron) to join Martok&#x27;s house.

Martok is portrayed as an excellent judge of character, caring deeply about those under his command. This, in turn, earned him great respect among fellow Klingons, since while they have a love for battle and conquest, they also have a very low opinion of those who wantonly throw soldiers into battle with little regard for their safety or well-being. These traits, along with his courage and leadership skills, would serve him well in the Dominion War, during which he fought in several battles, including the battle to retake Deep Space Nine, and the First and Second Battle of Chin&#x27;toka. Despite his humble background, or perhaps because of it, Martok would become extremely popular among other Klingon warriors and the civilian population, because he climbed his way up the ranks honorably, though Martok himself repeatedly stated he had no interest in politics. Eventually, he was made Supreme Commander of the Ninth Fleet, a position he initially resented because of the amount of paperwork involved. Like most Klingons, Martok had a disdain for Ferengi, which manifested itself in several refusals to even acknowledge Nog, who at the time was a Starfleet Cadet. It isn&#x27;t until Nog stands up to Martok and directly challenges him that Martok begins to display a grudging respect for the young Ferengi (episodes &quot;Soldiers of the Empire&quot;, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;).

Shortly before the end of the war (&quot;When It Rains…&quot;), Gowron comes to Deep Space Nine to honor Martok by inducting him into the Order of Kahless, and then announces that he would be taking control of the Klingon forces from Martok because it was time for him to &quot;take a more active role in the war&quot;. However, it becomes clear that Gowron is simply worried about Martok getting too powerful politically, and intends to usurp Martok&#x27;s standing by sending him into battles that he cannot win. Worf tries to convince Martok to challenge Gowron, but he refuses, saying he is a loyal soldier of the Empire and has no desire whatsoever to enter politics, let alone become Chancellor. Worf then kills Gowron himself, and rather than accept the title of Chancellor, gives it to Martok (&quot;Tacking into the Wind&quot;).

===Chancellor Martok===
When the Dominion forces suddenly withdrew into Cardassian territory, the Allies realized that they were withdrawing in order to gain time to recover from their battle wounds, so that they could come back stronger a few years later.

Martok believed that the Empire should attack right away, and convinced the Federation and Romulans to attack as well. Martok, leading the Klingon fleet; Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko, leading the Federation fleet; and the Romulans attacked and defeated the Dominion on the Cardassian homeworld.

Despite the refusal of Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko (who were horrified by the sight of being surrounded by so many dead Cardassians) to drink bloodwine with Martok in the halls of Cardassian Central Command, something most Klingons would consider a grave insult, Martok simply shook his head and said that humans didn&#x27;t understand, with the Federation and Klingons remaining staunch allies. Martok is happy to receive Lt. Commander Worf as the Federation Ambassador to Qo&#x27;noS. He comments that he now has an Ambassador that he can go targ hunting with and that, for this reason, &quot;perhaps being Chancellor won&#x27;t be &quot;so bad&quot; after all&quot;. Shortly after the end of the war, Martok and Worf leave DS9 for Qo&#x27;noS (&quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;).

===Personal life===
Martok is the son of Urthog, and is an only child. He grew up in the Ketha province on Qo&#x27;noS. Urthog did not live to see his son become an officer; Martok holds a grudge against Kor for robbing his father of that honour.

Martok is married to Sirella, a noble woman. They have one son, Drex (&quot;You Are Cordially Invited&quot;, &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot;) Martok views marriage as another form of combat, albeit one disguised and more subtle than most (&quot;The Changing Face of Evil&quot;).

After Worf joined Martok&#x27;s house, Worf&#x27;s son Alexander would be inducted into the house as well, as would Jadzia Dax upon her marriage Worf (the marriage was initially opposed by Sirella). After Jadzia&#x27;s death, Martok would come to regard Dax&#x27;s new host Ezri as a worthy successor to Jadzia and would consider her part of his house as well.

Martok&#x27;s first appearances on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (in &quot;The Way of the Warrior, Parts I and II&quot; and &quot;Apocalypse Rising&quot;) were actually the Changeling infiltrator posing as Martok. The real Martok did not appear onscreen until &quot;In Purgatory&#x27;s Shadow&quot;.

The Mirror Universe version of Martok has only appeared in the novels. Unlike the regular Martok, who is an honorable and caring commander, the MU version is foul-mouthed, slovenly and cruel. He is eventually killed by the mirror counterpart of Klag, who assumes Martok&#x27;s role as Regent of the Klingon-Cardassian Alliance.

==Reception and analysis==
In 2015, SyFy rated Martok among the top 21 most interesting supporting characters of Star Trek, and in 2019, SyFy rated Martok as the #1 greatest and &quot;most Klingon-y&quot; Klingon of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Tara Bennett called him &quot;legendary.&quot; In 2016, ScreenRant ranked the character Martok as the 12th best &quot;Star Trek&quot; character overall, in between Worf (#13) and Sarek (#11). They describe Martok as a &quot;Klingon&#x27;s Klingon&quot;, but instead of being obsessed with battle he appears as &quot;battle-worn, flinty, and grateful to be alive&quot;, while Victor Grech highlights the instances where Martok embraces warfare.

In 2018, CBR ranked this character 10th best recurring character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Producer Ira Steven Behr&#x27;s impression from &quot;The Way of the Warrior&quot; was &quot;Gee, this guy Martok is great&quot;, and he decided to make him a recurring character. He described Martok as &quot;a great Klingon. Very charismatic and fun.&quot;

Uwe Meyer characterizes Martok as an upright person of integrity, who in this regard stands in direct contrast and conflict to his predecessor, the erratic and self-serving Gowron. Martok is committed to family loyalty and follows a code of honour that is especially visible in times of war. Douglas Mann calls it &quot;the Homeric code of the Klingon warrior&quot; and compares it to that of ancient Sparta and the warriors of Mycenean culture as depicted in the &quot;Illiad&quot;.

Meyer sees elements of the Cold War reflected in the Star Trek franchise, with the Federation representing the West and the Klingon Empire the USSR and Russia. In this context, Martok represents a Klingon character who is not explicitly Westernized like Worf, but still pays homage to the liberal values of the West to a significant degree. This characterization - bar the political connotations - is supported by a discussion documented by Karl Spracklen: Martok has been exposed to human culture enough to laugh off the refusal of his Federation allies to celebrate a victory the Klingon way with him, where another Klingon might have been offended. Martok&#x27;s chancellorship is compared by Meyer to the position of Mikhail Gorbachev in the USSR, as a representative of the ruling elite who recognizes the shortcomings and divisions of his society and strives for reform. In this role Martok is also similar to the character of Azetbur from &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot;. She was denied significant success as a lone reformer. Whether Martok can fulfill the hopes invested in him is an open question at the end of his arc.

Uwe Meyer also states that Martok conforms to the stereotype of the simple, honest soldier, who is not well-versed in the intrigues associated with a negatively connoted political class, and is more like a politician should be because of it. That he was often victorious in battle is presented as adding to his aptitude, comparable to a number of former military officers who have achieved the U.S. presidency.

<text>Kathryn Janeway is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. She was the main character of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, which aired between 1995 and 2001. She served as the captain of the Starfleet starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot; while it was lost in the Delta Quadrant on the other side of the galaxy. After returning home to the Alpha Quadrant, she is promoted to vice admiral and briefly appears in the 2002 film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. She is seen again commanding the USS &quot;Dauntless&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;, searching for the missing USS &quot;Protostar&quot; which was being commanded by Captain Chakotay, her former first officer on &quot;Voyager&quot;, at the time of its disappearance.

Although other female captains had appeared in previous &quot;Star Trek&quot; episodes and other media, Janeway was the first to serve as the central character of a live-action &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. She has also appeared in other media including books and video games. In all of her screen appearances, she has been played by Kate Mulgrew.

==Casting==
===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===
During the development of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, one of the actors considered to play the captain, before it was decided the character would be a woman, was Gary Graham. Kate Mulgrew, Geneviève Bujold, Erin Gray, Patty Duke and Susan Gibney were all considered or auditioned during development, with Bujold being initially cast.

The character was originally named Elizabeth Janeway, after the noted writer of the same name. However, after Geneviève Bujold was cast, she requested the character be renamed &quot;Nicole Janeway&quot;. Bujold was initially very positive, saying in an interview, &quot;This role is a challenge but it feels right.&quot; Bujold, whose acting experience was mainly in feature films, was unprepared for the schedule demanded by television and was unwilling to do news interviews. After the second day of filming for the first episode &quot;Caretaker&quot;, Bujold dropped out of the series.

After Bujold&#x27;s departure, Joanna Cassidy, Susan Gibney, Elizabeth Dennehy, Tracy Scoggins, and Lindsay Crouse were considered as replacements. Erin Gray and Chelsea Field (wife of future &quot;Star Trek&quot; captain Scott Bakula) auditioned for the role. Not only was shooting already behind schedule, but the episode had to be ready by January 1995. It was not only the launch of series, but would also be the first program airing on the newly-launching United Paramount Network (UPN), and over $20 million was being spent on the pilot. Kate Mulgrew, who had previously auditioned for the role, was cast on September 17, 1994. She suggested that the name be changed to &quot;Kathryn&quot;, to which the producers agreed. 

===&quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;===
In October 2020, Mulgrew confirmed she would voice Janeway in the animated series &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;. Executive Producer Alex Kurtzman said of the choice, &quot;We can think of no better captain to inspire the next generation of dreamers on Nickelodeon, than she.&quot; In April 2021, it was revealed that Mulgrew would voice an emergency training hologram based on Janeway. Though initially announced as a series for Nickelodeon, the show premiered on Paramount+ in October 2021, with later airings on Nickelodeon.

The real Janeway first appears in the episode &quot;A Moral Star, Part 2&quot;. Janeway is searching for her former first officer, Captain Chakotay, of the USS &quot;Protostar&quot;. She commands the USS &quot;Dauntless,&quot; which features a quantum slip-stream drive. The ship is based on schematics the crew of the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; obtained under Janeway&#x27;s command in the Delta Quadrant of another USS &quot;Dauntless&quot;, a ship used to bait the crew into getting assimilated by the Borg (&quot;Hope and Fear&quot;). She tries to keep up with the &quot;Protostar&quot; and its protowarp capability. The kids, desperate for a means of explaining the situation to their pursuers without setting off the &quot;living construct&quot; booby trap, since using regular communications with the Starfleet ships would do that, attempt a telepathic communication with Admiral Janeway. In the attempt, the effort goes awry with the consciousnesses of the kids&#x27; leader, Dal and Admiral Janeway being inadvertently exchanged in their bodies. While this development allows Janeway to learn the full situation from the kids, Dal&#x27;s struggles in Janeway&#x27;s body leads to the crew to believe she had lost her sanity. The two manage to return to their bodies, but Janeway found herself in the brig with seemingly no one willing to believe her explanation of recent events, nor her warning of the Protostar&#x27;s booby trap before it was too late and the Starfleet ships in the immediate area starting to attack each other out of the crews&#x27; control and that promised to be only the beginning of the destruction.

The events of &quot;Supernova, Part 2&quot; caused Mulgrew&#x27;s primary role in the series to shift to Admiral Janeway. Within this episode, the holographic Janeway stays on the &quot;Protostar&quot; in order to enact the self-destruct to destroy a &quot;living construct&quot; installed on the &quot;Protostar&quot; threatening to obliterate Starfleet. Though she promises to copy herself so she can join her young protégés, she is unable to do so due to the vastly increased complexity of her program, meaning her program is lost when the &quot;Protostar&quot; is destroyed, something she makes sure the kids only discover when it is too late so they would not delay their escape arguing with her. When the kids reach Starfleet Headquarters, Admiral Janeway vouches for them and takes them under her wing as warrant officers.

In the second season, Janeway works with the kids to rescue Chakotay from the future, accidentally creating a universe destroying temporal paradox in the process. As a result of the alterations to time, a younger version of the holographic Janeway returns in the second season, having spent ten years marooned with Chakotay. At the behest of Wesley Crusher, Janeway reluctantly allows the kids to go after Chakotay alone and they find and rescue him and the &quot;Protostar&quot;. At the end of the season, at Chakotay&#x27;s behest, The Doctor copies the holographic Janeway onto an EMH backup module before her memories are erased and the ship is sent back in time to be found by the kids. In the present, the holographic Janeway becomes the Emergency Command Hologram of the new USS &quot;Prodigy&quot;.

==Character biography==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, Kathryn Janeway was born on May 20, 2336 in Bloomington, Indiana on Earth. She was the daughter of Vice Admiral Janeway and has a sister named Phoebe, who is the artist in the family. Phoebe never chose to join Starfleet and stayed close to home with her mother, Gretchen Janeway. Kathryn Janeway was very close to her father, who taught her to look at the universe with a scientist&#x27;s eye; she was devastated by his death. Her first mission after graduating the academy was as a science officer on the USS &quot;Al-Batani&quot;, where she served as Chief Science Officer during the Arias mission.

Captain Janeway takes command of the &quot;Intrepid&quot;-class USS &quot;Voyager&quot; in 2371. Their first mission is to locate and capture a Maquis vessel last seen in the area of space known as the Badlands. While there, the Maquis ship and &quot;Voyager&quot; are transported against their will into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light-years away, by a massive displacement wave. The Maquis ship is destroyed while fighting the Kazon-Ogla, and although &quot;Voyager&quot; survives, there are numerous casualties. In order to protect the Ocampa, who live on a planet &quot;Voyager&quot; visits, Janeway destroys the Caretaker Array, the space station that transported the two ships to the Delta Quadrant, which provides energy to the Ocampa&#x27;s planet, despite the fact that the Array may be the two ships&#x27; only chance to return home. In doing this, Janeway strands her ship and crew seven decades&#x27; travel from home.

Her first major task is integrating the surviving Maquis and &quot;Voyager&quot; crews. Chakotay, captain of the Maquis ship, succeeds the deceased Lieutenant Commander Cavit as her first officer. Janeway also grants convicted criminal, former Starfleet officer, and accomplished pilot Tom Paris a field commission, and makes him &quot;Voyager&quot;″s helmsman.

Janeway&#x27;s other interactions with her crew include helping the de-assimilated Borg Seven of Nine reclaim her individuality and humanity and advocating for the Doctor&#x27;s status as a sentient being.

During the course of the TV series, &quot;Voyager&quot; has contact with the Q Continuum on three occasions, and repeated contact with the Borg. With the intervention of a future/alternate version of herself, Janeway leads her crew in using one of the Borg&#x27;s transwarp conduits to return her ship to Federation space after having traveled through the Delta Quadrant for seven years.

In a cameo in the film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, now-Admiral Janeway instructs Captain Jean-Luc Picard to travel to Romulus at the invitation of the film&#x27;s antagonist.

A few years after &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s return to Federation space and Janeway&#x27;s subsequent promotion to Admiral, Janeway commands the USS &quot;Dauntless&quot; in an effort to locate her former first officer Chakotay who disappeared while commanding the USS &quot;Protostar&quot;.

=== Non-canon ===
Admiral Janeway also appeared in the Borg Invasion 4-D ride at the Star Trek: The Experience venue in Las Vegas, which closed in 2008. In the ride, Janeway leads &quot;Voyager&quot; to the rescue of ride participants who are ostensibly trapped first on a space station and later on a shuttlecraft that come under attack by a Borg Cube commanded by the Borg Queen. At the ride&#x27;s end, Janeway tells the participants, &quot;Congratulations. You&#x27;ve defeated the Borg with one thing the Queen can never assimilate: the human spirit. As long as we have that, resistance will never be futile.&quot;

Janeway continued as a major character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels that depict the events in the lives of the &quot;Voyager&quot; characters after the end of that series. In Peter David&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; novel, &quot;Before Dishonor&quot;, which is set after the events of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, Janeway is assimilated by a rogue faction of the Borg, and becomes their new Borg Queen. Seven of Nine, with the aid of Ambassador Spock and the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E crew, manages to communicate with Janeway&#x27;s consciousness, buried deep within the Queen&#x27;s mind. During a brief moment of contact, Janeway helps them destroy the Borg cube, with all hands on board. Although Seven manages to escape, Janeway is killed. Her memorial service sees a vast turnout, and a tall gleaming pillar with a light burning atop it is constructed in tribute to her. The Q female appears to Janeway&#x27;s spirit, and tells her that Q and the Q Continuum had taken an interest in her. Telling her that she has a destiny, Lady Q takes Janeway by the hand, and disappears with her into realms unknown. Writer Peter David explained the book was conceived by Pocket Books editorial as one in which Janeway would die, and that he was brought in to write it in order to give her a reportedly heroic send-off.

In the 2012 &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; novel &quot;The Eternal Tide&quot; by Kirsten Beyer, Janeway returns to human life with the help of young Q, who needs her assistance, and by the book&#x27;s end resumes her admiralship in Starfleet. In the 2014 &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; novel &quot;Protectors&quot; by Kirsten Beyer, Janeway goes back to Earth per orders of Starfleet Command; by the end of the book she returns to the Delta Quadrant, taking charge of the starships stationed there. She continues this mission in Beyer&#x27;s second 2014 &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; novel, &quot;Acts of Contrition&quot;.

In Cryptic Studios&#x27; online role-playing game, &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, Janeway was physically added to game in January 2022 along with voiceover work by Kate Mulgrew as part of the game&#x27;s twelfth anniversary. Prior to her addition, Janeway was only occasionally mentioned in the game. She was also retroactively added to the game&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Delta Rising&quot; expansion.

==Reception==
In 2019, Vulture.com ranked Captain Kathryn Janeway as the number one &quot;Star Trek&quot; captain by their selection criterion, a combination of competency and managerial style. In particular, they note her ability to overcome great challenges despite being on the other side of the Galaxy and commanding a crew in large part consisting of non-Starfleet personnel. One of her interesting relationships is noted as with the former Maquis B&#x27;Elanna Torres (played by Roxann Dawson), and the former Borg Seven of Nine (played by Jeri Ryan). Space.com rated Janeway as the number three best captain of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked Janeway as the third best Captain of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Captain Janeway was ranked as the 18th best character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; by IGN in 2009. In 2016, Captain Janeway was ranked as the 8th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by Wired magazine.

The romance between Janeway and Kashyk in &quot;Counterpoint&quot; was praised by &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, which they rated as one of the ten best episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. In 2018, CBR ranked Janeway as the 4th best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Kathryn Janeway as the 18th most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, The Gamer ranked Janeway as one of the top fifteen starship captains of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

Captain Janeway was rated as one of the top seven time travelers, in the whole &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise by &quot;Nerdist&quot; in 2019, for her exploits in &quot;Endgame&quot;.

In July 2019, Screen Rant ranked Janeway the 4th smartest character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

In May 2024, CBR ranked Janeway as the best Star Trek captain to lead a series.

== Legacy ==
=== There&#x27;s coffee in that nebula ===
In 2015, astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti – then serving aboard the International Space Station– dressed as Janeway for photographs in which she gestured toward an incoming Dragon cargo spacecraft. She posted a photo to Twitter with the comment, &quot;‘There’s coffee in that nebula’… ehm, I mean… in that #Dragon,&quot; quoting a memorable line by the character from the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;The Cloud&quot;. The craft was carrying an ISSpresso machine and coffee for the crew.

=== Birthplace monument ===
In 2019, a group of Bloomington, Indiana residents formed what is now The Janeway Collective with the goal of building a such as the one existing for James T. Kirk in Riverside, Iowa. Through attending local events and raising awareness, and with the permission of CBS, they were able to successfully raise funds through a crowdsourcing campaign on the platform Patronicity and received a matching grant from the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority&#x27;s CreatINg Place program.

An official groundbreaking event took place on June 27, 2020, and the monument was unveiled on October 24, 2020, after being delayed from the planned date of May 20, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kate Mulgrew attended the unveiling virtually due to the pandemic. The monument is constructed of a cast bronze bust with a limestone base with stainless steel plate, and was sculpted by Aaron Eby. It is located on the B-Line Trail immediately next to the WonderLab science museum.

On October 23, 2022, almost two years after the unveiling, Kate Mulgrew visited the monument in person, fulfilling the promise she made when the statue was unveiled.

<text>B&#x27;Elanna Torres is a main character in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; played by Roxann Dawson. She is portrayed as a half-human half-Klingon born in 2346 on the Federation colony Kessik IV. 

In the series, Torres was admitted to Starfleet academy but dropped out before graduating. She joined the Maquis in 2370 and was serving on the &quot;Val jean&quot; when taken to the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker alien using his station. In the first few episodes, her Maquis ship was destroyed and the surviving Maquis joined the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; on the long journey across the galaxy to Earth. She was posted to engineering and quickly promoted to chief engineer, where she played a major role in the rest of the series. She had an ongoing relationship with Tom Paris, whom she married in the final season.

Dawson was praised for her portrayal of Torres by CBR, who wrote that she made the character believable. As a part-human, part-Klingon character struggling to reconcile the two halves of her heritage, Torres was praised by multi-ethnic audiences.

==Character development==
The &quot;Star Trek: Voyager Companion&quot; describes B&#x27;Elanna as a young half-human half-Klingon in her twenties who is a member of the Maquis Rebellion.

The producers wanted to hire an actress who could portray B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s inner struggle between her human and Klingon halves. After Roxann Dawson read for the role, she became the first of the &quot;Voyager&quot; actors to be cast. Originally, Dawson&#x27;s makeup differed from the final design; she explained that she had a much more pronounced Klingon forehead and nose and had to wear a set of Klingon teeth, which made her feel uncomfortable. She asked the producers and makeup artist Michael Westmore if they could perhaps make her more attractive and tone down the Klingon makeup. Eventually they came up with a design with which Roxann was happy, something she described as her &quot;beauty monster makeup&quot;. 

During season one, Dawson initially doubted her readiness to portray her character&#x27;s dual roles in the early-series episode &#x27;Faces.&#x27; However, she used the episode to learn more about her character, and it became one of her favorite episodes. When the episode aired, she called her parents to ask their opinions, and they replied, &quot;You were good, but the girl that played that Klingon was really great!&quot;, which Dawson took as a compliment. Joy Kilpatrick was a stand-in of one of two versions albeit uncredited. 

During season four, Dawson became pregnant with her first child. The writers decided they did not want B&#x27;Elanna to be pregnant as well, so for the duration of Dawson&#x27;s pregnancy, she was given an engineering lab coat, which was used to help cover her growing pregnancy. 

During the episode &quot;The Killing Game&quot;, the Hirogen had taken over &quot;Voyager&quot; and forced the crew to participate in holodeck recreations of various combat situations, to which B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s holodeck character is portrayed as pregnant in World War II with a Nazi officer&#x27;s child.

During season five, Dawson had a meeting with the producers and writers to discuss her character. Roxann explained to them that she felt B&#x27;Elanna had an extreme dark side that hadn&#x27;t been explored, and from that discussion the episode &quot;Extreme Risk&quot; was created. Dawson stated that after the episode aired, she received fan mail praising the issues of depression and inner conflict raised in the episode, with which many people identified.

During season six, Dawson got the chance to explore B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s Klingon heritage thanks to an episode originally conceived by Ronald D. Moore for &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. In the episode &quot;Barge of the Dead&quot;, B&#x27;Elanna has a near-death experience and travels to Gre&#x27;thor, the Klingon Hell, where she meets her mother, Miral. She discovers that because of the dishonor B&#x27;Elanna has caused her family, her mother would spend eternity in Gre&#x27;thor. The episode explores some aspects of B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s character, and also gives further insight into Klingon mythology. Dawson believed the episode had many layers to it, and she believed it was essentially a coming-of-age story for B&#x27;Elanna and her final acceptance of her Klingon heritage.

During season seven, a pregnancy storyline was written in for B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s character. Jessica Gaona played the character&#x27;s young iteration in the episode &quot;Lineage&quot;. At the end of the series, Dawson described B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s character arc as that of an &quot;unruly young woman who matures over the course of seven years.&quot;

==Character overview==

B&#x27;Elanna was born in 2346 on the Federation colony Kessik IV. Torres had a troubled childhood; her human father, John Torres, and Klingon mother, Miral, often fought. At the age of 5, she overheard her father expressing his unhappiness in the home of two Klingons and she would attempt to run away. In a later confrontation with him, she bitterly told him to leave. John Torres left when B’Elanna was twelve years old. He returned to Earth days later, leaving her to be raised by her mother. In season 7, he contacted her through Starfleet Command and asked to resume a relationship to which she agreed.

Being both Human and Klingon, Torres is shown as prone to aggressive outbursts. She once attacked her schoolmate Daniel Byrd after he repeatedly taunted her, calling her &quot;Miss Turtlehead&quot; due to her cranial ridges. Torres retained this aggressive behavior throughout her life, but she eventually learned to control it.

===Starfleet Academy and Maquis===
While attending Starfleet Academy, B&#x27;Elanna was constantly having trouble with the Starfleet&#x27;s rules. This resulted in her getting four disciplinary hearings and one suspension. Torres dropped out of Starfleet Academy in 2365 at age 19. Before doing so, Torres was a valued member of the academy athletics team, competing as a decathlete. Her decision to leave the academy upset the track and field coach, as well as other professors.

A few years later she became a member of the Maquis renegade group and began developing a profound hatred of the Cardassians. Torres became associated with a Maquis captain named Chakotay and was serving as chief engineer on his ship, the &quot;Val Jean&quot;, when they were brought to the Delta Quadrant by &quot;The Caretaker&quot;.

During her time with the Maquis, Torres reprogrammed a Cardassian missile known as &quot;Dreadnought&quot;. The missile, built with artificial intelligence, was originally targeted at Maquis installations. Torres reprogrammed it on a course for a Cardassian installation, but &quot;Dreadnought&quot; was swept into the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker.

===USS &quot;Voyager&quot;===
When the crews of the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; and the &quot;Val Jean&quot; were taken to the Delta Quadrant, Harry Kim and Torres were transported to the Ocampa home world while their respective crews set out to look for them. Being the only two people from their region of the Alpha Quadrant, the two quickly formed a relationship and she nicknamed him &quot;Starfleet&quot; for his faith in the Federation and Starfleet. This relationship would carry on throughout the series as the two would more than occasionally work on tasks together, allowing Kim to prove his intelligence to the whole crew.

In 2371, B&#x27;Elanna Torres joined the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew with the rest of the Maquis from the &quot;Val Jean&quot;, as Captain Kathryn Janeway offers them the opportunity. She was placed in the engineering department. As the original chief engineer was killed during the trip to the Delta Quadrant, Captain Janeway promoted Torres to the position based on Chakotay&#x27;s recommendation. Initially, Torres was very outspoken in her disapproval of Captain Janeway&#x27;s decision to destroy the Caretaker&#x27;s array, which had the ability to send the &quot;Voyager&quot; back home from the Delta Quadrant, and carried a small grudge against the captain. Over the first few months, Torres began respecting the captain and her decisions based on Janeway&#x27;s strong leadership and their shared interest in science.

Shortly after becoming chief engineer, Torres disobeys the captain&#x27;s orders when &quot;Voyager&quot; encounters a race known as the Sikarians. The Sikarians have advanced transporter technology that could drastically shorten their 70-year journey, but Sikarian law prohibits the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew from obtaining it legitimately. Torres becomes involved with a small group of officers who obtain the technology on the Sikarian black market and perpetrate a failed attempt to integrate it into &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s systems.

Torres, along with Tom Paris, was later kidnapped by the Vidiians. A Vidiian scientist extracts the Klingon DNA from Torres, splicing her into two separate people: one human, one Klingon. He believed the Klingon DNA had a specific biochemical property that could lead to a cure for the Phage, a disease affecting his people. The human Torres is portrayed fraught with fear but having strong technical expertise, while the Klingon Torres is shown as aggressive and impatient. After her escape from the Vidiians the Klingon Torres suffered a fatal wound from the Vidiian energy weapon and died, but the Doctor used her DNA to restore the human Torres to her original half-human/half-Klingon state, as her cellular structure needs the Klingon DNA to survive.

In the episode &quot;Persistence of Vision,&quot; it is revealed that Torres at the time had a romantic interest in Chakotay.

In 2373, Torres was the target of telepathically inspired dreams from a member of a race called the Enarans. The dreams were actually memories of a great that took place on the Enaran homeworld and were the elder Enaran&#x27;s method of making sure that the memory of this massacre lives on, even if in the mind of an alien.

Later that year, Vulcan engineer Vorik triggered Torres&#x27;s mating instincts when he forcibly initiated a telepathic bond with her while he is experiencing the &quot;pon farr&quot;. Torres and Tom Paris later became trapped on a planet together during an away mission, and Torres attempted to get Paris to mate with her, but he resisted. Eventually, Vorik and Torres engaged in ritual battle to purge the blood fever.

Torres later began a relationship with Paris after a complicated and stormy courtship. During an incident in 2374, Torres confessed her love to him when they were left floating in space in environmental suits, with almost no hope of rescue (&quot;Day of Honor&quot;). Although &quot;Voyager&quot; was soon able to rescue them, Torres realized that her courage in admitting her love had brought her one step closer to discovering what she considered true honor. Their relationship first flourished on screen during &quot;Scientific Method&quot;. They married in 2377 and their honeymoon was aboard the &quot;Delta Flyer.&quot;

When Torres and Paris conceived their daughter, Miral, in 2377, she learned from the Doctor that the child would have distinct Klingon cranial ridges as well as other Klingon traits. Torres, remembering painful events from her own childhood, urged the Doctor to perform gene therapy to reduce this phenotype, and even went so far as to reprogram him to do so. Paris and Captain Janeway both disagreed and prevented the Doctor from performing the genetic modifications. When Paris got her to open up, she admitted that she was afraid her husband would find living with two Klingons too difficult and leave her the way her father did. Once he allayed her fears, he admitted wanting even more children just like their mother, and Torres was finally enjoy the pregnancy (&quot;Lineage&quot;).

When a group of Klingon radicals spent time aboard &quot;Voyager&quot; (&quot;Prophecy&quot;), Torres began opening herself to more Klingon beliefs and, for the first time since childhood, was able to pray for her grandmother, L&#x27;Naal, and her great-grandmother, Krelik. When communications with Earth became available (&quot;Author, Author&quot;), she reached out to her estranged father, John Torres.

Miral Paris, named after B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s mother, was born at the beginning of 2378, during &quot;Voyager&quot;″s trip through a Borg transwarp conduit back to the Alpha Quadrant. In an alternate timeline where &quot;Voyager&quot; made it home by different means, Miral was shown as an adult serving in Starfleet, with the rank of ensign.

==Birthdate==

Torres&#x27;s birthdate—on September 2, 2014, the official Star Trek website published an archive article with information on the press release for the launch of the series. In the document, which includes character biographies, it confirms that when the series began (2371) – &quot;B&#x27;Elanna is a beautiful 25-year-old woman who is half-human, half-Klingon...&quot; This information would then place B&#x27;Elanna&#x27;s birthdate at 2346.

The &quot;Official Star Trek Voyager Companion&quot; gives further evidence to Torres&#x27;s age. This is a passage taken from the book: &quot;B&#x27;ELANNA TORRES is a half-Klingon, half-human in her twenties who is frantically working at the consoles of the barely spaceworthy craft...&quot;

==Reception==
In March 2019, Syfy rated B&#x27;Elanna as the 6th-greatest Klingon of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In particular, they noted that she was an interesting character in the series, displaying both loyalty to the crew of the starship and brilliance as an engineer.

In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked B&#x27;Elanna Torres as the 14th-most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, The Wrap ranked B&#x27;Elanna Torres as the 35th-best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. CBR ranked B&#x27;Elanna as the 14th-best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in 2018. They note that the former Maquis member works as chief engineer on the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft, and must struggle with her ambivalent emotions about her Klingon heritage while keeping the warp engines working in the Delta quadrant (cutoff from Federation starbases). In addition, CBR opined that the character enhanced other characters aboard the starship, and praised the actress who portrayed her for making B’Elanna Torres&#x27;s relationships more believable.

In 2019, B&#x27;Elanna Torres was ranked the 11th-sexiest &quot;Star Trek&quot; character by Syfy.

B’Elanna&#x27;s struggle to reconcile both sides of her Klingon/Human hybrid heritage has been praised by audiences of multi-ethnic backgrounds.

In 2020 &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked B&#x27;Elanna and Tom Paris as the 3rd best romantic couple of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

<text>Chakotay is a fictional character who appears in each of the seven seasons of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Portrayed by Robert Beltran, he was First Officer aboard the Starfleet starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot;, and later promoted to Captain in command of the &quot;USS Protostar&quot; in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;. The character was suggested at an early stage of the development of the series. He is the first Native American main character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. This was a deliberate move by the producers of the series, who sought to provide an inspiration as with Uhura in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; for African Americans. To develop the character, the producers sought the assistance of Jamake Highwater, who falsely claimed to be Native American. Despite first being named by producers as a Sioux, and later a Hopi, Chakotay was given no tribal affiliation at the start of the series, and eventually was assigned ancestry with a fictional tribe in the episode &quot;Tattoo”. It wasn’t until his appearance in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; that he was formally identified as a descendant of the Nicarao people of Central America.

The character first appeared in the pilot episode of the series, &quot;Caretaker&quot;. The character continued to appear throughout the series in a main cast role, with his final appearance in the finale, &quot;Endgame&quot;. He was featured in an ongoing storyline throughout the first and second seasons, which featured the betrayal of his former lover Seska (Martha Hackett) until her death in &quot;Basics&quot;. Following his experience with disconnected Borg in &quot;Unity&quot;, Chakotay was against an alliance with the Borg in &quot;Scorpion&quot;, nearly leading to the death of Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan). Despite this, by the end of the series, the two characters were in a romantic relationship. In the &quot;Voyager&quot; relaunch novels set after the vessel&#x27;s return to the Alpha Quadrant, Chakotay is promoted to captain of the ship, but the relationship with Seven has ended.

Reviewers of Chakotay were critical of the stereotypical nature of Chakotay&#x27;s Native American heritage. This led to comparisons with Tonto from &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, and that the inclusion of &quot;Hollywood&quot; versions of vision quests and meditation techniques were contrary to the character&#x27;s in-universe tribal background. However, he was praised as a role model for Native American science fiction and called &quot;ground-breaking&quot;, as well as the most prominent example of a Native American character within this genre.

==Concept and development==

The inclusion of a Native American character in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; was suggested at an early stage in the development of the series. The producers were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise. It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of Uhura in &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; later inspired Whoopi Goldberg and other African Americans. Executive producer Jeri Taylor said: &quot;It seemed to us that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost ... the future looks good, you have purpose, you have worth, you have value, you will be leaders, you will be powerful. That was one character choice we had early on.&quot; Taylor&#x27;s notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as &quot;First Officer – a human native American male, a &#x27;Queequeg&#x27; person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet. A mystical, mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection, not explained.&quot; A month later, this description was expanded with the line, &quot;This man has made another choice – to re-enter the world of Starfleet.&quot; Chakotay was not the first Native American character to appear in the franchise, with &quot;The Paradise Syndrome&quot; in the third season of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; showing a group of displaced humans following a Native American–like culture.

The producers aimed to develop some conflict between the members of the crew to produce a scenario similar to the Bajoran / Starfleet relationship seen in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, but wanted the characters to share the same ideals. To do this, the Maquis were created – a group of Federation colonists from the Cardassian border in a disputed territory who were joined by some Starfleet officers who joined them to fight for their rights. The producers had the Maquis introduced in other &quot;Star Trek&quot; series before &quot;Voyager&quot; in four episodes; two in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and two in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;. It was a deliberate reference to the political situation in the West Bank.

In developing Chakotay, the producers sought the assistance of Jamake Highwater, a writer of more than 25 books of both fiction and non-fiction related to Native American myths and traditions. Highwater was a controversial choice of advisor, having been exposed by Hank Adams and Vine Deloria, Jr. as taking a fake Native American ancestry to sell books. Around September 21, 1993, Highwater gave seven pages of notes to producers regarding Chakotay&#x27;s backstory, but his tribal ancestry was unresolved. By the end of that month, Michael Piller drafted the first version of the writer&#x27;s bible for the series in which the character was named &quot;Chakotoy&quot;. By the time Piller wrote the first draft of the story that eventually became the &quot;Voyager&quot; pilot &quot;Caretaker&quot;, the character was known as &quot;Chakotay&quot; and been made a Sioux. By the third draft of the story, submitted at the start of November, he had become a Hopi, but by the following February, he once again had no tribal affiliation.

Winrich Kolbe, the director of &quot;Caretaker&quot;, was involved in casting the main cast for the series. He described the casting process for the part of Chakotay as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans who were in the Screen Actors Guild. The casting process came down to two actors, and the producers decided on Robert Beltran, who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera &quot;Models Inc.&quot; and was of Mexican heritage. Beltran was not familiar with &quot;Star Trek&quot; before auditioning, and went along on the strength of the &quot;Caretaker&quot; script which showed the character becoming the second in command of &quot;Voyager&quot; after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta quadrant. Beltran explained the audition experience: &quot;I felt neutral about the audition, didn&#x27;t much care one way or the other. I went in the first time and wasn&#x27;t really trying to get the part. They asked to see me again, and they wanted to see more of an edge to the character.&quot;

Chakotay was originally written as a &quot;calm, stoic&quot; character, but Beltran expanded on the character during the audition process, something that Kolbe credited him for. The writer&#x27;s bible described Chakotay as a very traditional Native American with an altar and traditional art in his quarters. It also mentioned his spirit guide, something which was picked up in the media report in &quot;TV Guide&quot;. Beltran wore a facial tattoo while playing Chakotay, which was applied with make-up. The design was created by Michael Westmore, who deliberately created it so it did not represent any particular tribal culture. The in-universe story of the tattoo and Chakotay&#x27;s tribal origins were explained in the episode &quot;Tattoo&quot;.

Beltran gained the reputation on-set as a comedian. Following the first season and during a group interview with &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, Beltran joked that he was asked to perform in &quot;Hamlet&quot; during the summer in Albuquerque, but had been asked to wear Chakotay&#x27;s facial tattoo. During that time, he worked on the Oliver Stone film &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995). During the period when &quot;Voyager&quot; was run by Taylor and Piller as the executive producers, Beltran gave feedback on the character which was taken into account. He later explained that this ended following the introduction of Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine onto the cast and Brannon Braga taking over from Taylor and Piller. Beltran felt that Chakotay was one of the characters alongside Harry Kim, Tuvok, and Neelix who were left behind by the new writers, who tended to concentrate on Janeway, Seven, and The Doctor.

Beltran said that he was not aware of the effects this was having on the rest of the cast, saying: &quot;For me it was like, &#x27;OK, you can fire me if you want to. Go ahead, and I&#x27;ll leave.&#x27;&quot; He compared his experience on &quot;Voyager&quot; to working in a car factory, and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity. Beltran explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors, and in the end, he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make &quot;very much difference, except to a very, very small percentage of fans who maybe didn&#x27;t like what I said.&quot;

In an interview to publicize the final episode of &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Endgame&quot;, Beltran said: &quot;We all had a great relationship with each other and we&#x27;ve all said how much we enjoy our crew. We have a terrific crew. But at the same time, I&#x27;m looking forward to what&#x27;s next. It&#x27;s exciting to know that something unknown is next.&quot; The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and Chakotay. Ryan found this relationship confusing for the characters, as although it had been suggested in the episode &quot;Human Error&quot;, in the intervening episodes, the producers had told her and Beltran to ignore it.

==Appearances==

===Background===
Chakotay&#x27;s backstory was explained during the course of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. He was born in 2329 on a Federation colony near Cardassian space in the demilitarized zone. While young, he was looked after by his grandfather. At the age of 15, Chakotay visited Earth with his father, who sought to find his tribe&#x27;s ancestral home in Central America and the descendants of the Rubber Tree People. He was resistant to this, and instead dreamed of going into space and had heroes such as John Kelly, a pioneering astronaut in the early 21st century. He chose to enter Starfleet Academy against his father&#x27;s wishes, and his entry was sponsored by Captain Sulu.[A] He attended Starfleet Academy from 2344 to 2348, where he engaged in the sport of boxing. After graduating, he was assigned to a starship. One of his earliest away missions resulted in a diplomatic incident on Ktaria VII, and he was also on the team that made first contact with the Tarkannans.

He was assigned as an instructor in Starfleet&#x27;s Advanced Tactical Training and achieved the rank of lieutenant commander. Following the death of his father in 2368 while defending his colony from the Cardassians, Chakotay resigned his Starfleet commission and joined the Maquis. At the time of his resignation, one of his students was Ro Laren. After he joined the Maquis, he became captain of a vessel named the &quot;Val Jean&quot;, with a crew which among others included his lover Seska (Martha Hackett), B&#x27;Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), and Tuvok (Tim Russ), who was actually Captain Janeway&#x27;s Chief of Security, on an undercover mission to infiltrate the Maquis.

===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===

====The Kazon and Seska====
In the pilot episode of &quot;Voyager&quot;, while the crew on the &quot;Val Jean&quot; seek to evade a Cardassian vessel captained by Gul Evek (Richard Poe) in the Badlands, the vessel is transported some 70,000 light years across the galaxy into the Delta Quadrant by the creature known as the Caretaker. After the Federation starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot; is also trapped in the Delta Quadrant and Tuvok was revealed to be a Starfleet agent, Chakotay agrees with Captain Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to work together to find two of their missing crew. Following an attack by the Kazon, Chakotay destroyed the &quot;Val Jean&quot; to save &quot;Voyager&quot; and the Maquis crew joined the Federation ship. Chakotay was given a provisional rank of commander and named executive officer, the second-in-command of the vessel and the crew seeks to return home to the Alpha Quadrant.

The Kazon continue to be a hindrance during &quot;Voyager&quot; initial period in the Delta Quadrant, with Chakotay dismayed in &quot;State of Flux&quot;. The incident occurs while Tuvok and he were investigating a dark matter nebula, and he sought to prevent the ship from returning there, as an alien species wants to feed on the crew&#x27;s neural energy. After &quot;Voyager&quot; enters the nebula, Chakotay possesses Neelix (Ethan Phillips) and guides the ship out using a medicine wheel as a map. Shortly afterwards, The Doctor (Robert Picardo) is able to restore Chakotay&#x27;s mind into his body. At the end of the first season, Chakotay supported Tuvok&#x27;s aim of helping the former Maquis crew adapt better to life on &quot;Voyager&quot; in &quot;Learning Curve&quot;, by showing them the enforcement techniques of the Maquis.

In the second season episode &quot;Tattoo&quot;, Chakotay meets with an alien race who influenced the ancestors of his tribe. They perceived &quot;Voyager&quot; as a threat because they had thought his people had been wiped out. He was able to resolve the problem using the teachings of his father. The Kazon returned and attacked &quot;Voyager&quot; in &quot;Maneuvers&quot;, where they stole a transporter control module. Chakotay took it upon himself to retrieve the device, recognising that Seska was behind it. He managed to destroy it, but was captured and tortured by the Kazon in the process. He was rescued by &quot;Voyager&quot;, and shortly afterwards, he was contacted by Seska, who informed him that she had impregnated herself with his DNA. In &quot;Resolutions&quot;, Chakotay and Janeway are infected with a virus which requires them to quarantine themselves on a nearby planet. The two began to show signs of affection for each other, but their stay is short-lived after &quot;Voyager&quot; under the captaincy of Tuvok agrees a deal with the Vidiians for a cure. The pair agree to return to the status quo on &quot;Voyager&quot;, but remain good friends.

Chakotay was contacted by Seska in &quot;Basics&quot; to say that his son had been born, and the Kazon were threatening to condemn her to the life of a slave. &quot;Voyager&quot; attempted to extract Seska and the child, but it was a trap and resulted in the Kazon boarding the vessel and stranding the Federation/Maquis crew on a nearby planet. While Tom Paris (Robert Duncan McNeil), The Doctor, and Lon Suder (Brad Dourif), along with allied Talaxian forces, sought to retake &quot;Voyager&quot;, Chakotay was instrumental in the crew&#x27;s survival on the planet. He saved Kes (Jennifer Lien) from a local tribe, and built an alliance with them. The crew retook &quot;Voyager&quot;, and in the process Seska was killed. The child was discovered not to be Chakotay&#x27;s, but instead a Cardassian/Kazon hybrid and the son of the Kazon-Nistrim leader First Maje Culluh (Anthony De Longis).

====Entering Borg space====
The first indication that &quot;Voyager&quot; was approaching Borg space was shown in the episode &quot;Unity&quot;. While investigating a Federation distress call in a shuttlecraft, Chakotay was injured by the natives of a planet. Another group saves him, and Chakotay discovers that the colonists are former Borg whose access to the main hive-mind was disrupted. He is linked to a local hive-mind to help him to heal, and after being returned to &quot;Voyager&quot;, he is forced against his will to reactivate the colonists&#x27; former Borg Cube. Chakotay is released from the new &quot;cooperative&quot; after the Cube self-destructs, leaving the planet with a hive-mind separate from the main collective. Chakotay is captured by the Voth scientist Gegen (Henry Woronicz) in &quot;Distant Origin&quot;, who is seeking to prove his hypothesis that the Voth came from Earth. When Gegen is placed on trial by his people, Chakotay seeks to argue in his defense. Ultimately, Gegen is forced to back down to save &quot;Voyager&quot; after the Voth threaten to destroy the vessel. Before they depart, Chakotay gives a model globe of the Earth to Gegen as a present.

His experience with the disconnected Borg resulted in Chakotay being against a plan to ally with the Borg against Species 8472 in &quot;Scorpion&quot;, causing conflict between Captain Janeway and him. The alliance results in Seven of Nine and a number of other Borg drones being placed on &quot;Voyager&quot; and Janeway injured. Although he was ordered to continue with the alliance, Chakotay seeks to renegotiate the alliance, but Seven refuses any changes. When she opens a rift to Fluidic Space, Chakotay decompresses the cargo bay, sending all the Borg drones out into space with the exception of Seven. Later, when the Borg attempt to double-cross &quot;Voyager&quot;, Chakotay activates his localised neural link, confusing Seven and allowing Torres to disable her link to the Collective permanently.

Chakotay played an important role when &quot;Voyager&quot; was attacked in their dreams by a species that existed in a shared dream state, using meditative techniques of his people to induce a state of lucid dreaming that allowed him to wake himself up and plant a mental &quot;command&quot; that he would see Earth&#x27;s moon in any dream. With the rest of the crew asleep with the exception of the Doctor, Chakotay was able to track down the aliens&#x27; home planet, ordering the Doctor to destroy the canyon where the dream species slept if they would not release the rest of the crew. During the &quot;Year of Hell&quot;, Chakotay is captured by the Krenim scientist Annorax (Kurtwood Smith) on a Time Ship. The two first attempt to work together as Annorax agrees to restore the now damaged &quot;Voyager&quot; if Chakotay complies with his demands. After Annorax wipes out a species, though, he helps to disable the ship, allowing Captain Janeway to destroy it by ramming &quot;Voyager&quot; into it. This results in the timeline being reset, and the events of the episode were undone. In &quot;Unforgettable&quot;, he falls in love with Kellin (Virginia Madsen), a member of a xenophobic race who have developed a technology to prevent others from forming long-term memories of them. As such, he is informed that they were previously in love when she was on &quot;Voyager&quot; a month earlier, and rekindle their relationship despite Chakotay not remembering the earlier encounter. Another member of her race removes Kellin&#x27;s memories of Chakotay and installs a virus to remove all records of their race. Chakotay takes to writing out his memories of Kellin on paper so that he will not forget them.

He was placed in command of &quot;Voyager&quot; after Seven was captured by the Borg in &quot;Dark Frontier&quot; and destroyed a transwarp conduit. Chakotay is later one of the members of the crew who were captured by Borg children in &quot;Collective&quot; and was saved after Seven&#x27;s intervention. Initially, Chakotay and Seven did not get along, but he would come to realise that he was mistaken in that opinion. Towards the end of the seventh season in &quot;Human Error&quot;, Seven simulates a relationship with Chakotay on the holodeck. A Borg implant was preventing her from feeling strong emotions without any physical ill effects, which prevented her from seeking a romantic relationship with the real Chakotay. By the time of the series finale, &quot;Endgame&quot;, The Doctor had managed to remove the implant, allowing Seven to pursue a relationship with Chakotay. The alternative future seen at the start of the episode showed that Seven and Chakotay were eventually married, but she died while &quot;Voyager&quot; was still travelling home. Chakotay died in 2394, following &quot;Voyager&quot; return, and Admiral Janeway visits his grave marker in that episode. This future was undone by the future Janeway travelling back in time to &quot;Voyager&quot; to return it to Earth sooner.

===&quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;===
Sometime prior to 2383, Chakotay was named Captain of the USS &quot;Protostar&quot; and was in command when the ship was taken by the Vau N&#x27;Akat. Chakotay&#x27;s mission was to continue exploration of the Delta Quadrant after &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; return, but his ship fell through a time rift into the future where it was captured by the Vau N&#x27;Akat who blamed the Federation for the destruction of their home planet in a civil war. The Vau N&#x27;Akat attempted to use the &quot;Protostar&quot; to send a weapon called a living construct back in time to destroy the Federation, but Chakotay and his first officer Adreek-Hu managed to launch themselves with the weapon onboard, forcing the Vau N&#x27;Akat to chase after it. At the end of the first season, following the destruction of the &quot;Protostar&quot;, a new temporal rift is opened through which Starfleet receives a distress call from Chakotay 52 years into the future.

In the second season, Janeway leads a rescue mission for Chakotay with her cadets, who were the ones to find and crew the &quot;Protostar&quot; after it was sent back in time, traveling into the future with the plan to help Chakotay and Adreek to launch the ship and then to rescue them. However, they accidentally change history, allowing Chakotay and Adreek to escape with their ship through the rift, sending it elsewhere and creating a temporal paradox that starts destroying the universe. With the help of Wesley Crusher, the cadets eventually find Chakotay in the present where he has been marooned for ten years on another planet, becoming a broken man following the loss of his crew and hope. The cadets manage to reignite Chakotay&#x27;s spirit and help him to repair the &quot;Protostar&quot; and escape, reuniting with the &quot;Voyager&quot;-A and Janeway. With the universe still in danger from the paradox and Ascencia, the last of the hostile Vau N&#x27;Akat from the future, Janeway, Chakotay, and the cadets embark upon a mission to launch the &quot;Protostar&quot; into the past where it will be found by the younger selves of the cadets, repairing the timeline. Returning to Starfleet, Chakotay becomes the new captain of the &quot;Voyager&quot;-A before Mars is destroyed by rogue synths, changing everything for the Federation. Alongside Janeway and the Doctor, Chakotay gives the cadets field commissions as ensigns and the new &quot;Protostar&quot;-class ship, the USS &quot;Prodigy&quot;, which has been turned into a training ship. During their time together, Chakotay becomes a mentor to Dal R&#x27;El who expresses doubts about his future after seeing that he won&#x27;t be the captain. Chakotay explains to Dal that he struggled all of his life to find a place where he belonged before becoming &quot;Voyager&#x27;s&quot; first officer. While Chakotay wasn&#x27;t the captain, being the loyal support of Janeway instead was where he finally found his purpose. Dal later takes this to heart, giving the captain&#x27;s chair to Gwyn and serving as the first officer of the &quot;Prodigy&quot; instead.

==Reception==
Some criticism was directed at Chakotay&#x27;s character development during the series. James Lileks for the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; said that &quot;Chakotay, the rock-solid First Officer, remained rock-solid&quot;, but also suggested that &quot;[a]ll of the characters ended the series as they began.&quot;

Critics commented on the relationship between Janeway and Chakotay, with psychologist Richard Borofsky&#x27;s views published in &quot;The Boston Herald&quot;. He suggested that by several seasons into &quot;Voyager&quot;, Chakotay had come to terms with his feelings for his Captain, but she was hesitant about entering into a relationship with a member of her crew. For the relationship to work in the future, it was said that Chakotay should not try to lead the relationship and Janeway needed to be more vulnerable. Following the end of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the romance between Chakotay and Janeway was described in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as the one most wanted to be seen on screen in any of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, but that &quot;it never panned out. Dang!&quot; Chakotay&#x27;s relationship with Seven was also commented on, and both UGO and io9 complained that the relationship appeared at random.

In 2016 Chakotay was ranked as the eleventh most important character out of 100 of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. In 2018, CBR ranked Chakotay the 20th best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In July 2019, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked &quot;The Fight&quot; as one of the top five worst of the series, singling out Chakotay as a major problem in the show noting how he did not really fit in, and had poor development.

For his portrayal as Chakotay, Beltran won the Nosotros Golden Eagle Award for Outstanding Actor in a Television Series in 1997. He was nominated in 1996 for the NCLR Bravo Award for Outstanding Television Series Actor in a Crossover Role, and the ALMA Award for Outstanding Individual Performance in a Television Series in a Crossover Role in 1998 and 1999.

===Themes===
Chakotay&#x27;s inclusion in the main cast of &quot;Voyager&quot; was seen by critics as one of several who were used to highlight the diversity within the series. This was highlighted during the episode &quot;Faces&quot;, in which one scene showed Janeway, Tuvok, Harry Kim, and Chakotay in a single camera pan. Beltran&#x27;s individual position was that he was &quot;continually positioned as an exotic native other in relation to the white female Captain Janeway&quot;, and was used to &quot;help the white protagonist and progress the internal narrative.&quot;

The placement of a character of indigenous peoples descent in science fiction was highlighted in the media. Drew Hayden Taylor said that Chakotay was &quot;perhaps the most well-known&quot;. Of Chakotay&#x27;s origin, he said: &quot;They never actually say what nation he is, but I do believe it&#x27;s some Central American tribe.&quot; Hayden Taylor wrote in a later article in 2012 describing the rise of Native American characters in the &quot;Twilight&quot; film series that Chakotay was still the sole popular example of a Native American character in science fiction. Chakotay was also described as &quot;the only First Nations role model around in a futuristic setting&quot; in the 2005 book, &quot;&quot;Indian&quot; Stereotypes in TV Science Fiction: First Nations&#x27; Voices Speak Out&quot;, but was also referred to as the &quot;quintessential Tonto in outer space&quot;. A similar criticism was highlighted of the character in &quot;Medicine Bags and Dog Tags: American Indian Veterans from Colonial Times to the Second Iraq War&quot; (2008), which called Chakotay &quot;a creature of white fantasies&quot; and suggested that he was &quot;far more stereotypical than Tonto&quot; as &quot;at least Tonto was heroic and saved the Lone Ranger once in a while&quot;.

Although religion was referenced during the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, such as in the &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot; episode &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot;, it did not take a more prominent role until later in the series, with &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; exploring the Bajorans&#x27; beliefs and &quot;Voyager&quot; concentrating on those of Chakotay. These included vision quests, and other interpretations of Native American culture which were described by critics as showing a &quot;very Hollywood version of Plains-culture religion&quot;.

The appearance of a medicine wheel in the episode &quot;Cathexis&quot; was described by Sierra S. Adare as showing Chakotay as a &quot;&#x27;good Indian&#x27; in the classic Pocahontas sense&quot;. Chakotay is seen attempting to introduce rituals and meditation techniques to other crew members, something they failed to understand. These were said to be contrary to the tribal history described in &quot;Tattoo&quot;, which was said to say that Chakotay&#x27;s tribe descended from a pre-Mayan culture in Central America. Adare attributed this to Euro-American/European writers writing inaccurate information into scripts. However, the appearance of the character was described as &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.

==Notes==

*A ^ The reference to Captain Sulu in the episode &quot;Tattoo&quot; did not make it clear whether it was Hikaru Sulu or Demora Sulu to whom Chakotay referred; however, he stated that the Captain was a &quot;he&quot;. The noncanon novels by Pocket Books have disagreed on which Captain Sulu to whom Chakotay referred. In a short story in the anthology &quot;Tales From The Captain Table&quot;, it is said to be Demora Sulu, but in &quot;Pathways&quot; by Jeri Taylor, it is stated that it was Hiromi Sulu, the son of Demora.

<doc id="27086" wikidata="Q1070917" url="?curid=27086" title="Maquis (Star Trek)">
<text>In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science-fiction franchise, the Maquis are a 24th-century paramilitary organization-terrorist group (like the World War II Maquis in the French Resistance and the Spanish Maquis that emerged in the Spanish Civil War). The group is introduced in the two-part episode &quot;The Maquis&quot; of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, building on a plot foundation introduced in the episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and appear in later episodes of those two series as well as &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. The Maquis story debuted when three &quot;Star Trek&quot; television shows running from 1987 to 2001 took place in the same fictional science-fiction universe at the same time in the future (the 2360s–2370s). As a result, the Maquis story was told across several episodes in all three shows. The Maquis are especially prominent in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, whose premise is that a Starfleet crew and a Maquis crew are stranded together on the opposite side of the Galaxy.

The Maquis are also featured in the comic book saga &quot;The Maquis: Soldier of Peace&quot; by Malibu Comics, who held the rights to &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; comics in the 1990s, and in the book series &quot;The Badlands&quot; by Susan Wright.

==Concept==
The concept of the Maquis was introduced by the creators of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; so that it could play a role in the upcoming &quot;Voyager&quot;, which was scheduled to begin airing in 1995. As Jeri Taylor commented, &quot;We knew that we wanted to include a renegade element in &quot;Voyager&quot;, and that the show would involve a ship housing both Starfleet people and those idealistic freedom fighters that the Federation felt were outlaws [i.e., the Maquis].&quot; Therefore, the creators of &quot;Star Trek&quot; decided to create a backstory for the Maquis in several episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, and named them after the French guerrilla fighters of the Second World War. The recurring characters of Michael Eddington (Kenneth Marshall) in &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes) in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; became members of the Maquis, and &quot;Voyager&quot; contained regular former Maquis characters such as Chakotay (Robert Beltran) and B&#x27;Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), as well as recurring characters such as Seska (Martha Hackett). While the book by Erdmann links the Maquis to the French Maquis, their history seems to more closely resemble the Spanish Maquis.

In &quot;Caretaker&quot;, the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, the titular starship pursues a Maquis ship into the Badlands before being teleported to the Delta Quadrant.

According to the fictional storyline of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, the Maquis were formed in the 24th century after a peace treaty was enacted between the United Federation of Planets and the Cardassian Union, redesignating the demilitarized zone between the two powers, which resulted in the Federation ceding several of their colony worlds to the Cardassians. Although the colonists were offered free relocation to elsewhere in Federation territory, some insisted on remaining on the ceded worlds; effectively becoming subject to the Cardassian Union, which behaves aggressively towards them. Some of these colonists subsequently formed the Maquis to protect themselves from Cardassian aggression, due to a lack of official support from the Federation; who feared breaking the peace treaty with the Cardassians, which would lead to war.

Nonetheless, various Federation members supported the Maquis&#x27; cause, and illegally supplied them with weapons and other technology that they could use in their struggle. In several cases, the Federation actually intervened in the war between the Maquis and the Cardassians, aiding the latter in recognition of the peace treaty. In one case, the Federation ship tracked a Maquis vessel to the Badlands with the intention of apprehending it, but an alien force transported both to the Delta Quadrant on the opposite side of the Milky Way Galaxy. The two crews were forced to unite to survive against alien threats such as the Kazon and the Borg. In later years, when the Cardassians joined the Dominion to fight in the Dominion War against the Federation, the Dominion aided the Cardassian military in wiping out the Maquis; a prelude to their war against the Federation and its allies.

The Maquis provide moral challenges to existing characters such as Quark and Sisko on Deep Space Nine. Quark is lured into selling weapons to the Maquis by an attractive Vulcan woman, showing how his desire for money unwittingly turned him into an illegal-arms dealer. Sisko must navigate the internal politics of the Cardassians and Federation as he tries to uphold the peace treaty, in addition to being tested by his old friend trying to recruit him into the rebellion.

==Episodes==
Cardassians were introduced on &quot;Star Trek The Next Generation&quot; in January 1991 with the episode &quot;The Wounded&quot;, which lays some of the foundation for the Federation settlements on the Cardassian border. &quot;Ensign Ro&quot; aired in October 1991 introducing the experiences of living in Cardassian-occupied space. &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; premiered in January 1993 and is primarily set within former Cardassian-occupied space. &quot;The Next Generation&quot;″s &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; aired in March 1994 and introduced the results of the Federation-Cardassian peace treaty and establishment of a new demilitarized zone with Federation colonists in Cardassian territory. The Maquis were then formally introduced one month later on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;″s two-part episode &quot;The Maquis&quot; and would then be the focus of many episodes of the franchise.

The episode &quot;Learning Curve&quot; used the different operating styles of Maquis and Federation as a plot point when some Maquis were taken aboard as crew on a Federation starship.

==Characters==

Various members of the Maquis are characters in &quot;TNG&quot;, &quot;DS9&quot;, and &quot;Voyager&quot;, although membership is sometimes transitory and as revealed by the Maquis saga, for example some are revealed as Federation agents. The reveal of a character&#x27;s identity is common plot device throughout the story line. Many episodes play on these questions.

==Fictional spacecraft==
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction franchise, the Maquis are known to use a diverse mix of older spacecraft from the United Federation of Planets. Three aspects are that the spacecraft are older, as much as several decades, there are a variety of types in service, and finally, they tend to be of Federation design. Although the spacecraft are old, the Maquis are known to upgrade them with advanced weaponry to take on larger Cardassian vessels such as the &quot;Galor&quot; class.

*The &quot;Val Jean&quot; in &quot;Caretaker&quot;
*Maquis raider as seen on &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;The Maquis, Part II&quot; The Maquis spaceship in this episode was designed by Rich Sternbach, and constructed of fiberglass and resin.
*Dreadnought, former Cardassian weapon commandeered by the Maquis (&quot;Dreadnought&quot;)
*Maquis Interceptor/Maquified Peregrine-class

The Maquis Fighter seen in the DS9 episodes (&quot;The Maquis&quot; I &amp; II) was designed by Jim Martin and the model for the special effect shots was built by Tony Meinenger. The fighter/transport used by Ro was also designed by Jim Martin, but that model was built by Greg Jein.

In 2006, the miniature model of the Maquis raider from &quot;The Maquis, Part II&quot; went for 10,800 USD at auction.

==Reception==
An example of a review of Maquis episode was in 2016; &quot;USA Today&quot; the episode &quot;The Maquis&quot; as a must-watch for the entire &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise for its introduction of the Maquis story, which would also be an element in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. They note the interesting science fiction story elements of the Federation, Cardassians, Maquis, and Bajorans playing off one another to create complex themes centered around the fictional space station Deep Space Nine.

== Broadcast and releases ==
Episodes featuring the Maquis were distributed in many ways because the story was spread out across multiple series. For instance, &quot;Star Trek : Deep Space Nine&quot; was broadcast in syndication, while &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; was on the UPN network. Home Video Releases of the television episodes include an array of LaserDisc, VHS, and DVD titles. Relevant &quot;Star Trek: Trek The Next Generation&quot; titles were also released on Blu-Ray disc in HD.

For example, the two part episode &quot;The Maquis&quot; was released in two separate LaserDisc releases in the United States. A double episode 12 inch optical disc with &quot;Blood Oath&quot; and &quot;The Maquis, Part I&quot; was released on October 6, 1998, in the United States. Another item with &quot;The Maquis, Part II&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot; was released on October 20, 1998.

<doc id="27087" wikidata="Q1107814" url="?curid=27087" title="Kes (Star Trek)">
<text>Kes is a fictional character played by Jennifer Lien on the American science fiction television show &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. The series follows the crew of the starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot;, stranded far from home and struggling to get back to Earth. Kes joins the crew in the pilot episode &quot;Caretaker&quot;, opening an aeroponics garden and working as the medical assistant to the artificial intelligence known as the Doctor. She is a member of a telepathic alien species known as the Ocampa who have latent psychic abilities and a life span of only nine years. Her storylines focus on encouraging the Doctor to develop his humanity and dealing with her Talaxian boyfriend Neelix&#x27;s jealousy. She also seeks to expand upon her mental capabilities, leaving in the fourth season after her powers threaten to destroy the ship. She reappears in a season six episode and features in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; novels and short stories.

&quot;Voyager&quot;″s creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor designed Kes to be a rapidly-aging character who would provide audiences with a different perspective on time. Although Kes is portrayed as fragile and innocent, she is also shown as having hidden strength and maturity. &quot;Voyager&quot;″s producers reluctantly fired Lien after her personal issues affected her reliability on set. At the time, this was not openly discussed and her departure was attributed to other reasons; these ranged from Lien voluntarily leaving to pursue other roles to her being removed to make room for Jeri Ryan&#x27;s introduction as Seven of Nine.

Kes was a fan favorite character while &quot;Voyager&quot; was airing, although critics reacted more negatively, finding the character boring and without a clear purpose. Lien was praised for her performance, which was highlighted in reviews of individual episodes. Kes&#x27;s age was the subject of critical discussion, questioning if she was too young to be dating Neelix. Lien&#x27;s removal from &quot;Voyager&quot; received mixed reviews from critics; some preferred the addition of Seven of Nine while others were disappointed by this casting change. Reviewers and fans disliked her return in the season six episode &quot;Fury&quot;, which some media outlets called one of the worst moments in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. Academics have analyzed Kes&#x27;s representation of femininity, her relationship with Captain Kathryn Janeway, and her mental abilities.

==Appearances==
===Background and introduction===
Introduced in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;″s pilot episode &quot;Caretaker&quot;, Kes is an Ocampa—a telepathic alien species with latent psychic abilities and a life span of nine years. She was born and raised on the Ocampa home world in an underground city, which was constructed by an alien known as the Caretaker after he inadvertently destroyed the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. The Ocampa have grown dependent on his care. The Caretaker realizes he is dying and abducts beings from across the galaxy, including the Starfleet crew of the starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot;. He does this to find a compatible mate to produce an offspring who would continue caring for the Ocampa.

Kes dreams of exploring the galaxy and finds a way out of the city, but is captured and tortured by the Kazon. She is rescued by her Talaxian boyfriend Neelix who is assisted by &quot;Voyager&quot; captain Kathryn Janeway and her crew. When the Kazon attack and attempt to steal the Caretaker&#x27;s technology, Janeway orders the destruction of his vessel. Stranded in the Delta Quadrant, she agrees to have Kes and Neelix remain on &quot;Voyager&quot;.

===On &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===
Aboard &quot;Voyager&quot;, Kes starts an aeroponics garden to provide produce to the crew. While working as a medical assistant for the Doctor, an artificial intelligence projected as a hologram, she encourages him to develop his social skills and the crew to recognize him as more than a machine. The Vidiians harvest Neelix&#x27;s lungs in &quot;Phage&quot;, and Kes donates one of her own to him. In &quot;Elogium&quot;, emanations from space-dwelling lifeforms cause Kes to prematurely enter a fertile period. An Ocampa goes through this process only once and it is her only time to have a child. After discussions, Neelix agrees to be a father, but Kes decides against having a child. When &quot;Voyager&quot; moves away from the aliens, the Doctor determines Kes had a false alarm and would be able to conceive in the future. Neelix grows more paranoid regarding &quot;Voyager&quot;″s helmsman Tom Paris and his interest in Kes, such as in &quot;Twisted&quot;; the two resolve this tension in &quot;Parturition&quot; during an away mission.

When &quot;Voyager&quot; discovers an Ocampa colony in &quot;Cold Fire&quot;, its leader Tanis teaches Kes psychokinesis. Prior to this, Security Chief Tuvok had been training Kes. She uses her abilities in earlier episodes, including having visions of a planet&#x27;s destruction in &quot;Time and Again&quot; and showing an eidetic memory in &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;. Unable to control her psychokinesis abilities, she destroys the aeroponics garden and nearly kills Tuvok by boiling his blood. The crew discover that Tanis is working with the Caretaker&#x27;s mate, Suspiria, to destroy &quot;Voyager&quot;, but Kes subdues him with her powers. In &quot;Warlord&quot;, Tiernan, a former dictator of the planet Illari, possesses Kes and uses her abilities to stage a coup on the new leader. Under his influence, Kes breaks up with Neelix. Although &quot;Voyager&quot; frees Kes from Tieran&#x27;s control and kills him, the experience traumatizes her.

In &quot;Darkling&quot;, Kes is attracted to Zahir, a member of an alien species of explorers, and considers temporarily joining his journey. The Doctor injures Zahir and kidnaps Kes after developing an evil alter ego while grafting new personalities into his program. After the Doctor is returned to normal, Kes decides to remain on &quot;Voyager&quot;. Throughout &quot;Before and After&quot;, Kes lives short periods of her life in reverse order, from her death to her conception, as part of an alternative timeline. During &quot;Scorpion&quot;, Kes becomes telepathically connected with Species 8472 who are at war with the Borg.

Kes&#x27;s powers advance at an exponential rate in &quot;The Gift&quot; to the point that she can no longer stay aboard &quot;Voyager&quot; as they threaten to destroy the ship. Leaving on a shuttlecraft, she hurls &quot;Voyager&quot; and its crew safely beyond Borg space, roughly 10,000 light-years closer to Earth, before turning into living energy. In &quot;Fury&quot;, Kes is unable to control her evolving mental abilities and fears that she would not be accepted by other Ocampa. She blames these changes on Janeway for allowing her to join &quot;Voyager&quot;. Breaking into &quot;Voyager&quot;, she travels back in time to negotiate with the Vidiians to take her younger self back to the Ocampa home world. The younger Kes makes a hologram to remind her future self about her love for the crew. This message encourages the older Kes to return to Ocampa.

===Other appearances===
In 1995, Pocket Books began publishing &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; novels set during the show&#x27;s run and after its series finale. Kes appears in the 1995 novelization of &quot;Caretaker&quot; by L. A. Graf and the 1996 book for &quot;Flashback&quot; by Diane Carey. Nathan Archer began writing the 1995 book &quot;Ragnorak&quot;, before the pilot episode aired and said that his interpretation of Kes, based on the series bible, was radically different from her depiction in the show. In Greg Cox&#x27;s 1997 novel, &quot;The Black Shore&quot;, Kes has horrific visions after the crew takes shore leave on a seemingly idyllic planet. Cox included scenes between Kes and Chief Engineer B&#x27;Elanna Torres after reading an interview in which actor Roxann Dawson, who portrays Torres, talked about how the characters rarely interacted. &quot;Marooned&quot;, published in the same year, focuses on Kes being kidnapped by a space pirate; the author Christie Golden said that she wanted to explore how Kes would appear to an alien with a lifespan of thousands of years.

Kes appears in stories published after &quot;Voyager&quot; ended. She goes back in time to help create an Ocampa and Nacene hybrid in the &quot;String Theory&quot; trilogy (2005–2006) by Jeffrey Lang, Kirsten Beyer, and Heather Jarman. The book describes the Kes from &quot;Fury&quot; as the &quot;manifestation of her dark side&quot; made as a byproduct of this time travel. Jarman used &quot;Evolution&quot; to explore questions she had with &quot;Voyager&quot;, such as how Neelix felt about Kes after her departure and what the Ocampa home world looked like in the past. In Beyer&#x27;s 2012 book, &quot;The Eternal Tide&quot;, Kes helps to resurrect a dead Janeway.

Kes is also depicted in short stories, like Penny A. Proctor&#x27;s &quot;Restoration&quot; from the 2002 anthology &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds V&quot; in which she revives Ocampa&#x27;s ecosystem. She is included in three stories from the 2005 collection &quot;Distant Shores&quot;. In Kim Sheard&#x27;s &quot;Winds of Change&quot;, Kes struggles with aggression after &quot;Warlord&quot; and asks Torres for advice. Sheard developed the concept after being told the anthology would focus on unusual character combinations. &quot;Closure&quot; is about Neelix seeing Kes after being caught in a cave-in with former Borg drone Seven of Nine. The author James Swallow was inspired by how Ethan Phillips, who plays Neelix, wanted closure for his character&#x27;s relationship with Kes. In &quot;Brief Candle&quot;, Neelix talks about one of his memories with Kes; the writer Christopher L. Bennett said she was one of his favorite &quot;Voyager&quot; characters.

==Development==
===Creation and casting===
Kes was one of the first nine characters that &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; creators Rick Berman, Michael Piller, and Jeri Taylor developed for the crew of the USS &quot;Voyager&quot; starship. Inspired by the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Child&quot;, Berman, Piller, and Taylor wanted to feature a rapidly-aging character to encourage viewers to reflect on time. Early in production, they nicknamed Kes the Mayfly to reference her short life span. She was set to age a year at the midpoint of each season to emphasize this rapid age progression.

In initial descriptions, Kes was characterized as a potential scout and expert on gangs, but was later changed to be a medical intern, while Neelix assumed a similar role as a guide. When Berman, Piller, and Taylor wrote Kes with psychic powers, production assistant Zayra Cabot hired a paranormal-focused consulting firm, Joan Pearce Research Associates. Joan Pearce created a list of psi abilities, which was used to decide that Kes would be shown with limited telepathy in the pilot episode (&quot;Caretaker&quot;) with further exploration of her power planned for later episodes.

Early in &quot;Voyager&quot;″s development, it was undetermined if Kes would be female, male, or androgynous. &quot;Caretaker&quot; director Winrich Kolbe wanted an actress who &quot;could be fragile but with a steely will underneath&quot;. Jennifer Lien was an &quot;early selection&quot; for the role; Taylor said that she had &quot;this wonderful elfin quality&quot; and projected vulnerability and strength in her audition. Lien was unfamiliar with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, and at the age of nineteen, she was the youngest actor on the show. Jennifer Gatti had also been considered for the role, and would later guest star in the episode &quot;Non Sequitur&quot;.

For the pilot, Robert Blackman designed Kes&#x27;s wardrobe and Michael Westmore created her prosthetic ears. Blackman had difficulty dressing Lien as &quot;Voyager&quot;″s producers were unclear on her character&#x27;s direction. His initial design was for a pastel-colored costume inspired by a sprite; producers rejected it, instead suggesting a costume similar to Peter Pan&#x27;s. The final look was partially modeled on Joan of Arc. Kes&#x27;s wardrobe primarily consisted of tunics, and Lien wore a short blonde wig. Lien tested combinations of wigs and prosthetics, which cinematographer Marvin V. Rush filmed for Berman&#x27;s final approval. Westmore kept the prosthetic simple to facilitate working on 30 Ocampa characters for the pilot episode. Lien said the ear prosthetics impaired her hearing, and she developed an allergic response to them as the series progressed. Starting with the episode &quot;Before and After&quot;, Lien no longer wore the prosthetics and used her longer hair to cover her ears and hide this change; around this point, her costumes also transitioned to tighter jumpsuits.

===Characterization and relationships===
In &quot;Voyager&quot;″s series bible, Kes is characterized as &quot;an innocent who sees humanity through a fresh perspective&quot; and as &quot;delicate, beautiful, [and] young&quot;. The &quot;Caretaker&quot; script describes her as a &quot;dazzling, ethereal beauty, waifish and fragile&quot; who has a &quot;dignity to her bearing, an alertness in her look, that suggests a being of powerful intelligence&quot;. While promoting &quot;Voyager&quot;, Lien said that Kes lacked any &quot;cynicism or precociousness or pretentiousness or sarcasm&quot;, and believed this separated her from the typical roles for young women. Taylor defined the character through her curiosity as demonstrated by how she challenges the Ocampa&#x27;s beliefs and explores her mental abilities. Author Paul Ruditis wrote that Kes has a &quot;fragile power&quot; and balances a &quot;child-like wonder&quot; with a &quot;maturity of someone well into adulthood&quot;.

Kes and Neelix were created as an alien couple who would learn about humanity together. They are portrayed as an unlikely pair in age and appearance, with Kes as the dominant partner keeping Neelix out of trouble. Kes and Neelix are shown sleeping in separate bedrooms, and their sex lives are left vague. Taylor said this was done to avoid potentially offending viewers, particularly families with young children and those against cohabitation. Taylor and Berman also worried that Kes was too young to show in a sexual relationship. In retrospect, writers and producers felt Kes and Neelix never worked as a couple; a break-up scene was filmed for the episode &quot;Fair Trade&quot;, but was cut due to time constraints.

In &quot;Voyager&quot;″s first two seasons, Kes is involved in a love triangle with Neelix and Tom Paris. Neelix becomes increasingly jealous over Paris&#x27;s interest in Kes, although she never returns his advances. None of the actors involved liked this storyline, which was ended to avoid further damaging Neelix and Paris as characters. Aside from Neelix, Kes spent most of her scenes with the Doctor; she was instrumental to helping him develop his humanity and persuading the crew to view him as more than just a machine. The Doctor teaches Kes about medicine and Tuvok helps her to further develop her mental abilities. She is respectful toward the Doctor and Kathryn Janeway, whom she sees as parental figures.

===Departure and return===
In the fourth season, &quot;Voyager&quot;″s producers reluctantly fired Lien when her personal issues affected her reliability on set. She had become increasingly unfocused, requiring multiple takes to complete a scene. Lien refused to discuss or accept help for her problems; Taylor said that no one on the set knew the cause for her behavior, which she described as &quot;something emotionally upset&quot;. Actors on &quot;Voyager&quot; found Lien to be private and shy; Robert Picardo, who plays the Doctor, said that she became &quot;really monosyllabic&quot;. Robert Beltran, who portrays Chakotay, got the impression that either Lien no longer wanted to work on the show or that the shooting schedule was affecting her.

The cast and crew did not publicly disclose the reason for Lien&#x27;s firing. At the time, it was believed Lien was removed to make room for Jeri Ryan as Seven of Nine, but these casting choices were unrelated. Paramount reported that Lien wanted to act in other projects, and Taylor said Kes &quot;did not work out as well as we wanted&quot;. In 2004, writer Kenneth Biller talked about his disappointment about Kes&#x27;s removal:

I was a little bit regretful when Kes left the show, because I thought she was an interesting character to write for—from a science fiction standpoint—because she had certain... she had telepathic abilities, she had this very compressed lifespan, she had things about her character that often lent themselves to interesting storytelling [...] We lost something in losing the Kes character.

UPN executives wanted Kes cut from &quot;Voyager&quot; off-screen without explanation, but Taylor insisted that the character get a proper farewell. Lien last appears as a full-time cast member in &quot;The Gift&quot;. It was intended to be the fifth episode of the fourth season, but was moved to the second after a decision was made to remove Lien earlier than planned. She had a final appearance in the season six episode, &quot;Fury&quot;. Berman asked her to come back before a story was completed. Lien discussed the script with Fuller and Michael Taylor to ensure that Kes was &quot;handled with great care&quot;. Her primary request was for the character to be dramatically different than how she left. In a 2010 interview, Lien said she preferred &quot;The Gift&quot; as her final episode; she disliked her performance in &quot;Fury&quot;, explaining that she had not acted for an extended period and struggled with playing such a different version of Kes.

==Reception==
While &quot;Voyager&quot; was airing, Kes was a fan favorite character, ranking as the most popular from the show on a Usenet newsgroup listing. &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot;″s Larry Bonko felt that she &quot;gave the series heart&quot;. Other critics had negative reviews for Kes, finding her to be boring and without a clear direction. Rob Owen, writing for the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot;, felt she was &quot;reduced to a subservient Nurse Chapel role&quot; early in the series. Henry Mietkiewicz of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; thought she did not contribute much outside of her medical training. In retrospective reviews, Kes was called the show&#x27;s &quot;most superfluous character&quot; by &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s William Hughes, and &quot;generally a pretty crap and useless character&quot; by Tom Pritchard of &quot;Gizmodo&quot;.

Critics praised Jennifer Lien&#x27;s performance as Kes. For the pilot episode, &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Kinsey Lowe described her as bringing a &quot;beguiling blend of naive wonder and fierce dedication&quot; to her character. While critical of &quot;Elogium&quot;, writer David A. McIntee said she convincingly portrayed Kes&#x27;s fear about her physical changes. Andy Patrizio for &quot;IGN&quot; wrote that starting in &quot;Voyager&quot;″s second season, &quot;we really started to see the talents of Jennifer Lien as Kes&quot;. He identified her portrayal of a possessed Kes in &quot;Warlord&quot; as a highlight. &quot;Reactor&quot;&#x27;s Keith DeCandido praised Lien&#x27;s acting in his reviews for &quot;Cold Fire&quot;, &quot;Warlord&quot;, &quot;Before and After&quot;, and &quot;The Gift&quot;.

Kes&#x27;s age was a topic of critical commentary. &quot;Bustle&quot;&#x27;s Marie Southard Ospina praised &quot;Elogium&quot; for its portrayal of a woman voluntarily not having a baby, but felt that Kes&#x27;s age made the moment uncomfortable. Other commentators felt Kes was too young to be dating Neelix. According to &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Juliette Harrisson, the age gap was frequently criticized online. Science fiction author Sylvia Spruck Wrigley interpreted Kes as undergoing puberty in &quot;Elogium&quot;, noting that it raises questions about Neelix starting a relationship with a prepubescent girl. Harrisson and &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;″s Jonathan Storm wrote that the age difference could be rationalized since Kes and Neelix are aliens with different biology than humans.

Some critics praised the decision to remove Kes during &quot;Voyager&quot;″s fourth season, preferring the addition of Seven of Nine. The &quot;Akron Beacon Journal&quot; R.D. Heldenfels described it as a &quot;reasonable trade&quot;, viewing Kes as &quot;wan and increasingly dull&quot;. Pritchard thought Seven of Nine was more complex compared to Kes. Other reviewers disliked this change, as they enjoyed the character. Patrizio was critical of the writers developing new ideas for Seven of Nine after struggling with Kes for three seasons. He preferred Lien&#x27;s acting and Kes as a character over Ryan as Seven of Nine. Writers Duncan Barrett and Michele Barrett cited Lien&#x27;s removal as an example of &quot;Star Trek&quot; having &quot;a serious historical problem with the treatment of its female performers&quot;, explaining that a male lead was never taken off a &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.

Kes&#x27;s return in &quot;Fury&quot; was criticized as one of the worst moments in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. DeCandido considered the story to be insulting to the character describing the script and Lien&#x27;s acting as lacking any &quot;emotional content&quot;. Michael Weyer of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; believed that Kes deserved a better ending and disliked how she came back as &quot;twisted monster whose actions can come off as a spoiled brat&quot;. Fans were also critical of how the episode portrayed Kes. &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s John Andrews had a more positive response to &quot;Fury&quot;, calling it a &quot;sad yet compelling character study&quot;.

==Themes and analysis==
===Femininity===
Academics analyzed Kes as a representation of womanhood and femininity on &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Communication studies professor Mia Consalvo described her as a &quot;woman with stereotypically feminine traits&quot; such as &quot;empathy and caring&quot;. She identified Kes as one of several female characters with similar characteristics on &quot;Star Trek&quot; who are placed in healthcare rather than leadership roles, and argued that this is because the setting of the series &quot;valorized&quot; masculine traits over feminine ones.

American culture historian Peter W. Y. Lee said that &quot;Voyager&quot; characterizes Kes as a &quot;little girl&quot; who struggles to maintain her innocence as the series progresses, specifically with scenes involving sex or motherhood. Lee wrote that unlike other children in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, namely Wesley Crusher, Jake Sisko, Nog, Molly O&#x27;Brien, and Alexander Rozhenko, Kes is more of a &quot;blank slate&quot;. He argued that Kes becomes too mature for this &quot;little girl&quot; role after adopting a &quot;more aggressive womanhood and sexuality&quot; in &quot;Warlord&quot; that foreshadows her having &quot;outgrown her home&quot; and leaving &quot;Voyager&quot;.

&quot;Voyager&quot; aired in the 1990s, a decade that editor Leimar Garcia-Siino characterized by postfeminism and its &quot;reactionary anti-feminist and traditionally gendered views&quot;. Garcia-Siino wrote that although these events shaped the writing for Kes, the character was still portrayed with authority through her hydroponics garden and her medical and psychic training and is shown as reaching self-actualization.

===Relationship with Janeway===
Scholars had varying interpretations of Kes&#x27;s relationship with Janeway. Cultural studies lecturer Debra Bonita Shaw argued that although Janeway accepts characters like Kes into her crew, she treats them as subordinates who must aid in &quot;Voyager&quot;″s return home. Lee considered Janeway more of a parental figure to Kes. He noted that Janeway&#x27;s actor Kate Mulgrew shared this view, particularly for &quot;Elogium&quot;; Mulgrew said the episode&#x27;s focus on Janeway helping Kes with puberty and potential pregnancy and motherhood &quot;showed my involvement with her on a very female level, a very maternal level&quot;.

Roger Kaufman, a scholar in LGBT psychology, interpreted Kes as one of Janeway&#x27;s &quot;significant intimate partnerships&quot;. According to Kaufman, it was shown in their protection of each other, like Janeway saving her in &quot;Sacred Ground&quot; and &quot;Fury&quot;, and Kes sending &quot;Voyager&quot;″s crew past Borg space in &quot;The Gift&quot;. Kaufman wrote that Kes&#x27;s decision to leave &quot;Voyager&quot; used similar language to a lesbian coming out; he paralleled her desire to explore her powers without endangering &quot;Voyager&quot; with a lesbian not wanting to cause trouble for her family of origin.

===Mental abilities===
Scholars focused on how Kes&#x27;s powers contributed to her character development. Lee wrote that &quot;Voyager&quot; focuses Kes&#x27;s character arc on her mental abilities rather than her physical development; he explained that &quot;Kes&#x27;s girl power rested in her brains, not her bared skin&quot;. Aviva Dove Viebahn, a professor of media studies, argued that the non-human Kes is nearly tokenized as a &quot;native informant&quot; whose role is merely to advise the human crew about the Delta Quadrant. For Viebahn, the character&#x27;s mental abilities, which at times are more useful than &quot;Voyager&quot;″s medical and scientific technologies, provide her a degree of agency which elevates her from this &quot;subjugated&quot; role.

&quot;Voyager&quot; often depicts Kes&#x27;s powers as dangerous or unpredictable. Media studies scholar Marion Gymnich wrote that in &quot;Cold Fire&quot;, Kes changes from &quot;generally very friendly and gentle&quot; to &quot;extremely destructive&quot; after being tutored by another Ocampa. She cited her as an example of &quot;Star Trek&quot; negatively portraying telepathy. Comparing &quot;Voyager&quot; to Homer&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Odyssey&quot;, literary scholar Kwasu David Tembo likened Kes to two of the poem&#x27;s characters—Calypso and Circe—as her powers both endanger the ship and aid in its homeward journey. Tembo wrote that Kes and Circe both have the &quot;attractive and equally dangerous aspects of Aeaea and Ocampan power are under the absolute control of a female authority&quot;.

<text>Lieutenant Thomas Eugene &quot;Tom&quot; Paris is a fictional character in the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; and is portrayed by Robert Duncan McNeill. Paris is the chief helmsman, as well as a temporary auxiliary medic, of the USS &quot;Voyager&quot;, a Starfleet ship that was stranded in the Delta Quadrant by an alien entity known as the Caretaker. 

Initially recruited by Captain Kathryn Janeway as a Starfleet &quot;observer&quot; on &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s first mission into the Badlands, Paris was reinstated as a Starfleet officer by Janeway and took on the role of being &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s helmsman after the original helmsman was killed during the ship&#x27;s turbulent displacement from the Alpha Quadrant.

The character&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Eugene&quot;, is a tribute to &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry.

==Background==

The writers planned to use the character of Nicolas Locarno as a template for Tom Paris, a previous similar character played by McNeill in the &quot;Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The First Duty&quot;. &quot;Voyager&quot;″s writers created an entirely new character sharing many of Locarno&#x27;s attributes. One reason for this is that the writers wanted to have the character be a story of redemption, and they did not like the backstory established for Locarno.

Paris&#x27; character has two backstories. The original backstory, and the only one acknowledged onscreen, cast Paris as a disgraced officer dishonorably discharged from Starfleet for covering up pilot error following a shuttle accident on Caldik Prime. In her published novel, &quot;Pathways&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot; producer Jeri Taylor provided an alternative story much more similar to Locarno&#x27;s, moving the accident to Paris&#x27; Academy years and making his fellow cadets the victims of his recklessness.

==Appearances==

=== Prior to &quot;Voyager&quot; ===
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe, &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; takes place in the years 2371 to 2378. Most of Paris&#x27; backstory takes place prior to the 2370s.

Tom Paris is the son of Starfleet Admiral Owen Paris, with most of his other family also hailing from Starfleet. Following his family&#x27;s tradition, Paris attended Starfleet Academy sometime in the 2350s and majored in astrophysics. A gifted pilot, he earned an assignment to the Academy&#x27;s honor squadron.

His relationship with his father was not a good one; while Tom wanted to join the Federation Naval Patrol due to his love for the sea, Owen wanted him to enlist at Starfleet Academy. Admiral Paris often disapproved of his son&#x27;s tendency to get into fights and his resulting punishments.

After his graduation from Starfleet Academy, Paris was assigned to the &quot;USS Exeter&quot;. During his initial tenure at Starfleet, Paris crashed a shuttle he was piloting near Caldik Prime, killing three other Starfleet officers. Afraid he would lose his commission, Paris falsified records to conceal the cause of the accident. His efforts to cover up his pilot error succeeded, but overwhelmed by guilt and regret, he confessed. He was court martialed for his actions and dishonorably discharged from Starfleet. This caused a major rift between Paris and his father.

Following his discharge, Paris left San Francisco for Marseille, where he started spending his time drinking and playing pool in Sandrine&#x27;s, a waterfront bar that he frequented during his academy days. There, Chakotay, a former Starfleet officer now serving with the Maquis, recruited him to serve as a mercenary pilot for the Maquis Rebellion against the Federation. This adventure went no better than his earlier stint in Starfleet as Paris was captured by Starfleet while piloting his first mission for the Maquis.

Tried and convicted of treason for aiding the Maquis Rebellion, Paris was sentenced to serve time in a Federation penal settlement near Auckland, New Zealand.

=== Events of &quot;Voyager&quot; ===
While serving time, Paris is visited by Kathryn Janeway, captain of the starship USS &quot;Voyager&quot;. &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s first mission was to travel to the Badlands and locate a missing Maquis ship commanded by Chakotay, which also has Janeway&#x27;s chief of security Tuvok aboard as a spy. Janeway recruits Paris due to his previous experience working with the Maquis, obtaining his temporary release. In return, Paris would serve as an informant during the mission.

Janeway and the crew of &quot;Voyager&quot;, while searching for the Maquis ship, are thrown into the Delta Quadrant by a massive energy wave created by an alien known as the Caretaker. Once there, they successfully locate the Maquis ship docked at the Caretaker&#x27;s array. The survivors of the incident become stranded about 70,000 light-years from Earth. The Maquis ship is destroyed and its crew joins the Federation crew on &quot;Voyager&quot;. 

The marooning of &quot;Voyager&quot; in the Delta Quadrant provides Paris with a new beginning. Janeway gives Paris a field commission as a Starfleet lieutenant and makes him the chief helmsman of &quot;Voyager&quot;. He had a rough start, however, as Starfleet and Maquis alike viewed Paris with suspicion due to his previous affiliations with both organizations. Paris worked hard to earn his crewmates&#x27; respect. During this time, he became best friends with Ensign Harry Kim, a young officer on his first mission who defied his crewmates to befriend Paris. Eventually Paris is accepted by the crew and becomes one of Janeway&#x27;s most valued officers.

As &quot;Voyager&quot; begins its journey home, Paris is involuntarily selected to be an auxiliary medic on &quot;Voyager&quot; as he had previously studied two semesters of biochemistry at Starfleet Academy. He is initially joined and eventually replaced by Kes after she expresses a desire to learn from the Doctor. Later, on an away mission, Paris visits the planet Banea with Harry Kim to find a replacement collimator. Once &quot;Voyager&quot; arrives to pick them up however, they learn that Paris is accused of murdering a well-known elderly engineering physicist after allegedly being caught flirting with the latter&#x27;s wife. As punishment, the Baneans imprint the scientist&#x27;s final moments leading up to his death in Paris&#x27; brain, which Paris has to relive repeatedly, slowly causing permanent brain damage. Tuvok conducts his own investigation to determine the true culprit, and discovers that Paris had been framed by the Baneans&#x27; enemies and is being used as a messenger, with the messages being imprinted in the recollection which Paris initially thought to be random letters and numbers. Upon discovery of Paris&#x27; innocence, the imprints are removed.

During &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s second year in the Delta Quadrant, Paris reconfigures a shuttlecraft with the help of Kim and chief engineer B&#x27;Elanna Torres and breaks the transwarp barrier, achieving warp 10 and becoming the first known person to do so. However, this later causes Paris to experience an accelerated state of evolution that would normally take humans millions of years. During this, Paris kidnaps Janeway in a shuttlecraft and brings her on a warp 10 flight. &quot;Voyager&quot; later finds the duo on an uninhabited planet and discovers that they had evolved into amphibian-like beings and had reproduced. The Doctor manages to reverse the evolution process using antiproton treatments. Later that year, Paris also participates in a plot organized by Janeway and Tuvok in order to flush out a possible traitor aboard &quot;Voyager&quot; that had been feeding information to Seska and the Kazon, one of &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s enemies. However, this negatively impacts Paris&#x27; relations with first officer Chakotay as no one else had known of the plan, all being deceived by Paris&#x27; apparent tardiness and attitude. The plot is successful at deceiving the rest of the crew to the point where Neelix, believing that Paris was going to leave &quot;Voyager&quot; for good, gives a tribute speech on his own onboard show. Paris later manages to sneak on board a Kazon ship and discover the spy. In the season 3 premiere, &quot;Basics&quot;, Paris takes back &quot;Voyager&quot; with the assistance of the Doctor, crewman Lon Suder as well as several Talaxian ships after &quot;Voyager&quot; was taken over by the Kazon.

During &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s third and fourth years into its journey, Paris is accused of bombing an alien world along with Kim and is sentenced to jail. Paris becomes gravely injured after being stabbed during a prison fight. Despite &quot;Voyager&quot; later discovering and bringing forward the true perpetrator, Paris and Kim are denied release due to the society&#x27;s laws. Both men are later saved by Janeway and the others after they break into the prison. Relationships-wise, Paris grows closer to B&#x27;Elanna Torres. In one instance, Torres experiences symptoms similar to the Vulcan &quot;pon farr&quot; and aggressively pursues Paris as a result. Knowing that Torres was in a delirious state, Paris does not engage with her, angering the latter as she knew of Paris&#x27; advances. The year after, Paris and Torres are on an away mission which had gone wrong. As the pair float aimlessly in space in their environmental suits, the duo confesses to each other their true feelings. Fortunately, they are saved by &quot;Voyager&quot; in time. As the rest of the crew are unaware of the duo&#x27;s relationship, they try their best to keep quiet about it. During that year, Paris also returns to being a field medic after Kes departs &quot;Voyager&quot; in &quot;The Gift&quot;, serving regular shifts in the sickbay.

The following year, Paris builds his own unique shuttlecraft which he named the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot;. The construction of the craft was authorized by Janeway as &quot;Voyager&quot; had to retrieve a multi-spatial probe that was lost in the atmosphere of a gas giant. Paris and the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; manage to safely retrieve the probe. Later that year, Paris is demoted to ensign by Janeway and placed in &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s brig for 30 days after disobeying direct orders to not interfere with another society, called the Moneans, who lived on a planet where the entirety of its surface area was covered in water. Paris, who had an affection for the sea, had become concerned with the planet&#x27;s gradual loss of water. Upon discovery by Paris that the Moneans&#x27; own oxygen-mining operations are to blame for the loss of water, he goes in the &quot;Delta Flyer&quot; with a Monean in order to target the oxygen refineries so that they could be temporarily taken out of operation and redesigned in a way that reduced the loss of water. The attack is foiled by &quot;Voyager&quot; at the last second, preventing a massive catastrophe. As Paris spends 30 days in the brig, he dictates his whole situation in his personal access display device in the form of a letter to his father to pass the time, later instructing the computer to transmit the letter to his father once &quot;Voyager&quot; is within range of Earth. 

During &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s last few years in the Delta Quadrant, Paris is repromoted to lieutenant junior grade in the season 6 finale &quot;Unimatrix Zero&quot; after a year of exemplary service. As Paris and Torres&#x27; relationship grew deeper, they marry during an interstellar race. Later that year, when it is revealed that Torres had become pregnant, Paris manages to convince Torres to let their baby inherit Torres&#x27; Klingon characteristics when she did not want them. As &quot;Voyager&quot; makes their return to the Alpha Quadrant and Earth in 2378, Torres gives birth to her and Paris&#x27; daughter, Miral Paris.

=== Later career ===
Paris briefly appears in &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; in the season 2 episode &quot;We&#x27;ll Always Have Tom Paris&quot;, set approximately three years after the end of &quot;Star Trek:&quot; &quot;Voyager&quot;. In &quot;Lower Decks&quot;, Paris, who by then had been fully promoted to lieutenant, had been moving through various Starfleet ships and posts, conducting handshake tours and speaking of his experiences in the Delta Quadrant. In one instance, Paris visits the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot;, the show&#x27;s focus ship, much to the excitement of one of the show&#x27;s main characters.

=== Non-canonical appearances ===
In the non-canonical &quot;Voyager&quot; relaunch novels, written by Christie Golden, Paris was promoted two steps in rank, like many of the &quot;Voyager&quot; crew, and is now a lieutenant commander. He is serving as the first officer of &quot;Voyager&quot;, under the command of now-Captain Chakotay.

In &quot;Star Trek: Voyager – Elite Force&quot;, published by Activision in 2000, Paris appears in the game as the ship&#x27;s helmsman.

In &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, a massive multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Cryptic Studios, Paris is active as a Starfleet captain in the early 25th century. Paris makes his first appearance in the game in 2015, with McNeill reprising Paris and voicing him.

==Personality==

=== Personal interests ===
Paris had a deep interest in 20th-century Earth pop culture, often utilizing such in his holo-programs. This knowledge helped the crew during time travel incidents. 

Paris had also shown an interest in cars; he was well-versed with 20th-century automobiles and even created his own holoprogram where he would tinker with cars from that era. This interest was also shown when &quot;Voyager&quot; encountered a Ford truck that originated from 1936 floating in space, as Paris was able to identify the car model and even the year it came from. He also programmed a holoprogram featuring a 1957 Chevy for the Doctor to use when the latter had an attraction to a Vidiian patient.

During Paris&#x27; childhood, he had an interest in the sea as well as naval ships; in one instance, Paris was scolded by his father for playing with ancient sailing ship models instead of doing his homework. This interest later pushed Paris to do everything in his power to save the Moneans&#x27; planet, which was entirely water-based, as it was losing water due to the society&#x27;s oxygen-mining operations.

While serving on &quot;Voyager&quot;, Paris also nurtured a long-hidden talent for holo-programming, devising several programs for the entertainment of his fellow crewmembers. His most popular programs included a re-creation of Sandrine&#x27;s bar, an Irish town called Fair Haven, and a 1930s-era sci-fi movie serial titled &quot;Captain Proton&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Paris was at times portrayed as feeling resentful toward his father, Owen Paris, due to the latter&#x27;s words and actions which made Paris feel misunderstood and isolated during his childhood years. Their relationship improved substantially over the course of the series, due to Captain Janeway&#x27;s willingness to offer him redemption, and later due to his relationship with B&#x27;Elanna Torres.

He became good friends with Harry Kim from the start and at times displayed protectiveness in the face of Harry&#x27;s customary naiveté. In &quot;Caretaker&quot;, he rescues the ensign from Quark, a manipulative Ferengi. Kim later befriends Paris. The bond between both men strengthened after Kim protected Paris while they were imprisoned in a jail complex despite the latter destroying one of Kim&#x27;s tools while in a delirious state.

Paris also viewed Captain Janeway in high regard. As she recruited Paris to join &quot;Voyager&quot; on its initial first mission, he was fatefully brought along to the Delta Quadrant. This made Paris felt like he had been given a second chance in life and was grateful to her for it. In one instance where all members of the crew were forced to abandon ship as &quot;Voyager&quot; prepared to self-destruct in order to destroy a missile from hitting an inhabited planet, Paris thanked Janeway for everything she has done before he left the ship in an escape pod while Janeway stayed behind to oversee the auto-destruction sequence.

One member of the crew with whom Paris initially had a somewhat difficult relationship was Chakotay because of their history in the Maquis. Paris also expressed dislike of Chakotay&#x27;s leadership as he felt that Chakotay was not flexible regarding Starfleet protocols, insisting that he overruled most of the other officers&#x27; suggestions and opinions. These tensions even escalated to the point where Paris had to be placed in the brig after pushing Chakotay to the floor. However, it was later revealed that these tensions were all a ruse in a plot to expose a traitor on &quot;Voyager&quot;, though unbeknownst to Chakotay. Fortunately, throughout &quot;Voyager&quot;″s seven-year journey home, Paris and Chakotay reconciled (in part due to Paris having earned Chakotay&#x27;s trust) and became good friends.

Initially, Paris and Neelix also often got into personal conflicts due to the former&#x27;s often fraternizations with Kes, who was Neelix&#x27;s girlfriend. Neelix felt jealous of Paris as the latter had given Kes a special locket for her birthday. They later resolved their differences after taking care of an alien baby together while on an away mission. When Paris appeared to be departing the ship in the episode &quot;Investigations&quot;, Neelix was shown to be greatly concerned for Paris. When he later found out that Paris was part of a plot to expose a spy aboard &quot;Voyager&quot;, he volunteered to take part in the plot to bring back Paris safely. When Torres&#x27; baby was announced during &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s last year in the quadrant, Paris had initially thought of Neelix to be the child&#x27;s godfather, though Neelix had to give the role to the Doctor as the former already had goddaughter Naomi Wildman.

== Reception ==

&quot;Wired&quot; ranked Paris as the 26th most important character of Starfleet in 2016, while &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked Paris as the 19th best Starfleet character in 2018.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked B&#x27;Elanna Torres and Paris as the 3rd best romantic couple of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2021, they also felt that Paris&#x27; story arc was an interesting one, as he starts off on probation from Starfleet prison, but then returns to good standing over the course of his adventures on the show.

<doc id="27100" wikidata="Q15857" url="?curid=27100" title="Q (Star Trek)">
<text>Q is a fictional character, as well as the name of a race, in &quot;Star Trek&quot;, appearing in the &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Lower Decks&quot;, and &quot;Picard&quot; series and in related media. The most familiar Q is portrayed by John de Lancie. He is an extra-dimensional being of unknown origin who possesses immeasurable power over time, space, the laws of physics, and reality itself, being capable of altering it to his whim. Despite his vast knowledge and experience spanning untold eons, he is not above practical jokes for his personal amusement, for a or manipulative purpose, or to prove a point. He is said to be almost completely omnipotent and he is continually evasive regarding his true motivations.

The name &quot;Q&quot; applies to the names of the individuals portrayed (all male and female characters refer to each other as &quot;Q&quot;); it also applies to the name of their race and to the &quot;Q Continuum&quot; itself – an alternate dimension accessible to only the Q and their &quot;invited&quot; guests. The true nature of the realm is said to be beyond the comprehension of &quot;lesser beings&quot; such as humans, therefore it is shown to humans only in ways they can understand; e.g., a run-down gas station in the &#x27;middle of nowhere&#x27;.

Beginning with the pilot episode &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, Q became a recurring character, with pronounced comedic and dramatic chemistry with Jean-Luc Picard. He serves as a major antagonist throughout &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, playing a pivotal role in both the first and final episodes. Q is initially presented as a cosmic force judging humanity to see if it is becoming a threat to the universe, but as the series progresses, his role morphs more into one of a teacher to Picard and the human race generally – albeit often in seemingly destructive or disruptive ways, subject to his own amusement. Other times, notably during &quot;Deja Q&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;, Q appears to the crew seeking assistance.

Gene Roddenberry chose the letter &quot;Q&quot; in honor of his friend Janet Quarton.

===Television===
Q debuted in &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, where he puts Captain Picard and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew on trial, arguing that humanity is a dangerous race and should be destroyed. When they later save the life of a kidnapped alien, Q agrees to defer judgment, though he hints that it will not be the last time the crew sees him.

In &quot;Hide and Q&quot;, he forces the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew to participate in a war game against monsters he summoned, then makes a wager with Picard. He grants Commander William Riker the powers of a Q, then promises that if Riker rejects the powers, then Q will leave them alone. Riker uses the powers to save his friends and starts to lose himself to them, but ultimately manages to reject them. Q attempts to go back on his word, but the Q Continuum forcibly recalls him.

In &quot;Q Who&quot;, he offers to divest himself of his powers and guide humanity through uncharted regions and prepare it for unknown threats. Picard argues that Q&#x27;s services are unneeded (and unwanted), and Q rebuts him by teleporting the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; to a distant system for their first encounter with the Borg. Unable to resist the Borg, Picard must ask Q to save the ship. Q returns the &quot;Enterprise&quot; home and tells Picard that other men would rather have died than ask for help. This episode also reveals Q has a past history and hostile relationship with Guinan.

In &quot;Deja Q&quot;, Q is punished by the Q Continuum by being made mortal; his committing of an uncharacteristically selfless act (sacrificing his life so that a race attacking him will not destroy the &quot;Enterprise&quot;) garners the return of his powers. In the same episode, Q says that Picard is &quot;the closest thing in this universe that I have to a friend.&quot;

The Q are mentioned in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Due&quot;. A woman named Ardra claims to be the Devil to subjugate a planet, displaying abilities similar to the Q. The crew speculate that she may be a member of the Q Continuum or even Q himself in a disguise before Picard points out Q would not be interested in a planet&#x27;s economics. Ardra is exposed as a con artist using technology to simulate her powers.

In &quot;Qpid&quot;, Q attempts to repay Picard for saving him in &quot;Deja Q&quot; by helping him with his relationship with his ex-girlfriend Vash. He transports everyone to Sherwood Forest and casts himself as the Sheriff of Nottingham, Picard as Robin Hood, the crew as the Merry Men, and Vash as Maid Marian, then challenges them to rescue her. Q and Vash find themselves kindred spirits, and she ultimately decides to go with him and explore the universe together.

In &quot;True Q&quot;, Q reveals that a new crew member named Amanda Rogers is actually the daughter of two rogue members of the Q Continuum, then orders her to choose between remaining human and never using her powers, or coming with him to join the Continuum. After using her powers to save a planet, Amanda decides to join the Continuum.

Toward the end of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, Q is less antagonistic toward Picard. In &quot;Tapestry&quot;, Q apparently saves Picard and helps him better understand himself, giving Picard a chance to avoid the accident that gave him an artificial heart only for Picard to choose dying as himself over living the tedious life he would have lived without the inspiration of his near-death experience (although whether Q actually appeared in this episode or was merely a hallucination Picard experienced during surgery is deliberately left ambiguous).

In &quot;All Good Things&quot;, Q reveals that the trial of humanity is not over and displaces Picard through different time periods where a temporal anomaly threatens the existence of humanity. After Picard resolves the situation, Q admits to having helped him find the solution and to having saved him from death. Q departs, stating that the trial of humanity is never over.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Q-Less&quot;, Vash decided to end her partnership with Q. Q follows her to the Deep Space Nine station and attempts to win her back. Q is blamed for a series of power failures, but denies it. Q taunts Commander Benjamin Sisko, only to get punched in the face, shocking him since &#x27;Picard never did that&#x27;. The power failures were actually caused by an alien life form disguised as a crystal that Vash was carrying. Q gives Vash his blessing to leave him.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; episode &quot;Death Wish&quot;, Q pursues a rogue member of the Continuum, later named Quinn, who has been inadvertently released from his asteroid prison by the crew of that ship, and who seeks asylum on &quot;Voyager&quot;. He demands that Q make him human, as he does not wish to be a member of the Continuum any more, but Q refuses, because Quinn intends to commit suicide if he becomes human. The two parties agree to allow Captain Janeway to mediate their dispute, and after Janeway eventually finds in favor of Quinn, he is made human and then commits suicide. It is subsequently revealed that Q chose to assist Quinn&#x27;s suicide.

Later, in the &quot;Voyager&quot; episode &quot;The Q and the Grey&quot;, Q reappears on the &quot;Voyager&quot;, asking Janeway to bear his child. He eventually reveals that the uncertainty and instability caused by Quinn&#x27;s suicide divided the Continuum, causing a civil war between Quinn&#x27;s followers (of which Q is a part) and the rest of the Continuum. Q believes that the birth of a new member of the Continuum could revitalize the Q by giving them something new to focus on after millennia of stagnation and boredom. Janeway refuses, and after she and her crew bring about a ceasefire in the Continuum, Q eventually mates with a female Q (Suzie Plakson) with whom he had been involved (referred to in &quot;Star Trek&quot; novels as &#x27;Lady Q&#x27;), producing a son. Their progeny is born conscious and with all the power of any other Q, although lacking adult maturity. Q makes Janeway his godmother.

In the episode &quot;Q2&quot;, he appears on &quot;Voyager&quot; with his immature, rebellious son, who appears as a human teenager (played by John de Lancie&#x27;s real-life son Keegan de Lancie, and referred to in the novels as &quot;Little Q&quot; or &quot;q&quot;). Q asks Janeway to mentor his son, and the two adults agree that the boy will remain on &quot;Voyager&quot;, without his powers, and either learn how to be a responsible, accountable, and productive inhabitant of the cosmos, or spend eternity as an amoeba. Eventually, the young Q comes around, but the Continuum is not entirely convinced, so in negotiation with Q, they come to an agreement. Q must eternally guard, observe, and accompany the boy to ensure his proper behavior. Q thanks Janeway for her help by showing her a shortcut to Earth that will shave three years off &quot;Voyager&quot;&#x27;s journey. When she asks why he does not just send them directly to Earth, he says it would set a bad example for his son to do all the work for them.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; episode &quot;Veritas&quot;, Q appears in a flashback, challenging the senior crew of the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot; to an inexplicable &#x27;game&#x27; to prove humanity&#x27;s worth, dressing them up as chess pieces facing a football field filled with anthropomorphic cards and soccer balls. Later in the episode, he appears again to challenge the ensigns to a duel, but he is unceremoniously blown off by Ensign Mariner, who tells him to &quot;go bother Picard.&quot; Q follows them anyway, complaining that Picard is always quoting Shakespeare and making wine.

Q returns in season 2 of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. In the episode &quot;The Star Gazer&quot;, the &quot;Stargazer&quot; encounters a Borg vessel containing the Borg Queen. When it appears that she is assimilating the Stargazer and controlling the fleet, Picard activates the ship&#x27;s self-destruct mechanism to stop her. Just as the ship explodes, Picard abruptly wakes up in a different version of his home. Q appears, initially looking like his younger self before turning himself into an old man to match Picard&#x27;s age. Q says the trial of humanity is not over, so he&#x27;s altered history to show Picard &quot;the end of the road not taken.&quot;

In the next episode, &quot;Penance&quot;, Q acts unusually agitated while claiming this dark, totalitarian future is all Picard&#x27;s fault, even striking Picard when he complains. This prompts Picard to wonder if Q is unwell. Q admits to saving Picard and his crew from the explosion of the &quot;Stargazer&quot; and making sure they all remembered the original timeline to give them a chance to change it back. After Q departs, Picard meets his crew and they work with a captured Borg Queen, who can detect temporal anomalies and says this future was caused by a change in Los Angeles in the year 2024.

In the next episode, &quot;Assimilation&quot;, Q briefly appears to taunt Picard about how everything was lost because of his fears before disappearing.

In the next episode, &quot;Watcher&quot;, Q appears in Los Angeles in 2024 (before First Contact), observing a woman working on a planned spaceflight to Europa. He is then surprised to find his powers do not work.

In the next episode, &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, the woman is revealed to be Jean-Luc Picard&#x27;s ancestor, Renee Picard. Undaunted by the loss of his powers, Q poses as Renee&#x27;s psychiatrist and tries to convince her to cancel her spaceflight to Europa. When Picard and his crew find out about this, they speculate that this is the change that causes the dark future. Q also meets Dr. Adam Soong and provides him a temporary cure for his daughter Kore&#x27;s life-threatening illness. Desperate for a permanent cure, Soong agrees to assist Q.

In the next episode, &quot;Two of One&quot;, Q instructs Soong to stop Renee from going on her spaceflight, which he attempts by trying to hit her with his car. However, Picard pushes her out of the way and is hit instead and hospitalized by his injuries.

Q is mentioned in the next episode, &quot;Monsters&quot;. After recovering, Picard asks Guinan to summon Q to their location so he can question him, remembering Q&#x27;s unusual behavior in their previous encounter. Guinan reveals that the Q Continuum and her race, the El-Aurians, went to war in the past before making a peace treaty. However, her ritual to summon Q fails.

In the next episode, &quot;Mercy&quot;, after Picard and Guinan have been arrested by an FBI agent, Q visits Guinan disguised as an agent, revealing that he is dying and that this whole scenario was just an attempt to give his life meaning. He leaves after saying humans are always stuck in the past, giving Picard inspiration to pry into the agent&#x27;s past to persuade him to let them go. Q later visits Kore and gives her the permanent cure even though Soong did not fulfill his end of the bargain, allowing her to leave her home and escape her controlling father. The Borg Queen reveals the change that caused the dark future: In the original timeline, Renee found an alien life form on Europa, paving the way for the formation of the Federation. If Renee&#x27;s flight is prevented, Dr. Adam Soong will eventually rise in power and become ruler of the world.

In &quot;Farewell,&quot; after the original timeline is restored, Picard leaves the skeleton key behind a loose brick in the wall for his younger self to find, then encounters Q in his home. Q notes that Picard had the chance to potentially save his mother and change his own future, but instead he chose to accept himself as he is and absolve himself of his guilt. Because Picard has chosen himself, perhaps now he will finally believe himself worthy of being chosen by someone else, and may even give himself the chance to be loved. Q repeats his earlier statement that this was about forgiveness: Picard&#x27;s own forgiveness of himself. Q reminds Picard that all of the deaths caused by Q&#x27;s alteration of the timeline have been fixed, apart from Tallinn and Elnor. However, Tallinn was always destined to die in every timeline, but thanks to Picard&#x27;s intervention, Tallinn had been able to meet Renée in this one. Picard asks why Q had taken such an interest in him for over thirty years, and Q explains that he is dying alone and doesn&#x27;t want that for Picard. As such, he had set it up so Picard could travel back in time and become unshackled from his past (&quot;As I leave, I leave you free.&quot;) For once, Q had not been acting for some grander design, but simply because he cared about Picard and genuinely wanted to help his friend.

Gathering outside, Q prepares to use the last of his power to send Picard and his friends back to their own timeline, an action that will kill Q in his weakened state. When Rios chooses to stay in 2024, Q tells Picard that he now has an unexpected surplus of energy, which he will use to give Picard a final surprise gift. Stating that Q doesn&#x27;t have to die alone, Picard hugs him, and an emotional Q promises to &quot;See you out there.&quot; He then snaps his fingers one last time, sending Picard, Raffi and Seven back to 2401 moments before the &quot;Stargazer&#x27;s&quot; destruction, allowing Picard the chance to change his future. Shortly thereafter, the group discovers Q&#x27;s final gift: Q has resurrected Elnor and returned him to the &quot;Excelsior&quot;.

Despite his supposed death, Q appears to Picard&#x27;s son Jack Crusher in a mid-credits scene of the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; series finale &quot;The Last Generation&quot;. When asked about his supposed death, Q simply states that he&#x27;d hoped that the next generation wouldn&#x27;t think so linearly and that while humanity&#x27;s trial has ended for Picard, it has only just begun for Jack.

The Q were also mentioned in the fourth season of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; as the possible creators of the Dark Matter Anomaly threatening the Alpha Quadrant, but were dismissed as being such by the Federation due to neither Q or his fellow Q being heard from since the late 26th century.

===Novels===
The similarity between Q and Trelane, the alien encountered in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;The Squire of Gothos&quot;, inspired writer Peter David to establish in his 1994 novel &quot;Q-Squared&quot; that Trelane is a member of the Continuum, and that Q is his godfather (with it being all-but-explicitly stated that Q is actually Trelane&#x27;s biological father, although the truth of this is kept an official secret).

Q&#x27;s past is expanded on in the trilogy &quot;The Q Continuum&quot;, which has Q and Picard travel through Q&#x27;s past, witnessing Q&#x27;s first encounter with the being that inspired his interest in testing other races. This being, known as 0, is similar to Q in power and abilities (although an injury of some sort prevents 0 travelling faster than light under his own power, even if he can still teleport short distances), but whereas Q has been shown to be more of a &quot;merry prankster&quot; throughout &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon, 0 is malevolent in his desires. Where Q always offers his opponents a sporting chance to win his challenges, 0 is ultimately shown to use his &#x27;tests&#x27; as just an excuse to torture other races, to the extent that he basically changes the rules of his games so that the subjects will inevitably lose. The young Q ends up bringing him into the Milky Way galaxy through the Guardian of Forever while looking for something new to do with himself, and 0 assembles other seemingly omnipotent beings from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;, including Gorgan (the entity who turned children against their parents in &quot;And the Children Shall Lead&quot;), The One (the being who impersonated God in &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot;) and (*) (the entity from &quot;Day of the Dove&quot;, which thrived on violent conflict). However, although intrigued at 0&#x27;s words about testing lesser races, Q loses his taste for 0&#x27;s methods when 0&#x27;s group provoke the Tkon Empire- an advanced civilisation millennia in the past- into decades of civil war and then blows up their sun just as they were about to exchange their dying old sun for a younger, fresher one, the Tkon having completed their Great Endeavour despite the war. 0&#x27;s group was later defeated in a battle with the Q Continuum, though the dinosaurs were left extinct as a result when Q diverted an asteroid from one of the combatants so that it would strike Earth instead. With Q having abstained from most of the conflict, he was thus put in charge of watching over Earth and its inhabitants as a possible rehabilitation project, while (*) and Gorgan escaped and The One was trapped at the heart of the galaxy having been reduced to just his head. 0 in particular was banished to just outside our galaxy and the galactic barrier erected to keep him out; as Picard observes, with 0&#x27;s crippled state preventing him travelling faster than light, 0 was essentially reduced to a shipwrecked survivor cut off from the nearest inhabitable land and millennia away from anywhere else. In the course of the trilogy, 0 is temporarily released from his banishment beyond the galaxy and sought revenge on Q, having manipulated a dying scientist to complete an artificial wormhole experiment intended to let starships breach the barrier that would allow 0 to regain access. However, 0 was defeated when Picard was able to convince one of 0&#x27;s old enemies to join forces with Q so that their combined powers could stop his former mentor.

The novel &quot;The Buried Age&quot; which explores Picard&#x27;s life between the destruction of the &quot;Stargazer&quot; and his appointment to the position of captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D ends with a cameo appearance by Q as he meets an alien woman who recently met Picard before she chose to ascend to a higher plane of existence, her tales of Picard inspiring Q&#x27;s own interest in humanity. This novel also establishes why Q chose his name, as he wanted something that would be simple for humans to remember, reasoning that, if he was ever asked why he was called &#x27;Q&#x27;, he could reply &quot;Because U will always be behind me&quot;.

In the &quot;Voyager&quot; novel &quot;The Eternal Tide&quot;, Q&#x27;s son sacrifices himself to save the universe, inspired by the example of the resurrected Kathryn Janeway, prompting Q to declare himself her enemy. However, he swiftly gets over this hostility &#x27;off-screen&#x27;, and by the later novel &quot;A Pocket Full of Lies&quot;, it is revealed that he acted to save the life of an alternate Janeway created during the events of &quot;Shattered&quot;.

In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; comic series based on the alternate timeline established in the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot;, Q visits that reality to take the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; into their future. This allows them to interact with characters from the original timeline in the new history created by Spock&#x27;s trip to the past. It also helps Q deal with a threat to the Continuum in the form of the Pah-Wraiths, which have all but destroyed the Bajoran Prophets in this timeline, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew retrieving a tablet containing the last Prophet and allowing it to merge with Q to defeat the Pah-Wraiths.

===Computer games===
The 1996 computer game &quot;Star Trek: Borg&quot; was primarily made up of live action segments directed by James L. Conway and featured John de Lancie as Q.

Another Q also appears during holiday events in the massively multiplayer online game &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; including the creation of a Christmas village that player characters can be teleported to. This entity is believed to be The Junior Q as he had mentioned the name &quot;Aunt Kathy&quot;.

=== Q&#x27;s phone number ===
In &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, S02E05 &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot;, Q sends Dr. Adam Soong his business card via his 3D printer. The number on it was (323) 634-5667. This is a functional phone number intended for the viewers to call. Typically, American movies or TV episodes use &quot;dud&quot; phone numbers that go nowhere, but this is a small treat for diligent viewers; a small, out-of-universe Easter egg with a short message from John de Lancie&#x27;s portrayal of Q. Since initial launch this phone number is still active.

==Reception==
In 2009, Q was ranked as the 9th best character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; by IGN.

In 2016, &quot;Time&quot; rated Q as the #10 best villain of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2017, Space.com rated Q as one of the &quot;15 of the Most Bizarre Alien Species&quot; of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; said that Q would be at the top of the list if he was included with ranking 39 main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

In 2018, CBR ranked Q the #1 best &quot;Star Trek&quot; recurring character.

<text>Beverly Crusher is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, played by Gates McFadden. Debuting in the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, McFadden appeared in every season, except for the second, as well as its spin-off feature films: &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;. McFadden returned to the role in the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. She also had cameo appearances in &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot;, both as a holographic recreation and the real Crusher.

Crusher was the chief medical officer of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D and &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E, two starships in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

==Casting==
Gates McFadden was reluctant to accept the role of Dr. Crusher because of her commitment to appear in the play &quot;The Matchmaker&quot; at the La Jolla Playhouse. During the second season, the character was written out of the series, with the explanation that she &quot;was off heading up Starfleet Medical for the year.&quot; Producer Rick Berman has said that McFadden left due to her disputes with the head &quot;TNG&quot; writer at the time, Maurice Hurley. She was replaced by the louder, more opinionated Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur). Patrick Stewart was upset by McFadden&#x27;s departure and played a large part in bringing about her return after Hurley left at the end of the second season.

==Early life==
Beverly Crusher was born Beverly Howard on October 13, 2324, in Copernicus City, Luna. Her ancestors were Scottish-Americans. Following the death of her parents when she was very young, she lived with her grandmother, Felisa Howard, on Arvada III, a colony planet, until a moon collision caused the planet to flood, forcing its evacuation. Resourceful Felisa, with her granddaughter&#x27;s aid, used herbs, grasses, tree chemicals, and roots as medicines when synthetic medicines ran out for the injured.

During her youth, Beverly was known as quiet, shy, and socially awkward. She was also very self-conscious about her bright red hair, and at the age of 13, attempted to dye it dark with disastrous results. She admits to Data later, in the episode &quot;Offspring&quot;, that she was often ridiculed, unpopular in school, and it had been very painful for her. She also admits that it brought back painful memories of those years when she saw her son Wesley going through similar ridicule as a child.

It was her grandmother&#x27;s career as a healer and Beverly&#x27;s own caring, high intelligence, and sensitivity that largely sparked Beverly&#x27;s lifelong interest in medicine and healing the sick and wounded. The Arvada III disaster solidified Beverly&#x27;s decision to be a doctor.

After Arvada III was evacuated, Beverly and Felisa then settled on Caldos IV where Beverly lived until she entered Starfleet Academy.

==Starfleet Academy==
Crusher attended Starfleet Academy from 2342 to 2350 during which she attended medical school. While attending the academy, she became romantically involved with fellow cadet Jack Crusher. They were introduced by their friend, Walker Keel. She graduated top of her class and married Jack in 2348. She had also been called &quot;the Dancing Doctor&quot; when she was at the academy because she had won multiple awards at a dance competition in St. Louis, Missouri. In 2350, she started an internship with Dr. Dalen Quaice.

==Family==
After marrying Jack, Beverly returned to the academy while he left for the USS &quot;Stargazer&quot;. A year later, she gave birth to a son named Wesley Crusher. Jack died on an away mission when Wesley was five years old. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, who was commanding the &quot;Stargazer&quot; at the time, took home the body of Jack. She never fully recovered from his death. Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard were also acquaintances while the character&#x27;s husband was alive, as Picard and Jack Crusher were very good friends. At the beginning of the series, Picard and Dr. Crusher have not seen or heard from each other since Jack&#x27;s death. &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; is the first time Picard and Dr. Crusher&#x27;s son Wesley truly meet face to face. Later in her life she realizes Picard has fallen in love with her.

As time goes by, both Crusher and Picard try to conceal their feelings from each other. Their relationship advances in &quot;Attached&quot;, when the two are linked telepathically and their romantic feelings are revealed. At the end of this episode, Beverly tells Jean-Luc, &quot;Perhaps we should be afraid&quot;, implying that she&#x27;s not ready to take that step forward in their relationship.

However, only a handful of episodes later in &quot;Sub Rosa&quot;, it is revealed that neither Beverly nor Jean-Luc has been able to let go of those feelings and they are back to where they started, trying to pretend the feelings don&#x27;t exist and that they have no problem being &quot;just friends&quot; with one another.

In the series finale &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, it is revealed that in an alternate future, Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard had been married and then divorced—still evidently having feelings for each other after so many years. Little information is given about the circumstances of their marriage or separation. In the present the two share a kiss; however, that particular timeline is erased when Picard changes the past.

In the four &quot;Next Generation&quot; movies, the flirtation between Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard remains, though it is not as obvious as previous episodes and most certainly not part of the substantial movie plots. The most noteworthy moment between the two happens in one of the deleted scenes of the last &quot;Next Generation&quot; movie, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;.

Following the television series and films, the relationship between Dr. Crusher and Captain Picard continued throughout the non-canonical &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; Pocket Books series. Beverly and Jean-Luc have married, but still serve together on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E. They have a son named René Jacques Robert Francois Picard, named after Picard&#x27;s older brother (Robert) and nephew (René).

However, in the canonical sequel series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, Beverly and Jean-Luc have not married. They have conceived a son, Jack II, but mounting assassination attempts on Picard have led Beverly to hide Jack away from him and raise Jack by herself. By 2401, Beverly is piloting her own charity hospital ship, the SS &quot;Eleos&quot;, and is assisting her son in his criminal exploits. She sends a message to Jean-Luc requesting help and gets severely injured when encountering an aggressive band of raiders. Picard commandeers a Starfleet ship, the USS &quot;Titan&quot;, and rescues her and Jack, right before the raiders&#x27; leader Vadic destroys the &quot;Eleos&quot;. After she is treated, Beverly helps the &quot;Titan&quot; medical staff throughout the third season, and her analysis of autopsies and interrogation of Vadic with Picard, prove crucial in helping uncover a conspiracy of rogue Changelings infiltrating Starfleet out of revenge for Starfleet&#x27;s medical experimentation and actions during the Dominion War. She is reunited with the rest of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew as they race to prevent the conspirators and their collaborators the Borg from further attacking Starfleet. When they are too late, Picard decides to infiltrate the Borg&#x27;s last cube and rescue a newly assimilated Jack. Beverly fires the torpedoes that destroy the cube while the rest of the crew beams Picard and Jack out. By 2402, after developing new transporter modifications and gene therapies to prevent the conspirators and their partners the Borg from returning, her commission is reinstated. Beverly is promoted to the rank of Admiral, and Beverly and Picard see their son off as he joins Starfleet aboard the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-G. Beverly and Jean-Luc are last seen playing poker with the rest of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D crew in the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles, finally content with their lives.

In &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; season 2, Kathryn Janeway contacts Beverly in 2384 after meeting Wesley. Beverly isn&#x27;t able to offer much insight into her son&#x27;s current activities as Wesley hasn&#x27;t visited her in years. Beverly laments that &quot;for a time traveler, I wish he had more time to spend with his mother.&quot; Wesley later finally visits his mother, and she introduces Wesley to his little brother for the first time, Jack having only been a small child at the time.

==Reception==
The character has generally been positively received. Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; praised Gates McFadden&#x27;s performance, as well as the inclusion of a strong, likable female character in the series, but lamented that the character&#x27;s potential was never fully realized, saying she &quot;should&#x27;ve been one of &quot;TNG&quot;&#x27;s best characters&quot; but that &quot;too often, her character has been relegated to back-up roles, interjecting occasional medical jargon to give color to scenes, or else worrying to one side about whether or not Wesley was getting enough fun in his life.&quot;

McFadden left the series at the end of the first season and was replaced by Diana Muldaur as Doctor Katherine Pulaski at the beginning of the second. An official announcement stated McFadden had left the series to pursue other career options. McFadden herself got a call from her agent who told her the producers had decided to go in another direction with the character. Like the other cast members, McFadden was surprised. Thanks to a letter-writing campaign, support from Patrick Stewart, and a personal invitation from executive producer Rick Berman, McFadden was brought back to the TNG cast for the third and subsequent seasons, with her only three appearances for season two being stock footage.

In an interview in May 2006, Berman revealed the actress was fired at end of the first season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; because head writer Maurice Hurley &quot;had a real bone to pick&quot; and did not like her acting. After Hurley departed the show&#x27;s writing staff, Berman brought the actress and character back.

In 2016, SyFy ranked Beverly Crusher as the fourth best of the six main-cast space doctors of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2016, Beverly Crusher was ranked as the 20th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

In 2017, IndieWire ranked Beverly fifth in a list of important characters on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, noting she was &quot;pretty much flawless&quot; and offered &quot;valuable perspectives&quot;.

In 2017, IndieWire ranked Crusher as the sixth best character on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

In 2018, CBR ranked Beverly Crusher the 21st best member of Starfleet.

In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; placed Crusher as 14th out of 39 in a ranking of the franchise&#x27;s best main characters prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

In 2019, ScreenRant suggested the character was ripe for a spin-off series, highlighting her relations with Picard and also the high potential of the character.

In 2019, SyFy Wire recommended &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; include Beverly Crusher, pointing out her long-time friendship with the titular character. They were critical of the lack of screen time the pair had, lamenting &quot;It was not explored, it was ignored... and Beverly Crusher had almost nothing to do in the &quot;TNG&quot; films.&quot;

<doc id="27105" wikidata="Q16351" url="?curid=27105" title="Leonard McCoy">
<text>Dr. Leonard H. McCoy, known as &quot;Bones&quot;, is a character in the American science-fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. McCoy was played by actor DeForest Kelley in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series from 1966 to 1969, and he also appears in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, in six &quot;Star Trek&quot; films, in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, and in numerous books, comics, and video games. A decade after Kelley&#x27;s death, Karl Urban assumed the role of McCoy in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; reboot film in 2009.

==Depiction==
McCoy was born in Atlanta, Georgia, in 2227. The son of David McCoy, he attended the University of Mississippi and is a divorcé. McCoy later married Natira, the priestess of Yonada, as recounted in the episode &quot;For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky&quot;. In 2266, McCoy was posted as chief medical officer of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; under Captain James T. Kirk, who often calls him &quot;Bones&quot;. McCoy and Kirk are good friends, even &quot;brotherly&quot;. The passionate, sometimes cantankerous McCoy frequently argues with Kirk&#x27;s other confidant, science officer Spock, and occasionally is annoyed by Spock&#x27;s Vulcan heritage. McCoy often plays the role of Kirk&#x27;s conscience, offering a counterpoint to Spock&#x27;s logic. McCoy is suspicious of technology, especially the transporter. As a physician, he prefers less intrusive treatment and believes in the body&#x27;s innate recuperative powers. The nickname &quot;Bones&quot; – chosen before the character was named – is a play on &quot;&quot;, a 19th century epithet for a surgeon. In the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film reboot, when McCoy first meets Kirk, he complains that his ex-wife took all their shared assets following their divorce: &quot;All I got left is my bones&quot;, implying this was the origin of the nickname.

When Kirk orders McCoy&#x27;s commission reactivated in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979); a resentful McCoy complains of being &quot;drafted&quot;. Spock transfers his &quot;katra&quot;—his knowledge and experience—into McCoy before dying in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982). This causes mental anguish for McCoy, who in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984) helps restore Spock&#x27;s &quot;katra&quot; to his reanimated body. McCoy continues to serve on Kirk&#x27;s crew aboard the captured Klingon ship in &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986). In &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989), McCoy (through the intervention of Spock&#x27;s half-brother Sybok) reveals that he helped his father commit suicide to relieve him of his pain. Shortly after the suicide, a cure was found for his father&#x27;s disease, and McCoy had carried the guilt about it with him until Sybok&#x27;s intervention.

In &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991), McCoy and Kirk escape from a Klingon prison world, and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew stops a plot to prevent peace between the United Federation of Planets and the Klingon Empire. Kelley reprised the role for the &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot; pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987), insisting upon no more than the minimum Screen Actors Guild payment for his appearance. McCoy had attained the rank of admiral in the &quot;Trek&quot; timeline when this episode was aired, and he is stated to be 137 years of age. He went on to become chief of Starfleet Medical, with a special rank known as branch admiral. The fictional book &quot;Comparative Alien Physiology&quot; was written by McCoy, and was required reading at the Starfleet Medical Academy through the 2370s.

In the 1973 &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Survivor&quot;, McCoy mentions he has a daughter, Joanna. Although Chekov&#x27;s friend Irina in the original series episode &quot;The Way to Eden&quot; was originally written as McCoy&#x27;s daughter, it was changed before the episode was shot.

===Reboot film series===

In the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, which takes place in an alternate, parallel reality, McCoy and Kirk become friends at Starfleet Academy, which McCoy joins after a divorce that he says, &quot;left [him] nothing but [his] bones.&quot; This line, improvised by Urban, explains how McCoy earned the nickname &quot;Bones&quot;. McCoy later helps get Kirk posted aboard the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. He later becomes the chief medical officer after Doctor Puri is killed during an attack by Nero. McCoy remains aboard to see the &quot;Enterprise&quot; defeat Nero and his crew, with Kirk becoming the commanding officer of the ship.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; called Urban&#x27;s portrayal of McCoy in the 2009 film an &quot;unqualified success&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the character &quot;wild-eyed and funny&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot; said Urban came closer than the other actors to impersonating a character&#x27;s original depiction.

==Development==
Kelley had worked with &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry on previous television pilots, and he was Roddenberry&#x27;s first choice to play the doctor aboard the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. However, for the rejected pilot &quot;The Cage&quot; (1964), Roddenberry went with director Robert Butler&#x27;s choice of John Hoyt to play Dr. Philip Boyce. For the second pilot, &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; (1966), Roddenberry accepted director James Goldstone&#x27;s decision to have Paul Fix play Dr. Mark Piper. Although Roddenberry wanted Kelley to play the character of ship&#x27;s doctor, he did not put Kelley&#x27;s name forward to NBC; the network never &quot;rejected&quot; the actor, as Roddenberry sometimes suggested.

Kelley&#x27;s first broadcast appearance as Doctor Leonard McCoy was in &quot;The Man Trap&quot; (1966). Despite his character&#x27;s prominence, Kelley&#x27;s contract granted him only a &quot;featuring&quot; credit; he was not given &quot;starring&quot; credit until the second season, at the urging of producer Robert Justman. Kelley was apprehensive about &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s future, telling Roddenberry that the show was &quot;going to be the biggest hit or the biggest miss God ever made&quot;. Kelley portrayed McCoy throughout the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, and voiced the character in the animated &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

Kelley, who in his youth wanted to become a doctor like his uncle, but whose family could not pay for a medical education, in part drew upon his real-life experiences in creating McCoy, a doctor&#x27;s &quot;matter-of-fact&quot; delivery of news of Kelley&#x27;s mother&#x27;s terminal cancer was the &quot;abrasive sand&quot; Kelley used in creating McCoy&#x27;s demeanor. &quot;Star Trek&quot; writer D. C. Fontana said that while Roddenberry created the series, Kelley essentially created McCoy; everything done with the character was done with Kelley&#x27;s input.

&quot;Exquisite chemistry&quot; among Kelley, William Shatner, and Leonard Nimoy manifested itself in their performances as McCoy, Captain James T. Kirk, and Science Officer Spock, respectively. Nichelle Nichols, who played Uhura, referred to Kelley as her &quot;sassy gentleman friend&quot;; the friendship between the African-American Nichols and Southern Kelley was a real-life demonstration of the message Roddenberry hoped to convey through &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

For the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman saw McCoy as an &quot;arbiter&quot; in Kirk and Spock&#x27;s relationship. While Spock represented &quot;extreme logic, extreme science&quot; and Kirk symbolized &quot;extreme emotion and intuition&quot;, McCoy&#x27;s role as &quot;a very colorful doctor, essentially a very humanistic scientist&quot;, represented the &quot;two extremes that often served as the glue that held the trio together&quot;. They chose to reveal that McCoy befriended Kirk first, explaining the &quot;bias&quot; in their friendship and why he would often be a &quot;little dismissive&quot; of Spock. Urban said the script was &quot;very faithful&quot; to the original character, including the &quot;great compassion for humanity and that sense of irascibility&quot; with which Kelley imbued the character. New Zealand-born Urban trained with a dialect coach to create McCoy&#x27;s accent and reprised the role in its sequels &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;.

==Cultural impact==
McCoy is someone to whom Kirk unburdens himself, but is a foil to Spock. He is Kirk&#x27;s &quot;friend, personal bartender, confidant, counselor, and priest&quot;. Spock and McCoy&#x27;s bickering became so popular that Roddenberry wrote in a 1968 memo &quot;we simply didn&#x27;t realize ... how much the fans loved the bickering between our Arrowsmith and our Alien&quot;. Urban said McCoy has a &quot;sense of irascibility with real passion for life and doing the right thing&quot;, and that &quot;Spock&#x27;s logic and McCoy&#x27;s moral standing gave Kirk the benefit of having three brains instead of just one.&quot;

Kelley said that his greatest thrill at &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions was the number of people who told him they entered the medical profession because of the McCoy character. He received two or three letters a month from others reporting similar experiences. A friend observed that despite not becoming a doctor as he had hoped, Kelley&#x27;s portrayal of McCoy had helped create many doctors. According to Kelley, &quot;You can win awards and that sort of thing, but to influence the youth of the country ... is an award that is not handed out by the industry&quot;.

===&quot;He&#x27;s dead, Jim.&quot;===
Twenty times on the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, McCoy declares someone or something deceased with the line, &quot;He&#x27;s dead&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s dead, Jim&quot;, or something similar. The phrase so became a catchphrase of the character that Kelley joked that the line would appear on his tombstone—and it appeared in the first sentence of at least one obituary—but disliked repeating the line. During filming of &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;, when Spock is dying from radiation exposure, Kelley felt it would spoil the gravitas of the moment, so he and James Doohan agreed to swap their lines: McCoy warns Kirk not to open the chamber, and Scotty says, &quot;He&#x27;s dead already&quot;.

University of Southern California literature professor Henry Jenkins cites Dr. McCoy&#x27;s &quot;He&#x27;s dead, Jim&quot; line as an example of fans actively participating in the creation of an underground culture in which they derive pleasure by repeating memorable lines as part of constructing new mythologies and alternative social communities.

===&quot;I&#x27;m a doctor, not a...&quot;===
Another of McCoy&#x27;s catchphrases is his &quot;I&#x27;m a doctor, (Jim) not a(n)...&quot; statements, delivered by Kelley 11 times, and three times by Karl Urban in later films. McCoy repeats the line when he must perform some task beyond his medical skills, such as when he is asked to treat the unfamiliar silicon-based Horta alien in &quot;The Devil in the Dark&quot; (1967), saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a doctor, not a bricklayer.&quot; Variations of the line have also been used by doctors in other &quot;Trek&quot; series, including Julian Bashir, Phlox, and the Emergency Medical Hologram stationed aboard &quot;Voyager&quot;.

Kelley parodied the phrase in a 1992 commercial for Trivial Pursuit&#x27;s 10th Anniversary Edition, in which the question is asked, &quot;How many chambers are there in a human heart?&quot; replying &quot;How should I know? I&#x27;m an actor, not a doctor!&quot;.

It is often believed that Kelley said &quot;Damn it, Jim!&quot; before the &quot;I&#x27;m a doctor&quot; line, but in reality &quot;damn&quot; was never said on the original show (although damning was used) because the word was considered taboo on TV in the 1960s.

===In popular culture===
An audio clip of McCoy saying &quot;It&#x27;s worked so far, but we&#x27;re not out yet.&quot; (taken from the episode &quot;I, Mudd&quot;) was sampled by Minnesota-based New Wave band Information Society on their 1988 hit single &quot;What&#x27;s On Your Mind (Pure Energy)&quot;.

==Reception==
In a rebuttal to a tongue-in-cheek analysis in the &quot;Canadian Medical Association Journal&quot;, which claimed that Dr. Nick from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; was a better role model than his competitor Dr. Hibbert, both of which were published in the same journal in 1998, both doctors are cast aside for Dr. McCoy, &quot;TV&#x27;s only true physician&quot; and &quot;someone who has broken free from the yoke of ethics and practises the art and science of medicine beyond the stultifying opposition of paternalism and autonomy. A free and independent thinker and, indeed, someone even beyond role models&quot;.

In 2012, IGN ranked the character Doctor McCoy, as depicted in the original series, its films, and the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek,&quot; as the fifth-top character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, behind Data, Picard, Spock, and Kirk.

In 2016, Doctor McCoy was ranked as the fifth-most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science-fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot;.

In 2016, SyFy ranked McCoy third of the six main-cast space doctors of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2017, Screen Rant ranked the reboot film (Kelvin timeline) McCoy, played by Urban, as the 17th-most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; placed Doctor McCoy as sixth out of 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. In 2018, CBR ranked McCoy as the 11th-best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek.&quot;

<doc id="27107" wikidata="Q625731" url="?curid=27107" title="Deanna Troi">
<text>Deanna Troi is a main character in the science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and related TV series and films, portrayed by English actress Marina Sirtis. Troi is half-human, half-Betazoid, and has the psionic ability to sense emotions. She serves as the ship&#x27;s counselor on USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. Throughout most of the series, she holds the rank of lieutenant commander. In the seventh season, Troi takes the bridge officer&#x27;s examination and is promoted to the rank of commander, but continues as counselor.

Troi appears in all four &quot;Next Generation&quot; theatrical films, and also made guest appearances on &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Picard&quot; and &quot;Lower Decks&quot;.

Her romantic interests, family and personal life are plot elements in many &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes.

==Depiction==
Deanna Troi was born on March 29, 2336, near Lake El-Nar, Betazed. Troi&#x27;s parents are Betazoid Ambassador Lwaxana Troi (portrayed by Majel Barrett) and deceased human Starfleet officer Lt. Ian Andrew Troi (portrayed by Amick Byram). An older sister, Kestra, died in a drowning accident during Troi&#x27;s infancy. Although Deanna Troi has little exposure to Earth culture, she attended Starfleet Academy from 2355 to 2359, as well as the University of Betazed, and earned an advanced degree in psychology. As part of Betazoid aristocratic culture, Deanna, like her mother, is a Daughter of the Fifth House.

Deanna Troi serves as the ship&#x27;s counselor aboard the Starfleet starships USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; (NCC-1701-D) and &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard. In &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, Troi leaves the &quot;Enterprise&quot; with her new husband William Riker, who has just been promoted to captain of the USS &quot;Titan&quot;.

Troi&#x27;s empathic abilities prove key to main shows, and other popular areas are her relationships and sexuality. In &quot;The Child&quot;, she gives birth to an alien child.

The Betazoid race has telepathic abilities. Due to her half-human heritage, Troi has only partial telepathic abilities, and as a result, is more of an empath with clairsentience. In &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, Troi has expanded her empathic abilities, as she is able to connect to another psychic and follow that empathic bond to its source. In this instance, her ability enables &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E to target and hit the Romulan vessel &quot;Scimitar&quot;, despite the fact that it is cloaked. She is also able to communicate telepathically with her mother and other telepathic Betazoids or races with sufficient aptitude. Several species are resistant to the telepathy and empathy of Betazoids, such as the Ferengi, the Breen and the Ulians.

Early in the series, Troi finds herself working with a former lover, the newly assigned first officer to USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Commander William Riker. In season one, she meets a potential spouse in &quot;Haven&quot;. In later episodes, Troi has romantic involvements with several others, including a brief relationship with Klingon Starfleet officer Lieutenant Worf. A major exploration of their relationship begins with &quot;Parallels&quot;, in which Worf encounters parallel universes where they are married with children. Another episode that explores a Troi-Worf relationship is &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;. However, in both cases, they are not revealed to be dating aboard the &quot;real&quot; ship, although both episodes are oriented towards exploring this concept. In &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, the beginnings of a real-world relationship are briefly explored, though this is abruptly dropped as Worf explores other love interests in &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, and Troi&#x27;s romantic relationship with Riker is rekindled through the &quot;Next Generation&quot; films.

As a main cast member, Troi appears in nearly every &quot;TNG&quot; episode, though particular episodes, starting with &quot;The Child&quot;, feature her as the primary protagonist. Her name is included in the show title &quot;Ménage à Troi&quot;, which is oriented towards an adventure her mother and she have (besides Data and Q, this is one of the few cases where a character&#x27;s name is in the episode title). Other episodes principally about Troi include: &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot;, &quot;Man of the People&quot;, &quot;Violations&quot; and &quot;Night Terrors&quot;. The Season 7 episode &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; deals with Troi&#x27;s attempts to pass the bridge officer&#x27;s exam; she succeeds after several attempts and is promoted to Commander.

She is addressed in various ways by fellow officers. Captain Picard calls her &quot;Counselor&quot;, but when he is concerned about her, or in emergencies, he calls her &quot;Deanna&quot;. Picard also refers to her as &quot;Commander&quot; in the pilot episode, &quot;Encounter at Farpoint&quot;, which is consistent with her uniform&#x27;s rank pips. Riker addresses her as &quot;Lieutenant&quot; a single time in the pilot episode; her service rank is not referred to again for several seasons. Doctor Crusher (one of her most noted female friends) usually calls her &quot;Troi&quot;. Data very rarely calls her by her first name, usually calling her &quot;Counselor Troi&quot;. Depending on the situation, Commander Riker calls her &quot;Deanna&quot; or &quot;Imzadi&quot;, which means &quot;beloved&quot; in the Betazoid language.

In several episodes, Troi falls victim to aliens. In an episode of season four (&quot;Clues&quot;), the &quot;Enterprise&quot;’s crew loses a day&#x27;s memory. As events unfold, Troi is taken over by an entity to communicate with the crew. She temporarily gains &quot;superhuman&quot; strength and effortlessly tosses Worf across the bridge, breaking his wrist. In the season-five episode, &quot;Violations&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; encounters an alien species who are telepathic and specialise in being able to bring back lost memories. One of the aliens mentally assaults Deanna and also tries to physically assault her in her quarters. She is saved by Worf and one of his security teams. In the film, &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, she is mentally violated by Shinzon&#x27;s viceroy, who is also telepathic. This occurs in her quarters when she is with her new husband, Commander Riker; it also occurs in the &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; bonus deleted scenes, where she is attacked in the turbolift. She eventually is able to turn the tables on the viceroy using the same connection.

Troi is an avid connoisseur of chocolate, a fact that is significant in multiple episodes, including one in which she tells Commander Riker how to properly enjoy eating it. In the episode &quot;Remember Me&quot;, Beverly Crusher briefly describes Troi to Captain Picard to jog his memory and mentions that she &quot;loves chocolate&quot;. She is known for ordering chocolate-flavored desserts in Ten-Forward, and her love for desserts is a common point of dialogue in many shows. She talks about this with a visiting-alien ambassador in &quot;Liaisons&quot;, who takes up her love for desserts as in their culture they do not have this type of food.

Dream-themed episodes include &quot;Phantasms&quot;, where Troi appears as cake in Data&#x27;s dream and in &quot;Night Terrors&quot;, her dreams help save the ship. The dreams a suitor thinks he is having about her in &quot;Haven&quot; become a major plot point in that episode.

==Development and casting==
Marina Sirtis at first read for the role that would become Tasha Yar in 1986. She had, in total, five readings, all with Gene Roddenberry and other executives. Roddenberry took a liking to her almost immediately. Denise Crosby, who eventually won the role of Tasha, auditioned for the role of Deanna Troi. Sirtis was said to have had a more &quot;exotic&quot; feel about her.

She was just about to return home, in debt and jobless, when she received the phone call alerting her that she had the role of Deanna Troi. She stated that if it had been an hour later, she would have missed that call and been on her way to England. Sirtis&#x27; US visa was expiring that day, and if she had stayed any longer, she could have run into legal trouble.

For Sirtis, &quot;Star Trek&quot; was her first big break. Prior to Deanna Troi, her acting career was going nowhere: &quot;What they told us about &quot;The Next Generation&quot; when we first started was that we were guaranteed 26 episodes. So that was the longest job I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;

Series creator Gene Roddenberry initially intended Troi to be &quot;eye candy&quot; - beautiful, sexy, and not very bright. He also conceptualised her as having four breasts, before his wife told him this was a bad idea. Prior to filming, Sirtis was told to lose , but thought to herself that she had to drop even more, and was often wearing plunging necklines and form-fitting dresses. After six years, the producers decided to drop the &quot;sexy and brainless&quot; Troi and make her a stronger character, represented by changing her outfit to a standard crew uniform: I was thrilled when I got my regulation Starfleet uniform... it covered up my cleavage and I got all my brains back, because when you have cleavage, you can&#x27;t have brains in Hollywood... I was allowed to do things that I hadn&#x27;t been allowed to do for five or six years. I went on away teams, I was in charge of staff, I had my pips back, I had phasers, I had all the equipment again, and it was fabulous. I was absolutely thrilled.

==Reception==
One reviewer compared her to Leonard McCoy from the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series. In 2018, CBR ranked Counselor Troi as the 25th-best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in 2018; they note her role as an empath aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot; 1701-D. In 2017, &quot;IndieWire&quot; ranked Troi as the 9th-best character on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

In 2016, Troi was ranked as the 24th-most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe by &quot;Wired&quot;.

In 2017, &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked Troi the 12th-most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, &quot;CBR&quot; ranked Troi the 25th-best member of Starfleet.

In 2019, Troi was ranked the sixth-sexiest &quot;Star Trek&quot; character by SyFy.

In 2020, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Guide&quot; recommended the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episodes &quot;Ménage à Troi&quot;, &quot;Face of the Enemy&quot; and &quot;Thine Own Self&quot; as having some of the best moments for this character.

In 2020, SyFy Wire was very positive about her performance in the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; episode &quot;Nepenthe&quot;, explaining that &quot;It features Deanna Troi at her very best, with Marina Sirtis at the height of her powers.&quot;

==Franchise appearances==
Besides being a regular in &quot;The Next Generation&quot; and its films, Deanna Troi appears in three episodes of &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (&quot;Pathfinder&quot;, &quot;Life Line&quot;, and &quot;Inside Man&quot;) together with Reginald Barclay, and in the final episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;, with William Riker.

Troi appears in the &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; season 1 episode &quot;Nepenthe&quot;, set twenty years after &quot;Nemesis&quot; where she is married to Riker and they have two children, Thad (deceased) and Kestra. When Jean-Luc Picard and his android companion Soji visit the Rikers&#x27; home, Deanna and her husband welcome them with open arms. Deanna and Will are both retired from Starfleet, although Will is described as being on &quot;active reserve&quot;.

Deanna appears in a recurring capacity in the first half of season 3, which include flashbacks to her motherhood. She is later revealed to have been abducted by the antagonists of the season, and is reunited with Riker, who had fallen into an existential crisis after Thad&#x27;s death and needed to temporarily separate from her to get outside help from Picard. They discuss their marital issues in their detainment, realizing their relationship had turned into one of toxic codependency and longing for adventure. Worf rescues the couple, and they are reunited with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew aboard a new incarnation of the USS &quot;Titan&quot;.

Troi appears in the first-season finale of the animated &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot;, set a year after the events of &quot;Nemesis&quot;.

<doc id="27108" wikidata="Q384569" url="?curid=27108" title="Geordi La Forge">
<text>Geordi La Forge ( ) is a fictional character who appeared in all seven seasons of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and its four feature films as well as the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. Portrayed by LeVar Burton, he served as helmsman of the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D in the first season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, then occupied the role of the chief engineer for the rest of the series and in the films before appearing as a commodore in &quot;Picard&quot;. La Forge has been blind since his birth and uses technological devices that allow him to see – a VISOR in the series and the first film, replaced by ocular prosthetic implants in the last three films and in &quot;Picard&quot;.

==Concept and development==
Gene Roddenberry created the character in honor of George La Forge, a quadriplegic fan of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, who died in 1975. He was not the first to honor La Forge in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise; a character directly named for George La Forge was written into the 1980 &quot;Star Trek&quot; novel &quot;The Galactic Whirlpool&quot; by David Gerrold.

A casting call was placed with agencies for the role, which described him as friends with Data, and specified that La Forge should have &quot;perfect diction and might even have a Jamaican accent&quot; and instructed those agencies not to submit &quot;any &#x27;street&#x27; types.&quot;

LeVar Burton auditioned for the role in 1986. He had previously appeared in &quot;Roots&quot; and other major network shows. He stated that &quot;years ago I was doing a TV movie called &quot;Emergency Room&quot; and it was a fairly miserable experience. But there was a producer on that show, a man named Bob Justman... six, seven years later, I get this call from Bob Justman and he&#x27;s working at Paramount on this new Star Trek series and he said I remember your love of the show, we&#x27;ve got this character, would you be interested in coming in and seeing us? And I said was [franchise creator] Gene Roddenberry involved? He said he is. And I said I&#x27;ll be right there.&quot; Roddenberry was very pleased with Burton at his first audition. Among the other actors considered for the role were Wesley Snipes, Reggie Jackson, Kevin Peter Hall, Clarence Gilyard, and Tim Russ, who would later play Tuvok on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. Snipes was close to getting cast, but lost to Burton; he would later say that he was disappointed at first, but later said that he was grateful how things turned out saying if he had gotten the role he would have been in television more than film.

Burton also commented that he was anxious about his role, because he feared that &quot;The Next Generation&quot; was going to flop: &quot;At the beginning, you know, there was a lot of conversation in the press at what a bad idea this was [but] I thought that since Gene was involved we had a real good shot of making a good show that would carry on in that tradition of Star Trek.&quot;

Throughout the series, Burton was equipped with Geordi La Forge&#x27;s trademark VISOR, which he found extremely unpleasant to wear:It&#x27;s pretty much a living hell. 85 to 90% of my vision is taken away when the VISOR goes on. I bumped into everything the first season—light stands, overhead microphones, cables at my feet—I tripped over it all. So it&#x27;s a sort of conundrum. The blind man, who puts on the VISOR and sees much more than everyone else around him, when the actor actually does that he&#x27;s turned into a blind person. Then there was the pain. In the second season, we re-designed the VISOR and made it heavier and the way we actually affixed it was that we screwed it, we literally screwed it into my head and so there were screws that we would turn and there were flanges on the inside that would press into my temples and so after fifteen or twenty minutes of that I got headaches. So I had a daily headache for about six years. Which was also no fun.During the series, Burton&#x27;s character was Chief Engineering Officer, and thus was often portrayed repairing machines or discovering new scientific phenomena. Burton commented how hard it sometimes was to deliver the technobabble used by La Forge in these scenes with a straight face: &quot;Technobabble brings with it its own challenge. I&#x27;m not an engineer, I just played one on TV. The methodology that I found most successful was to really spit it out as fast as I possibly could. Giving the illusion that I knew what I was talking about when, in fact, I really didn&#x27;t.&quot;

 Asked about his favorite scenes, Burton answered that he especially liked holodeck adventures: &quot;The Holmes and Watson episodes for Data and Geordi, the Robin Hood episode, you know, those were a lot of fun for us. I think the holodeck was a very cool concept, you know. You can create a three dimensional reality. I mean, how cool is that?&quot;

Following the end of the series, Burton has stated how much he gained from &quot;The Next Generation&quot;; &quot;When I got married my best man was Brent (Spiner, who portrayed the series character Lieutenant Commander Data) and my groomsmen were Michael (Dorn, Lieutenant Worf) and Jonathan (Frakes, Commander Riker) and Patrick (Stewart, Captain Picard). No matter what, we will always be family to each other. I mean in every respect. There have been times when there have been feuds within the family, when it hasn&#x27;t been all hugs and kisses. But we have stuck together.&quot;

==VISOR==
===In universe===
In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fictional universe, a VISOR is a device used by the blind to artificially provide them with a sense of sight. A thin, curved device worn over the face like a pair of sunglasses, the VISOR scans the electromagnetic spectrum, creating visual input, and transmits it into the brain of the wearer via the optic nerves. The sensors are located on the side, that covers the eyes and attaches at small input jacks implanted in the temples. The only VISOR seen on screen was used by Geordi La Forge, who was blind from birth. VISOR is an acronym for &quot;Visual Instrument and Sight Organ Replacement&quot;; however, the complete term never appeared in the series, but only in novelizations and other written tie-in products.

The VISOR also caused LaForge some persistent pain, which could not be treated without interfering with the device. Beverly Crusher and Katherine Pulaski, the two high-ranking doctors who served on the ship, were unfamiliar with the device when first meeting La Forge.

The device does not reproduce normal human vision, but does allow the character to &quot;see&quot; energy phenomena visible to the naked human eye while expanding the wearer&#x27;s full perceived spectrum to 1 Hz — 100 PHz. This also allowed the character to see human vital signs such as heart rate and temperature, giving him the ability to monitor moods and even detect lies in humans (but not aliens). In the episode &quot;Heart of Glory&quot;, Captain Picard keys the main viewer to Geordi&#x27;s visor allowing him to see the way he does. Seeing all the overlapping and different wavelengths was highly confusing to the Captain, prompting him to ask Geordi how he was able to differentiate between them all. Geordi&#x27;s response made the comparison of a child hearing many different sounds at once and eventually being able to pick out what they needed; it is a learned talent.

In the episode &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;, the access to Geordi&#x27;s brain through the interface makes him a target of Romulan brainwashing.

In the episode &quot;Interface&quot;, Geordi uses an experimental interface to his VISOR. In an environment too dangerous for humans to be in, Geordi sees, hears, feels and acts through a robot.

Twice in the series, Geordi refused to be granted natural vision, first by Commander Riker, who had been given extraordinary amounts of power by Q, because it would have come at the cost of Riker&#x27;s humanity, and later by Doctor Katherine Pulaski.

Sometime between 2371 and 2373, before the time of the film &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, Geordi&#x27;s VISOR was replaced by cybernetic eyes, performing the same functions. On film, they are depicted using a combination of cosmetic contact lenses and CGI.

There was a short time period in &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; where Geordi gained actual eyesight, due to the effects of fictional metaphasic radiation, in the atmosphere of the planet Ba&#x27;ku. However, the effects of the metaphasic radiation wore off after leaving the planet, and the cybernetic eyes were once again used in the film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;.

===Reality===
&quot;New Scientist&quot; magazine reported on research as to whether a device similar to a VISOR can actually be created for blind or visually impaired people. Partial sight has been successfully restored to blind rats by installing an implant behind the retina.

Several types of visual prosthesis are in development or trials in humans, and one device has been approved for sale in the European market. , 16 blind people worldwide have had sight partially restored in a procedure where electrodes implanted in their brains take impulses from a camera to allow patients to see lights and outlines of objects. There is a device developed by NASA called a Joint Optical Reflective Display, or JORDY, that is presumably named for Geordi La Forge.

On August 14, 2012, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences published an article stating the encoding of image information by the retina into patterns of action potentials has been replicated successfully by a prosthetic device and scientists have successfully restored full vision to blind mice. Scientists were able to mimic this ocular response using glasses, and speculate that a similar pair of glasses may be available for human use within two years.

LeVar Burton, who played the character of Geordi La Forge, disliked the VISOR prop because it restricted his peripheral vision – albeit less than its prototypes – and the constant pressure of the prop&#x27;s arms on his temples caused headaches. In commentary for &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;, film writers Ronald D. Moore and Brannon Braga noted Burton also felt the prop limited him as an actor, as it denied him the use of his eyes in conveying emotion. The original prop was inspired by a one-piece women&#x27;s hair clip brought to production by Michael Okuda during the initial conceptual development of the VISOR prop.

==Fictional character biography==
In the series, Geordi was born blind and wears a VISOR, an arc-shaped prosthetic attached at the temples that provides him with vision. Interfacing directly with his brain, the device enables him to &quot;see&quot; much of the electromagnetic spectrum – radio waves, infrared, ultraviolet, and beyond, but not normal light perception, though it does allow Geordi to see the visible light section of the electromagnetic spectrum.

La Forge was born February 16, 2335, in Mogadishu, Somalia of the African Confederation on Earth to Silva La Forge, a Starfleet command track officer and eventual Captain of the USS &quot;Hera&quot; (NCC-62006) and Edward M. La Forge, a Starfleet exozoologist. He has also mentioned having a sister, Arianna. La Forge stated that with two parents in Starfleet he was an &quot;army brat&quot;, frequently moving homes depending on where his parents were stationed around Earth (or other planets), which mirrors Burton&#x27;s own youth (he was born on an American base in Germany). He attended Zefram Cochrane High School and then Starfleet Academy from 2353 to 2357. In 2357, he was assigned as an ensign aboard the USS &quot;Victory&quot; under Captain Zimbata. After his first cruise, he was transferred to the USS &quot;Hood&quot; serving with then Lt. Commander William Riker for her 2361-64 cruise, during which he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade.

La Forge once impressed Captain Jean-Luc Picard by staying up all night to fix a shuttle craft that Picard mentioned had a superficial problem. Upon learning this, Picard decided he wanted Geordi on his next command which ended up being the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D where Geordi was assigned to him as a helmsman. At the beginning of Season 2, he was promoted to Lieutenant and named Chief Engineer; in Season 3, he rose to Lieutenant Commander, a rank that he held for the duration of the series and movies. He and the android Data, the second officer aboard the &quot;Enterprise-D&quot;, quickly become friends.

In 2372, Geordi is transferred to the new &quot;Sovereign&quot;-class starship &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E. When the ship travels back in time to the 21st century, he works alongside Dr. Zefram Cochrane and helps him successfully launch Earth&#x27;s first warp-capable vessel and achieve first contact with the Vulcans.

During the Ba&#x27;ku incident, La Forge began to experience pain in his eyes after sojourning on the planet. Doctor Beverly Crusher removes his ocular implants to discover that his optic nerves have regenerated and he has gained normal sight. This effect is caused by the healing properties of the Ba&#x27;ku ring system and, at the time, it is speculated that the effect will fade after La Forge leaves Ba&#x27;ku. This diagnosis proved correct; La Forge again wears the implants in &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;.
In the third season of the sequel series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, La Forge is revealed to have fathered two daughters, Alandra and Sidney, who have joined Starfleet by 2401. Like their father, Alandra has become an engineer while Sidney has become a pilot. Alandra serves alongside Geordi while Sidney serves aboard the USS &quot;Titan&quot;; he has become overprotective of them nonetheless. La Forge has become a Commodore and is the head curator of the Starfleet Museum, wherein he has been working on a secret project for twenty years. Picard, Crusher, their son Jack, and the &quot;Titan&quot; crew, on the run from a Changeling conspiracy in Starfleet, seek La Forge&#x27;s help to try to clone the ship&#x27;s signals, but La Forge points out that Starfleet has upgraded their ships to &quot;talk&quot; to each other. However, when his daughters and Jack steal a cloaking device from the Museum and install it on the &quot;Titan&quot;, La Forge reluctantly goes along with them, whereupon he is reunited with an altered form of Data, fighting with his &quot;evil twin&quot; Lore for control of their common android body. La Forge helps Data overcome Lore&#x27;s dominance of the body, which allows Data to kill the main antagonist of the season. La Forge is reunited with the rest of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew; he helps Data and Crusher find the true nature of Picard&#x27;s neurological disorder and loses his daughters to it, forcing La Forge to reveal his secret project: the full reconstruction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D. Picard uses the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to infiltrate the antagonists&#x27; collaborators&#x27; base; La Forge assumes temporary command, letting Crusher destroy the base&#x27;s power source with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; torpedoes, eliminating the collaborators&#x27; threat once and for all, and oversees Picard&#x27;s rescue. La Forge greets his daughters, who have been returned to normal, on the &quot;Titan&quot; over video; he is last seen playing poker with his &quot;Enterprise&quot; crewmates at the Ten Forward bar in Los Angeles, content with his life.

===Alternate timelines===
In one of the alternate universes experienced by Worf in the Season 7 episode &quot;Parallels (Star Trek: The Next Generation)&quot;, Geordi is killed in a Cardassian attack on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; when Worf is suddenly confronted with unfamiliar tactical controls and cannot raise the shields in time. Geordi&#x27;s VISOR is revealed to be the trigger of Worf&#x27;s unplanned shifts through the timelines.

In the alternate timeline of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; series finale &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, La Forge has, by 2395, married &quot;Leah&quot; and had three children (Alandra, Brett, and Sydney) with her. He left Starfleet and became a novelist. However, these events may never happen because of the divergence of the time line at the episode&#x27;s end.

In the alternate 2390 future in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;″s &quot;Timeless&quot;, La Forge is a captain and the commanding officer of the USS &quot;Challenger&quot;, doing his best to stop Harry Kim and Chakotay from altering the time line. He had micro-implants in his eyes, allowing him to see without wearing his visor. However, Kim and Chakotay succeed in their mission, erasing the alternate time line. Despite trying his best to stop them, La Forge is sympathetic to their actions and even offers a full pardon if they stop. When they refuse, La Forge is forced to attack, but wishes them good luck and says that in their place, he would probably do the same. When the group&#x27;s ship suffers a warp core breach and is going to explode, he offers to beam them aboard his ship so that they can survive, but they refuse and tell him to move off to a safe distance, which he does.

In the holographic alternate history depicted in &quot;Future Imperfect&quot;, a fictitious La Forge had cloned eye implants and had no need of his VISOR.

During the non-canon events of the comic book mini-series &quot;Star Trek: Countdown&quot; (a prequel to the 2009 &quot;Star Trek&quot; film), Geordi (now a civilian) is reunited with Data and Picard during an effort to stop a massive supernova that threatens all of existence. Geordi ultimately designs the &quot;Jellyfish&quot;, the advanced spacecraft that is piloted by Ambassador Spock in the film.

==Reception==
Critics and fans have responded favorably to the character. Burton himself has complained on DVD featurettes about the lack of romantic interests for his character. At least one scholar, however, states that out of seven principal black characters across the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, only La Forge and Tuvok &quot;really qualify as nerds, and neither of them compares with the extraordinary geekiness of the teenaged Wesley Crusher.&quot; According to Dr. Ron Eglash, the construction of the La Forge character stands up to the standards of Afrofuturism.

In David Greven&#x27;s book &quot;Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek&quot; (2009), he described the use of the VISOR as a means to obscure the face of the character, describing it as a &quot;surprisingly clunky symbol of blindness&quot;. However, he felt that the bionic eyes used in the film series were an improvement but followed a pattern of African American eye modifications in fantasy and science fiction films such as Halle Berry as Storm in &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000). Greven suggested that these changes were to create the impression that the wearer was alien in nature and to highlight the difference between that character/actor and the others in the film.

In 2018, TheWrap ranked Geordi as the 11th best main cast character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; shows, noting his ability to come up with technical solutions on short notice and his friendship with Data. In 2016, the character of Geordi was ranked as the 21st most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine. In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked &quot;Relics&quot; as the 62nd greatest of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise up to that time, noting that LeVar Burton has many great scenes with original cast veteran James Doohan reprising his famous character Scotty.

In 2017, IndieWire rated Geordi as the 8th best character on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. CBR ranked La Forge as the 13th best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, in 2018.

In 2017, Screen Rant ranked La Forge the 9th most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe. In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; placed La Forge as 11th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

<doc id="27109" wikidata="Q1055776" url="?curid=27109" title="Hoshi Sato">
<text>Hoshi Sato , played by Korean American actress Linda Park, is a fictional character in the science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

In the show Sato, born in Kyoto, Japan on July 9, 2129, is the communications officer aboard the starship &quot;Enterprise (NX-01)&quot;, and a linguist who can speak more than forty languages (polyglotism), including Klingon. She is an acknowledged linguistic genius and expert at operating the universal translator, a key instrument in allowing the crew to communicate with alien cultures.

==Biography==
Relatively little of Sato&#x27;s background was explored in the series. She briefly suffered from space sickness and claustrophobia. The fourth season episode &quot;Observer Effect&quot; revealed that she was once dishonourably discharged from Starfleet for running a floating poker game and breaking the arm of a Starfleet instructor who tried to break it up (she has a black belt in Aikido). She was subsequently allowed to reenlist because of her exceptional linguistic skills.

Before posting to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, she taught linguistics in Brazil; it is not known whether she was an active Starfleet officer at the time, or was reactivated to serve under Jonathan Archer. She later (also in &quot;Observer Effect&quot;) expressed regret at leaving without saying goodbye to her students.

She appears to be very close to Captain Archer—he is often protective towards her and they appear to have a history that predates her posting to &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but the full nature of their relationship was not explored further.

The series&#x27; final episode, &quot;These Are the Voyages...&quot;, reveals that Sato remains Archer&#x27;s communications officer throughout his tenure as captain, and was considering resuming her teaching career in Brazil following the ship&#x27;s decommissioning. The final episode also revealed that, after serving aboard &quot;Enterprise&quot; for ten years, she still wore an Ensign&#x27;s insignia. As noted in the records aboard the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;, Sato eventually achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander.

==Fate==
According to a computer bio screen, shown in the episode &quot;In a Mirror, Darkly&quot;, and taken from the memory banks of the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;, Sato was born in Kyoto, Japan. She was instrumental in the development of the universal translator. She eventually marries a man named Takashi Kimura, and retires from Starfleet with the rank of lieutenant commander.

A portion of her biography created for the episode not seen on-screen, stated that she and her family were among four thousand people who died on Tarsus IV in 2246 when a food shortage caused by an exotic fungus threatened the colony&#x27;s population. This would have made her 117 at the time of her death. Governor Kodos ordered the deaths of Sato and the others in order to save the rest of the colony. She was buried in Kyoto with her husband, Takashi Kimura. 

==Mirror Universe==
In the Mirror Universe, Sato held the rank of Lieutenant. In addition to being the communications officer, she acted as the &quot;Captain&#x27;s Woman&quot; (a combination yeoman/concubine) of Captain Maximillian Forrest and then Commander Jonathan Archer after Archer took control of the ISS &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

After Archer used the USS &quot;Defiant&quot; to put down the rebellion, Sato poisoned him and took command of the ship, taking the Mirror Travis Mayweather as a new consort. Upon reaching Earth, she demanded Earth&#x27;s surrender and proclaimed herself Empress.

==Reception==
According to author David Greven, &quot;Ensign Hoshi Sato is an Asian American linguist and the communications officer. Prone to fearful fits and generally seen as ineffectual in any terms other than the linguistic aspects of her job, Hoshi is the resident screamer.&quot;

Consulting producer and writer during season 1, Fred Dekker said Hoshi was his favorite character to write for as he felt she was the most human and relatable of the crew.

In 2001 in an interview with Ian Spelling of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, actress Linda Park who portrays character Hoshi Sato on &quot;Enterprise&quot; cited &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; as an example of the progression and growth of her character during the series.

In 2004, IGN said &quot;Linda Park is possibly the most under-utilized actor on the show and shows the most potential.&quot;

In 2013, &quot;Slate magazine&quot; ranked Hoshi Sato one of the ten best crew characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

In 2015, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; noted how Hoshi showed the importance of communication and the depth of her linguistic abilities. They recommended the episodes &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; and &quot;Vox Sola&quot; as watches for the Hoshi character.

In 2016, &quot;The Wrap&quot; ranked Hoshi the 37th, on a list of 39 of the best characters in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise. They noted her importance as a translator but called her &quot;a poor man&#x27;s Uhura&quot; and said the writers failed to flesh out the character beyond her basic premise.
&quot;Wired&quot; ranked Lt. Commander Hoshi Sato the 27th-most important Starfleet character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

<text>The Romulans () are an extraterrestrial race in the American science fiction franchise &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Their adopted home world is Romulus, and within the same star system they have settled a sister planet Remus. Their original home world, Vulcan, was renamed Ni&#x27;Var later in canon. They first appeared in the series &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966–1969). They have appeared in most subsequent &quot;Star Trek&quot; releases, including &quot;The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;The Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Picard&quot;, &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;, and &quot;Lower Decks&quot;. They appear in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; feature films &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989), &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991), &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002) and &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009). They also appear in various other spin-off media, including books, comics, toys and games.

Writer Paul Schneider created the Romulans for the 1966 &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;. As a basis, he considered what the ancient Roman Empire might have looked like had it developed to the point of spaceflight. Physically, the Romulans were presented as humanoid, but the show&#x27;s make-up department gave them pointed ears to distinguish them from humans. In the series, which is set in the 23rd century, the Romulans were speculated as having split from another alien species, the Vulcans, in the distant past. In contrast to the Vulcans, who were presented as peaceful and logic-oriented philosopher scientists, the Romulans were depicted as militaristic, having founded an interstellar empire. The Romulans were used as antagonists for the series&#x27; protagonists, the starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, her crew, and their government, the United Federation of Planets.

In 1987, the writers of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;—set in the 24th century—again used the Romulans as antagonists of the Federation. The show&#x27;s designers gave the Romulans new costumes and added a V-shaped ridge on the foreheads of most Romulan characters, though with indications that Romulans without the ridges also existed. In the series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, Romulans without ridges are depicted as passing for Vulcans (who do not have ridges either). The 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot; depicted the Romulan homeworld, Romulus, being destroyed by a supernova in the year 2387. This film featured Romulans without the head ridges. The impact of Romulus&#x27;s destruction forms a plot-theme in the series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. Romulans in that series have included those with and without ridges, and a line about northern Romulans may have been intended to refer to these two groups.

==History==

===Original development===
The Romulans are a fictional extraterrestrial species in the Star Trek universe and were devised for the episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;. In 2014, the episode was rated the best in the franchise by &quot;io9.&quot; They were reused for the second-season episode &quot;The Deadly Years&quot; and the third-season episode &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot;.

They are humanoid beings originating from the planet Romulus and are known for their cunning, secrecy, and often adversarial relations with other civilizations, especially the United Federation of Planets. Physiologically, Romulans are similar to Vulcans, another species in the Star Trek universe. In fact, Romulans share a common ancestry with Vulcans and are considered an offshoot of the same species. They have pointed ears and arched eyebrows, and possess great strength, intelligence, and longevity.

The Romulans diverged from their Vulcan counterparts millennia ago due to ideological differences. While Vulcans embraced logic and the teachings of Surak, advocating emotional control and pacifism, the Romulans rejected these principles. They embraced their emotions and maintained a more militaristic and secretive society. Romulans are known for their cunning strategies, espionage, and manipulation in political affairs. They have a powerful and formidable military, with their signature warbird starships being a symbol of their might.

Throughout various Star Trek series and films, the Romulans have been portrayed as complex adversaries with deep-seated cultural traditions and a sense of superiority over other species. Their interactions with other factions in the Star Trek universe often involve political intrigue, espionage, and attempts to expand their influence in the galaxy. 

While based on the Roman Empire, they took on the adversarial role of Cold War era Communist China, with the fictional government the United Federation of Planets playing the role of the United States, and the Klingons, based on the Mongol Empire, acting the role of the Soviet Union. As a result, the Romulans were generally portrayed as mysterious, but also &quot;highly militaristic, aggressive by nature, and ruthless in warfare&quot;. The make-up required for an episode including Romulans in the Original Series became too expensive and time-consuming, so the Romulans became largely overshadowed by the Klingons.

===Reintroduction in the 1980s and 1990s===
After the launch of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in 1987, the show&#x27;s writers introduced the Romulans in the final episode of the first season, &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot;, which aired in the U.S. in May 1988. The episode was written by Maurice Hurley, who later acknowledged rushing it, putting together a script in a day and a half. In the episode, which is set in the year 2364, the Starfleet ship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D—whose crew are the series&#x27; main protagonists—responds to the disappearance of Federation colonies along the Neutral Zone, fearing that it reflects growing Romulan activity in the region. Investigating, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew encounter a Romulan spaceship; it is stated that this is the first encounter between the two peoples for 53 years. The Romulans reveal that they have had colonies destroyed on their side of the border too, and the two species agree to share information on the issue in future. In later episodes it is revealed that these colonies were destroyed by a previously unknown species, the Borg, whom the show&#x27;s writers had devised as a new alien antagonist following dissatisfaction with their previous attempt, the Ferengi. Initial thoughts by the script-writers had proposed a multi-episode storyline in which the Federation and Romulan governments would co-operate to fight the Borg; ultimately only certain elements of this idea entered &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot;, and the Borg would be introduced not in the first season, but in the second-season episode &quot;Q Who&quot;.

New costumes were designed for the actors playing Romulans, created by the show&#x27;s costume designer William Theiss.
The newly designed Romulan ship that appeared in &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; was built as a miniature model by Greg Jein. The ship featured a newly designed Romulan crest, featuring a stylised bird of prey clutching two planets, Romulus and Remus, in its claws. Later in the series, this ship type would be explicitly referred to as a &quot;warbird&quot;. In 1989, AMT released a plastic kit of the vessel, alongside other kits for a Ferengi ship and a Klingon bird of prey vessel.

The Romulans were re-used for the second-season episode &quot;Contagion&quot;, written by Steve Gerber and Beth Woods and first aired in March 1989. In this episode, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D entered the Neutral Zone to answer a distress call and ends up in conflict with a Romulan vessel, with both spaceships being disabled by an alien computer virus. &quot;Contagion&quot; was the first episode in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise in which the Romulan ship was given a name, in this case the &quot;Haakona&quot;. In the third-season episode &quot;The Enemy&quot;, written by David Kemper and Michael Piller and first screened in November 1989, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D is depicted rescuing a crashed Romulan ship. The episode introduced the Romulan character Tomalak, played by Andreas Katsulas, who would reappear in three further &quot;Next Generation&quot; episodes. It also further established the idea of a significant enmity between the Romulans and the Klingons, with the &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s Klingon officer, Worf (Michael Dorn), refusing to donate blood to save the life of an injured Romulan; the scriptwriters had debated whether to include this, with Dorn initially reticent.

Three episodes later, in &quot;The Defector&quot;, written by Ronald D. Moore and first screened in January 1990, a Romulan admiral is presented as seeking to defect to the Federation. The episode is the first in the franchise to include images of Romulus itself and introduced the design of a Romulan scout vessel. &quot;The Defector&quot; also includes a reference to the Battle of Cheron, an incident in the 22nd century Earth-Romulan War that was previously mentioned in &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;.

====&quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Voyager&quot;====
For &quot;The Search&quot;, the opening two-part episode of the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, a Romulan link was introduced. The episode, which was written by Ira Steven Behr, Robert Hewitt Wolfe, and Ronald D. Moore, featured the introduction of a new Starfleet ship, the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;; the scriptwriters included the idea that it had been equipped with a cloaking device by the Romulans in return for intelligence that the Federation gathered on another alien power, the Dominion. A Romulan character, T&#x27;Rul (Martha Hackett), was included to oversee the device&#x27;s use aboard the &quot;Defiant&quot;. The show&#x27;s writers had initially planned on including T&#x27;Rul as a permanent fixture on the show but decided that she did not offer enough potential for new storylines.

The Romulans were reused later that season in &quot;Visionary&quot;, where they are presented as attempting to destroy the Deep Space Nine space station as part of their plan to collapse the nearby wormhole and thus prevent a Dominion invasion of the Alpha Quadrant, the region of space where both the Federation and Romulans reside. Three episodes later, the follow-on episodes &quot;Improbable Cause&quot; and &quot;The Die Is Cast&quot; again featured the Romulans, in this case portraying a joint mission by the Romulan Tal Shiar and Cardassian Obsidian Order to fatally cripple the Dominion by eradicating its leaders, the Founders. For these episodes, new Tal Shiar outfits were designed; Moore related that this was partly his decision, for he &quot;hated, underline hated, the Romulan costumes [introduced in the first season of &quot;The Next Generation&quot;]. Big shoulder pads, the quilting, I just loathed it&quot;. Costume designer Robert Blackman noted that his team created eight new Romulan uniforms, using the same fabric as the old ones but &quot;dyed it down slightly, and we made them much sleeker and a little more menacing&quot;.

==== &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; ====
The Romulans were the major antagonists in the 2002 film &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, with much of the action set on Romulus. The film also introduced the Remans, inhabitants of the other planet in the Romulan system, who serve as a slave labor caste in Romulan society.

==== &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; ====
In season 4, the Romulans played a pivotal role in the episodes &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot;, &quot;Babel One&quot;, United&quot;, and &quot;The Aenar&quot;. In &quot;Kir&#x27;Shara&quot;, it&#x27;s revealed that Administrator V&#x27;Las of the Vulcan High Command is actually conspiring with a Romulan agent to &quot;reunify&quot; their two peoples through force. The agent, Major Talok, chases Captain Archer, T&#x27;Pol and T&#x27;Pau through the area of Vulcan known as The Forge throughout the episode, although his true nature isn&#x27;t revealed until the end. In addition, in the previous episode &quot;Awakening&quot;, Archer learned from Surak that during the &quot;Time of Awakening&quot;, a Vulcan schism of those who &quot;sought a return to savage ways&quot; and &quot;marched beneath the raptor&#x27;s wings&quot; (later the symbol of the Romulan people) perpetrate a cataclysmic nuclear attack upon Surak and his enlightened society. Soon after Surak&#x27;s death, these Vulcan recidivists abandoned their homeworld to colonize the planets Romulus and Remus.

In &quot;Babel One&quot;, &quot;United&quot;, and &quot;The Aenar&quot;, the Romulans plot to destabilize their sector of space by using drone ships disguised as vessels from various cultures to turn their enemies against each other. These drone ships are piloted remotely through telepresence by Gareb, a young Aenar kidnapped by the Romulans who had lied to him that he was the last of his people. The plot was exposed by the efforts of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew and instead resulted in the humans, Vulcans, Andorians, and Tellarites uniting to defeat the Romulan threat, bringing them closer together than ever. The &quot;Enterprise&quot; then enlists the help of Gareb&#x27;s sister Jhamel who telepathically contacts her brother and informs him of the truth. Gareb turns on the Romulans, destroying one drone ship and allowing the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to destroy the other, foiling the Romulan plot. In retaliation, Romulan Admiral Valdore kills Gareb for his betrayal.

===Reboot: 2009–present===

After &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; proved a financial failure and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; was cancelled, the franchise&#x27;s executive producer Rick Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendresen began developing a new film entitled &quot;Star Trek: The Beginning&quot;, which was to be set during the 22nd century Earth–Romulan War. The project never materialised. Instead, the decision was made to reboot the series by creating a film using the characters of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series but played by new actors. Putting together a script for the new film, the director J. J. Abrams stated that he wanted Romulans to be the antagonists because they had featured less than the Klingons in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series. The film&#x27;s writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, thought that it would feel backward to demonize the Klingons as villains again after they had been presented heroically in later &quot;Star Trek&quot; series; they also wanted to use Spock as a central character in the film and believed that the Romulan presence would continue Spock&#x27;s story from his last chronological appearance in &quot;Unification&quot;.

In the 2009 Abrams reboot film, titled &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the planet Romulus is destroyed by a supernova in the year 2387. A Romulan mining ship, the &quot;Narada&quot;, survives and travels back in time to the 23rd century; its commander, Nero (Eric Bana), is committed to destroying the planet Vulcan to punish Spock for failing to save Romulus. The actors playing Romulans in this film wore three prosthetics applied to their ears and foreheads, while Bana had a fourth prosthetic for the bitemark on his ear that extends to the back of his character&#x27;s head. The film&#x27;s Romulans lacked the V-shaped ridges on the foreheads, which had been present in all of their depictions outside the original series. Neville Page wanted to honor that by having Nero&#x27;s crew ritually scar themselves too, forming keloids reminiscent of the &quot;V&quot;-ridges. It was abandoned as they did not pursue the idea enough.

Picard&#x27;s reaction to the destruction of Romulus is the backstory and central premise of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. The series begins with Picard in self-imposed exile at his French vineyard following his resignation in protest to Starfleet&#x27;s handling of Romulans and androids. Picard has two live-in Romulans at his estate. At least two groups of Romulans survived: one group formed the Romulan Free State, while the other group was evacuated to the planet of Vashti.

In the &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; episode &quot;Unification III&quot;, Ambassador Spock&#x27;s dream of Vulcan/Romulan reunification has been achieved. The Romulans have returned to their ancestral homeworld (since renamed Ni&#x27;Var) and reunified with their Vulcan cousins. When the Vulcans decided to pull out of the Federation due to the apocalyptic event known as the Burn, it was actually the Romulans who wished to remain, according to Starfleet Admiral Vance. In the episode &quot;All Is Possible&quot;, Ni&#x27;Var rejoins the Federation.

== Romulan Warbird ==

The Warbird was developed by Andrew Probert with the model built by Greg Jein. In the series it was introduced in the episode &quot;The Neutral Zone&quot; and seen on a recurring basis in the franchise from then on. In the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, it is twice as big as Picard&#x27;s Enterprise D and is powered by an artificial quantum singularity. It is noted for its size and power in &quot;Star Trek&quot; by Picard and his crew. 
In 2017, Space.com said the Warbird was the 9th best spacecraft in the Star Trek franchise. In 2020, CNET ranked the Romulan Warbird the 16th most powerful spacecraft in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

== Romulan language ==

Two fictional languages have been constructed for the Romulans and Remans of the Star Trek franchise.

The first was created by Diane Duane for her non-canon series of novels called &quot;Rihannsu&quot;. In this imagining, it was an intentional creation, based on Old High Vulcan when the Romulans left Vulcan and established their own society. Duane describes it as sounding somewhat like Latin and Welsh.

The second was created for the television series &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. Its script is distinct from occasional glimpses of Romulan writing in earlier series. As of 2021, little information has been released about the language, though it is developed enough to be used for dialog in the show.

== Reception ==

In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Romulans the seventh best aliens out of 50 species from the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, ahead of the Ferengi but behind the Q, and in first and second place respectively were the Vulcans and the Klingons.

==Other media==
The Romulans have been the focus of a number of non-canon books and have appeared or been mentioned in other non-canon media. Among their key appearances have been:

* Diane Duane&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Star Trek: Rihannsu&quot;, consisting of five books written between 1984 and 2006, is regarded as among the most detailed works focusing on the Romulans.
* In Dalla Van Hise&#x27;s &quot;Killing Time&quot; (1985), the Romulans use time travel to alter history, which results in James T. Kirk becoming an ensign and Spock a starship captain.
* A prototype Romulan warbird is the focus of Simon Hawke&#x27;s novel &quot;The Romulan Prize&quot; (1993).
* Robert Greenberger&#x27;s &quot;The Romulan Stratagem&quot; (1995) involves Jean-Luc Picard and his crew competing with the Romulan officer Sela to convince a planet to join their respective states.
* In Diane Carey&#x27;s &quot;Red Sector&quot; (1999), Spock and Leonard McCoy try to cure a virus that has infected the Romulan royal family.
* Josepha Sherman and Susan M. Schwartz&#x27;s &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Heart&quot; (1999) involved Spock traveling to Romulus to aid the Romulan Commander from &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot;.
* &quot;Captain&#x27;s Blood&quot; (2003), one of many collaborative works between &quot;Star Trek&quot; lead William Shatner and husband-and-wife team Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, focused on the involvement of Kirk in preventing a Romulan civil war in the aftermath of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;.
* The Tomed Incident is the focus of David R. George III&#x27;s novel &quot;Serpents Among the Ruins&quot; (2003), which features the crew of the &quot;Enterprise-B&quot;.
* &quot;Star Trek: Vulcan&#x27;s Soul&quot; is a trilogy written by Sherman and Shwartz between 2004 and 2007; set in the aftermath of the Dominion War, it focuses on members of Kirk&#x27;s original crew becoming involved in a war between the Romulans and a fellow Vulcan offshoot, the Watraii.
* In the &quot;Star Trek: Titan&quot; novel &quot;Taking Wing&quot; (2005), the Romulan Star Empire collapses into civil war in the wake of &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;.
* The &quot;Star Trek: Titan&quot; novel &quot;The Red King&quot; (2005) opens with the disappearance of a Romulan fleet and features Donatra, the Romulan commander featured in &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot;, working alongside William Riker and his crew.
* In the novel &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot; (2008) by Michael A. Martin and Andy Mangels, Admiral Valdore attempts once again to cause conflict in the region approximately one year after the incident involving the Aenar, this time using a &quot;telecapture&quot; system, designed to take over and control enemy ships. Using three Klingon vessels, Valdore attacks Coalition of Planets allies hoping to weaken or destroy two enemies of the Romulan Star Empire by provoking a war. Captain Archer is eventually able to provide evidence of this Romulan deception. This is followed by yet another unsuccessful attempt to break apart the alliance which involves using telecaptured Vulcan cruisers against Proxima Centauri (a recent coalition member). In the book, the event that finally sparks the Coalition&#x27;s declaration of war against the Romulans is the destruction of the Earth freighter &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;.
* &quot;The Romulan War: Beneath the Raptor&#x27;s Wing&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Kobayashi Maru&quot;. Set between July 22, 2155 and July 22, 2156, it details the war between the Coalition of Planets and the Romulan Star Empire. The story focuses on the Romulan attempts at taking over the Coalition whilst the Vulcans who are aware they are vulnerable to the telecapture weapon withdraw from the fight early. The other Coalition members withdraw one by one in the face of continued losses, leaving it up to Earth Starfleet to stop the Romulan menace.
* In &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;, set in the year 2409, the Romulan survivor D&#x27;Tan (the adult version of a minor character from TNG episode &quot;Unification II&quot;, played by Vidal Peterson) assisted in building a New Romulus after the destruction of the original homeworld twenty-two years prior. As part of rebuilding a new Romulan Republic, he became leader of the Romulan Unification Movement in an attempt to continue Ambassador Spock&#x27;s work of bringing the Vulcan and Romulan people together.

The &quot;Enterprise&quot; made for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series has been called an iconic design, and it influenced subsequent spacecraft in and outside the franchise. Several vessels named &quot;Enterprise&quot; have been the main setting for various &quot;Star Trek&quot; spinoff series and films.

== Design history ==

=== The original &quot;Star Trek&quot; and first films ===
Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek&quot; (1966–1969)
The USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, led by Captain James T. Kirk, is the main setting of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series and &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; (1973–74). Matt Jefferies designed the ship, and its core components – a saucer-shaped primary hull, and cylindrical secondary hull, and a pair of outriding engine nacelles – established the core ship design for the franchise. &quot;Enterprise&quot; footage was rotoscoped for its depiction in the animated spinoff.

Ship: Refit USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; (1979)
Jefferies created an updated &quot;Enterprise&quot; design for the &quot;Star Trek: Phase II&quot; series. He left the project when &quot;Phase II&quot; halted and production began on the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;. Several artists, including Andrew Probert, contributed to the film redesign. Several aspects of the ship, such as the engine nacelle grills, were influenced by art deco. The ship&#x27;s significantly different appearance compared to the television show was attributed to an 18-month refit. The ship is heavily damaged in &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot; (1982), and it is destroyed in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984).

Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-A
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home&quot; (1986)
Captain Kirk is given command of a new vessel named &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the end of &quot;Star Trek IV&quot;. Despite being a new ship narratively, the producers used the same filming model, redressed to include the new &quot;NCC-1701-A&quot; registry. The vessel appears in next two films, &quot;Star Trek V: The Final Frontier&quot; (1989) and &quot;Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country&quot; (1991). The ship is ordered decommissioned at the end of the sixth film, and it appears in a Starfleet Museum in the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2023).

=== &quot;The Next Generation&quot; productions ===
Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-D
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (1987–1994)
Andrew Probert designed the &quot;Enterprise&quot; created for the franchise&#x27;s return to television, taking place on a new &quot;Enterprise&quot; led by Captain Jean-Luc Picard 70 years after the events in the original series. This &quot;Enterprise&quot; also appears in the first film featuring the &quot;Next Generation&quot; cast, &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot; (1994). The ship&#x27;s engineering section is destroyed in &quot;Generations&quot;, but its saucer section crash lands on an alien planet. In the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;, the saucer section has been attached to a different vessel&#x27;s engineering hull, and it features prominently in the show&#x27;s climax before becoming part of the Fleet Museum.


Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-C
Introduction: &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Enterprise&quot; (1990) episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;
A third-season episode of &quot;The Next Generation&quot; includes a depiction of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-D&#x27;s predecessor, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C. Rick Sternbach used an illustration created by Andrew Probert as the design basis for the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C, executing a final design that could be more easily produced on a television episode&#x27;s budget. Led by Captain Rachel Garrett, the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C is destroyed protecting a Klingon outpost from a Romulan attack, strengthening an alliance between the Federation and the Klingon Empire.


Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-B
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek: Generations&quot; (1994)
The opening of &quot;Generations&quot; depicts the maiden voyage of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-B, during which James Kirk is lost and presumed dead. The vessel serves after Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot;-A and before the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-C from &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot;&quot;. The filming model was a modification of the &quot;Excelsior&quot; created for &quot;Star Trek III&quot;, with some components added to depict damage to the ship without harming the underlying model.


Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-E
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; (1996)
With the &quot;Enterprise-&quot;D&#x27;s destruction in &quot;Generations&quot;, a new film vessel for Picard and his crew was designed as the main setting for its sequels: &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998), and &quot;Star Trek: Nemesis&quot; (2002). It also appears in the first-season finale of &quot;Star Trek: Prodigy&quot; (2022) and the series finale of &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; (2024). The ship is disabled or destroyed under Worf&#x27;s command.

=== Return to television ===

Ship: &quot;Enterprise,&quot; NX-01
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2001–2005)
United Earth Starfleet&#x27;s &quot;Enterprise&quot; is the main setting of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, which takes places a century before the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Under the command of Captain Jonathan Archer, the vessel is the first Earth-built starship capable of reaching Warp 5. Initial designs of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; were deemed too similar to the original 1960s vessel. The final design, created by Doug Drexler, is based on the features of the &quot;Akira&quot; class created by Alex Jeager for &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot;.

Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-J
Introduction: &quot;Azati Prime&quot; episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2004)
A third-season episode of &quot;Enterprise&quot; involves Captain Archer being transported to the 26th-century &quot;Enterprise&quot;-J. Doug Drexler drew the first design only two days prior to the production meeting for the episode. The computer-generated model was created in a few hours, and Drexler later said that they would have finished it differently. He imagined that the vessel was so large that there would be universities and entire parks on board, with the turbolifts replaced by short range transporters. More than one design was created, with the final version created with elements from different designs.

=== Film franchise reboot ===

Ships: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701 and USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-A
Introduction: &quot;Star Trek&quot; (2009)
A new &quot;Enterprise&quot; was designed for the film franchise relaunch, which began with &quot;Star Trek&quot; and continued with &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot; (2013) and &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot; (2016). The new &quot;Enterprise&quot; was conceived as a &quot;hot rod&quot; while retaining elements from the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Motion Picture&quot; refit. At the end of &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, &quot;Enterprise&quot; has started its five-year mission under Captain Kirk. The ship is destroyed in &quot;Star Trek Beyond&quot;, and a successor &quot;Enterprise&quot;, with registry NCC-1701-A, is commissioned at the film&#x27;s conclusion.

=== Streaming services ===
Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701
Introduction: &quot;Will You Take My Hand?&quot; episode of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; (2018)
&quot;Star Trek: Discovery&#x27;s&quot; first-season finale, and several episodes of the second season, depict the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; under the command of Captain Christopher Pike. &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2022–present) focuses on Pike&#x27;s command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, whose exterior and interiors were slightly modified from their &quot;Discovery&quot; appearance. John Eaves, Scott Schneider, and William Budge redesigned the &quot;Enterprise&quot; for its appearance in the streaming series.

Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-F
Introduction: &quot;Võx&quot; episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2023)
This ship appears in penultimate episode &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2023) at the Frontier Day festival. The ship was originally designed by Adam Ihle as part of a fan competition for &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;. Ihle&#x27;s design has a &quot;familiar and recognizable&quot; shape while also offering an evolution in design. &quot;Star Trek Online&quot; artist Thomas Marrone updated the video game asset, and then sent the model to the series artists to incorporate into the show.


Ship: USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, NCC-1701-G
Introduction: &quot;The Last Generation&quot; episode of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot; (2023)
The USS &quot;Titan&quot; is the main setting for the third season of &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;. In the series finale, that vessel is renamed USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; and placed under the command of Captain Seven of Nine. The ship is based on designs by Bill Krause&quot;.&quot;
==Reception and influence==
&quot;Time&quot; described each iteration of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as &quot;a character in its own right&quot;. &quot;io9&quot; ranked the original design of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; as the best version of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; lineage, characterizing the original as still superior to all later versions. By contrast, SyFy ranked the refit design of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; from &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; and its sequels as the franchise&#x27;s best.

Over many decades, the starship has influenced activities of NASA. This includes a successful letter writing campaign by fans to name the initial flight-test Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and NASA&#x27;s decision to name its IXS &quot;Enterprise&quot; advanced propulsion concept vehicle after the &quot;Star Trek&quot; vessel. NetDragon Websoft based the design of its Fuzhou headquarters building on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;-E under an official license from CBS.

Celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has spoken highly of the influence and legacy of the original &quot;Enterprise&quot; on other fictional spaceships. Drawing a parallel to comparing athletes between eras, he said of spaceship design, &quot;What matters is not what they look like now, but what they looked to others at the time that they prevailed... There is only one spaceship that&#x27;s earlier than [the original &quot;Enterprise&quot;], and that&#x27;s the flying saucer from &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot;. So, what matters here is, what did [the &quot;Enterprise&quot;] look like at the time it came out (1966) compared with anything that had been imagined before? And when you consider that, that is the most astonishing machine that has ever graced the screen.&quot; On the ship&#x27;s influence upon scientists, Tyson wrote, &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; was the first ever spaceship represented in storytelling that was not designed to go from one place to another; [it was] only designed to explore. It was revolutionary in terms of what we would think space would, and should, be about.&quot;

<doc id="27113" wikidata="Q216920" url="?curid=27113" title="Secularism">
<text>Secularism is the principle of seeking to conduct human affairs based on naturalistic considerations, uninvolved with religion. It is most commonly thought of as the separation of religion from civil affairs and the state and may be broadened to a similar position seeking to remove or to minimize the role of religion in any public sphere. Secularism may encapsulate anti-clericalism, atheism, naturalism, non-sectarianism, neutrality on topics of religion, or antireligion. Secularism is not necessarily antithetical to religion, but may be compatible with it. As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life based on principles derived solely from the material world, without recourse to religion. It shifts the focus from religion towards &quot;temporal&quot; and material concerns.

There are distinct traditions of secularism like the French, Turkish, American and Indian models. These differ greatly, from the American emphasis on avoiding an established religion and the freedom of belief, to the French interventionist and controlling model, and more. The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely, ranging from assertions that it is a crucial element of modernization, or that religion and traditional values are backward and divisive, to the claim that it is the only guarantor of free religious exercise.

Secularism has origins going back to the ancient world and extends even into religious texts such as the Bible, being refined through history by religious thinkers. 

== Variations ==
Secularism takes different forms with varying stances on where and how religion should be separate from other aspects of society. People of any religious denomination can support a secular society, or adopt the principles of secularism, although secularist identity is often associated with non-religious individuals such as atheists. Political secularism encompasses the schools of thought in secularism that consider the regulation of religion by a secular state. Religious minorities and non-religious citizens in a country tend to support political secularism while members of the majority religion tend to oppose it. Secular nationalists are people that support political secularism within their own state.

Scholars identify several variations of political secularism in society. The strictest form, associated with the French laique model, advocates a state that is both firmly and officially distanced from all religions and non-religious philosophical convictions in all of its manifestations and official dealings, without exception. A more &quot;humanistic&quot; form is indifferent towards religions &quot;per se&quot; but also advocates for the states to operate on purely a rational basis of evidence-based policy and a focus on human needs and welfare, entailing non-discrimination between peoples of differing religions and non-religious philosophical convictions throughout society. A third &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;pillarized&quot; form of secularism holds that governments may in some instances express sympathy to, provide funding to, licence state services to, or otherwise allow unique special treatment of religions (common in German-speaking and Benelux secular states), so long as states nevertheless treat these convictions equally, and are neither hostile nor preferential towards any particular set of religious or non-religious philosophical convictions such as humanists. In these countries, secular humanist organizations typically receive state funding according to the same funding formulas used to provide state funding to religious groups. In Indian political discourse, the pejorative term pseudo-secularism is also used to highlight instances where it is believed that while the state purports to be secular, indifferent, or impartial towards religions, its policies in reality favour a particular religion over others. 

There are many principles that are associated with all forms of political secularism. It typically promotes legal equality between people of different religions, opposing a legal hierarchy on the basis of religious belief or lack of religious belief. It is also associated with a separation of church and state, considering these to be two distinct entities that should be treated separately. State supremacy is a secular principle that supports obedience to the rule of law over religious diktat or canon law, while internal constraint is a secular principle that opposes governmental control over one&#x27;s personal life. Under political secularism, the government can enforce how people act but not what they believe. Similarly, freedom of thought is supported by secularism. Order is supported by secularists, specifically in that one&#x27;s beliefs should not be permitted to disturb the civil peace. Religious tolerance is supported both for people of other religions and for a lack of piety demonstrated by members of one&#x27;s own religion. Political secularism also supports reason as a virtue. Secularists also support freedom from religion as an extension to freedom of religion.

== History ==
Secularism in practice has existed since ancient times. In societies such as Ancient Greece, a limited secularism was practised in which religion was not involved in governance, though it was still prevalent in public life.

Secularism&#x27;s origins can be traced to the Bible itself and fleshed out throughout Christian history into the modern era. &quot;Secular&quot; is a part of the Christian church&#x27;s history, which even has &quot;secular clergy&quot; since the medieval period. Furthermore, secular and religious entities were not separated in the medieval period, but coexisted and interacted naturally. Significant contributions to principles used in modern secularism came from prominent theologians and Christian writers such as St. Augustine, William of Ockham, Marsilius of Padua, Martin Luther, Roger Williams, John Locke and Talleyrand. 

In Europe, secularism emerged in the early modern period. Due to functional differentiation, religion changed from being the predominant lens through which reality was interpreted to providing only an alternative explanatory approach.

In 1636, Roger Williams founded the Providence Plantations as a settlement with total freedom of religion, in present-day Rhode Island. Secular ideas were strongly challenged by religious leaders and the Catholic Church in particular, causing a religious culture war. During the American Revolution, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison incorporated the ideas of John Locke into the government of the United States, including his secularism, though a true secular state was not achieved until the 20th century. French secularism in the Age of Enlightenment was based on Gallicanism, which emphasised state supremacy, as well as anti-clericalism and materialism. Revolutionary France opposed Catholic influence in the country, and it briefly replaced Christianity with the deistic Cult of Reason.

The first to use the already-extant word &quot;secularism&quot; in a modern sense, was the British agnostic writer George Holyoake, in 1851. Finding &quot;atheism&quot; too aggravating, he sought a term that would describe a stance advocating to conduct life based on naturalistic (secular) considerations only, but without necessarily rejecting religion, thus enabling cooperation with believers. Holyoake&#x27;s definition of secularism differs from its usage by later writers. As the Humanist Heritage website notes, Holyoake provides a definition of secularism &quot;much akin to modern definitions of humanism... broader than just atheism.&quot; More modern definitions of secularism are likely to pertain to separation of church and state rather than personal beliefs.

Many Christian countries began to undergo societal secularisation during the 20th century, with levels of belief and practice declining. Sociologists disagree as to whether this represents a periodic fluctuation or a larger trend toward long-term adoption of secularism. The principle of &quot;Laïcité&quot;, the French notion of strict separation, was enshrined into law in 1905. After the rise to power of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1923, Turkish secularism, or &quot;laiklik&quot;, became a state ideology under Kemalism, aiming to modernise the country. Turkey&#x27;s secular tradition prior to Atatürk&#x27;s reforms was limited, and 20th century Turkish secularism was initially modelled after French &quot;laïcité&quot;. Turkey remains virtually the only Muslim-majority nation with an effective secular government, though secularism remains a controversial ideology in Turkey, and the country&#x27;s ruling party AKP is more anti-Kemalist than anti-secularist. India became a secular state after it achieved independence in 1947; Mahatma Gandhi supported pluralist secularism as a means to curb tensions in the religiously diverse nation. The Indian model of secularism stressed equality of citizens regardless of faith before the law, along with some separation. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed in 1948, protecting freedom of religion in international law.

== State secularism ==


In political terms, secularism is a movement towards the separation of religion and government, often termed the separation of church and state. This can refer to reducing ties between a government and a state religion, replacing laws based on scripture (such as &quot;Halakha&quot;, &quot;Dharmaśāstra&quot;, and &quot;Sharia&quot;) with civil laws, and eliminating discrimination on the basis of religion. This is said to add to democracy by protecting the rights of religious minorities. Separation of church and state is one possible strategy to be deployed by secular governments. From the democratic to the authoritarian, such governments share a concern to limit the religious side in the relationship. Each state may find its own unique policy prescriptions. These may include separation, careful monitoring and regulation of organized religion such as in France, Turkey, India and others.

In accord with the belief in the separation of church and state, secularists tend to prefer that politicians make decisions for secular rather than religious reasons. In this respect, policy decisions pertaining to topics like abortion, contraception, embryonic stem cell research, same-sex marriage, and sex education are prominently focused upon by American secularist organizations such as the Center for Inquiry. Religious fundamentalists often oppose a secular form of government, arguing that it contradicts the character of historically religious nations, or infringes on their rights to express themselves in the public sphere. In the United States, for example, the word &quot;secularism&quot; became equivalent to &quot;anti-religion&quot; due to such efforts. Religious minorities, however, often support secularism as a means of defending their rights against the majority.

State secularism is most often associated with the Age of Enlightenment in Europe and it plays a major role in Western society. Some of the best known examples of states considered &quot;constitutionally secular&quot; are the United States, France, Turkey, India, Mexico, and South Korea, though none of these nations have identical forms of governance with respect to religion. For example, in India, secularism does not completely separate state and religion, while in France, secularism precludes such mutual involvement.

=== Frameworks ===
Separationist secularism enforces the separation of church and state. Under this system, the state does not support any religious group and does not enforce religious laws. Challenges facing separationist secularism include how the government should regulate secular activities of religious groups and how to govern separately from religion when citizens, including government employees, are religious. The federal judiciary of the United States interpreted the United States Constitution as supporting this system during the 20th century, based on the ideas of John Locke and Thomas Jefferson.

&quot;Laïcité&quot; is a secularist framework developed and used in France. Under this system, the state has legal supremacy over religion and enforces the restriction of religion in the public sphere. It was established by a 1905 law, and subsequent laws have restricted the use of religious iconography in public or by children. Kemalist secularism, or &quot;laiklik&quot;, is an adaptation of &quot;laïcité&quot; that Mustafa Kemal Atatürk established in Turkey in the 1920s and 1930s.

Accommodationism is a system of actively supporting religion in general without favouring a specific religious sect. Under this system, the state applies few restrictions to religion and often provides religious organizations with financial support. India uses this system, incorporating Western ideas of secularism in combination with the Indian tradition of religious and ethnic pluralism. One source of disagreement regarding accommodationism in India is the right of Muslims to live under both the civil code and Sharia simultaneously and the complications that result from this. Accommodationism also has a history in the United States, and the U.S. has increasingly moved toward accommodationism in the 21st century.

State atheism is a total ban on religion. Under this system, the state enforces laws that do not allow religious practice or the expression of religious beliefs in society. Unlike other secularist frameworks, state atheism does not permit freedom of thought or the separation of government from personal belief. Because of this distinction, state atheism may or may not be considered a form of secularism. It is typically associated with Marxism and Communist states, in which it is described as &quot;scientific atheism&quot;.

== Secular society ==
In studies of religion, modern democracies are generally recognized as secular. This is due to the near-complete freedom of religion (religious beliefs generally are not subject to legal or social sanctions), and the lack of authority of religious leaders over political decisions. Nevertheless, it has been claimed that surveys done by Pew Research Center show Americans as generally being more comfortable with religion playing a major role in public life, while in Europe the impact of the church on public life is declining.

Most societies become increasingly secular as the result of social, economic development and progress, rather than through the actions of a dedicated secular movement. Modern sociology has, since Max Weber, often been preoccupied with the problem of authority in secularised societies and with secularisation as a sociological or historical process. Contemporary ethical debate in the West is often described as &quot;secular&quot;, as it is detached from religious considerations. Twentieth-century scholars, whose work has contributed to the understanding of these matters, include Carl L. Becker, Karl Löwith, Hans Blumenberg, M. H. Abrams, Peter L. Berger, Paul Bénichou and D. L. Munby, among others.

There is not one singular secular culture, as different people identify as secularists for different reasons and under different belief systems. Secularism is typically associated with progressivism and social liberalism. In democratic countries, middle and upper class white urban males with high education are more likely to identify as secularist than any other demographic group. In societies where secularism is more common, such as in Western Europe, demographics of secularists are closer to even. How a society considers what is secular may also change, where nominally spiritual beliefs become part of public or private life without being recognized as religious. As secularists are a minority in most communities, secularism is often stigmatized. Proponents of religious society challenge secular society on the basis of morality, saying that secularism lacks a meaningful way to incentivize moral behaviour among its members.

== Secular philosophy ==
Secularism is considered in political philosophy and philosophy of religion. As a philosophy, secularism is closely associated with naturalism and materialism, rejecting consideration of immaterial or supernatural substances, such as a soul, in favour of a material universe. This secular materialism and rationalism forms the basis of most modern empirical science. During the Age of Enlightenment, liberal European philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza, John Locke, Montesquieu, Voltaire, David Hume, Adam Smith, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all proposed various forms of separation of church and state. The work of well known moral philosophers such as Derek Parfit and Peter Singer, and even the whole field of contemporary bioethics, have been described as explicitly secular or non-religious.

A major issue considered by secular philosophy is the nature of morality in a material universe. Secular ethics and secular morality describe systems of right and wrong that do not depend on religious or supernatural concepts. Much of the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche is developed in response to this issue. Under secular ethics, good is typically defined as that which contributes to &quot;human flourishing and justice&quot; rather than an abstract or idealized conception of good. Secular ethics are often considered within the frame of humanism.

=== Secularism in late 20th century political philosophy ===
It can be seen by many of the organizations (NGOs) for secularism that they prefer to define &quot;secularism&quot; as the common ground for all life stance groups, religious or atheistic, to thrive in a society that honours freedom of speech and conscience. An example of that is the National Secular Society in the UK. This is a common understanding of what secularism stands for among many of its activists throughout the world. However, many scholars of Christianity and conservative politicians will often interpret secularism as an antithesis of religion and an attempt to push religion out of society and replace it with atheism or a void of values, nihilism. This dual aspect (as noted above in &quot;Secular ethics&quot;) has created difficulties in political discourse on the subject. Most political theorists in philosophy following the landmark work of John Rawls&#x27; &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; in 1971 and its following book, &quot;Political Liberalism&quot; (1993), will use the conjoined concept &quot;overlapping consensus&quot; rather than secularism. In the latter Rawls holds the idea of an overlapping consensus as one of three main ideas of political liberalism. He argues that the term &quot;secularism&quot; cannot apply; But what is a secular argument? Some think of any argument that is reflective and critical, publicly intelligible and rational, as a secular argument; [...], Nevertheless, a central feature of political liberalism is that it views all such arguments the same way it views religious ones, and therefore these secular philosophical doctrines do not provide public reasons. Secular concepts and reasoning of this kind belong to first philosophy and moral doctrine, and fall outside the domain of the political.Still, Rawl&#x27;s theory is akin to Holyoake&#x27;s vision of a tolerant democracy that treats all life stance groups alike. Rawl&#x27;s idea is that it is in everybody&#x27;s own interest to endorse &quot;a reasonable constitutional democracy&quot; with &quot;principles of toleration&quot;. His work has been highly influential on scholars in political philosophy and his term, &quot;overlapping consensus&quot;, seems to have for many parts replaced &quot;secularism&quot; among them. In textbooks on modern political philosophy, like Colin Farrelly&#x27;s, &quot;An Introduction to Contemporary Political Theory&quot;, and Will Kymlicka&#x27;s, &quot;Contemporary Political Philosophy&quot;, the term secularism is not even indexed and in the former it can be seen only in one footnote. However, there is no shortage of discussion and coverage of the topic it involves. It is just called &quot;overlapping consensus, pluralism&quot;, &quot;multiculturalism&quot; or expressed in some other way. In The &quot;Oxford Handbook of Political Theory&quot;, there is one chapter called &quot;Political secularism&quot;, by Rajeev Bhargava. It covers secularism in a global context, and starts with this sentence: &quot;Secularism is a beleaguered doctrine.&quot;

<text>Silicon is a chemical element; it has the symbol Si and the atomic number 14. It is a hard, brittle crystalline solid with a blue-grey metallic lustre, and is a tetravalent metalloid and semiconductor. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table: carbon is above it; and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium are below it. It is relatively unreactive. Silicon is a significant element that is essential for several physiological and metabolic processes in plants. Silicon is widely regarded as the predominant semiconductor material due to its versatile applications in various electrical devices such as transistors, solar cells, integrated circuits, and others. These may be due to its significant band gap, expansive optical transmission range, extensive absorption spectrum, surface roughening, and effective anti-reflection coating.

Because of its high chemical affinity for oxygen, it was not until 1823 that Jöns Jakob Berzelius was first able to prepare it and characterize it in pure form. Its oxides form a family of anions known as silicates. Its melting and boiling points of 1414 °C and 3265 °C, respectively, are the second highest among all the metalloids and nonmetals, being surpassed only by boron.

Silicon is the eighth most common element in the universe by mass, but very rarely occurs in its pure form in the Earth&#x27;s crust. It is widely distributed throughout space in cosmic dusts, planetoids, and planets as various forms of silicon dioxide (silica) or silicates. More than 90% of the Earth&#x27;s crust is composed of silicate minerals, making silicon the second most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s crust (about 28% by mass), after oxygen.

Most silicon is used commercially without being separated, often with very little processing of the natural minerals. Such use includes industrial construction with clays, silica sand, and stone. Silicates are used in Portland cement for mortar and stucco, and mixed with silica sand and gravel to make concrete for walkways, foundations, and roads. They are also used in whiteware ceramics such as porcelain, and in traditional silicate-based soda–lime glass and many other specialty glasses. Silicon compounds such as silicon carbide are used as abrasives and components of high-strength ceramics. Silicon is the basis of the widely used synthetic polymers called silicones.

The late 20th century to early 21st century has been described as the Silicon Age (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age) because of the large impact that elemental silicon has on the modern world economy. The small portion of very highly purified elemental silicon used in semiconductor electronics (&lt;15%) is essential to the transistors and integrated circuit chips used in most modern technology such as smartphones and other computers. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices, and the semiconductors industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.

Silicon is an essential element in biology. Only traces are required by most animals, but some sea sponges and microorganisms, such as diatoms and radiolaria, secrete skeletal structures made of silica. Silica is deposited in many plant tissues.

==History==
Owing to the abundance of silicon in the Earth&#x27;s crust, natural silicon-based materials have been used for thousands of years. Silicon rock crystals were familiar to various ancient civilizations, such as the predynastic Egyptians who used it for beads and small vases, as well as the ancient Chinese. Glass containing silica was manufactured by the Egyptians since at least 1500 BC, as well as by the ancient Phoenicians. Natural silicate compounds were also used in various types of mortar for construction of early human dwellings.

===Discovery===

In 1787, Antoine Lavoisier suspected that silica might be an oxide of a fundamental chemical element, but the chemical affinity of silicon for oxygen is high enough that he had no means to reduce the oxide and isolate the element. After an attempt to isolate silicon in 1808, Sir Humphry Davy proposed the name &quot;silicium&quot; for silicon, from the Latin , &quot;silicis&quot; for flint, and adding the &quot;-ium&quot; ending because he believed it to be a metal. Most other languages use transliterated forms of Davy&#x27;s name, sometimes adapted to local phonology (e.g. German , Turkish &#x27;, Catalan &#x27;, Armenian or &quot;Silitzioum&quot;). A few others use instead a calque of the Latin root (e.g. Russian , from &quot;flint&quot;; Greek &quot;&quot; from &quot;fire&quot;; Finnish from &quot;flint&quot;, Czech from &quot;quartz&quot;, &quot;flint&quot;).

Gay-Lussac and Thénard are thought to have prepared impure amorphous silicon in 1811, through the heating of recently isolated potassium metal with silicon tetrafluoride, but they did not purify and characterize the product, nor identify it as a new element. Silicon was given its present name in 1817 by Scottish chemist Thomas Thomson. He retained part of Davy&#x27;s name but added &quot;-on&quot; because he believed that silicon was a nonmetal similar to boron and carbon. In 1824, Jöns Jacob Berzelius prepared amorphous silicon using approximately the same method as Gay-Lussac (reducing potassium fluorosilicate with molten potassium metal), but purifying the product to a brown powder by repeatedly washing it. As a result, he is usually given credit for the element&#x27;s discovery. The same year, Berzelius became the first to prepare silicon tetrachloride; silicon tetrafluoride had already been prepared long before in 1771 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele by dissolving silica in hydrofluoric acid. In 1823 for the first time Jacob Berzelius discovered silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4). In 1846 Von Ebelman&#x27;s synthesized tetraethyl orthosilicate (Si(OC2H5)4).
Silicon in its more common crystalline form was not prepared until 31 years later, by Deville. By electrolyzing a mixture of sodium chloride and aluminium chloride containing approximately 10% silicon, he was able to obtain a slightly impure allotrope of silicon in 1854. Later, more cost-effective methods have been developed to isolate several allotrope forms, the most recent being silicene in 2010. Meanwhile, research on the chemistry of silicon continued; Friedrich Wöhler discovered the first volatile hydrides of silicon, synthesising trichlorosilane in 1857 and silane itself in 1858, but a detailed investigation of the silanes was only carried out in the early 20th century by Alfred Stock, despite early speculation on the matter dating as far back as the beginnings of synthetic organic chemistry in the 1830s. Similarly, the first organosilicon compound, tetraethylsilane, was synthesised by Charles Friedel and James Crafts in 1863, but detailed characterisation of organosilicon chemistry was only done in the early 20th century by Frederic Kipping.

Starting in the 1920s, the work of William Lawrence Bragg on X-ray crystallography elucidated the compositions of the silicates, which had previously been known from analytical chemistry but had not yet been understood, together with Linus Pauling&#x27;s development of crystal chemistry and Victor Goldschmidt&#x27;s development of geochemistry. The middle of the 20th century saw the development of the chemistry and industrial use of siloxanes and the growing use of silicone polymers, elastomers, and resins. In the late 20th century, the complexity of the crystal chemistry of silicides was mapped, along with the solid-state physics of doped semiconductors.

===Silicon semiconductors===
The first semiconductor devices did not use silicon, but used galena, including German physicist Ferdinand Braun&#x27;s crystal detector in 1874 and Indian physicist Jagadish Chandra Bose&#x27;s radio crystal detector in 1901. The first silicon semiconductor device was a silicon radio crystal detector, developed by American engineer Greenleaf Whittier Pickard in 1906.

In 1940, Russell Ohl discovered the p–n junction and photovoltaic effects in silicon. In 1941, techniques for producing high-purity germanium and silicon crystals were developed for radar microwave detector crystals during World War II. In 1947, physicist William Shockley theorized a field-effect amplifier made from germanium and silicon, but he failed to build a working device, before eventually working with germanium instead. The first working transistor was a point-contact transistor built by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain later that year while working under Shockley. In 1954, physical chemist Morris Tanenbaum fabricated the first silicon junction transistor at Bell Labs. In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick at Bell Labs accidentally discovered that silicon dioxide () could be grown on silicon. By 1957 Frosch and Derick published their work on the first manufactured semiconductor oxide transistor: the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface.

===Silicon Age===
The &quot;Silicon Age&quot; refers to the late 20th century to early 21st century. This is due to silicon being the dominant material used in electronics and information technology (also known as the Digital Age or Information Age), similar to how the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age were defined by the dominant materials during their respective ages of civilization.

Because silicon is an important element in high-technology semiconductor devices, many places in the world bear its name. For example, the Santa Clara Valley in California acquired the nickname Silicon Valley, as the element is the base material in the semiconductor industry there. Since then, many other places have been similarly dubbed, including Silicon Wadi in Israel; Silicon Forest in Oregon; Silicon Hills in Austin, Texas; Silicon Slopes in Salt Lake City, Utah; Silicon Saxony in Germany; Silicon Valley in India; Silicon Border in Mexicali, Mexico; Silicon Fen in Cambridge, England; Silicon Roundabout in London; Silicon Glen in Scotland; Silicon Gorge in Bristol, England; Silicon Alley in New York City; and Silicon Beach in Los Angeles.

==Characteristics==
===Physical and atomic===

A silicon atom has fourteen electrons. In the ground state, they are arranged in the electron configuration [Ne]3s23p2. Of these, four are valence electrons, occupying the 3s orbital and two of the 3p orbitals. Like the other members of its group, the lighter carbon and the heavier germanium, tin, and lead, it has the same number of valence electrons as valence orbitals: hence, it can complete its octet and obtain the stable noble gas configuration of argon by forming sp3 hybrid orbitals, forming tetrahedral derivatives where the central silicon atom shares an electron pair with each of the four atoms it is bonded to. The first four ionisation energies of silicon are 786.3, 1576.5, 3228.3, and 4354.4 kJ/mol respectively; these figures are high enough to preclude the possibility of simple cationic chemistry for the element. Following periodic trends, its single-bond covalent radius of 117.6 pm is intermediate between those of carbon (77.2 pm) and germanium (122.3 pm). The hexacoordinate ionic radius of silicon may be considered to be 40 pm, although this must be taken as a purely notional figure given the lack of a simple cation in reality.

====Electrical====
At standard temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops as temperature rises. This arises because silicon has a small energy gap (band gap) between its highest occupied energy levels (the valence band) and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between the valence and conduction bands and is the energy at which a state is as likely to be occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is effectively an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, or gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled valence band, creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p–n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p–n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating current that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n–p–n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.

====Crystal structure====

Silicon crystallises in a giant covalent structure at standard conditions, specifically in a diamond cubic crystal lattice (space group 227). It thus has a high melting point of 1414 °C, as a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds and melt the solid. Upon melting silicon contracts as the long-range tetrahedral network of bonds breaks up and the voids in that network are filled in, similar to water ice when hydrogen bonds are broken upon melting. It does not have any thermodynamically stable allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40 gigapascals known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). An allotrope called BC8 (or bc8), having a body-centred cubic lattice with eight atoms per primitive unit cell (space group 206), can be created at high pressure and remains metastable at low pressure. Its properties have been studied in detail.

Silicon boils at 3265 °C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes (3642 °C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of vaporisation than carbon, consistent with the fact that the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.

It is also possible to construct silicene layers analogous to graphene.

===Isotopes===

Naturally occurring silicon is composed of three stable isotopes, 28Si (92.23%), 29Si (4.67%), and 30Si (3.10%). Out of these, only 29Si is of use in NMR and EPR spectroscopy, as it is the only one with a nuclear spin (&quot;I&quot; =). All three are produced in Type Ia supernovae through the oxygen-burning process, with 28Si being made as part of the alpha process and hence the most abundant. The fusion of 28Si with alpha particles by photodisintegration rearrangement in stars is known as the silicon-burning process; it is the last stage of stellar nucleosynthesis before the rapid collapse and violent explosion of the star in question in a type II supernova.

Twenty-two radioisotopes have been characterized, the two stablest being 32Si with a half-life of about 150 years, and 31Si with a half-life of 2.62 hours. All the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than seven seconds, and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than one-tenth of a second. Silicon has one known nuclear isomer, 34mSi, with a half-life less than 210 nanoseconds. 32Si undergoes low-energy beta decay to 32P and then stable 32S. 31Si may be produced by the neutron activation of natural silicon and is thus useful for quantitative analysis; it can be easily detected by its characteristic beta decay to stable 31P, in which the emitted electron carries up to 1.48 MeV of energy.

The known isotopes of silicon range in mass number from 22 to 46. The most common decay mode of the isotopes with mass numbers lower than the three stable isotopes is inverse beta decay, primarily forming aluminium isotopes (13 protons) as decay products. The most common decay mode for the heavier unstable isotopes is beta decay, primarily forming phosphorus isotopes (15 protons) as decay products.

Silicon can enter the oceans through groundwater and riverine transport. Large fluxes of groundwater input have an isotopic composition which is distinct from riverine silicon inputs. Isotopic variations in groundwater and riverine transports contribute to variations in oceanic 30Si values. Currently, there are substantial differences in the isotopic values of deep water in the world&#x27;s ocean basins. Between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, there is a deep water 30Si gradient of greater than 0.3 parts per thousand. 30Si is most commonly associated with productivity in the oceans.

==Chemistry and compounds==

Crystalline bulk silicon is rather inert, but becomes more reactive at high temperatures. Like its neighbour aluminium, silicon forms a thin, continuous surface layer of silicon dioxide () that protects the material beneath from oxidation. Because of this, silicon does not measurably react with the air below 900 °C. Between 950 °C and 1160 °C, the formation rate of the vitreous dioxide rapidly increases, and when 1400 °C is reached, atmospheric nitrogen also reacts to give the nitrides SiN and . Silicon reacts with gaseous sulfur at 600 °C and gaseous phosphorus at 1000 °C. This oxide layer nevertheless does not prevent reaction with the halogens; fluorine attacks silicon vigorously at room temperature, chlorine does so at about 300 °C, and bromine and iodine at about 500 °C. Silicon does not react with most aqueous acids, but is oxidised and complexed by hydrofluoric acid mixtures containing either chlorine or nitric acid to form hexafluorosilicates. It readily dissolves in hot aqueous alkali to form silicates. At high temperatures, silicon also reacts with alkyl halides; this reaction may be catalysed by copper to directly synthesise organosilicon chlorides as precursors to silicone polymers. Upon melting, silicon becomes extremely reactive, alloying with most metals to form silicides, and reducing most metal oxides because the heat of formation of silicon dioxide is so large. In fact, molten silicon reacts virtually with every known kind of crucible material (except its own oxide, ). This happens due to silicon&#x27;s high binding forces for the light elements and to its high dissolving power for most elements. As a result, containers for liquid silicon must be made of refractory, unreactive materials such as zirconium dioxide or group 4, 5, and 6 borides.

Tetrahedral coordination is a major structural motif in silicon chemistry just as it is for carbon chemistry. However, the 3p subshell is rather more diffuse than the 2p subshell and does not hybridise so well with the 3s subshell. As a result, the chemistry of silicon and its heavier congeners shows significant differences from that of carbon, and thus octahedral coordination is also significant. For example, the electronegativity of silicon (1.90) is much less than that of carbon (2.55), because the valence electrons of silicon are further from the nucleus than those of carbon and hence experience smaller electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus. The poor overlap of 3p orbitals also results in a much lower tendency toward catenation (formation of Si–Si bonds) for silicon than for carbon, due to the concomitant weakening of the Si–Si bond compared to the C–C bond: the average Si–Si bond energy is approximately 226 kJ/mol, compared to a value of 356 kJ/mol for the C–C bond. This results in multiply bonded silicon compounds generally being much less stable than their carbon counterparts, an example of the double bond rule. On the other hand, the presence of radial nodes in the 3p orbitals of silicon suggests the possibility of hypervalence, as seen in five and six-coordinate derivatives of silicon such as and . Lastly, because of the increasing energy gap between the valence s and p orbitals as the group is descended, the divalent state grows in importance from carbon to lead, so that a few unstable divalent compounds are known for silicon; this lowering of the main oxidation state, in tandem with increasing atomic radii, results in an increase of metallic character down the group. Silicon already shows some incipient metallic behavior, particularly in the behavior of its oxide compounds and its reaction with acids as well as bases (though this takes some effort), and is hence often referred to as a metalloid rather than a nonmetal. Germanium shows more, and tin is generally considered a metal.

Silicon shows clear differences from carbon. For example, organic chemistry has very few analogies with silicon chemistry, while silicate minerals have a structural complexity unseen in oxocarbons. Silicon tends to resemble germanium far more than it does carbon, and this resemblance is enhanced by the d-block contraction, resulting in the size of the germanium atom being much closer to that of the silicon atom than periodic trends would predict. Nevertheless, there are still some differences because of the growing importance of the divalent state in germanium compared to silicon. Additionally, the lower Ge–O bond strength compared to the Si–O bond strength results in the absence of &quot;germanone&quot; polymers that would be analogous to silicone polymers.

==Occurrence==

Silicon is the eighth most abundant element in the universe, coming after hydrogen, helium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, and neon. These abundances are not replicated well on Earth due to substantial separation of the elements taking place during the formation of the Solar System. Silicon makes up 27.2% of the Earth&#x27;s crust by weight, second only to oxygen at 45.5%, with which it always is associated in nature. Further fractionation took place in the formation of the Earth by planetary differentiation: Earth&#x27;s core, which makes up 31.5% of the mass of the Earth, has approximate composition ; the mantle makes up 68.1% of the Earth&#x27;s mass and is composed mostly of denser oxides and silicates, an example being olivine, ; while the lighter siliceous minerals such as aluminosilicates rise to the surface and form the crust, making up 0.4% of the Earth&#x27;s mass.

The crystallisation of igneous rocks from magma depends on a number of factors; among them are the chemical composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and some properties of the individual minerals to be formed, such as lattice energy, melting point, and complexity of their crystal structure. As magma is cooled, olivine appears first, followed by pyroxene, amphibole, biotite mica, orthoclase feldspar, muscovite mica, quartz, zeolites, and finally, hydrothermal minerals. This sequence shows a trend toward increasingly complex silicate units with cooling, and the introduction of hydroxide and fluoride anions in addition to oxides. Many metals may substitute for silicon. After these igneous rocks undergo weathering, transport, and deposition, sedimentary rocks like clay, shale, and sandstone are formed. Metamorphism also may occur at high temperatures and pressures, creating an even vaster variety of minerals.

There are four sources for silicon fluxes into the ocean: chemical weathering of continental rocks, river transport, dissolution of continental terrigenous silicates, and the reaction between submarine basalts and hydrothermal fluid which release dissolved silicon. All four of these fluxes are interconnected in the ocean&#x27;s biogeochemical cycle as they all were initially formed from the weathering of Earth&#x27;s crust.

Approximately 300–900 megatonnes of aeolian dust is deposited into the world&#x27;s oceans each year. Of that value, 80–240 megatonnes are in the form of particulate silicon. The total amount of particulate silicon deposition into the ocean is still less than the amount of silicon influx into the ocean via riverine transportation. Aeolian inputs of particulate lithogenic silicon into the North Atlantic and Western North Pacific oceans are the result of dust settling on the oceans from the Sahara and Gobi Desert, respectively. Riverine transports are the major source of silicon influx into the ocean in coastal regions, while silicon deposition in the open ocean is greatly influenced by the settling of aeolian dust.

==Production==

Silicon of 96–99% purity is made by carbothermically reducing quartzite or sand with highly pure coke. The reduction is carried out in an electric arc furnace, with an excess of used to stop silicon carbide (SiC) from accumulating:
: + 2 C → Si + 2 CO
:2 SiC + → 3 Si + 2 CO
This reaction, known as carbothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, usually is conducted in the presence of scrap iron with low amounts of phosphorus and sulfur, producing ferrosilicon. Ferrosilicon, an iron-silicon alloy that contains varying ratios of elemental silicon and iron, accounts for about 80% of the world&#x27;s production of elemental silicon, with China, the leading supplier of elemental silicon, providing 4.6 million tonnes (or two-thirds of world output) of silicon, most of it in the form of ferrosilicon. It is followed by Russia (610,000 t), Norway (330,000 t), Brazil (240,000 t), and the United States (170,000 t). Ferrosilicon is primarily used by the iron and steel industry (see below) with primary use as alloying addition in iron or steel and for de-oxidation of steel in integrated steel plants.

Another reaction, sometimes used, is aluminothermal reduction of silicon dioxide, as follows:
:3 + 4 Al → 3 Si + 2 

Leaching powdered 96–97% pure silicon with water results in ~98.5% pure silicon, which is used in the chemical industry. However, even greater purity is needed for semiconductor applications, and this is produced from the reduction of tetrachlorosilane (silicon tetrachloride) or trichlorosilane. The former is made by chlorinating scrap silicon and the latter is a byproduct of silicone production. These compounds are volatile and hence can be purified by repeated fractional distillation, followed by reduction to elemental silicon with very pure zinc metal as the reducing agent. The spongy pieces of silicon thus produced are melted and then grown to form cylindrical single crystals, before being purified by zone refining. Other routes use the thermal decomposition of silane or tetraiodosilane (). Another process used is the reduction of sodium hexafluorosilicate, a common waste product of the phosphate fertilizer industry, by metallic sodium: this is highly exothermic and hence requires no outside energy source. Hyperfine silicon is made at a higher purity than almost any other material: transistor production requires impurity levels in silicon crystals less than 1 part per 1010, and in special cases impurity levels below 1 part per 1012 are needed and attained.

Silicon nanostructures can directly be produced from silica sand using conventional metalothermic processes, or the combustion synthesis approach. Such nanostructured silicon materials can be used in various functional applications including the anode of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), other ion batteries, future computing devices like memristors or photocatalytic applications.

==Applications==
===Compounds===
Most silicon is used industrially without being purified, often with comparatively little processing from its natural form. More than 90% of the Earth&#x27;s crust is composed of silicate minerals, which are compounds of silicon and oxygen, often with metallic ions when negatively charged silicate anions require cations to balance the charge. Many of these have direct commercial uses, such as clays, silica sand, and most kinds of building stone. Thus, the vast majority of uses for silicon are as structural compounds, either as the silicate minerals or silica (crude silicon dioxide). Silicates are used in making Portland cement (made mostly of calcium silicates) which is used in building mortar and modern stucco, but more importantly, combined with silica sand, and gravel (usually containing silicate minerals such as granite), to make the concrete that is the basis of most of the very largest industrial building projects of the modern world.

Silica is used to make fire brick, a type of ceramic. Silicate minerals are also in whiteware ceramics, an important class of products usually containing various types of fired clay minerals (natural aluminium phyllosilicates). An example is porcelain, which is based on the silicate mineral kaolinite. Traditional glass (silica-based soda–lime glass) also functions in many of the same ways, and also is used for windows and containers. In addition, specialty silica based glass fibers are used for optical fiber, as well as to produce fiberglass for structural support and glass wool for thermal insulation.

Silicones often are used in waterproofing treatments, molding compounds, mold-release agents, mechanical seals, high temperature greases and waxes, and caulking compounds. Silicone is also sometimes used in breast implants, contact lenses, explosives and pyrotechnics. Silly Putty was originally made by adding boric acid to silicone oil. Other silicon compounds function as high-technology abrasives and new high-strength ceramics based upon silicon carbide. Silicon is a component of some superalloys.

===Alloys===
Elemental silicon is added to molten cast iron as ferrosilicon or silicocalcium alloys to improve performance in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits for each type of steel, can be more closely controlled. Ferrosilicon production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world&#x27;s use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of transformer steel, modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties.

The properties of silicon may be used to modify alloys with metals other than iron. &quot;Metallurgical grade&quot; silicon is silicon of 95–99% purity. About 55% of the world consumption of metallurgical purity silicon goes for production of aluminium-silicon alloys (silumin alloys) for aluminium part casts, mainly for use in the automotive industry. Silicon&#x27;s importance in aluminium casting is that a significantly high amount (12%) of silicon in aluminium forms a eutectic mixture which solidifies with very little thermal contraction. This greatly reduces tearing and cracks formed from stress as casting alloys cool to solidity. Silicon also significantly improves the hardness and thus wear-resistance of aluminium.

===Electronics===


Most elemental silicon produced remains as a ferrosilicon alloy, and only approximately 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3–1.5 million metric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity. This typically is the &quot;nine-9&quot; or 99.9999999% purity, nearly defect-free single crystalline material.

Monocrystalline silicon of such purity is usually produced by the Czochralski process, and is used to produce silicon wafers used in the semiconductor industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon&#x27;s electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) to be used as a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and other semiconductor devices used in the computer industry and other technical applications. In silicon photonics, silicon may be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light.

In common integrated circuits, a wafer of monocrystalline silicon serves as a mechanical support for the circuits, which are created by doping and insulated from each other by thin layers of silicon oxide, an insulator that is easily produced on Si surfaces by processes of thermal oxidation or local oxidation (LOCOS), which involve exposing the element to oxygen under the proper conditions that can be predicted by the Deal–Grove model. Silicon has become the most popular material for both high power semiconductors and integrated circuits because it can withstand the highest temperatures and greatest electrical activity without suffering avalanche breakdown (an electron avalanche is created when heat produces free electrons and holes, which in turn pass more current, which produces more heat). In addition, the insulating oxide of silicon is not soluble in water, which gives it an advantage over germanium (an element with similar properties which can also be used in semiconductor devices) in certain fabrication techniques.

Monocrystalline silicon is expensive to produce, and is usually justified only in production of integrated circuits, where tiny crystal imperfections can interfere with tiny circuit paths. For other uses, other types of pure silicon may be employed. These include hydrogenated amorphous silicon and upgraded metallurgical-grade silicon (UMG-Si) used in the production of low-cost, large-area electronics in applications such as liquid crystal displays and of large-area, low-cost, thin-film solar cells. Such semiconductor grades of silicon are either slightly less pure or polycrystalline rather than monocrystalline, and are produced in comparable quantities as the monocrystalline silicon: 75,000 to 150,000 metric tons per year. The market for the lesser grade is growing more quickly than for monocrystalline silicon. By 2013, polycrystalline silicon production, used mostly in solar cells, was projected to reach 200,000 metric tons per year, while monocrystalline semiconductor grade silicon was expected to remain less than 50,000 tons per year.

===Quantum dots===
Silicon quantum dots are created through the thermal processing of hydrogen silsesquioxane into nanocrystals ranging from a few nanometers to a few microns, displaying size dependent luminescent properties. The nanocrystals display large Stokes shifts converting photons in the ultraviolet range to photons in the visible or infrared, depending on the particle size, allowing for applications in quantum dot displays and luminescent solar concentrators due to their limited self absorption. A benefit of using silicon based quantum dots over cadmium or indium is the non-toxic, metal-free nature of silicon.
Another application of silicon quantum dots is for sensing of hazardous materials. The sensors take advantage of the luminescent properties of the quantum dots through quenching of the photoluminescence in the presence of the hazardous substance. There are many methods used for hazardous chemical sensing with a few being electron transfer, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and photocurrent generation. Electron transfer quenching occurs when the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is slightly lower in energy than the conduction band of the quantum dot, allowing for the transfer of electrons between the two, preventing recombination of the holes and electrons within the nanocrystals. The effect can also be achieved in reverse with a donor molecule having its highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) slightly higher than a valence band edge of the quantum dot, allowing electrons to transfer between them, filling the holes and preventing recombination. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurs when a complex forms between the quantum dot and a quencher molecule. The complex will continue to absorb light but when the energy is converted to the ground state it does not release a photon, quenching the material. The third method uses different approach by measuring the photocurrent emitted by the quantum dots instead of monitoring the photoluminescent display. If the concentration of the desired chemical increases then the photocurrent given off by the nanocrystals will change in response.

==Biological role==

Although silicon is readily available in the form of silicates, very few organisms use it directly. Diatoms, radiolaria, and siliceous sponges use biogenic silica as a structural material for their skeletons. Some plants accumulate silica in their tissues and require silicon for their growth, for example rice. Silicon may be taken up by plants as orthosilicic acid (also known as monosilicic acid) and transported through the xylem, where it forms amorphous complexes with components of the cell wall. This has been shown to improve cell wall strength and structural integrity in some plants, thereby reducing insect herbivory and pathogenic infections. In certain plants, silicon may also upregulate the production of volatile organic compounds and phytohormones which play a significant role in plant defense mechanisms. In more advanced plants, the silica phytoliths (opal phytoliths) are rigid microscopic bodies occurring in the cell.

Several horticultural crops are known to protect themselves against fungal plant pathogens with silica, to such a degree that fungicide application may fail unless accompanied by sufficient silicon nutrition. Silicaceous plant defense molecules activate some phytoalexins, meaning some of them are signalling substances producing acquired immunity. When deprived, some plants will substitute with increased production of other defensive substances.

Life on Earth is largely composed of carbon, but astrobiology considers that extraterrestrial life may have other hypothetical types of biochemistry. Silicon is considered an alternative to carbon, as it can create complex and stable molecules with four covalent bonds, required for a DNA-analog, and it is available in large quantities.

===Marine microbial influences ===
Diatoms use silicon in the biogenic silica (bSi) form, which is taken up by the silicon transport protein (SIT) to be predominantly used in the cell wall structure as frustules. Silicon enters the ocean in a dissolved form such as silicic acid or silicate. Since diatoms are one of the main users of these forms of silicon, they contribute greatly to the concentration of silicon throughout the ocean. Silicon forms a nutrient-like profile in the ocean due to the diatom productivity in shallow depths. Therefore, concentration of silicon is lower in the shallow ocean and higher in the deep ocean.

Diatom productivity in the upper ocean contributes to the amount of silicon exported to the lower ocean. When diatom cells are lysed in the upper ocean, their nutrients such as iron, zinc, and silicon, are brought to the lower ocean through a process called marine snow. Marine snow involves the downward transfer of particulate organic matter by vertical mixing of dissolved organic matter. It has been suggested that silicon is considered crucial to diatom productivity and as long as there is silicic acid available for diatoms to use, the diatoms can contribute to other important nutrient concentrations in the deep ocean as well.

In coastal zones, diatoms serve as the major phytoplanktonic organisms and greatly contribute to biogenic silica production. In the open ocean, however, diatoms have a reduced role in global annual silica production. Diatoms in North Atlantic and North Pacific subtropical gyres only contribute about 5–7% of global annual marine silica production. The Southern Ocean produces about one-third of global marine biogenic silica. The Southern Ocean is referred to as having a &quot;biogeochemical divide&quot; since only minuscule amounts of silicon are transported out of this region.

===Human nutrition===
There is some evidence that silicon is important to human health for their nail, hair, bone, and skin tissues, for example, in studies that demonstrate that premenopausal women with higher dietary silicon intake have higher bone density, and that silicon supplementation can increase bone volume and density in patients with osteoporosis. Silicon is needed for synthesis of elastin and collagen, of which the aorta contains the greatest quantity in the human body, and has been considered an essential element; nevertheless, it is difficult to prove its essentiality, because silicon is very common, and hence, deficiency symptoms are difficult to reproduce.

Silicon is currently under consideration for elevation to the status of a &quot;plant beneficial substance by the Association of American Plant Food Control Officials (AAPFCO).&quot;

==Safety==
People may be exposed to elemental silicon in the workplace by breathing it in, swallowing it, or having contact with the skin or eye. In the latter two cases, silicon poses a slight hazard as an irritant. It is hazardous if inhaled. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit for silicon exposure in the workplace as 15 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 10 mg/m3 total exposure and 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure over an eight-hour workday. Inhalation of crystalline silica dust may lead to silicosis, an occupational lung disease marked by inflammation and scarring in the form of nodular lesions in the upper lobes of the lungs.

<doc id="27116" wikidata="Q713" url="?curid=27116" title="Scandium">
<text>Scandium is a chemical element with the symbol Sc and atomic number 21. It is a silvery-white metallic d-block element. Historically, it has been classified as a rare-earth element, together with yttrium and the lanthanides. It was discovered in 1879 by spectral analysis of the minerals euxenite and gadolinite from Scandinavia.

Scandium is present in most of the deposits of rare-earth and uranium compounds, but it is extracted from these ores in only a few mines worldwide. Because of the low availability and difficulties in the preparation of metallic scandium, which was first done in 1937, applications for scandium were not developed until the 1970s, when the positive effects of scandium on aluminium alloys were discovered. Its use in such alloys remains its only major application. The global trade of scandium oxide is 15–20 tonnes per year.

The properties of scandium compounds are intermediate between those of aluminium and yttrium. A diagonal relationship exists between the behavior of magnesium and scandium, just as there is between beryllium and aluminium. In the chemical compounds of the elements in group 3, the predominant oxidation state is +3.

==Properties==

===Chemical characteristics===
Scandium is a soft metal with a silvery appearance. It develops a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It is susceptible to weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid () and 48.0% hydrofluoric acid (), possibly due to the formation of an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in the air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium oxide.

===Isotopes===

In nature, scandium is found exclusively as the isotope 45Sc, which has a nuclear spin of ; this is its only stable isotope. 

The known isotopes of scandium range from 37Sc to 62Sc. The most stable radioisotope is 46Sc, which has a half-life of 83.8 days. Others are 47Sc, 3.35 days; the positron emitter 44Sc, 4 hours; and 48Sc, 43.7 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives less than 4 hours, and the majority of them have half-lives less than 2 minutes. 
The low mass isotopes are very difficult to create. The initial detection of 37Sc and 38Sc only resulted in the characterization of their mass excess.
Scandium also has five nuclear isomers: the most stable of these is 44m2Sc (&quot;t&quot;1/2 = 58.6 h).

The primary decay mode of ground-state scandium isotopes at masses lower than the only stable isotope, 45Sc, is electron capture (or positron emission), but the lightest isotopes (37Sc to 39Sc) undergo proton emission instead, all three of these producing calcium isotopes. The primary decay mode at masses above 45Sc is beta emission, producing titanium isotopes.

===Occurrence===
In Earth&#x27;s crust, scandium is not rare. Estimates vary from 18 to 25 ppm, which is comparable to the abundance of cobalt (20–30 ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant element in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun and the 26th most abundant element in the stars. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium oxide.

The stable form of scandium is created in supernovas via the r-process. Also, scandium is created by cosmic ray spallation of the more abundant iron nuclei.
*28Si + 17n → 45Sc (r-process)
*56Fe + p → 45Sc + 11C + n (cosmic ray spallation)

==Production==
The world production of scandium is in the order of 15–20 tonnes per year, in the form of scandium oxide. The demand is slightly higher, and both the production and demand keep increasing. In 2003, only three mines produced scandium: the uranium and iron mines in Zhovti Vody in Ukraine, the rare-earth mines in Bayan Obo, China, and the apatite mines in the Kola Peninsula, Russia. Since then, many other countries have built scandium-producing facilities, including 5 tonnes/year (7.5 tonnes/year ) by Nickel Asia Corporation and Sumitomo Metal Mining in the Philippines. 
In the United States, NioCorp Development hopes to raise $1 billion toward opening a niobium mine at its Elk Creek site in southeast Nebraska, which may be able to produce as much as 95 tonnes of scandium oxide annually. In each case, scandium is a byproduct of the extraction of other elements and is sold as scandium oxide.

To produce metallic scandium, the oxide is converted to scandium fluoride and then reduced with metallic calcium.

Madagascar and the Iveland-Evje region in Norway have the only deposits of minerals with high scandium content, thortveitite ), but these are not being exploited. The mineral kolbeckite has a very high scandium content but is not available in any larger deposits.

The absence of reliable, secure, stable, long-term production has limited the commercial applications of scandium. Despite this low level of use, scandium offers significant benefits. Particularly promising is the strengthening of aluminium alloys with as little as 0.5% scandium. Scandium-stabilized zirconia enjoys a growing market demand for use as a high-efficiency electrolyte in solid oxide fuel cells.

The USGS reports that, from 2015 to 2019 in the US, the price of small quantities of scandium ingot has been $107 to $134 per gram, and that of scandium oxide $4 to $5 per gram.

==Compounds==

Scandium chemistry is almost completely dominated by the trivalent ion, Sc3+. The radii of M3+ ions in the table below indicate that the chemical properties of scandium ions have more in common with yttrium ions than with aluminium ions. In part because of this similarity, scandium is often classified as a lanthanide-like element.

===Oxides and hydroxides===
The oxide  and the hydroxide are amphoteric:
: + 3 → (scandate ion)
: + 3 + 3 → 

α- and γ-ScOOH are isostructural with their aluminium hydroxide oxide counterparts. Solutions of in water are acidic due to hydrolysis.

===Halides and pseudohalides===
The halides , where X= Cl, Br, or I, are very soluble in water, but  is insoluble. In all four halides, the scandium is 6-coordinated. The halides are Lewis acids; for example,  dissolves in a solution containing excess fluoride ion to form . The coordination number 6 is typical for Sc(III). In the larger Y3+ and La3+ ions, coordination numbers of 8 and 9 are common. Scandium triflate is sometimes used as a Lewis acid catalyst in organic chemistry.

===Organic derivatives===

Scandium forms a series of organometallic compounds with cyclopentadienyl ligands (Cp), similar to the behavior of the lanthanides. One example is the chlorine-bridged dimer, and related derivatives of pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands.

=== Uncommon oxidation states ===

Compounds that feature scandium in oxidation states other than +3 are rare but well characterized. The blue-black compound is one of the simplest. This material adopts a sheet-like structure that exhibits extensive bonding between the scandium(II) centers. Scandium hydride is not well understood, although it appears not to be a saline hydride of Sc(II). As is observed for most elements, a diatomic scandium hydride has been observed spectroscopically at high temperatures in the gas phase. Scandium borides and carbides are non-stoichiometric, as is typical for neighboring elements.

Lower oxidation states (+2, +1, 0) have also been observed in organoscandium compounds.

==History==
Dmitri Mendeleev, who is referred to as the father of the periodic table, predicted the existence of an element &quot;ekaboron&quot;, with an atomic mass between 40 and 48 in 1869. Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team detected this element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite in 1879. Nilson prepared 2 grams of scandium oxide of high purity. He named the element scandium, from the Latin &quot;Scandia&quot; meaning &quot;Scandinavia&quot;. Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev&#x27;s prediction, but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev.

Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture of potassium, lithium, and scandium chlorides, at 700–800 °C. The first pound of 99% pure scandium metal was produced in 1960. Production of aluminium alloys began in 1971, following a US patent. Aluminium-scandium alloys were also developed in the USSR.

Laser crystals of gadolinium-scandium-gallium garnet (GSGG) were used in strategic defense applications developed for the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Applications==

===Aluminium alloys===
The main application of scandium by weight is in aluminium-scandium alloys for minor aerospace industry components. These alloys contain between 0.1% and 0.5% of scandium. They were used in Russian military aircraft, specifically the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 and MiG-29.

The addition of scandium to aluminium limits the grain growth in the heat zone of welded aluminium components. This has two beneficial effects: the precipitated forms smaller crystals than in other aluminium alloys, and the volume of precipitate-free zones at the grain boundaries of age-hardening aluminium alloys is reduced. The precipitate is a coherent precipitate that strengthens the aluminum matrix by applying elastic strain fields that inhibit dislocation movement (i.e., plastic deformation). has an equilibrium L12 superlattice structure exclusive to this system. A fine dispersion of nano scale precipitate can be achieved via heat treatment that can also strengthen the alloys through order hardening. Recent developments include the additions of transition metals such as zirconium (Zr) and rare earth metals like erbium (Er) produce shells surrounding the spherical precipitate that reduce coarsening. These shells are dictated by the diffusivity of the alloying element and lower the cost of the alloy due to less Sc being substituted in part by Zr while maintaining stability and less Sc being needed to form the precipitate. These have made somewhat competitive with titanium alloys along with a wide array of applications. However, titanium alloys, which are similar in lightness and strength, are cheaper and much more widely used.

The alloy is as strong as titanium, light as aluminium, and hard as some ceramics.

Some items of sports equipment, which rely on lightweight high-performance materials, have been made with scandium-aluminium alloys, including baseball bats, tent poles and bicycle frames and components. Lacrosse sticks are also made with scandium. The American firearm manufacturing company Smith &amp; Wesson produces semi-automatic pistols and revolvers with frames of scandium alloy and cylinders of titanium or carbon steel.

Since 2013, Apworks GmbH, a spin-off of Airbus, have marketed a high strength Scandium containing aluminium alloy processed using metal 3D-Printing (Laser Powder Bed Fusion) under the trademark Scalmalloy which claims very high strength &amp; ductility.

===Light sources===
The first scandium-based metal-halide lamps were patented by General Electric and made in North America, although they are now produced in all major industrialized countries. Approximately 20 kg of scandium (as ) is used annually in the United States for high-intensity discharge lamps. One type of metal-halide lamp, similar to the mercury-vapor lamp, is made from scandium triiodide and sodium iodide. This lamp is a white-light source with high color rendering index that sufficiently resembles sunlight to allow good color-reproduction with TV cameras. About 80 kg of scandium is used in metal-halide lamps/light bulbs globally per year.

Dentists use erbium-chromium-doped yttrium-scandium-gallium garnet () lasers for cavity preparation and in endodontics.

===Other===
The radioactive isotope 46Sc is used in oil refineries as a tracing agent. Scandium triflate is a catalytic Lewis acid used in organic chemistry.

The 12.4 keV nuclear transition of 45Sc has been studied as a reference for timekeeping applications, with a theoretical precision as much as three orders of magnitude better than the current caesium reference clocks.

Scandium has been proposed for use in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) as a dopant in the electrolyte material, typically zirconia (ZrO₂). Scandium oxide (Sc₂O₃) is one of several possible additives to enhance the ionic conductivity of the zirconia, improving the overall thermal stability, performance and efficiency of the fuel cell. This application would be particularly valuable in clean energy technologies, as SOFCs can utilize a variety of fuels and have high energy conversion efficiencies.

==Health and safety==
Elemental scandium is considered non-toxic, though extensive animal testing of scandium compounds has not been done. The median lethal dose (LD50) levels for scandium chloride for rats have been determined as 755 mg/kg for intraperitoneal and 4 g/kg for oral administration. In the light of these results, compounds of scandium should be handled as compounds of moderate toxicity. Scandium appears to be handled by the body in a manner similar to gallium, with similar hazards involving its poorly soluble hydroxide.

<text>Selenium is a chemical element; it has the symbol Se and atomic number 34. It has various physical appearances, including a brick-red powder, a vitreous black solid, and a grey metallic-looking form. It seldom occurs in this elemental state or as pure ore compounds in Earth&#x27;s crust. Selenium () was discovered in 1817 by , who noted the similarity of the new element to the previously discovered tellurium (named for the Earth).

Selenium is found in metal sulfide ores, where it substitutes for sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly replaced with silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of DC power surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.

Although trace amounts of selenium are necessary for cellular function in many animals, including humans, both elemental selenium and (especially) selenium salts are toxic in even small doses, causing selenosis. Symptoms include (in decreasing order of frequency): diarrhea, fatigue, hair loss, joint pain, nail brittleness or discoloration, nausea, headache, tingling, vomiting, and fever.

Selenium is listed as an ingredient in many multivitamins and other dietary supplements, as well as in infant formula, and is a component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and some plants) as well as in three deiodinase enzymes. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species, with some plants requiring relatively large amounts and others apparently not requiring any.

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===

Selenium forms several allotropes that interconvert with temperature changes, depending somewhat on the rate of temperature change. When prepared in chemical reactions, selenium is usually an amorphous, brick-red powder. When rapidly melted, it forms the black, vitreous form, usually sold commercially as beads. The structure of black selenium is irregular and complex and consists of polymeric rings with up to 1000 atoms per ring. Black selenium is a brittle, lustrous solid that is slightly soluble in CS2. Upon heating, it softens at 50 °C and converts to gray selenium at 180 °C; the transformation temperature is reduced by presence of halogens and amines.

The red α, β, and γ forms are produced from solutions of black selenium by varying the evaporation rate of the solvent (usually CS2). They all have a relatively low, monoclinic crystal symmetry (space group 14) and contain nearly identical puckered cyclooctaselenium (Se8) rings as in sulfur. The eight atoms of a ring are not equivalent (i.e. they are not mapped one onto another by any symmetry operation), and in fact in the γ-monoclinic form, half the rings are in one configuration (and its mirror image) and half in another. The packing is most dense in the α form. In the Se8 rings, the Se–Se distance varies depending on where the pair of atoms is in the ring, but the average is 233.5 pm, and the Se–Se–Se angle is on average 105.7°. Other selenium allotropes may contain Se6 or Se7 rings.

The most stable and dense form of selenium is gray and has a chiral hexagonal crystal lattice (space group 152 or 154 depending on the chirality) consisting of helical polymeric chains, where the Se–Se distance is 237.3 pm and Se–Se–Se angle is 103.1°. The minimum distance between chains is 343.6 pm. Gray selenium is formed by mild heating of other allotropes, by slow cooling of molten selenium, or by condensing selenium vapor just below the melting point. Whereas other selenium forms are insulators, gray selenium is a semiconductor showing appreciable photoconductivity. Unlike the other allotropes, it is insoluble in CS2. It resists oxidation by air and is not attacked by nonoxidizing acids. With strong reducing agents, it forms polyselenides. Selenium does not exhibit the changes in viscosity that sulfur undergoes when gradually heated.

===Isotopes===
Selenium has seven naturally occurring isotopes. Five of these, 74Se, 76Se, 77Se, 78Se, 80Se, are stable, with 80Se being the most abundant (49.6% natural abundance). Also naturally occurring is the long-lived primordial radionuclide 82Se, with a half-life of 8.76×1019 years. The non-primordial radioisotope 79Se also occurs in minute quantities in uranium ores as a product of nuclear fission. Selenium also has numerous unstable synthetic isotopes ranging from 64Se to 95Se; the most stable are 75Se with a half-life of 119.78 days and 72Se with a half-life of 8.4 days. Isotopes lighter than the stable isotopes primarily undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of arsenic, and isotopes heavier than the stable isotopes undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of bromine, with some minor neutron emission branches in the heaviest known isotopes.

==Chemical compounds==

Selenium compounds commonly exist in the oxidation states −2, +2, +4, and +6. It is a nonmetal (more rarely considered a metalloid) with properties that are intermediate between the elements above and below in the periodic table, sulfur and tellurium, and also has similarities to arsenic.

===Chalcogen compounds===

Selenium forms two oxides: selenium dioxide (SeO2) and selenium trioxide (SeO3). Selenium dioxide is formed by combustion of elemental selenium:

It is a polymeric solid that forms monomeric SeO2 molecules in the gas phase. It dissolves in water to form selenous acid, H2SeO3. Selenous acid can also be made directly by oxidizing elemental selenium with nitric acid:
Unlike sulfur, which forms a stable trioxide, selenium trioxide is thermodynamically unstable and decomposes to the dioxide above 185 °C:
Selenium trioxide is produced in the laboratory by the reaction of anhydrous potassium selenate (K2SeO4) and sulfur trioxide (SO3).

Salts of selenous acid are called selenites. These include silver selenite (Ag2SeO3) and sodium selenite (Na2SeO3).

Hydrogen sulfide reacts with aqueous selenous acid to produce selenium disulfide:
Selenium disulfide consists of 8-membered rings. It has an approximate composition of SeS2, with individual rings varying in composition, such as Se4S4 and Se2S6. Selenium disulfide has been used in shampoo as an antidandruff agent, an inhibitor in polymer chemistry, a glass dye, and a reducing agent in fireworks.

Selenium trioxide may be synthesized by dehydrating selenic acid, H2SeO4, which is itself produced by the oxidation of selenium dioxide with hydrogen peroxide:
Hot, concentrated selenic acid reacts with gold to form gold(III) selenate.

===Halogen compounds===
Selenium reacts with fluorine to form selenium hexafluoride:

In comparison with its sulfur counterpart (sulfur hexafluoride), selenium hexafluoride (SeF6) is more reactive and is a toxic pulmonary irritant. Selenium tetrafluoride is a laboratory-scale fluorinating agent.

The only stable chlorides are selenium tetrachloride (SeCl4) and selenium monochloride (Se2Cl2), which might be better known as selenium(I) chloride and is structurally analogous to disulfur dichloride. Metastable solutions of selenium dichloride can be prepared from sulfuryl chloride and selenium (reaction of the elements generates the tetrachloride instead), and constitute an important reagent in the preparation of selenium compounds (e.g. Se7). The corresponding bromides are all known, and recapitulate the same stability and structure as the chlorides.

The iodides of selenium are not well known, and for a long time were believed not to exist. There is limited spectroscopic evidence that the lower iodides may form in bi-elemental solutions with nonpolar solvents, such as carbon disulfide and carbon tetrachloride; but even these appear to decompose under illumination.

Some selenium oxyhalides—seleninyl fluoride (SeOF2) and selenium oxychloride (SeOCl2)—have been used as specialty solvents.

===Metal selenides===

Analogous to the behavior of other chalcogens, selenium forms hydrogen selenide, H2Se. It is a strongly , toxic, and colorless gas. It is more acidic than H2S. In solution it ionizes to HSe−. The selenide dianion Se2− forms a variety of compounds, including the minerals from which selenium is obtained commercially. Illustrative selenides include mercury selenide (HgSe), lead selenide (PbSe), zinc selenide (ZnSe), and copper indium gallium diselenide (Cu(Ga,In)Se2). These materials are semiconductors. With highly electropositive metals, such as aluminium, these selenides are prone to hydrolysis, which may be described by this idealized equation:

Alkali metal selenides react with selenium to form polyselenides, , which exist as chains and rings.

===Other compounds===
Tetraselenium tetranitride, Se4N4, is an explosive orange compound analogous to tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). It can be synthesized by the reaction of selenium tetrachloride (SeCl4) with .

Selenium reacts with cyanides to yield selenocyanates:

===Organoselenium compounds===

Selenium, especially in the II oxidation state, forms a variety of organic derivatives. They are structurally analogous to the corresponding organosulfur compounds. Especially common are selenides (R2Se, analogues of thioethers), diselenides (R2Se2, analogues of disulfides), and selenols (RSeH, analogues of thiols). Representatives of selenides, diselenides, and selenols include respectively selenomethionine, diphenyldiselenide, and benzeneselenol. The sulfoxide in sulfur chemistry is represented in selenium chemistry by the selenoxides (formula RSe(O)R), which are intermediates in organic synthesis, as illustrated by the selenoxide elimination reaction. Consistent with trends indicated by the double bond rule, selenoketones, R(C=Se)R, and selenaldehydes, R(C=Se)H, are rarely observed.

==History==

Selenium (Greek σελήνη &quot;selene&quot; meaning &quot;Moon&quot;) was discovered in 1817 by Jöns Jacob Berzelius and Johan Gottlieb Gahn. Both chemists owned a chemistry plant near Gripsholm, Sweden, producing sulfuric acid by the lead chamber process. Pyrite samples from the Falun Mine produced a red solid precipitate in the lead chambers, which was presumed to be an arsenic compound, so the use of pyrite to make acid was discontinued. Berzelius and Gahn, who wanted to use the pyrite, observed that the red precipitate gave off an odor like horseradish when burned. This smell was not typical of arsenic, but a similar odor was known from tellurium compounds. Hence, Berzelius&#x27;s first letter to Alexander Marcet stated that this was a tellurium compound. However, the lack of tellurium compounds in the Falun Mine minerals eventually led Berzelius to reanalyze the red precipitate, and in 1818 he wrote a second letter to Marcet describing a newly found element similar to sulfur and tellurium. Because of its similarity to tellurium, named for the Earth, Berzelius named the new element after the Moon.

In 1873, Willoughby Smith found that the electrical conductivity of grey selenium was affected by light. This led to its use as a cell for sensing light. The first commercial products using selenium were developed by Werner Siemens in the mid-1870s. The selenium cell was used in the photophone developed by Alexander Graham Bell in 1879. Selenium transmits an electric current proportional to the amount of light falling on its surface. This phenomenon was used in the design of light meters and similar devices. Selenium&#x27;s semiconductor properties found numerous other applications in electronics. The development of selenium rectifiers began during the early 1930s, and these replaced copper oxide rectifiers because they were more efficient. These lasted in commercial applications until the 1970s, following which they were replaced with less expensive and even more efficient silicon rectifiers.

Selenium came to medical notice later because of its toxicity to industrial workers. Selenium was also recognized as an important veterinary toxin, which is seen in animals that have eaten high-selenium plants. In 1954, the first hints of specific biological functions of selenium were discovered in microorganisms by biochemist, Jane Pinsent. It was discovered to be essential for mammalian life in 1957. In the 1970s, it was shown to be present in two independent sets of enzymes. This was followed by the discovery of selenocysteine in proteins. During the 1980s, selenocysteine was shown to be encoded by the codon UGA. The recoding mechanism was worked out first in bacteria and then in mammals (see SECIS element).

==Occurrence==

Native (i.e., elemental) selenium is a rare mineral, which does not usually form good crystals, but, when it does, they are steep rhombohedra or tiny acicular (hair-like) crystals. Isolation of selenium is often complicated by the presence of other compounds and elements.

Selenium occurs naturally in a number of inorganic forms, including selenide, selenate, and selenite, but these minerals are rare. The common mineral selenite is not a selenium mineral, and contains no selenite ion, but is rather a type of gypsum (calcium sulfate hydrate) named like selenium for the moon well before the discovery of selenium. Selenium is most commonly found as an impurity, replacing a small part of the sulfur in sulfide ores of many metals.

In living systems, selenium is found in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.

Certain soils are selenium-rich, and selenium can be bioconcentrated by some plants. In soils, selenium most often occurs in soluble forms such as selenate (analogous to sulfate), which are leached into rivers very easily by runoff. Ocean water contains significant amounts of selenium.

Typical background concentrations of selenium do not exceed 1 ng/m3 in the atmosphere; 1 mg/kg in soil and vegetation and 0.5 μg/L in freshwater and seawater.

Anthropogenic sources of selenium include coal burning, and the mining and smelting of sulfide ores.

==Production==
Selenium is most commonly produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, such as those of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.

Industrial production of selenium usually involves the extraction of selenium dioxide from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium dioxide, which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur dioxide (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.

About 2,000 tonnes of selenium were produced in 2011 worldwide, mostly in Germany (650 t), Japan (630 t), Belgium (200 t), and Russia (140 t), and the total reserves were estimated at 93,000 tonnes. These data exclude two major producers: the United States and China. A previous sharp increase was observed in 2004 from $4–$5 to $27/lb. The price was relatively stable during 2004–2010 at about US$30 per pound (in 100 pound lots) but increased to $65/lb in 2011. The consumption in 2010 was divided as follows: metallurgy – 30%, glass manufacturing – 30%, agriculture – 10%, chemicals and pigments – 10%, and electronics – 10%. China is the dominant consumer of selenium at 1,500–2,000 tonnes/year.

==Applications==

===Manganese electrolysis===
During the electrowinning of manganese, the addition of selenium dioxide decreases the power necessary to operate the electrolysis cells. China is the largest consumer of selenium dioxide for this purpose. For every tonne of manganese, an average 2 kg selenium oxide is used. 

===Glass production===
The largest commercial use of selenium, accounting for about 50% of consumption, is for the production of glass. Selenium compounds confer a red color to glass. This color cancels out the green or yellow tints that arise from iron impurities typical for most glass. For this purpose, various selenite and selenate salts are added. For other applications, a red color may be desired, produced by mixtures of CdSe and CdS.

===Alloys===
Selenium is used with bismuth in brasses to replace more toxic lead. The regulation of lead in drinking water applications such as in the US with the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, made a reduction of lead in brass necessary. The new brass is marketed under the name EnviroBrass. Like lead and sulfur, selenium improves the machinability of steel at concentrations around 0.15%. Selenium produces the same machinability improvement in copper alloys.

===Lithium–selenium batteries===
The lithium–selenium (Li–Se) battery was considered for energy storage in the family of lithium batteries in the 2010s.

===Solar cells===
Selenium was used as the photoabsorbing layer in the first solid-state solar cell, which was demonstrated by the English physicist William Grylls Adams and his student Richard Evans Day in 1876. Only a few years later, Charles Fritts fabricated the first thin-film solar cell, also using selenium as the photoabsorber. However, with the emergence of silicon solar cells in the 1950s, research on selenium thin-film solar cells declined. As a result, the record efficiency of 5.0% demonstrated by Tokio Nakada and Akio Kunioka in 1985 remained unchanged for more than 30 years. In 2017, researchers from IBM achieved a new record efficiency of 6.5% by redesigning the device structure. Following this achievement, selenium has gained renewed interest as a wide bandgap photoabsorber with the potential of being integrated in tandem with lower bandgap photoabsorbers. In 2024, the first selenium-based tandem solar cell was demonstrated, showcasing a selenium top cell monolithically integrated with a silicon bottom cell. However, a significant deficit in the open-circuit voltage is currently the main limiting factor to further improve the efficiency, necessitating defect-engineering strategies for selenium thin-films to enhance the carrier lifetime. As of now, the only defect-engineering strategy that has been investigated for selenium thin-film solar cells involves crystallizing selenium using a laser.

===Photoconductors===
Amorphous selenium (α-Se) thin films have found application as photoconductors in flat-panel X-ray detectors. These detectors use amorphous selenium to capture and convert incident X-ray photons directly into electric charge. Selenium has been chosen for this application among other semiconductors owing to a combination of its favorable technological and physical properties:
# Amorphous selenium has a low melting point, high vapor pressure, and uniform structure. These three properties allow quick and easy deposition of large-area uniform films with a thickness up to 1 mm at a rate of 1–5 μm/min. Their uniformity and lack of grain boundaries, which are intrinsic to polycrystalline materials, improve the X-ray image quality. Meanwhile the large area is essential for scanning the human body or luggage items. 
# Selenium is less toxic than many compound semiconductors that contain arsenic or heavy metals such as mercury or lead.
# The mobility in applied electric field is sufficiently high both for electrons and holes, so that in a typical 0.2 mm thick device, c. 98% of electrons and holes produced by X-rays are collected at the electrodes without being trapped by various defects. Consequently, device sensitivity is high, and its behavior is easy to describe by simple transport equations.

===Rectifiers===
Selenium rectifiers were first used in 1933. They have mostly been replaced by silicon-based devices. One notable exception is in power DC surge protection, where the superior energy capabilities of selenium suppressors make them more desirable than metal-oxide varistors.

===Other uses===
The demand for selenium by the electronics industry is declining. Its photovoltaic and photoconductive properties are still useful in photocopying, photocells, light meters and solar cells. Its use as a photoconductor in plain-paper copiers once was a leading application, but in the 1980s, the photoconductor application declined (although it was still a large end-use) as more and more copiers switched to organic photoconductors.

Zinc selenide was the first material for blue LEDs, but gallium nitride dominates that market. Cadmium selenide was an important component in quantum dots. Sheets of amorphous selenium convert X-ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid-state, flat-panel X-ray cameras. Ionized selenium (Se+24, where 24 of the outer D, S and P orbitals are stripped away due to high input energies) is one of the active mediums used in X-ray lasers. 75Se is used as a gamma source in industrial radiography.

Selenium catalyzes some chemical reactions, but it is not widely used because of issues with toxicity. In X-ray crystallography, incorporation of one or more selenium atoms in place of sulfur helps with multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing.

Selenium is used in the toning of photographic prints, and it is sold as a toner by numerous photographic manufacturers. Selenium intensifies and extends the tonal range of black-and-white photographic images and improves the permanence of prints. Small amounts of organoselenium compounds have been used to modify the catalysts used for the vulcanization for the production of rubber. Selenium is used in some anti-dandruff shampoos in the form of selenium disulfide such as Selsun and Vichy Dereos brands.

==Pollution==
Selenium pollution might impact some aquatic systems and may be caused by anthropogenic factors such as farming runoff and industrial processes. People who eat more fish are generally healthier than those who eat less, which suggests no major human health concern from selenium pollution, although selenium has a potential effect on humans.

Selenium poisoning of water systems may result whenever new agricultural run-off courses through dry lands. This process leaches natural soluble selenium compounds (such as selenates) into the water, which may then be concentrated in wetlands as the water evaporates. Selenium pollution of waterways also occurs when selenium is leached from coal flue ash, mining and metal smelting, crude oil processing, and landfill. High selenium levels in waterways were found to cause congenital disorders in oviparous species, including wetland birds and fish. Elevated dietary methylmercury levels can amplify the harm of selenium toxicity in oviparous species.

Selenium is bioaccumulated in aquatic habitats, which results in higher concentrations in organisms than the surrounding water. Organoselenium compounds can be concentrated over 200,000 times by zooplankton when water concentrations are in the 0.5 to 0.8 μg Se/L range. Inorganic selenium bioaccumulates more readily in phytoplankton than zooplankton. Phytoplankton can concentrate inorganic selenium by a factor of 3000. Further concentration through bioaccumulation occurs along the food chain, as predators consume selenium-rich prey. It is recommended that a water concentration of 2 μg Se/L be considered highly hazardous to sensitive fish and aquatic birds. Selenium poisoning can be passed from parents to offspring through the egg, and selenium poisoning may persist for many generations. Reproduction of mallard ducks is impaired at dietary concentrations of 7 μg Se/L. Many benthic invertebrates can tolerate selenium concentrations up to 300 μg/L of selenium in their diet.

Bioaccumulation of selenium in aquatic environments causes fish kills depending on the species in the affected area. There are, however, a few species that have been seen to survive these events and tolerate the increased selenium. It has also been suggested that the season could have an impact on the harmful effects of selenium on fish. Substantial physiological changes may occur in fish with high tissue concentrations of selenium. Fish affected by selenium may experience swelling of the gill lamellae, which impedes oxygen diffusion across the gills and blood flow within the gills. Respiratory capacity is further reduced due to selenium binding to hemoglobin. Other problems include degeneration of liver tissue, swelling around the heart, damaged egg follicles in ovaries, cataracts, and accumulation of fluid in the body cavity and head. Selenium often causes a malformed fish fetus which may have problems feeding or respiring; distortion of the fins or spine is also common. Adult fish may appear healthy despite their inability to produce viable offspring.

===Examples===
In Belews Lake North Carolina, 19 species of fish were eliminated from the lake due to 150–200 μg Se/L wastewater discharged from 1974 to 1986 from a Duke Energy coal-fired power plant. At the Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge in California, thousands of fish and waterbirds were poisoned by selenium in agricultural irrigation drainage.

==Biological role==
Although it is toxic in large doses, selenium is an essential micronutrient for animals. In plants, it occurs as a bystander mineral, sometimes in toxic proportions in forage (some plants may accumulate selenium as a defense against being eaten by animals, but other plants, such as locoweed, require selenium, and their growth indicates the presence of selenium in soil). The selenium content in the human body is believed to be in the range of 13–20 mg.

Selenium is a component of the unusual amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for reduction of antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase found in animals and some plants (this enzyme occurs in all living organisms, but not all forms of it in plants require selenium).
The glutathione peroxidase family of enzymes (GSH-Px) catalyze reactions that remove reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides.

The thyroid gland and every cell that uses thyroid hormone also use selenium, which is a cofactor for the three of the four known types of thyroid hormone deiodinases, which activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites; the iodothyronine deiodinases are the subfamily of deiodinase enzymes that use selenium as the otherwise rare amino acid selenocysteine.

Increased dietary selenium reduces the effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity include the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. The selenium-containing compound selenoneine is present in the blood of bluefin tuna. Certain plants are considered indicators of high selenium content of the soil because they require high levels of selenium to thrive. The main selenium indicator plants are &quot;Astragalus&quot; species (including some locoweeds), prince&#x27;s plume (&quot;Stanleya&quot; sp.), woody asters (&quot;Xylorhiza&quot; sp.), and false goldenweed (&quot;Oonopsis&quot; sp.).

===Evolution in biology===
From about three billion years ago, prokaryotic selenoprotein families drove the evolution of the amino acid selenocysteine. Several selenoproteins are known in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, invariably owing to the presence of selenocysteine, Just as for mammals, selenoprotein protect unicellular organisms against oxidative damage.

Selenoprotein families of GSH-Px and the deiodinases of eukaryotic cells seem to have a bacterial phylogenetic origin. The selenocysteine-containing form occurs in species as diverse as green algae, diatoms, sea urchins, fish, and chickens.

Trace elements involved in GSH-Px and superoxide dismutase enzymes activities, i.e., selenium, vanadium, magnesium, copper, and zinc, may have been lacking in some terrestrial mineral-deficient areas. Marine organisms retained and sometimes expanded their selenoproteomes, whereas the selenoproteomes of some terrestrial organisms were lowered or completely lost. These findings suggest that, with the exception of vertebrates, aquatic life supports selenium use, whereas terrestrial habitats lead to lowered use of this trace element. Marine fishes and vertebrate thyroid glands have the highest concentration of selenium and iodine. From about 500 million years ago, freshwater and terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of &quot;new&quot; endogenous antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), polyphenols (including flavonoids), tocopherols, etc. A few of these appeared in the last 50–200 million years in fruits and flowers of angiosperm plants. In fact, the angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the late Jurassic period.

About 200 million years ago, new selenoproteins were developed as mammalian GSH-Px enzymes.

===Toxicity===

Although selenium is an essential trace element, it is toxic if taken in excess. Exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 micrograms per day can lead to selenosis. This 400 μg Tolerable Upper Intake Level is based primarily on a 1986 study of five Chinese patients who exhibited overt signs of selenosis and a follow-up study on the same five people in 1992. The 1992 study found the maximum safe dietary selenium intake to be approximately 800 micrograms per day (15 micrograms per kilogram body weight), but suggested 400 micrograms per day to avoid creating an imbalance of nutrients in the diet and to accord with data from other countries. In China, people who ingested corn grown in extremely selenium-rich stony coal (carbonaceous shale) have suffered from selenium toxicity. This coal was shown to have selenium content as high as 9.1%, the highest concentration in coal ever recorded.

Signs and symptoms of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action similar to that of arsenic trioxide and are very toxic. The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.

On 19 April 2009, 21 polo ponies died shortly before a match in the United States Polo Open. Three days later, a pharmacy released a statement explaining that the horses had received an incorrect dose of one of the ingredients used in a vitamin/mineral supplement compound that had been incorrectly prepared by a compounding pharmacy. Analysis of blood levels of inorganic compounds in the supplement indicated the selenium concentrations were 10 to 15 times higher than normal in the blood samples and 15 to 20 times higher than normal in the liver samples. Selenium was later confirmed to be the toxic factor.

In fish and other wildlife, selenium is necessary for life but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal selenium concentration is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight. Much below that level, young salmon die from deficiency; much above, they die from toxic excess.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for selenium in the workplace at 0.2 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a Recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 1 mg/m3, selenium is immediately dangerous to life and health.

==== Detection in biological fluids ====
Selenium may be measured in blood, plasma, serum, or urine to monitor excessive environmental or occupational exposure, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized victims, or to investigate a suspected case of fatal overdose. Some analytical techniques can distinguish organic from inorganic forms of the element. Both organic and inorganic forms of selenium are largely converted to monosaccharide conjugates (selenosugars) in the body before elimination in the urine. Cancer patients receiving daily oral doses of selenothionine may achieve very high plasma and urine selenium concentrations.

===Deficiency===

Selenium deficiency can occur in patients with severely compromised intestinal function, those undergoing total parenteral nutrition, and in those of advanced age (over 90). Also, people dependent on food grown from selenium-deficient soil are at risk. Although New Zealand soil has low levels of selenium, the residents have not detected adverse health effects.

Selenium deficiency, defined by low (&lt;60% of normal) selenoenzyme activity levels in brain and endocrine tissues, occurs only when a low selenium level is linked with additional stress, such as high exposures to mercury or increased oxidant stress from vitamin E deficiency.

Selenium interacts with other nutrients, such as iodine and vitamin E. The effect of selenium deficiency on health remains uncertain, particularly concerning Kashin–Beck disease. Also, selenium interacts with other minerals, such as zinc and copper. High doses of selenium supplements in pregnant animals might disturb the zinc:copper ratio and lead to zinc reduction; in such treatment cases, zinc levels should be monitored. Further studies are needed to confirm these interactions.

In the regions (e.g., regions within North America) where low selenium soil levels lead to low concentrations in the plants, some animal species may be deficient unless selenium is supplemented with diet or injection. Ruminants are particularly susceptible. In general, absorption of dietary selenium is lower in ruminants than in other animals and is lower in forages than in grain. Ruminants grazing certain forages, e.g., some white clover varieties containing cyanogenic glycosides, may have higher selenium requirements, presumably because cyanide is released from the aglycone by glucosidase activity in the rumen and glutathione peroxidases are deactivated by the cyanide acting on the glutathione moiety. Neonate ruminants at risk of white muscle disease may be administered both selenium and vitamin E by injection; some of the WMD myopathies respond only to selenium, some only to vitamin E, and some to either.

==== Nutritional sources of selenium ====
Dietary selenium comes from meat, nuts, cereals, and mushrooms. Brazil nuts are the richest dietary source (though this is soil-dependent since the Brazil nut does not require high levels of the element for its own needs).

The US Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of selenium for teenagers and adults is 55 μg/day. Selenium as a dietary supplement is available in many forms, including multi-vitamins/mineral supplements, which typically contain 55 or 70 μg/serving. Selenium-specific supplements typically contain either 100 or 200 μg/serving. In June 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published its final rule establishing a requirement for minimum and maximum levels of selenium in infant formula.

===General health effects===

The effects of selenium intake on cancer have been studied in several clinical trials and epidemiologic studies in humans. Selenium may have a chemo-preventive role in cancer risk as an anti-oxidant, and it might trigger the immune response. At low levels, it is used in the body to create anti-oxidant selenoproteins, at higher doses than normal it causes cell death.

Selenium (in close interrelation with iodine) plays a role in thyroid health. Selenium is a cofactor for the three thyroid hormone deiodinases, helping activate and then deactivate various thyroid hormones and their metabolites. Isolated selenium deficiency is now being investigated for its role in the induction of autoimmune reactions in the thyroid gland in Hashimoto&#x27;s disease. In a case of combined iodine and selenium deficiency was shown to play a thyroid-protecting role.

<doc id="27118" wikidata="Q938" url="?curid=27118" title="Strontium">
<text>Strontium is a chemical element; it has symbol Sr and atomic number 38. An alkaline earth metal, it is a soft silver-white yellowish metallic element that is highly chemically reactive. The metal forms a dark oxide layer when it is exposed to air. Strontium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of its two vertical neighbors in the periodic table, calcium and barium. It occurs naturally mainly in the minerals celestine and strontianite, and is mostly mined from these.

Both strontium and strontianite are named after Strontian, a village in Scotland near which the mineral was discovered in 1790 by Adair Crawford and William Cruickshank; it was identified as a new element the next year from its crimson-red flame test color. Strontium was first isolated as a metal in 1808 by Humphry Davy using the then newly discovered process of electrolysis. During the 19th century, strontium was mostly used in the production of sugar from sugar beets (see strontian process). At the peak of production of television cathode-ray tubes, as much as 75% of strontium consumption in the United States was used for the faceplate glass. With the replacement of cathode-ray tubes with other display methods, consumption of strontium has dramatically declined.

While natural strontium (which is mostly the isotope strontium-88) is stable, the synthetic strontium-90 is radioactive and is one of the most dangerous components of nuclear fallout, as strontium is absorbed by the body in a similar manner to calcium. Natural stable strontium, on the other hand, is not hazardous to health.

==Characteristics==
Strontium is a divalent silvery metal with a pale yellow tint whose properties are mostly intermediate between and similar to those of its group neighbors calcium and barium. It is softer than calcium and harder than barium. Its melting (777 °C) and boiling (1377 °C) points are lower than those of calcium (842 °C and 1484 °C respectively); barium continues this downward trend in the melting point (727 °C), but not in the boiling point (1900 °C). The density of strontium (2.64 g/cm3) is similarly intermediate between those of calcium (1.54 g/cm3) and barium (3.594 g/cm3). Three allotropes of metallic strontium exist, with transition points at 235 and 540 °C.

The standard electrode potential for the Sr2+/Sr couple is −2.89 V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (−2.84 V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92 V) couples, and close to those of the neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380 °C, at room temperature it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though it is not as strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.

Due to the large size of the heavy s-block elements, including strontium, a vast range of coordination numbers is known, from 2, 3, or 4 all the way to 22 or 24 in SrCd11 and SrZn13. The Sr2+ ion is quite large, so that high coordination numbers are the rule. The large size of strontium and barium plays a significant part in stabilising strontium complexes with polydentate macrocyclic ligands such as crown ethers: for example, while 18-crown-6 forms relatively weak complexes with calcium and the alkali metals, its strontium and barium complexes are much stronger.

Organostrontium compounds contain one or more strontium–carbon bonds. They have been reported as intermediates in Barbier-type reactions. Although strontium is in the same group as magnesium, and organomagnesium compounds are very commonly used throughout chemistry, organostrontium compounds are not similarly widespread because they are more difficult to make and more reactive. Organostrontium compounds tend to be more similar to organoeuropium or organosamarium compounds due to the similar ionic radii of these elements (Sr2+ 118 pm; Eu2+ 117 pm; Sm2+ 122 pm). Most of these compounds can only be prepared at low temperatures; bulky ligands tend to favor stability. For example, strontium dicyclopentadienyl, Sr(C5H5)2, must be made by directly reacting strontium metal with mercurocene or cyclopentadiene itself; replacing the C5H5 ligand with the bulkier C5(CH3)5 ligand on the other hand increases the compound&#x27;s solubility, volatility, and kinetic stability.

Because of its extreme reactivity with oxygen and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, such as in the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. Volatile strontium salts impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution of solvated electrons.

===Isotopes===
Natural strontium is a mixture of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. On these isotopes, 88Sr is the most abundant, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. This is the basis of rubidium–strontium dating. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6 days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium&#x27;s chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90 years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000 km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for about 5% of the 90Sr which was in the reactor core.

==History==
Strontium is named after the Scottish village of Strontian (), where it was discovered in the ores of the lead mines.

In 1790, Adair Crawford, a physician engaged in the preparation of barium, and his colleague William Cruickshank, recognised that the Strontian ores exhibited properties that differed from those in other &quot;heavy spars&quot; sources. This allowed Crawford to conclude on page 355 &quot;... it is probable indeed, that the scotch mineral is a new species of earth which has not hitherto been sufficiently examined.&quot; The physician and mineral collector Friedrich Gabriel Sulzer analysed together with Johann Friedrich Blumenbach the mineral from Strontian and named it strontianite. He also came to the conclusion that it was distinct from the witherite and contained a new earth (neue Grunderde). In 1793 Thomas Charles Hope, a professor of chemistry at the University of Glasgow studied the mineral and proposed the name &quot;strontites&quot;. He confirmed the earlier work of Crawford and recounted: &quot;... Considering it a peculiar earth I thought it necessary to give it an name. I have called it Strontites, from the place it was found; a mode of derivation in my opinion, fully as proper as any quality it may possess, which is the present fashion.&quot; The element was eventually isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 by the electrolysis of a mixture containing strontium chloride and mercuric oxide, and announced by him in a lecture to the Royal Society on 30 June 1808. In keeping with the naming of the other alkaline earths, he changed the name to &quot;strontium&quot;.

The first large-scale application of strontium was in the production of sugar from sugar beet. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849 the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German sugar industry used the process well into the 20th century. Before World War I the beet sugar industry used 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year. The strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process, but the demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of strontianite in the Münsterland. The mining of strontianite in Germany ended when mining of the celestine deposits in Gloucestershire started. These mines supplied most of the world strontium supply from 1884 to 1941. Although the celestine deposits in the Granada basin were known for some time the large scale mining did not start before the 1950s.

During atmospheric nuclear weapons testing, it was observed that strontium-90 is one of the nuclear fission products with a relatively high yield. The similarity to calcium and the chance that the strontium-90 might become enriched in bones made research on the metabolism of strontium an important topic.

==Occurrence==

Strontium commonly occurs in nature, being the 15th most abundant element on Earth (its heavier congener barium being the 14th), estimated to average approximately 360 parts per million in the Earth&#x27;s crust and is found chiefly as the sulfate mineral celestine (SrSO4) and the carbonate strontianite (SrCO3). Of the two, celestine occurs much more frequently in deposits of sufficient size for mining. Because strontium is used most often in the carbonate form, strontianite would be the more useful of the two common minerals, but few deposits have been discovered that are suitable for development. Because of the way it reacts with air and water, strontium only exists in nature when combined to form minerals. Naturally occurring strontium is stable, but its synthetic isotope Sr-90 is only produced by nuclear fallout.

In groundwater strontium behaves chemically much like calcium. At intermediate to acidic pH Sr2+ is the dominant strontium species. In the presence of calcium ions, strontium commonly forms coprecipitates with calcium minerals such as calcite and anhydrite at an increased pH. At intermediate to acidic pH, dissolved strontium is bound to soil particles by cation exchange.

The mean strontium content of ocean water is 8 mg/L. At a concentration between 82 and 90 μmol/L of strontium, the concentration is considerably lower than the calcium concentration, which is normally between 9.6 and 11.6 mmol/L. It is nevertheless much higher than that of barium, 13 μg/L.

==Production==
The major producers of strontium as celestine as of January 2024 are Spain (200,000 t), Iran (200,000 t), China (80,000 t), Mexico (35,000 t); and Argentina (700 t). Although strontium deposits occur widely in the United States, they have not been mined since 1959.

A large proportion of mined celestine (SrSO4) is converted to the carbonate by two processes. Either the celestine is directly leached with sodium carbonate solution or the celestine is roasted with coal to form the sulfide. The second stage produces a dark-coloured material containing mostly strontium sulfide. This so-called &quot;black ash&quot; is dissolved in water and filtered. Strontium carbonate is precipitated from the strontium sulfide solution by introduction of carbon dioxide. The sulfate is reduced to the sulfide by the carbothermic reduction:

:SrSO4 + 2 C → SrS + 2 CO2

About 300,000 tons are processed in this way annually.

The metal is produced commercially by reducing strontium oxide with aluminium. The strontium is distilled from the mixture. Strontium metal can also be prepared on a small scale by electrolysis of a solution of strontium chloride in molten potassium chloride:

:Sr2+ + 2 → Sr
:2 Cl− → Cl2 + 2 

==Applications==
Consuming 75% of production, the primary use for strontium was in glass for colour television cathode-ray tubes, where it prevented X-ray emission. This application for strontium has been declining because CRTs are being replaced by other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to the interaction of the X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.

Because strontium is so similar to calcium, it is incorporated in the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.

87Sr/86Sr ratios are commonly used to determine the likely provenance areas of sediment in natural systems, especially in marine and fluvial environments. Dasch (1969) showed that surface sediments of Atlantic displayed 87Sr/86Sr ratios that could be regarded as bulk averages of the 87Sr/86Sr ratios of geological terrains from adjacent landmasses. A good example of a fluvial-marine system to which Sr isotope provenance studies have been successfully employed is the River Nile-Mediterranean system. Due to the differing ages of the rocks that constitute the majority of the Blue and White Nile, catchment areas of the changing provenance of sediment reaching the River Nile Delta and East Mediterranean Sea can be discerned through strontium isotopic studies. Such changes are climatically controlled in the Late Quaternary.

More recently, 87Sr/86Sr ratios have also been used to determine the source of ancient archaeological materials such as timbers and corn in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. 87Sr/86Sr ratios in teeth may also be used to track animal migrations.

Strontium aluminate is frequently used in glow in the dark toys, as it is chemically and biologically inert.

Strontium carbonate and other strontium salts are added to fireworks to give a deep red colour. This same effect identifies strontium cations in the flame test. Fireworks consume about 5% of the world&#x27;s production. Strontium carbonate is used in the manufacturing of hard ferrite magnets.

Strontium chloride is sometimes used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total strontium chloride hexahydrate by weight. Small amounts are used in the refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a limited use as a getter, to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may also be used for this purpose.

The ultra-narrow optical transition between the [Kr]5s2 1S0 electronic ground state and the metastable [Kr]5s5p 3P0 excited state of 87Sr is one of the leading candidates for the future re-definition of the second in terms of an optical transition as opposed to the current definition derived from a microwave transition between different hyperfine ground states of 133Cs. Current optical atomic clocks operating on this transition already surpass the precision and accuracy of the current definition of the second.

===Radioactive strontium===
89Sr is the active ingredient in Metastron, a radiopharmaceutical used for bone pain secondary to metastatic bone cancer. The strontium is processed like calcium by the body, preferentially incorporating it into bone at sites of increased osteogenesis. This localization focuses the radiation exposure on the cancerous lesion.

90Sr has been used as a power source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). 90Sr produces approximately 0.93 watts of heat per gram (it is lower for the form of 90Sr used in RTGs, which is strontium fluoride). However, 90Sr has one third the lifetime and a lower density than 238Pu, another RTG fuel. The main advantage of 90Sr is that it is significantly cheaper than 238Pu and is found in nuclear waste. The latter must be prepared by irradiating 237Np with neutrons then separating the modest amounts of 238Pu. The principal disadvantage of 90Sr is the high energy beta particles produce Bremsstrahlung as they encounter nuclei of other nearby heavy atoms such as adjacent strontium. This is mostly in the range of X-rays. Thus strong beta emitters also emit significant secondary X-rays in most cases. This requires significant shielding measures which complicates the design of RTGs using 90Sr. The Soviet Union deployed nearly 1000 of these RTGs on its northern coast as a power source for lighthouses and meteorology stations.

==Biological role==
Acantharea, a relatively large group of marine radiolarian protozoa, produce intricate mineral skeletons composed of strontium sulfate. In biological systems, calcium is substituted to a small extent by strontium. In the human body, most of the absorbed strontium is deposited in the bones. The ratio of strontium to calcium in human bones is between 1:1000 and 1:2000, roughly in the same range as in the blood serum.

=== Effect on the human body ===
The human body absorbs strontium as if it were its lighter congener calcium. Because the elements are chemically very similar, stable strontium isotopes do not pose a significant health threat. The average human has an intake of about two milligrams of strontium a day. In adults, strontium consumed tends to attach only to the surface of bones, but in children, strontium can replace calcium in the mineral of the growing bones and thus lead to bone growth problems.

The biological half-life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1,000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years. The wide-ranging published biological half-life figures are explained by strontium&#x27;s complex metabolism within the body. However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life is estimated to be about 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected by age and sex, due to differences in bone metabolism.

The drug strontium ranelate aids bone growth, increases bone density, and lessens the incidence of vertebral, peripheral, and hip fractures. However, strontium ranelate also increases the risk of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. Its use is therefore now restricted. Its beneficial effects are also questionable, since the increased bone density is partially caused by the increased density of strontium over the calcium which it replaces. Strontium also bioaccumulates in the body. Despite restrictions on strontium ranelate, strontium is still contained in some supplements. There is not much scientific evidence on risks of strontium chloride when taken by mouth. Those with a personal or family history of blood clotting disorders are advised to avoid strontium.

Strontium has been shown to inhibit sensory irritation when applied topically to the skin. Topically applied, strontium has been shown to accelerate the recovery rate of the epidermal permeability barrier (skin barrier).

== Nuclear waste ==
Strontium-90 is a radioactive fission product produced by nuclear reactors used in nuclear power. It is a major component of high level radioactivity of nuclear waste and spent nuclear fuel. Its 29-year half life is short enough that its decay heat has been used to power arctic lighthouses, but long enough that it can take hundreds of years to decay to safe levels. Exposure from contaminated water and food may increase the risk of leukemia, bone cancer and primary hyperparathyroidism.

=== Remediation ===
Algae has shown selectivity for strontium in studies, where most plants used in bioremediation have not shown selectivity between calcium and strontium, often becoming saturated with calcium, which is greater in quantity and also present in nuclear waste.

Researchers have looked at the bioaccumulation of strontium by &quot;Scenedesmus spinosus&quot; (algae) in simulated wastewater. The study claims a highly selective biosorption capacity for strontium of &quot;S. spinosus&quot;, suggesting that it may be appropriate for use in treating nuclear wastewater.

A study of the pond alga &quot;Closterium moniliferum&quot; using non-radioactive strontium found that varying the ratio of barium to strontium in water improved strontium selectivity.
