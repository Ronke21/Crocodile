<text>A road is a thoroughfare for the conveyance of traffic that mostly has an improved surface for use by vehicles (motorized and non-motorized) and pedestrians. Unlike streets, whose primary function is to serve as public spaces, the main function of roads is transportation.

There are many types of roads, including parkways, avenues, controlled-access highways (freeways, motorways, and expressways), tollways, interstates, highways, thoroughfares, and local roads.

The primary features of roads include lanes, sidewalks (pavement), roadways (carriageways), medians, shoulders, verges, bike paths (cycle paths), and shared-use paths.

==Definitions==
Historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or some maintenance.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines a road as &quot;a line of communication (travelled way) using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips open to public traffic, primarily for the use of road motor vehicles running on their own wheels&quot;, which includes &quot;bridges, tunnels, supporting structures, junctions, crossings, interchanges, and toll roads, but not cycle paths&quot;.

The Eurostat, ITF and UNECE &quot;Glossary for Transport Statistics Illustrated&quot; defines a road as a &quot;Line of communication (traveled way) open to public traffic, primarily for the use of road motor vehicles, using a stabilized base other than rails or air strips. [...] Included are paved roads and other roads with a stabilized base, e.g. gravel roads. Roads also cover streets, bridges, tunnels, supporting structures, junctions, crossings and interchanges. Toll roads are also included. Excluded are dedicated cycle lanes.&quot;

The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic defines a road as the entire surface of any way or street open to public traffic.

In urban areas roads may diverge through a city or village and be named as streets, serving a dual function as urban space easement and route. Modern roads are normally smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel.

===Australia===

Part 2, Division 1, clauses 11–13 of the National Transport Commission Regulations 2006 defines a road in Australia as &#x27;an area that is open to or used by the public and is developed for, or has as one of its main uses, the driving or riding of motor vehicles.&#x27;

Further, it defines a shoulder (typical an area of the road outside the edge line, or the curb) and a road-related area which includes green areas separating roads, areas designated for cyclists and areas generally accessible to the public for driving, riding or parking vehicles.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the definition of a road is broad in common law where the statutory definition includes areas the public has access to, by right or not. Beaches, publicly accessible car parks and yards (even if privately owned), river beds, road shoulders (verges), wharves and bridges are included. However, the definition of a road for insurance purposes may be restricted to reduce risk.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom &quot;The Highway Code&quot; details rules for &quot;road users&quot;, but there is some ambiguity between the terms &quot;highway&quot; and &quot;road&quot;. For the purposes of the English law, Highways Act 1980, which covers England and Wales but not Scotland or Northern Ireland, road is &quot;any length of highway or of any other road to which the public has access, and includes bridges over which a road passes&quot;. This includes footpaths, bridleways and cycle tracks, and also road and driveways on private land and many car parks. Vehicle Excise Duty, a road use tax, is payable on some vehicles used on the public road.

The definition of a road depends on the definition of a highway; there is no formal definition for a highway in the relevant Act. A 1984 ruling said &quot;the land over which a public right of way exists is known as a highway; and although most highways have been made up into roads, and most easements of way exist over footpaths, the presence or absence of a made road has nothing to do with the distinction. Another legal view is that while a highway historically included footpaths, bridleways, driftways, etc., it can now be used to mean those ways that allow the movement of motor vehicles, and the term &quot;rights of way&quot; can be used to cover the wider usage.

===United States===
In the United States, laws distinguish between &quot;public roads&quot;, which are open to public use, and &quot;private roads&quot;, which are privately controlled.

==History==


The assertion that the first pathways were the trails made by animals has not been universally accepted; in many cases animals do not follow constant paths. Some believe that some roads originated from following animal trails. The Icknield Way may exemplify this type of road origination, where human and animal both selected the same natural line. By about 10,000 BC human travelers used rough roads/pathways.
* The world&#x27;s oldest known paved road was constructed in Egypt some time between 2600 and 2200 BC.
* Corduroy roads (log roads) are found dating to 4000 BC in Glastonbury, England.
* The Sweet Track, a timber track causeway in England, is one of the oldest engineered roads discovered and the oldest timber trackway discovered in Northern Europe. Built in winter 3807 BC or spring 3806 BC, (tree-ring dating – dendrochronology – enabled very precise dating). It was claimed to be the oldest road in the world until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in Plumstead, London.
* In 500 BC, Darius I the Great started an extensive road system for the Achaemenid Empire (Persia), including the Royal Road, which was one of the finest highways of its time, connecting Sardis (the westernmost major city of the empire) to Susa. The road remained in use after Roman times. These road systems reached as far east as Bactria and India.
* In ancient times, transport by river was far easier and faster than transport by road, especially considering the cost of road construction and the difference in carrying capacity between carts and river barges. A hybrid of road transport and ship transport beginning in about 1740 is the horse-drawn boat in which the horse follows a cleared path along the river bank.
* From about 312 BC, the Roman Empire built straight strong stone Roman roads throughout Europe and North Africa, in support of its military campaigns. At its peak the Roman Empire was connected by 29 major roads moving out from Rome and covering 78,000 kilometers or 52,964 Roman miles of paved roads.
* In the 8th century AD, many roads were built throughout the Arab Empire. The most sophisticated roads were those in Baghdad, which were paved with tar. Tar was derived from petroleum, accessed from oil fields in the region, through the chemical process of destructive distillation.
* The Highways Act 1555 in Britain transferred responsibility for maintaining roads from government to local parishes. This resulted in a poor and variable state of roads. To remedy this, the first of the turnpike trusts was established around 1706, to build good roads and collect tolls from passing vehicles. Eventually there were approximately 1,100 trusts in Britain and some of engineered roads. The Rebecca Riots in Carmarthenshire and Rhayader from 1839 to 1844 contributed to a Royal Commission that led to the demise of the system in 1844, which coincided with the development of the UK railway system.
* In the late-19th century roading engineers began to cater for cyclists by building separate lanes alongside roadways.
* From the beginning of the 20th century, roads were increasingly built for tourism and also to create jobs. A typical example of the stimulation of tourism is the Great Dolomite Road, while the creation of the panoramic coastal road Strada Costiera between Duino and Barcola, Italy, in 1928 was very much focused on creating jobs.
* The &quot;Autostrada dei Laghi&quot; (&quot;Lakes Motorway&quot;) in Italy, the first controlled-access highway built in the world, connecting Milan to Lake Como and Lake Maggiore, and now parts of the A8 and A9 motorways, was devised by Piero Puricelli and was inaugurated in 1924. This motorway, called &quot;autostrada&quot;, contained only one lane in each direction and no interchanges.

==Construction==

In transport engineering, subgrade is the native material underneath a constructed road.
Road construction requires the creation of an engineered continuous right-of-way or roadbed, overcoming geographic obstacles and having grades low enough to permit vehicle or foot travel, and may be required to meet standards set by law or official guidelines. The process is often begun with the removal of earth and rock by digging or blasting, construction of embankments, bridges and tunnels, and removal of vegetation (this may involve deforestation) and followed by the laying of pavement material. A variety of road building equipment is employed in road building.

After design, approval, planning, legal, and environmental considerations have been addressed alignment of the road is set out by a surveyor. The radii and gradient are designed and staked out to best suit the natural ground levels and minimize the amount of cut and fill. Great care is taken to preserve reference Benchmarks

Roads are designed and built for primary use by vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Storm drainage and environmental considerations are a major concern. Erosion and sediment controls are constructed to prevent detrimental effects. Drainage lines are laid with sealed joints in the road easement with runoff coefficients and characteristics adequate for the land zoning and storm water system. Drainage systems must be capable of carrying the ultimate design flow from the upstream catchment with approval for the outfall from the appropriate authority to a watercourse, creek, river or the sea for drainage discharge.

A borrow pit (source for obtaining fill, gravel, and rock) and a water source should be located near or in reasonable distance to the road construction site. Approval from local authorities may be required to draw water or for working (crushing and screening) of materials for construction needs. The topsoil and vegetation is removed from the borrow pit and stockpiled for subsequent rehabilitation of the extraction area. Side slopes in the excavation area not steeper than one vertical to two horizontal for safety reasons.
Old road surfaces, fences, and buildings may need to be removed before construction can begin. Trees in the road construction area may be marked for retention. These protected trees should not have the topsoil within the area of the tree&#x27;s drip line removed and the area should be kept clear of construction material and equipment. Compensation or replacement may be required if a protected tree is damaged. Much of the vegetation may be mulched and put aside for use during reinstatement. The topsoil is usually stripped and stockpiled nearby for rehabilitation of newly constructed embankments along the road. Stumps and roots are removed and holes filled as required before the earthwork begins. Final rehabilitation after road construction is completed will include seeding, planting, watering and other activities to reinstate the area to be consistent with the untouched surrounding areas.

Processes during earthwork include excavation, removal of material to spoil, filling, compacting, construction and trimming. If rock or other unsuitable material is discovered it is removed, moisture content is managed and replaced with standard fill compacted to meet the design requirements (generally 90–95% relative compaction). Blasting is not frequently used to excavate the roadbed as the intact rock structure forms an ideal road base. When a depression must be filled to come up to the road grade the native bed is compacted after the topsoil has been removed. The fill is made by the &quot;compacted layer method&quot; where a layer of fill is spread then compacted to specifications, under saturated conditions. The process is repeated until the desired grade is reached.

General fill material should be free of organics, meet minimum California bearing ratio (CBR) results and have a low plasticity index. The lower fill generally comprises sand or a sand-rich mixture with fine gravel, which acts as an inhibitor to the growth of plants or other vegetable matter. The compacted fill also serves as lower-stratum drainage. Select second fill (sieved) should be composed of gravel, decomposed rock or broken rock below a specified particle size and be free of large lumps of clay. Sand clay fill may also be used. The roadbed must be &quot;proof rolled&quot; after each layer of fill is compacted. If a roller passes over an area without creating visible deformation or spring the section is deemed to comply.

Geosynthetics such as geotextiles, geogrids, and geocells are frequently used in the various pavement layers to improve road quality. These materials and methods are used in low-traffic private roadways as well as public roads and highways. Geosynthetics perform four main functions in roads: separation, reinforcement, filtration, and drainage; which increase the pavement performance, reduce construction costs and decrease maintenance.

The completed roadway is finished by paving or left with a gravel or other natural surface. The type of road surface is dependent on economic factors and expected usage. Safety improvements such as traffic signs, crash barriers, raised pavement markers and other forms of road surface marking are installed.

According to a May 2009 report by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and TRIP – a national transportation research organization – driving on rough roads costs the average American motorist approximately $400 a year in extra vehicle operating costs. Drivers living in urban areas with populations more than 250,000 are paying upwards of $750 more annually because of accelerated vehicle deterioration, increased maintenance, additional fuel consumption, and tire wear caused by poor road conditions.

When a single carriageway road is converted into dual carriageway by building a second separate carriageway alongside the first, it is usually referred to as &quot;duplication&quot;, &quot;twinning&quot; or &quot;doubling&quot;. The original carriageway is changed from two-way to become one-way, while the new carriageway is one-way in the opposite direction. In the same way as converting railway lines from single track to double track, the new carriageway is not always constructed directly alongside the existing carriageway.

==Reallocation==

Roads that are intended for use by a particular mode of transport can be reallocated for another mode of transport, i.e. by using traffic signs. For instance, in the ongoing road space reallocation effort, some roads (particularly in city centers) which are intended for use by cars are increasingly being repurposed for cycling and/or walking.

==Maintenance==
Like all structures, roads deteriorate over time. Deterioration is primarily due to environmental effects such as frost heaves, thermal cracking and oxidation often contribute, however accumulated damage from vehicles also contributes. According to a series of experiments carried out in the late 1950s, called the AASHO Road Test, it was empirically determined that the effective damage done to the road is roughly proportional to the fourth power of axle weight. A typical tractor-trailer weighing 80,000 pounds (36.287 t) with 8,000 pounds (3.629 t) on the steer axle and 36,000 pounds (16.329 t) on both of the tandem axle groups is expected to do 7,800 times more damage than a passenger vehicle with 2,000 pounds (0.907 t) on each axle. Potholes on roads are caused by rain damage and vehicle braking or related construction work.

Pavements are designed for an expected service life or design life. In some parts of the United Kingdom the standard design life is 40 years for new bitumen and concrete pavement. Maintenance is considered in the whole life cost of the road with service at 10, 20 and 30-year milestones. Roads can be and are designed for a variety of lives (8-, 15-, 30-, and 60-year designs). When pavement lasts longer than its intended life, it may have been overbuilt, and the original costs may have been too high. When a pavement fails before its intended design life, the owner may have excessive repair and rehabilitation costs. Some asphalt pavements are designed as perpetual pavements with an expected structural life in excess of 50 years.

Many asphalt pavements built over 35 years ago, despite not being specifically designed as a perpetual pavement, have remained in good condition long past their design life. Many concrete pavements built since the 1950s have significantly outlived their intended design lives. Some roads like Chicago&#x27;s Wacker Drive, a major two-level (and at one point, three-level) roadway in the downtown area, are being rebuilt with a designed service life of 100 years.

Virtually all roads require some form of maintenance before they come to the end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. Software algorithms use this data to recommend maintenance or new construction.

Maintenance treatments for asphalt concrete generally include thin asphalt overlays, crack sealing, surface rejuvenating, fog sealing, micro milling or diamond grinding and surface treatments. Thin surfacing preserves, protects and improves the functional condition of the road while reducing the need for routing maintenance, leading to extended service life without increasing structural capacity.

Older concrete pavements that develop faults can be repaired with a dowel bar retrofit, in which slots are cut in the pavement at each joint, and dowel bars are placed in the slots, which are then filled with concrete patching material. This can extend the life of the concrete pavement for 15 years.

Failure to maintain roads properly can create significant costs to society. A 2009 report released by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimated that about 50% of the roads in the US are in bad condition, with urban areas worse. The report estimates that urban drivers pay an average of $746/year on vehicle repairs while the average US motorist pays about $335/year. In contrast, the average motorist pays about $171/year in road maintenance taxes (based on 600 gallons/year and $0.285/gallon tax).

===Slab stabilization===
Distress and serviceability loss on concrete roads can be caused by loss of support due to voids beneath the concrete pavement slabs. The voids usually occur near cracks or joints due to surface water infiltration. The most common causes of voids are pumping, consolidation, subgrade failure and bridge approach failure. Slab stabilization is a non-destructive method of solving this problem and is usually employed with other concrete pavement restoration methods including patching and diamond grinding. The technique restores support to concrete slabs by filing small voids that develop underneath the concrete slab at joints, cracks or the pavement edge.

The process consists of pumping a cementitious grout or polyurethane mixture through holes drilled through the slab. The grout can fill small voids beneath the slab and/or sub-base. The grout also displaces free water and helps keep water from saturating and weakening support under the joints and slab edge after stabilization is complete. The three steps for this method after finding the voids are locating and drilling holes, grout injection and post-testing the stabilized slabs.

Slab stabilization does not correct depressions, increase the design structural capacity, stop erosion or eliminate faulting. It does, however, restore the slab support, therefore, decreasing deflections under the load. Stabilization should only be performed at joints and cracks where the loss of support exists. Visual inspection is the simplest manner to find voids. Signs that repair is needed are transverse joint faulting, corner breaks and shoulder drop off and lines at or near joints and cracks. Deflection testing is another common procedure used to locate voids. It is recommended to do this testing at night as during cooler temperatures, joints open, aggregate interlock diminishes and load deflections are at their highest.

===Testing===
Ground penetrating radar pulses electromagnetic waves into the pavement and measures and graphically displays the reflected signal. This can reveal voids and other defects.

The epoxy/core test, detects voids by visual and mechanical methods. It consists of drilling a 25 to 50 millimeter hole through the pavement into the sub-base with a dry-bit roto-hammer. Next, a two-part epoxy is poured into the hole – dyed for visual clarity. Once the epoxy hardens, technicians drill through the hole. If a void is present, the epoxy will stick to the core and provide physical evidence.

Common stabilization materials include pozzolan-cement grout and polyurethane. The requirements for slab stabilization are strength and the ability to flow into or expand to fill small voids. Colloidal mixing equipment is necessary to use the pozzolan-cement grouts. The contractor must place the grout using a positive-displacement injection pump or a non-pulsing progressive cavity pump. A drill is also necessary but it must produce a clean hole with no surface spalling or breakouts. The injection devices must include a grout packer capable of sealing the hole. The injection device must also have a return hose or a fast-control reverse switch, in case workers detect slab movement on the uplift gauge. The uplift beam helps to monitor the slab deflection and has to have sensitive dial gauges.

===Joint sealing===
Also called joint and crack repair, this method&#x27;s purpose is to minimize infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the joint system. Joint sealants are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in concrete pavement restoration techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.

==Safety considerations==

Careful design and construction of roads can increase road traffic safety and reduce the harm (deaths, injuries, and property damage) on the highway system from traffic collisions.

On neighborhood roads traffic calming, safety barriers, pedestrian crossings and cycle lanes can help protect pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.

Lane markers in some countries and states are marked with Cat&#x27;s eyes or Botts dots. Botts dots are not used where it is icy in the winter, because frost and snowplows can break the glue that holds them to the road, although they can be embedded in short, shallow trenches carved in the roadway, as is done in the mountainous regions of California.

For major roads risk can be reduced by providing limited access from properties and local roads, grade separated junctions and median dividers between opposite-direction traffic to reduce the likelihood of head-on collisions.

The placement of energy attenuation devices (e.g. guardrails, wide grassy areas, sand barrels) is also common. Some road fixtures such as road signs and fire hydrants are designed to collapse on impact. Light poles are designed to break at the base rather than violently stop a car that hits them. Highway authorities may also remove larger trees from the immediate vicinity of the road. During heavy rains, if the elevation of the road surface is not higher than the surrounding landscape, it may result in flooding.

Speed limits can improve road traffic safety and reduce the number of road traffic casualties from traffic collisions. In their &quot;World report on road traffic injury prevention&quot; report, the World Health Organization (WHO) identify speed control as one of various interventions likely to contribute to a reduction in road casualties.

==Road conditions==

Road conditions are the collection of factors describing the ease of driving on a particular stretch of road, or on the roads of a particular locality, including the quality of the pavement surface, potholes, road markings, and weather. It has been reported that &quot;[p]roblems of transportation participants and road conditions are the main factors that lead to road traffic accidents&quot;. It has further been specifically noted that &quot;weather conditions and road conditions are interlinked as weather conditions affect the road conditions&quot;. Specific aspects of road conditions can be of particular importance for particular purposes. For example, for autonomous vehicles such as self-driving cars, significant road conditions can include &quot;shadowing and lighting changes, road surface texture changes, and road markings consisting of circular reflectors, dashed lines, and solid lines&quot;.

Various government agencies and private entities, including local news services, track and report on road conditions to the public so that drivers going through a particular area can be aware of hazards that may exist in that area. News agencies, in turn, rely on tips from area residents with respect to certain aspects of road conditions in their coverage area.

==Environmental performance==
Careful design and construction of a road can reduce any negative environmental impacts.
Water management systems can be used to reduce the effect of pollutants from roads. Rainwater and snowmelt running off of roads tends to pick up gasoline, motor oil, heavy metals, trash and other pollutants and result in water pollution. Road runoff is a major source of nickel, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are created as combustion byproducts of gasoline and other fossil fuels.

De-icing chemicals and sand can run off into roadsides, contaminate groundwater and pollute surface waters; and road salts can be toxic to sensitive plants and animals. Sand applied to icy roads can be ground up by traffic into fine particulates and contribute to air pollution.

Roads are a chief source of noise pollution. In the early 1970s, it was recognized that design of roads can be conducted to influence and minimize noise generation. Noise barriers can reduce noise pollution near built-up areas. Regulations can restrict the use of engine braking.

Motor vehicle emissions contribute air pollution. Concentrations of air pollutants and adverse respiratory health effects are greater near the road than at some distance away from the road. Road dust kicked up by vehicles may trigger allergic reactions. In addition, on-road transportation greenhouse gas emissions are the largest single cause of climate change, scientists say.

==Regulation==
===Right- and left-hand traffic===
Traffic flows on the right or on the left side of the road depending on the country. In countries where traffic flows on the right, traffic signs are mostly on the right side of the road, roundabouts and traffic circles go counter-clockwise/anti-clockwise, and pedestrians crossing a two-way road should watch out for traffic from the left first. In countries where traffic flows on the left, the reverse is true.

About 33% of the world by population drive on the left, and 67% keep right. By road distances, about 28% drive on the left, and 72% on the right, even though originally most traffic drove on the left worldwide.

==Economics==
Transport economics is used to understand both the relationship between the transport system and the wider economy and the complex effects of the road network structure when there are multiple paths and competing modes for both personal and freight (road/rail/air/ferry) and where induced demand can result in increased on decreased transport levels when road provision is increased by building new roads or decreased (for example California State Route 480). Roads are generally built and maintained by the public sector using taxation although implementation may be through private contractors). or occasionally using road tolls.

Public-private partnerships are a way for communities to address the rising cost by injecting private funds into the infrastructure. There are four main ones:
* design/build
* design/build/operate/maintain
* design/build/finance/operate
* build/own/operate

Society depends heavily on efficient roads. In the European Union (EU) 44% of all goods are moved by trucks over roads and 85% of all people are transported by cars, buses or coaches on roads. The term was also commonly used to refer to roadsteads, waterways that lent themselves to use by shipping.

===Construction costs===
According to the New York State Thruway Authority, some sample per-mile costs to construct multi-lane roads in several US northeastern states were:
* Connecticut Turnpike – $3,449,000 per mile
* New Jersey Turnpike – $2,200,000 per mile
* Pennsylvania Turnpike (Delaware Extension) – $1,970,000 per mile
* Northern Indiana Toll Road – $1,790,000 per mile
* Garden State Parkway – $1,720,000 per mile
* Massachusetts Turnpike – $1,600,000 per mile
* Thruway, New York to Pennsylvania Line – $1,547,000 per mile
* Ohio Turnpike – $1,352,000 per mile
* Pennsylvania Turnpike (early construction) – $736,000 per mile

==Statistics==
The United States has the largest network of roads of any country with as of 2009. The Republic of India has the second-largest road system globally with of road (2013). The People&#x27;s Republic of China is third with of road (2007). The Federative Republic of Brazil has the fourth-largest road system in the world with (2002). See List of countries by road network size. When looking only at expressways, the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) in China has a total length of at the end of 2006, and 60,300 km at the end of 2008, second only to the United States with in 2005. However, as of 2017, China has 130,000 km of Expressways.

==Global connectivity==

Eurasia, Africa, North America, South America, and Australia each have an extensive road network that connects most cities.
The North and South American road networks are separated by the Darién Gap, the only interruption in the Pan-American Highway. Eurasia and Africa are connected by roads on the Sinai Peninsula. The European Peninsula is connected to the Scandinavian Peninsula by the Øresund Bridge, and both have many connections to the mainland of Eurasia, including the bridges over the Bosphorus. Antarctica has very few roads and no continent-bridging network, though there are a few ice roads between bases, such as the South Pole Traverse. Bahrain is the only island country to be connected to a continental network by road (the King Fahd Causeway to Saudi Arabia).

Even well-connected road networks are controlled by many different legal jurisdictions, and laws such as which side of the road to drive on vary accordingly.

Many populated domestic islands are connected to the mainland by bridges. A very long example is the Overseas Highway connecting many of the Florida Keys with the continental United States.

Even on mainlands, some settlements have no roads connecting with the primary continental network, due to natural obstacles like mountains or wetlands, or high cost compared to the population served. Unpaved roads or lack of roads are more common in developing countries, and these can become impassible in wet conditions. As of 2014, only 43% of rural Africans have access to an all-season road. Due to steepness, mud, snow, or fords, roads can sometimes be passable only to four-wheel drive vehicles, those with snow chains or snow tires, or those capable of deep wading or amphibious operation.

Most disconnected settlements have local road networks connecting ports, buildings, and other points of interest.

Where demand for travel by road vehicle to a disconnected island or mainland settlement is high, roll-on/roll-off ferries are commonly available if the journey is relatively short. For long-distance trips, passengers usually travel by air and rent a car upon arrival. If facilities are available, vehicles and cargo can also be shipped to many disconnected settlements by boat, or air transport at much greater expense. The island of Great Britain is connected to the European road network by Eurotunnel Shuttle – an example of a car shuttle train which is a service used in other parts of Europe to travel under mountains and over wetlands.

In polar areas, disconnected settlements are often more easily reached by snowmobile or dogsled in cold weather, which can produce sea ice that blocks ports, and bad weather that prevents flying. For example, resupply aircraft are only flown to Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station October to February, and many residents of coastal Alaska have bulk cargo shipped in only during the warmer months. Permanent darkness during the winter can also make long-distance travel more dangerous in polar areas. Continental road networks do reach into these areas, such as the Dalton Highway to the North Slope of Alaska, the R21 highway to Murmansk in Russia, and many roads in Scandinavia (though due to fjords water transport is sometimes faster). Large areas of Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia are sparsely connected. For example, all 25 communities of Nunavut are disconnected from each other and the main North American road network.

Road transport of people and cargo by may also be obstructed by border controls and travel restrictions. For example, travel from other parts of Asia to South Korea would require passage through the hostile country of North Korea. Moving between most countries in Africa and Eurasia would require passing through Egypt and Israel, which is a politically sensitive area.

Some places are intentionally car-free, and roads (if present) might be used by bicycles or pedestrians.

Roads are under construction to many remote places, such as the villages of the Annapurna Circuit, and a road was completed in 2013 to Mêdog County. Additional intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links have been proposed, including a Bering Strait crossing that would connect Eurasia-Africa and North America, a Malacca Strait Bridge to the largest island of Indonesia from Asia, and a Strait of Gibraltar crossing to connect Europe and Africa directly.

<text>Roman roads ( ; singular: ; meaning &quot;Roman way&quot;) were physical infrastructure vital to the maintenance and development of the Roman state, built from about 300 BC through the expansion and consolidation of the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. They provided efficient means for the overland movement of armies, officials, civilians, inland carriage of official communications, and trade goods. Roman roads were of several kinds, ranging from small local roads to broad, long-distance highways built to connect cities, major towns and military bases. These major roads were often stone-paved and metaled, cambered for drainage, and were flanked by footpaths, bridleways and drainage ditches. They were laid along accurately surveyed courses, and some were cut through hills or conducted over rivers and ravines on bridgework. Sections could be supported over marshy ground on rafted or piled foundations.

At the peak of Rome&#x27;s development, no fewer than 29 great military highways radiated from the capital, and the empire&#x27;s 113 provinces were interconnected by 372 great roads. The whole comprised more than of roads, of which over were stone-paved. In Gaul alone, no less than of roadways are said to have been improved, and in Britain at least . The courses (and sometimes the surfaces) of many Roman roads survived for millennia; some are overlaid by modern roads.

==Roman systems==
Livy mentions some of the most familiar roads near Rome, and the milestones on them, at times long before the first paved road—the Appian Way. Unless these allusions are just simple anachronisms, the roads referred to were probably at the time little more than levelled earthen tracks. Thus, the Via Gabiana (during the time of Porsena) is mentioned in about 500 BC; the Via Latina (during the time of Gaius Marcius Coriolanus) in about 490 BC; the Via Nomentana (also known as &quot;Via Ficulensis&quot;), in 449 BC; the Via Labicana in 421 BC; and the Via Salaria in 361 BC.

In the Itinerary of Antoninus, the description of the road system is as follows:

With the exception of some outlying portions, such as Britain north of the Wall, Dacia, and certain provinces east of the Euphrates, the whole Empire was penetrated by these &quot;itinera&quot; (plural of &quot;iter&quot;). There is hardly a district to which we might expect a Roman official to be sent, on service either civil or military, where we do not find roads. They reach the Wall in Britain; run along the Rhine, the Danube, and the Euphrates; and cover, as with a network, the interior provinces of the Empire.
A road map of the empire reveals that it was generally laced with a dense network of prepared &quot;viae&quot;. Beyond its borders there were no paved roads; however, it can be supposed that footpaths and dirt roads allowed some transport. There were, for instance, some pre-Roman ancient trackways in Britain, such as the Ridgeway and the Icknield Way.

==Laws and traditions==
 The Laws of the Twelve Tables, dated to about 450 BC, required that any public road (Latin &quot;via&quot;) be 8 Roman feet (perhaps about 2.37 m) wide where straight and twice that width where curved. These were probably the minimum widths for a &quot;via&quot;; in the later republic, widths of around 12 Roman feet were common for public roads in rural regions, permitting the passing of two carts of standard (4 foot) width without interference to pedestrian traffic. Actual practices varied from this standard. The Tables command Romans to build public roads and give wayfarers the right to pass over private land where the road is in disrepair. Building roads that would not need frequent repair therefore became an ideological objective, as well as building them as straight as practicable to construct the shortest possible roads, and thus save on material.

Roman law defined the right to use a road as a &quot;servitus&quot;, or liability. The &quot;ius eundi&quot; (&quot;right of going&quot;) established a claim to use an &quot;iter&quot;, or footpath, across private land; the &quot;ius agendi&quot; (&quot;right of driving&quot;), an &quot;actus&quot;, or carriage track. A &quot;via&quot; combined both types of &quot;servitutes&quot;, provided it was of the proper width, which was determined by an &quot;arbiter&quot;. The default width was the &quot;latitudo legitima&quot; of 8 feet. Roman law and tradition forbade the use of vehicles in urban areas, except in certain cases. Married women and government officials on business could ride. The &quot;Lex Julia Municipalis&quot; restricted commercial carts to night-time access in the city within the walls and within a mile outside the walls.

==Types==

Roman roads varied from simple corduroy roads to paved roads using deep roadbeds of tamped rubble as an underlying layer to ensure that they kept dry, as the water would flow out from between the stones and fragments of rubble instead of becoming mud in clay soils. According to Ulpian, there were three types of roads:
#&quot;Viae publicae, consulares, praetoriae&quot; or &quot;militares&quot;
#&quot;Viae privatae, rusticae, glareae&quot; or &quot;agrariae&quot;
#&quot;Viae vicinales&quot;

===&quot;Viae publicae, consulares, praetoriae&quot; and &quot;militares&quot;===

The first type of road included public high or main roads, constructed and maintained at the public expense, and with their soil vested in the state. Such roads led either to the sea, to a town, to a public river (one with a constant flow), or to another public road. Siculus Flaccus, who lived under Trajan (98–117), calls them &quot;viae publicae regalesque&quot;, and describes their characteristics as follows:
# They are placed under &quot;curatores&quot; (commissioners), and repaired by &quot;redemptores&quot; (contractors) at the public expense; a fixed contribution, however, being levied from the neighboring landowners.
# These roads bear the names of their constructors (e.g. Via Appia, Cassia, Flaminia).

Roman roads were named after the censor who had ordered their construction or reconstruction. The same person often served afterwards as consul, but the road name is dated to his term as censor. If the road was older than the office of censor or was of unknown origin, it was named for its destination or the region through which it mainly passed. A road was renamed if the censor ordered major work on it, such as paving, repaving, or rerouting. With the term &quot;viae regales&quot; compare the roads of the Persian kings (who probably organized the first system of public roads) and the King&#x27;s Highway. With the term &quot;viae militariae&quot; compare the Icknield Way (&quot;Icen-hilde-weg&quot;, or &quot;War-way of the Iceni&quot;).

There were many other people, besides special officials, who from time to time and for a variety of reasons sought to connect their names with a great public service like that of the roads. Gaius Gracchus, when Tribune of the People (123–122 BC), paved or gravelled many of the public roads and provided them with milestones and mounting-blocks for riders. Gaius Scribonius Curio, when Tribune (50 BC), sought popularity by introducing a Lex Viaria, under which he was to be chief inspector or commissioner for five years. Dio Cassius mentions that the Second Triumvirate obliged the Senators to repair the public roads at their own expense.

===&quot;Viae privatae, rusticae, glareae&quot; and &quot;agrariae&quot;===
The second category included private or country roads, originally constructed by private individuals, in whom their soil was vested and who had the power to dedicate them to the public use. Such roads benefited from a right of way in favor either of the public or of the owner of a particular estate. Under the heading of &quot;viae privatae&quot; were also included roads leading from the public or high roads to particular estates or settlements; Ulpian considers these to be public roads.

Features off the &quot;via&quot; were connected to the &quot;via&quot; by &quot;viae rusticae&quot;, or secondary roads. Both main or secondary roads might either be paved or left unpaved with a gravel surface, as they were in North Africa. These prepared but unpaved roads were &quot;viae glareae&quot; or &quot;sternendae&quot; (&quot;to be strewn&quot;). Beyond the secondary roads were the &quot;viae terrenae&quot;, &quot;dirt roads&quot;.

===&quot;Viae vicinales&quot;===
The third category comprised roads at or in villages, districts, or , leading through or towards a &quot;vicus&quot; or village. Such roads ran either into a high road or into other &quot;viae vicinales&quot;, without any direct communication with a high road. They were considered public or private, according to the fact of their original construction out of public or private funds or materials. Such a road, though privately constructed, became a public road when the memory of its private constructors had perished.

Siculus Flaccus describes &quot;viae vicinales&quot; as roads &quot;de publicis quae divertunt in agros et saepe ad alteras publicas perveniunt&quot; (which turn off the public roads into fields, and often reach to other public roads). The repairing authorities, in this case, were the &quot;magistri pagorum&quot; or magistrates of the cantons. They could require the neighboring landowners either to furnish laborers for the general repair of the &quot;viae vicinales&quot;, or to keep in repair, at their own expense, a certain length of road passing through their respective properties.

===Governance and financing===
With the conquest of Italy, prepared &quot;viae&quot; were extended from Rome and its vicinity to outlying municipalities, sometimes overlying earlier roads. Building &quot;viae&quot; was a military responsibility and thus came under the jurisdiction of a consul. The process had a military name, &quot;viam munire&quot;, as though the &quot;via&quot; were a fortification. Municipalities, however, were responsible for their own roads, which the Romans called &quot;viae vicinales&quot;. Roads were not free to use; tolls abounded, especially at bridges. Often they were collected at the city gate. Freight costs were made heavier still by import and export taxes. These were only the charges for using the roads. Costs of services on the journey went up from there.

Financing road building was a Roman government responsibility. Maintenance, however, was generally left to the province. The officials tasked with fund-raising were the &quot;curatores viarum&quot;. They had a number of methods available to them. Private citizens with an interest in the road could be asked to contribute to its repair. High officials might distribute largesse to be used for roads. Censors, who were in charge of public morals and public works, were expected to fund repairs &quot;suâ pecuniâ&quot; (with their own money). Beyond those means, taxes were required.

A &quot;via&quot; connected two cities. &quot;Viae&quot; were generally centrally placed in the countryside. The construction and care of the public roads, whether in Rome, in Italy, or in the provinces, was, at all periods of Roman history, considered to be a function of the greatest weight and importance. This is clearly shown by the fact that the censors, in some respects the most venerable of Roman magistrates, had the earliest paramount authority to construct and repair all roads and streets. Indeed, all the various functionaries, including emperors, who succeeded the censors in this portion of their duties, may be said to have exercised a devolved censorial jurisdiction.

===Costs and civic responsibilities===
The devolution to the censorial jurisdictions became a practical necessity, resulting from the growth of the Roman dominions and the diverse labors which detained the censors in the capital city. Certain &quot;ad hoc&quot; official bodies successively acted as constructing and repairing authorities. In Italy, the censorial responsibility passed to the commanders of the Roman armies and later to special commissioners, and in some cases perhaps to the local magistrates. In the provinces, the consul or praetor and his legates received authority to deal directly with the contractor.

The care of the streets and roads within the Roman territory was committed in the earliest times to the censors. They eventually made contracts for paving the street inside Rome, including the Clivus Capitolinus, with lava, and for laying down the roads outside the city with gravel. Sidewalks were also provided. The aediles, probably by virtue of their responsibility for the freedom of traffic and policing the streets, co-operated with the censors and the bodies that succeeded them.

It would seem that in the reign of Claudius the quaestors had become responsible for the paving of the streets of Rome or at least shared that responsibility with the &quot;quattuorviri viarum&quot;. It has been suggested that the quaestors were obliged to buy their right to an official career by personal outlay on the streets. There was certainly no lack of precedents for this enforced liberality, and the change made by Claudius may have been a mere change in the nature of the expenditure imposed on the quaestors.

===Official bodies===
The official bodies which first succeeded the censors in the care of the streets and roads were:
# &quot;Quattuorviri viis in urbe purgandis&quot;, with jurisdiction inside the walls of Rome;
# &quot;Duoviri viis extra urbem purgandis&quot;, with jurisdiction outside the walls.
Both these bodies were probably of ancient origin. The first mention of either body occurs in the &quot;Lex Julia Municipalis&quot; in 45 BC. The quattuorviri were afterwards called &quot;quattuorviri viarum curandarum&quot;. The extent of jurisdiction of the duoviri is derived from their full title as &quot;duoviri viis extra propiusve urbem Romam passus mille purgandis&quot;. Their authority extended over all roads between their respective gates of issue in the city wall and the first milestone beyond.

In case of an emergency in the condition of a particular road, men of influence and liberality were appointed, or voluntarily acted, as &quot;curatores&quot; or temporary commissioners to superintend the work of repair. The dignity attached to such a curatorship is attested by a passage of Cicero. Among those who performed this duty in connection with particular roads was Julius Caesar, who became &quot;curator&quot; (67 BC) of the Via Appia and spent his own money liberally upon it. Certain persons appear also to have acted alone and taken responsibility for certain roads.

In the country districts, the magistri pagorum had authority to maintain the &quot;viae vicinales&quot;. In Rome each householder was legally responsible for the repairs to that portion of the street which passed his own house; it was the duty of the aediles to enforce this responsibility. The portion of any street which passed a temple or public building was repaired by the aediles at the public expense. When a street passed between a public building or temple and a private house, the public treasury and the private owner shared the expense equally. 

===Changes under Augustus===
The governing structure was changed by Augustus, who in the course of his reconstitution of the urban administration, both abolished and created new offices in connection with the maintenance of public works, streets, and aqueducts in and around Rome. The task of maintaining the roads had previously been administered by two groups of minor magistrates, the &quot;quattuorviri&quot; (a board of four magistrates to oversee the roads inside the city) and the &quot;duoviri&quot; (a board of two to oversee the roads outside the city proper) who were both part of the &quot;collegia&quot; known as the &quot;vigintisexviri&quot; (literally meaning &quot;Twenty-Six Men&quot;).

Augustus, finding the &quot;collegia&quot; ineffective, especially the boards dealing with road maintenance, reduced the number of magistrates from 26 to 20. Augustus abolished the &quot;duoviri&quot; and later granted the position as superintendent (according to Dio Cassius) of the road system connecting Rome to the rest of Italy and provinces beyond. In this capacity he had effectively given himself and any following emperors a paramount authority which had originally belonged to the city censors. The &quot;quattuorviri&quot; board was kept as it was until at least the reign of Hadrian (117 to 138 AD). Furthermore, he appointed praetorians to the offices of &quot;road-maker&quot; and assigning each one with two lictors, making the office of curator of each of the great public roads a perpetual magistracy rather than a temporary commission.

The persons appointed under the new system were of senatorial or equestrian rank, depending on the relative importance of the roads assigned to them. It was the duty of each curator to issue contracts for the maintenance of his road and to see that the contractor who undertook said work performed it faithfully, as to both quantity and quality. Augustus also authorized the construction of sewers and removed obstructions to traffic, as the &quot;aediles&quot; did in Rome.

It was in the character of an imperial curator (though probably armed with extraordinary powers) that Corbulo denounced the &quot;magistratus&quot; and &quot;mancipes&quot; of the Italian roads to Tiberius. He pursued them and their families with fines and imprisonment and was later rewarded with a consulship by Caligula, who also shared the habit of condemning well-born citizens to work on the roads. Under the rule of Claudius, Corbulo was brought to justice and forced to repay the money which had been extorted from his victims.

===Other &quot;curatores&quot;===
Special &quot;curatores&quot; for a term seem to have been appointed on occasion, even after the institution of the permanent magistrates bearing that title. The emperors who succeeded Augustus exercised a vigilant control over the condition of the public highways. Their names occur frequently in the inscriptions to restorers of roads and bridges. Thus, Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Trajan, and Septimius Severus were commemorated in this capacity at Emérita. The Itinerary of Antoninus (which was probably a work of much earlier date and republished in an improved and enlarged form under one of the Antonine emperors) remains as standing evidence of the minute care which was bestowed on the service of the public roads.

==Construction and engineering==

Ancient Rome boasted impressive technological feats, using many advances that were lost during the Middle Ages. Some of these accomplishments would not be rivaled in Europe until the Modern Age. Many practical Roman innovations were adopted from earlier designs. Some of the common, earlier designs incorporated arches.

===Practices and terminology===
Roman road builders aimed at a regulation width (see Laws and traditions above), but actual widths have been measured at between and more than . Today, the concrete has worn from the spaces around the stones, giving the impression of a very bumpy road, but the original practice was to produce a surface that was no doubt much closer to being flat. Many roads were built to resist rain, freezing and flooding. They were constructed to need as little repair as possible. 
Roman construction took a directional straightness. Many long sections are ruler-straight, but it should not be thought that all of them were. Some links in the network were as long as . Gradients of 10%–12% are known in ordinary terrain, 15%–20% in mountainous country. The Roman emphasis on constructing straight roads often resulted in steep slopes relatively impractical for most commercial traffic; over the years the Romans realized this and built longer but more manageable alternatives to existing roads. Roman roads generally went straight up and down hills, rather than in a serpentine pattern of switchbacks. 

As to the standard Imperial terminology that was used, the words were localized for different elements used in construction and varied from region to region. Also, in the course of time, the terms &quot;via munita&quot; and &quot;vía publica&quot; became identical.
===Materials and methods===
&quot;Viae&quot; were distinguished according to their public or private character, as well as according to the materials employed and the methods followed in their construction. Ulpian divided them up in the following fashion:

#&quot;Via terrena&quot;: A plain road of leveled earth.
#&quot;Via glareata&quot;: An earthen road with a gravel surface.
#&quot;Via munita&quot;: A built road, paved with rectangular blocks of local rock or with polygonal blocks of volcanic rock.

According to Isidore of Sevilla, the Romans borrowed the knowledge of construction of &quot;viae munitae&quot; from the Carthaginians, though certainly inheriting some construction techniques from the Etruscans.

====&quot;Via terrena&quot;====
The &quot;Viae terrenae&quot; were plain roads of leveled earth. These were mere tracks worn down by the feet of humans and animals, and possibly by wheeled carriages.

====&quot;Via glareata&quot;====
The &quot;Viae glareatae&quot; were earthen roads with a gravel surface or a gravel subsurface and paving on top. Livy speaks of the censors of his time as being the first to contract for paving the streets of Rome with flint stones, for laying gravel on the roads outside the city, and for forming raised footpaths at the sides. In these roads, the surface was hardened with gravel, and although pavements were introduced shortly afterwards, the blocks were laid on a bed of small stones. Examples include the Via Praenestina and Via Latina.

====&quot;Via munita&quot;====
The best sources of information as regards the construction of a regulation &quot;via munita&quot; are:
# The many existing remains of &quot;viae publicae&quot;. These are often sufficiently well preserved to show that the rules of construction were, as far as local material allowed, minutely adhered to in practice.
# The directions for making pavements given by Vitruvius. The &quot;pavement&quot; and the &quot;via munita&quot; were identical in construction, except as regards the top layer, or surface. Pavement consisted of marble or mosaic, and &quot;via munita&quot; consisted of blocks of stone or volcanic rock.
# A passage in Statius describing the repairs of the Via Domitiana, a branch road of the Via Appia leading to Neapolis.

After the civil engineer looked over the site of the proposed road and determined roughly where it should go, the agrimensores went to work surveying the road bed. They used two main devices, the rod and a device called a &quot;groma&quot;, which helped them obtain right angles. The &quot;gromatici&quot;, the Roman equivalent of rod men, placed rods and put down a line called the &quot;rigor&quot;. As they did not possess anything like a transit, a surveyor tried to achieve straightness by looking along the rods and commanding the &quot;gromatici&quot; to move them as required. Using the &quot;gromae&quot; they then laid out a grid on the plan of the road. If the surveyor could not see his desired endpoint, a signal fire would often be lit at the endpoint in order to guide the surveyor. The &quot;libratores&quot; then began their work using ploughs and, sometimes with the help of legionaries, with spades excavated the road bed down to bedrock or at least to the firmest ground they could find. The excavation was called the &quot;fossa&quot;, the Latin word for ditch. The depth varied according to terrain.

The method varied according to geographic locality, materials available, and terrain, but the plan or ideal at which the engineer aimed was always the same. The road was constructed by filling the &quot;fossa&quot;. This was done by layering rock over other stones. Into the &quot;fossa&quot; was placed large amounts of rubble, gravel and stone, whatever fill was available. Sometimes a layer of sand was put down, if it was locally available. When the layers came to within 1 yd (1 m) or so of the surface, the subsurface was covered with gravel and tamped down, a process called &quot;pavire&quot;, or &quot;pavimentare&quot;. 

The flat surface was then the &quot;pavimentum&quot;. It could be used as the road, or additional layers could be constructed. A &quot;statumen&quot; or &quot;foundation&quot; of flat stones set in cement might support the additional layers. The final steps utilized lime-based mortar, which the Romans had discovered. They seem to have mixed the mortar and the stones in the ditch. First a small layer of coarse concrete, the &quot;rudus&quot;, then a layer of fine concrete, the nucleus, went onto the pavement or &quot;statumen&quot;. Into or onto the nucleus went a course of polygonal or square paving stones, called the &quot;summa crusta&quot;. The &quot;crusta&quot; was crowned for drainage.

An example is found in an early basalt road by the Temple of Saturn on the Clivus Capitolinus. It had travertine paving, polygonal basalt blocks, concrete bedding (substituted for the gravel), and a rain-water gutter.


===Engineering works===
Romans preferred to engineer solutions to obstacles rather than circumvent them. Outcrops of stone, ravines, or hilly or mountainous terrain called for cuts and tunnels. An example of this is found on the Roman road from Căzănești near the Iron Gates. This road was half carved into the rock, about 5ft to 5ft 9in (1.5 to 1.75m); the rest of the road, above the Danube, was made from wooden structure, projecting out of the cliff. The road functioned as a towpath, making the Danube navigable. Tabula Traiana memorial plaque in Serbia is all that remains of the now-submerged road.
Roman bridges were some of the first large and lasting bridges created. River crossings were achieved by bridges, or &quot;pontes&quot;. Single slabs went over rills. A bridge could be of wood, stone, or both. Wooden bridges were constructed on pilings sunk into the river, or on stone piers. Stone arch bridges were used on larger or more permanent crossings. Most bridges also used concrete, which the Romans were the first to use for bridges. Roman bridges were so well constructed that many remain in use today.

Causeways were built over marshy ground. The road was first marked out with pilings. Between them were sunk large quantities of stone so as to raise the causeway to more than above the marsh. In the provinces, the Romans often did not bother with a stone causeway but used log roads (&quot;pontes longi&quot;).

==Military and citizen utilization ==
The public road system of the Romans was thoroughly military in its aims and spirit. It was designed to unite and consolidate the conquests of the Roman people, whether within or without the limits of Italy proper. A legion on the march brought its own baggage train (&quot;impedimenta&quot;) and constructed its own camp (&quot;castra&quot;) every evening at the side of the road.

===Milestones and markers===
Milestones divided the Via Appia even before 250 BC into numbered miles, and most &quot;viae&quot; after 124 BC. The modern word &quot;mile&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;milia passuum&quot;, &quot;one thousand paces&quot;, each of which was five Roman feet, or in total . A milestone, or &quot;miliarium&quot;, was a circular column on a solid rectangular base, set more than into the ground, standing tall, in diameter, and weighing more than 2 tons. At the base was inscribed the number of the mile relative to the road it was on. In a panel at eye height was the distance to the Roman Forum and various other information about the officials who made or repaired the road and when. These &quot;miliaria&quot; are valuable historical documents today, and their inscriptions are collected in Volume XVII of the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum&quot;. Milestones permitted distances and locations to be known and recorded exactly. It was not long before historians began to refer to the milestone at which an event occurred.The Romans had a preference for standardization wherever possible, so Augustus, after becoming permanent commissioner of roads in 20 BC, set up the &quot;miliarium aureum&quot; (&quot;golden milestone&quot;) near the Temple of Saturn. All roads were considered to begin from this gilded bronze monument. On it were listed all the major cities in the empire and distances to them. Constantine called it the &quot;umbilicus Romae&quot; (&quot;navel of Rome&quot;), and built a similar—although more complex—monument in Constantinople, the Milion.

===Itinerary maps and charts===

Combined topographical and road-maps may have existed as specialty items in some Roman libraries, but they were expensive, hard to copy and not in general use. Travelers wishing to plan a journey could consult an &quot;itinerarium&quot;, which in its most basic form was a simple list of cities and towns along a given road and the distances between them. It was only a short step from lists to a master list, or a schematic route-planner in which roads and their branches were represented more or less in parallel, as in the . From this master list, parts could be copied and sold on the streets. 

The most thorough used different symbols for cities, way stations, water courses, and so on. The Roman government from time to time would produce a master road itinerary. The first known were commissioned in 44 BC by Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Three Greek geographers, Zenodoxus, Theodotus and Polyclitus, were hired to survey the system and compile a master itinerary; the task required over 25 years, and the resulting stone-engraved master itinerary was set up near the Pantheon. Travelers and itinerary sellers could make copies from it.

===Vehicles and transportation===

Outside the cities, Romans were avid riders and rode on or drove quite a number of vehicle types, some of which are mentioned here. Carts driven by oxen were used. Horse-drawn carts could travel up to per day, while pedestrians traveled per day. For purposes of description, Roman vehicles can be divided into the car, the coach, and the cart. Cars were used to transport one or two individuals, coaches were used to transport parties, and carts to transport cargo.

Of the cars, the most popular was the &quot;carrus&quot;, a standard chariot form descending to the Romans from a greater antiquity. The top was open, the front closed. One survives in the Vatican. It carried a driver and a passenger. A &quot;carrus&quot; with two horses was a &quot;biga&quot;; three horses, a &quot;triga&quot;; and four horses a &quot;quadriga&quot;. The tires were of iron. When not in use, its wheels were removed for easier storage. A more luxurious version, the &quot;carpentum&quot;, transported women and officials. It had an arched overhead covering of cloth and was drawn by mules. A lighter version, the &quot;cisium&quot;, equivalent to a gig, was open above and in front and had a seat. Drawn by one or two mules or horses, it was used for cab work, the cab drivers being called &quot;cisiani&quot;. The builder was a &quot;cisarius&quot;.

Of the coaches, the mainstay was the &quot;raeda&quot; or &quot;reda&quot;, which had four wheels. The high sides formed a sort of box in which seats were placed, with a notch on each side for entry. It carried several people with baggage up to the legal limit of 1,000 Roman &quot;librae&quot; (pounds), modern equivalent . It was drawn by teams of oxen, horses or mules. A cloth top could be put on for weather, in which case it resembled a covered wagon. The &quot;raeda&quot; was probably the main vehicle for travel on the roads. &quot;Raedae meritoriae&quot; were hired coaches. The &quot;fiscalis raeda&quot; was a government coach. The driver and the builder were both referred to as a &quot;raedarius&quot;.

Of the carts, the main one was the &quot;plaustrum&quot; or &quot;plostrum&quot;. This was simply a platform of boards attached to wheels and a cross-tree. The wheels, or &quot;tympana&quot;, were solid and were several centimetres (inches) thick. The sides could be built up with boards or rails. A large wicker basket was sometimes placed on it. A two-wheel version existed along with the normal four-wheel type called the &quot;plaustrum maius&quot;.

The military used a standard wagon. Their transportation service was the &quot;cursus clabularis&quot;, after the standard wagon, called a &quot;carrus clabularius&quot;, &quot;clabularis&quot;, &quot;clavularis&quot;, or &quot;clabulare&quot;. It transported the &quot;impedimenta&quot; (baggage) of a military column.

===Way stations and traveler inns===
For non-military officials and people on official business who had no legion at their service, the government maintained way stations, or &quot;mansiones&quot; (&quot;staying places&quot;), for their use. Passports were required for identification. &quot;Mansiones&quot; were located about apart. There the official traveller found a complete &quot;villa&quot; dedicated to his use. Often a permanent military camp or a town grew up around the &quot;mansio&quot;. For non-official travelers in need of refreshment, a private system of &quot;inns&quot; or &quot;cauponae&quot; were placed near the &quot;mansiones&quot;. They performed the same functions but were somewhat disreputable, as they were frequented by thieves and prostitutes. Graffiti decorate the walls of the few whose ruins have been found.

Genteel travelers needed something better than &quot;cauponae&quot;. In the early days of the &quot;viae&quot;, when little unofficial provision existed, houses placed near the road were required by law to offer hospitality on demand. Frequented houses no doubt became the first &quot;tabernae&quot;, which were hostels, rather than the &quot;taverns&quot; we know today. As Rome grew, so did its &quot;tabernae&quot;, becoming more luxurious and acquiring good or bad reputations as the case might be. An example is the &quot;Tabernae Caediciae&quot; at Sinuessa on the Via Appia. It had a large storage room containing barrels of wine, cheese and ham. Many cities of today grew up around a &quot;taberna&quot; complex, such as Rheinzabern in the Rhineland, and Saverne in Alsace.

A third system of way stations serviced vehicles and animals: the &quot;mutationes&quot; (&quot;changing stations&quot;). They were located every . In these complexes, the driver could purchase the services of wheelwrights, cartwrights, and &quot;equarii medici&quot;, or veterinarians. Using these stations as chariot relays, Tiberius hastened in 24 hours to join his brother, Drusus Germanicus, who was dying of gangrene as a result of a fall from a horse.

===Post offices and services===
Two postal services were available under the empire, one public and one private. The &quot;cursus publicus&quot;, founded by Augustus, carried the mail of officials by relay throughout the Roman road system. The vehicle for carrying mail was a &quot;cisium&quot; with a box, but for special delivery a horse and rider was faster. On average a relay of horses could carry a letter in a day. The postman wore a characteristic leather hat, the &quot;petanus&quot;. The postal service was a somewhat dangerous occupation, as postmen were a target for bandits and enemies of Rome. Private mail of the well-to-do was carried by &quot;tabellarii&quot;, an organization of slaves available for a price.

<doc id="25901" wikidata="Q684020" url="?curid=25901" title="Roberto Clemente">
<text>Roberto Enrique Clemente Walker (; August 18, 1934 – December 31, 1972) was a Puerto Rican professional baseball player who played 18 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, primarily as a right fielder. In December 1972, Clemente died in the crash of a plane he had chartered to take emergency relief goods for the survivors of a massive earthquake in Nicaragua. After his sudden death, the National Baseball Hall of Fame changed its rules so that a player who had been dead for at least six months would be eligible for entry. In 1973, Clemente was posthumously inducted, becoming the first player from the Caribbean and second from Latin America (after Lefty Gomez in 1972) to be honored in the Hall of Fame.

Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Clemente was a track and field star and an Olympic hopeful in his youth before deciding to turn his full attention to baseball. His professional career began at the age of eighteen, with the Cangrejeros de Santurce of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League. He quickly attracted the attention of the Brooklyn Dodgers who signed him to a bonus of $10,000. However, due to the bonus rule under which Clemente had signed and the Dodgers decision to send him to the minor leagues, they lost Clemente to the Pittsburgh Pirates who drafted him after the 1954 season.

Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He was the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1966, the NL batting leader in 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and a Gold Glove Award winner for 12 consecutive seasons from 1961 through 1972. His batting average was over .300 for 13 seasons and he had 3,000 hits during his major league career. He also was a two-time World Series champion. Clemente was the first player from the Caribbean and Latin America to win a World Series as a starting position player (1960), to receive an NL MVP Award (1966), and to receive a World Series MVP Award (1971).

During the offseason, in addition to playing winter ball in Puerto Rico, Clemente was involved in charity work in Latin American and Caribbean countries. In 1972, he died in a plane crash at the age of 38 while en route to deliver aid to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake. The following season, the Pittsburgh Pirates retired his uniform number 21. In his honor, Major League baseball renamed the Commissioner&#x27;s Award, given to the player who &quot;best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement and the individual&#x27;s contribution to his team&quot;, to the Roberto Clemente Award.

== Early life ==
Clemente was born on August 18, 1934, in Barrio San Antón in Carolina, Puerto Rico, to Luisa Walker and Melchor Clemente. He was the youngest of seven siblings (three were from his mother&#x27;s previous marriage). During Clemente&#x27;s childhood, his father worked as a foreman for sugar cane crops located in the municipality in the northeastern part of the island. Because the family&#x27;s resources were limited, Clemente and his brothers worked alongside his father in the fields, loading and unloading trucks.

Clemente had first shown interest in baseball early in life and often played against neighboring barrios. When he was fourteen, he was recruited by Roberto Marín to play softball with the Sello Rojo team after he was seen playing baseball in barrio San Antón. He was with the team two years as a shortstop.

He attended Julio Vizcarrondo High School in Carolina where he was a track and field star, participating in the high jump and javelin throw. Clemente was considered good enough to represent Puerto Rico at the Olympics. He later stated that throwing the javelin helped in strengthening his arm and with his footwork and release. Despite his all-around athletic skill, however, Clemente decided to focus on baseball and went on to join Puerto Rico&#x27;s amateur league, playing for the Ferdinand Juncos team, which represented the municipality of Juncos.

==Professional career==

===Puerto Rican baseball (1952–1954)===
Clemente&#x27;s professional career began at age 18 when he accepted a contract from Pedrín Zorrilla with Cangrejeros de Santurce (&quot;Crabbers&quot;), a winter league team and franchise of the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League (LBPPR). Clemente signed with the team on October 9, 1952. He was a bench player during his first season but was promoted to the Cangrejeros&#x27; starting lineup the following season. During this season he hit .288 as the team&#x27;s leadoff hitter.

While Clemente was playing in the Puerto Rican League, the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract of $15,000 – $10,000 bonus and $5000 league minimum salary. Clemente signed with them on February 19, 1954.

===Minor league baseball (1954)===
At the time of Clemente&#x27;s signing, the bonus rule implemented by Major League Baseball was still in effect. The rule stipulated that when a major league team signed a player to a contract with a signing bonus in excess of $4,000 ($ today), the team was required to keep that player on their 25-man active roster for two full seasons and failure to comply with the rule would result in the team losing the rights to that player&#x27;s contract, and the player would then be exposed to the waiver wire.

As Clemente&#x27;s bonus was larger than $4,000, he was considered a bonus baby. However, the Dodgers decided against benching him for two years in the majors and decided to place him with the Montreal Royals, their International League Triple-A affiliate. While it is often believed that the Dodgers instructed manager Max Macon to use Clemente sparingly to prevent him from being drafted under the Rule 5 Draft, Macon himself denied it. Box scores also suggest that Macon platooned Clemente the same as he did with other outfielders.

Affected early on by both climate and language differences, Clemente received assistance from bilingual teammates such as infielder Chico Fernandez and pitchers Tommy Lasorda and Joe Black.

Black was the original target of the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; scouting trip to Richmond on June 1, 1954. Noticing Clemente in batting practice, Pirates scout Clyde Sukeforth made inquiries and soon learned about Clemente&#x27;s status as an unprotected bonus baby. Twelve years later, manager Macon acknowledged that &quot;we tried to sneak him through the draft, but it didn&#x27;t work&quot; but denied being instructed to not play Clemente, stating that the player needed time to develop and was struggling against Triple-A pitching. However, Pittsburgh noticed his raw talents; as Sukeforth recalled years later, &quot;I knew then he&#x27;d be our first draft choice. I told Montreal manager Max Macon to take good care of &#x27;our boy&#x27; and see that he didn&#x27;t get hurt.&quot;

In 87 games with the Royals, Clemente hit .257 with two home runs. The first home run of his North American baseball career came on July 25, 1954; Clemente&#x27;s extra inning, walk-off home run was hit in his first at-bat after entering the game as a defensive replacement. His only other minor league home run came on September 5. On his 20th birthday, August 8, he made a notable game-ending outfield assist, cutting down the potential tying run at the plate.

At the end of the season, Clemente returned to play for Santurce where one of his teammates was Willie Mays. While with the team, the Pirates made Clemente the first selection of the Rule 5 draft that took place on November 22, 1954.

===Major League Baseball (1955–1972)===
For all but the first seven weeks of his major league career, Clemente wore number 21, so chosen because his full name of Roberto Clemente Walker had that many letters. For his first few weeks, Clemente wore the number 13, as his teammate Earl Smith was wearing number 21. It was later reassigned to Clemente.

During the off-seasons (except the 1958–59, 1962–63, 1965–66, 1968–69, 1971–72, and 1972–73 seasons), Clemente played professionally for the Cangrejeros de Santurce, Criollos de Caguas, and Senadores de San Juan in the Liga de Béisbol Profesional de Puerto Rico, where he was considered a star. He sometimes managed the San Juan team.
In September 1958, Clemente joined the United States Marine Corps Reserve. He served his six-month active duty commitment at Parris Island, South Carolina, Camp LeJeune in North Carolina, and Washington, D.C. At Parris Island, Clemente received recruit training with Platoon 346 of the 3rd Recruit Battalion. The rigorous Marine Corps training programs helped Clemente physically; he added strength by gaining ten pounds and said his back troubles, caused by being in a 1954 auto accident, disappeared as a result of the training. He was a private first class in the Marine Corps Reserve until September 1964.

====Early years====

The Pirates struggled through several difficult seasons through the 1950s. They did have a winning season in 1958, their first since 1948.

Clemente debuted with the Pirates on April 17, 1955, wearing uniform number 13, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Early in his career with the Pirates, he was frustrated by racial and ethnic tensions, with sniping by the local media and some teammates. Clemente responded to this by saying &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in color.&quot; He said that, during his upbringing, he was taught never to discriminate against someone based on ethnicity.

Clemente was at a double disadvantage, as he was a Latin American and Caribbean player whose first language was Spanish and was of African descent. The year before, the Pirates had hired Curt Roberts, their first African-American player. They were the fifth team in the NL and ninth in the major leagues to do so, seven years after Jackie Robinson broke baseball&#x27;s color line by joining the Dodgers. When Clemente arrived in Pittsburgh, Roberts befriended him and helped him adjust to life in the major league, as well as in the Pittsburgh area.

During his rookie season, Clemente had to sit out several games, as he had suffered a lower back injury in Puerto Rico the previous winter. A speeding, drunk driver rammed into his car at an intersection. He finished his rookie season with a .255 batting average, despite trouble hitting certain types of pitches. His defensive skills were highlighted during this season.
The following season, on July 25, 1956, at Forbes Field, Clemente erased a three-run, ninth-inning deficit with a bases-clearing inside-the-park home run, thus becoming the first—and, as yet, only—player in modern Major League history (since 1900) to hit a documented walk-off, inside-the-park grand slam. Pittsburgh-based sportswriter John Steigerwald said that it &quot;&quot;may&quot; have been done only once in the history of baseball.&quot;

Clemente was still fulfilling his Marine Corps Reserve duty during spring of 1959 and set to be released from Camp Lejeune until April 4. A Pennsylvania state senator, John M. Walker, wrote to US Senator Hugh Scott requesting an early release on March 4 so Clemente could join the team for spring training.

====Stardom====
Early in the 1960 season, Clemente led the league with a .353 batting average, and the 14 extra-base hits and 25 RBIs recorded in May alone resulted in Clemente&#x27;s selection as the National League&#x27;s Player of the Month. His batting average would remain above the .300 mark throughout the course of the campaign. On August 5 at Forbes Field, Clemente crashed into the right-field wall while making a pivotal play, depriving San Francisco&#x27;s Willie Mays of a leadoff, extra-base hit in a game eventually won by Pittsburgh, 1–0. The resulting injury necessitated five stitches to the chin and a five-game layoff for Clemente, while the catch itself was described by Giants beat writer Bob Stevens as &quot;rank[ing] with the greatest of all time, as well as one of the most frightening to watch and painful to make.&quot; The Pirates compiled a 95–59 record during the regular season, winning the NL pennant, and defeated the New York Yankees in a seven-game World Series. Clemente batted .310 in the series, hitting safely at least once in every game. His .314 batting average, 16 home runs, and defensive playing during the course of the season had earned him his first spot on the NL All-Star roster as a reserve player, and he replaced Hank Aaron in right field during the 7th and 8th innings in the second All-Star game held that season (two All-Star games were held each season from 1959 through 1962).

During spring training in 1961, following advice from Pirates&#x27; batting coach George Sisler, Clemente tried to modify his batting technique by using a heavier bat to slow the speed of his swing. During the 1961 season, Clemente was named the starting NL right fielder for the first of two All-Star games and went 2 for 4; he hit a triple on his first at-bat and scored the team&#x27;s first run, then drove in the second with a sacrifice fly. With the AL ahead 4–3 in the 10th inning, he teamed with fellow future HOFers Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, and Frank Robinson to engineer a come-from-behind 5–4 NL victory, culminating in Clemente&#x27;s walk-off single off knuckleballer Hoyt Wilhelm. Clemente started again in right field for the second All-Star game held that season and was 0 for 2, flying and grounding out in the 2nd and 4th innings. That season he received his first Gold Glove Award.

Following the 1961 season, he traveled to Puerto Rico along with Orlando Cepeda, who was a native of Ponce. When both players arrived, they were received by 18,000 people. During this time, he was also involved in managing the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rican League, as well as playing with the team during the major league off-season. During the course of the winter league, Clemente injured his thigh while doing some work at home but wanted to participate in the league&#x27;s all-star game. He pinch-hit in the game and got a single, but experienced a complication of his injury as a result, and had to undergo surgery shortly after being carried off the playing field. This condition limited his role with the Pirates in the first half of the 1965 season, during which he batted .257. Although he was inactive for many games, when he returned to the regular starting lineup, he got hits in 33 out of 34 games and his batting average climbed up to .340. He participated as a pinch hitter and replaced Willie Stargell playing left field during the All-Star Game on July 15.
Clemente was an All-Star every season he played in the 1960s other than 1968—the only year in his career after 1959 in which he failed to hit above .300—and a Gold Glove winner for each of his final 12 seasons, beginning in 1961. He won the NL batting title four times: 1961, 1964, 1965, and 1967, and won the league&#x27;s MVP Award in 1966, hitting .317 with a career-high 29 home runs and 119 RBIs. In 1967, Clemente registered a career-high .357 batting average, hit 23 home runs, and batted in 110 runs. Following that season, in an informal poll conducted by &quot;Sport Magazine&quot; at baseball&#x27;s Winter Meetings, a plurality of major league GMs declared Clemente &quot;the best player in baseball today,&quot; edging out AL Triple Crown winner Carl Yastrzemski by a margin of 8 to 6, with one vote each going to Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson, Bill Freehan and Ron Santo.

In an effort to make him seem more American, sportswriters started calling him &quot;Bob&quot; or &quot;Bobby&quot;. His baseball cards even listed him as &quot;Bob Clemente&quot;, a practice that persisted through to 1969. He disliked the practice, which he felt was disrespectful to his Puerto Rican and Latino heritage. Clemente would correct reporters who referred to him as &quot;Bob&quot; during post-game interviews, but the issue continued throughout the 1960s.

====Final seasons====
The 1970 season was the last one that the Pirates played at Forbes Field before moving to Three Rivers Stadium; for Clemente, abandoning this stadium was an emotional situation. The Pirates&#x27; final game at Forbes Field occurred on June 28, 1970. That day, Clemente said that it was hard to play in a different field, saying, &quot;I spent half my life there.&quot; The night of July 24, 1970, was declared &quot;Roberto Clemente Night&quot;; on this day, several Puerto Rican fans traveled to Three Rivers Stadium and cheered Clemente while wearing traditional Puerto Rican attire. A ceremony to honor Clemente took place, during which he received a scroll with 300,000 signatures compiled in Puerto Rico, and several thousands of dollars were donated to charity work following Clemente&#x27;s request.

During the 1970 season, Clemente compiled a .352 batting average; the Pirates won the NL East pennant but were subsequently eliminated by the Cincinnati Reds. During the offseason, Roberto Clemente experienced some tense situations while he was working as manager of the Senadores and when his father, Melchor Clemente, experienced medical problems and underwent surgery.

In the 1971 season, the Pirates won the NL East, defeated the San Francisco Giants in four games to win the NL pennant, and faced the Baltimore Orioles in the World Series. Baltimore had won 101 games (third season in row with 100+ wins) and swept the American League Championship Series, both for the third consecutive year, and were the defending World Series champions. The Orioles won the first two games in the series, but Pittsburgh won the championship in seven games. This marked the second occasion that Clemente helped win a World Series for the Pirates. Over the course of the series, Clemente had a .414 batting average (12 hits in 29 at-bats), performed well defensively, and hit a solo home run in the deciding 2–1 seventh game victory. Following the conclusion of the season, he received the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.

Although he was frustrated and struggling with injuries, Clemente played in 102 games and hit .312 during the 1972 season. He also made the annual NL All-Star roster for the fifteenth (15th) time (he played in 14/15 All-Star games) and won his twelfth consecutive Gold Glove.

On September 30, he hit a double in the fourth inning off Jon Matlack of the New York Mets at Three Rivers Stadium for his 3,000th. It was his last regular season at-bat of his career. By playing in right field in one more regular season game, on October 3, Clemente tied Honus Wagner&#x27;s record for games played as a Pittsburgh Pirate, with 2,433 games played. In the NL playoffs that season, he batted .235 as he went 4 for 17. His last game was October 11, 1972, at Cincinnati&#x27;s Riverfront Stadium in the fifth and final game of the 1972 NLCS, won by the Reds in the bottom of the 9th inning. Clemente had his final hit (single) in the 1st inning; his final plate appearance was an intentional walk in the 8th inning. He and Bill Mazeroski were the last Pirate players remaining from the 1960 World Series championship team.

== Charity work and death ==

Clemente spent much of his time during the off-season involved in charity work. He also visited Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, in late 1972, while managing the Puerto Rico national baseball team at the 1972 Amateur World Series. When Managua was affected by a massive earthquake three weeks later, on December 23, 1972, Clemente immediately set to work arranging emergency relief flights. He soon learned, however, that the aid packages on the first three flights had been diverted by corrupt officials of the Somoza government, never reaching victims of the quake. He decided to accompany the fourth relief flight, hoping that his presence would ensure that the aid would be delivered to the survivors.

The airplane which he chartered for the New Year&#x27;s Eve flight, a Douglas DC-7 cargo plane, had a history of mechanical problems and it also had an insufficient number of flight personnel (the flight was missing a flight engineer and a copilot), and it was also overloaded by . It crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Isla Verde, Puerto Rico immediately after takeoff on December 31, 1972, due to engine failure.

A search and rescue effort was immediately launched, led by the USCGC &quot;Sagebrush&quot;. A few days after the crash, the body of the pilot and part of the fuselage of the plane were found. An empty flight case which apparently belonged to Clemente was the only personal item of his which was recovered from the plane. Clemente&#x27;s teammate and close friend Manny Sanguillén was the only member of the Pirates who did not attend Roberto&#x27;s memorial service. Instead, the Pirates catcher chose to dive into the waters where Clemente&#x27;s plane had crashed in an effort to find his teammate. The bodies of Clemente and three others who were also on the four-engine plane were never recovered.

Montreal Expos pitcher Tom Walker, then playing winter league ball in Puerto Rico, had helped him load the plane. Because Clemente wanted Walker, who was single, to go and enjoy New Year&#x27;s Eve, Clemente told him not to join him on the flight. A few hours later, Walker returned to his condo and discovered that the plane carrying Clemente had crashed.

In an interview for the ESPN documentary series &quot;SportsCentury&quot; in 2002, Clemente&#x27;s widow Vera mentioned that Clemente had told her that he thought he was going to die young several times. Indeed, while he was being asked when he would get his 3,000th career hit by broadcaster and future fellow Hall of Famer Richie Ashburn in July 1971 during the All-Star Game activities, Clemente&#x27;s response was &quot;Well, uh, you never know. I, I, uh, if I&#x27;m alive, like I said before, you never know because God tells you how long you&#x27;re going to be here. So you never know what can happen tomorrow.&quot;

== Career overall ==

At the time of his death, Clemente had established several records with the Pirates, including most triples in a single game (three) and hits in two consecutive games (ten). He won 12 Gold Glove Awards and shares the record of most won among outfielders with Willie Mays.

Clemente was an All-Star for 13 seasons, selected to 15 All-Star Games. He won the NL MVP Award in 1966, and was named NL Player of the Month Award three times (May 1960, May 1967, July 1969). Clemente led the Pirates to two World Series titles, being named World Series MVP in 1971.

Clemente had two three-home run games in his career, as well as eight five-hit games in MLB.

==Honors and legacy==

On March 20, 1973, the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America held a special election for the Baseball Hall of Fame. They voted to waive the waiting period for Clemente, due to the circumstances of his death, and posthumously elected him for induction into the Hall of Fame, giving him 393 out of 424 available votes, for 92.7% of the votes.

Clemente&#x27;s number 21 was retired by the Pittsburgh Pirates on April 6, 1973, a few months after his election to the Hall of Fame. There have been calls for MLB to retire number 21 league-wide, as was done with Jackie Robinson&#x27;s number 42 in 1997, but the sentiment has been opposed by the Robinson family.

In 1999, Clemente was ranked number 20 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking Latin American and Caribbean player on the list. Later that year, he was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Clemente at number 40 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

In 2007, Clemente was selected for the All Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team for the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Gold Glove Award.

He was named to Major League Baseball&#x27;s Latino Legends Team in 2005.

In 1973, Major League Baseball renamed the Commissioner&#x27;s Award to the Roberto Clemente Award. It has been awarded every year to a player with outstanding baseball playing skills who is personally involved in community work. A trophy and a donation check for a charity of the player&#x27;s choice are presented annually at the World Series.

Clemente was elected to the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame in 2010, and the Caribbean Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2003, he was also inducted into the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame.

Near the old Forbes Field where Clemente began his major league career, the city of Pittsburgh renamed a street in his honor. Additionally, the city named Roberto Clemente Memorial Park in his honor. At Pirate City, the Pirates spring training home in Bradenton, Florida, a section of 27th Street East is named Roberto Clemente Memorial Highway.

The United States Postal Service issued a Roberto Clemente postal stamp on August 17, 1984. The stamp was designed by Juan Lopez-Bonilla and shows Clemente wearing a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cap with a Puerto Rican flag in the background.

The Pirates originally erected a statue in memory of Clemente at Three Rivers Stadium, just before the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It has since been moved to PNC Park when it opened in 2001, and stands outside the park&#x27;s centerfield gates.

In 1974, the Harlem River State Park in Morris Heights, The Bronx, New York City, was renamed Roberto Clemente State Park in his honor. In 2013, forty years after his election to the Hall of Fame, a statue was unveiled at the park. It was the first statue honoring a Puerto Rican to be unveiled in New York City.

In 2012, the Puerto Rico Professional Baseball League (LBPPR) was renamed Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente, the number 21 was also permanently retired.

A number of schools have been named after Clemente, including the Roberto Clemente Community Academy in Chicago, and the Roberto Clemente Charter School in Allentown, Pennsylvania.

In 2002, 30 years after his death, Major League Baseball proclaimed September 15 as &quot;Roberto Clemente Day&quot;.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon posthumously honored Clemente with the Presidential Citizens Medal. That same day, Congress honored Clemente with the Congressional Gold Medal. In 2003, President George W. Bush awarded Clemente the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 

Clemente is an iconic sports figure in Puerto Rico, widely revered by his people. In 2022, the government of Puerto Rico granted Clemente the formal recognition of &quot;prócer&quot; (national hero). The Coliseo Roberto Clemente, opened in 1973 in San Juan, and Estadio Roberto Clemente, opened in 2000 in Carolina, are both named in his honor.

== Personal life ==
Clemente was married on November 14, 1964 to Vera Zabala at San Fernando Church in Carolina. The couple had three children: Roberto (often referred to as &quot;Roberto Jr.&quot;), born in 1965; Luis Roberto, born in 1966; and Roberto Enrique, born in 1969. Vera Clemente died on November 16, 2019, aged 78.

Clemente was a devout Catholic. In the 2010s, there was an initiative to have him canonized by the Catholic Church.

<text>Score voting, sometimes called range voting, is an electoral system for single-seat elections. Voters give each candidate a numerical score, and the candidate with the highest average score is elected. Score voting includes the well-known approval voting (used to calculate approval ratings), but also lets voters give partial (in-between) approval ratings to candidates.

== Usage ==

=== Political use ===

==== Historical ====
A crude form of score voting was used in some elections in ancient Sparta, by measuring how loudly the crowd shouted for different candidates. This has a modern-day analog of using clapometers in some television shows and the judging processes of some athletic competitions.

Beginning in the 13th century, the Republic of Venice elected the Doge of Venice using a multi-stage process with multiple rounds of score voting. This may have contributed to the Republic&#x27;s longevity, being partly responsible for its status as the longest-lived democracy in world history. Score voting was used in Greek legislative elections beginning in 1864, during which time it had a many-party system; it was replaced with party-list proportional representation in 1923.

According to Steven J. Brams, approval was used for some elections in 19th century England.

==== Current ====
Score voting is used to elect candidates who represent parties in Latvia&#x27;s Saeima (parliament) in an open list system.

The selection process for the Secretary-General of the United Nations uses a variant on a three-point scale (&quot;Encourage&quot;, &quot;Discourage&quot;, and &quot;No Opinion&quot;), with permanent members of the United Nations Security Council holding a veto over any candidate.

Proportional score voting was used in Swedish elections in the early 20th century, prior to being replaced by party-list proportional representation. It is still used for local elections.
In 2018, Fargo, North Dakota, passed a local ballot initiative adopting approval voting for the city&#x27;s local elections, becoming the first US city to adopt the method.

Score voting is used by the Green Party of Utah to elect officers, on a 0–9 scale.

The Pirate Party Germany uses variants of score voting such as Reweighted Range Voting (RRV) in some of its internal elections. The system has been used in the Bavarian branch for selecting candidates for the Bundestag list, and in the NRW branch for general decision-making and internal elections.

=== Non-political use ===

Members of Wikipedia&#x27;s Arbitration Committee are elected based on a three-point scale (&quot;Support&quot;, &quot;Neutral&quot;, &quot;Oppose&quot;).

Non-governmental uses of score voting are common, such as in Likert scales for customer satisfaction surveys and mechanism involving users rating a product or service in terms of &quot;stars&quot; (such as rating movies on IMDb, products at Amazon, apps in the iOS or Google Play stores, etc.). Judged sports such as gymnastics generally rate competitors on a numeric scale.

A multi-winner proportional variant called Thiele&#x27;s method or reweighted range voting is used to select five nominees for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects rated on a 0–10 scale.

==Example==

Suppose that 100 voters each decided to grant from 0 to 10 points to each city such that their most liked choice got 10 points, and least liked choice got 0 points, with the intermediate choices getting an amount proportional to their relative distance.

Nashville, the capital in real life, likewise wins in the example.

For comparison, note that traditional first-past-the-post would elect Memphis, even though most citizens consider it the worst choice, because 42% is larger than any other single city. Instant-runoff voting would elect the 2nd-worst choice (Knoxville), because the central candidates would be eliminated early (and Chattanooga voters preferring Knoxville above Nashville). In approval voting, with each voter selecting their top two cities, Nashville would win because of the significant boost from Memphis residents.

==Properties==
Score voting allows voters to express preferences of varying strengths, making it a rated voting system.

Score voting is not vulnerable to the less-is-more paradox, i.e. raising a candidate&#x27;s rating can never hurt their chances of winning. Score also satisfies the participation criterion, i.e. a candidate can never lose as a result of voters turning out to support them. Score voting satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives, and does not tend to exhibit spoiler effects.

It does not satisfy the Condorcet criterion, i.e. the method does not always agree with the majority rule. However, when voters all vote strategically, basing their votes on polling or past election results, the majority-preferred candidate will win.

==Strategy==

Ideal score voting strategy for well-informed voters is generally identical to their optimal approval voting strategy; voters will want to give their least and most favorite candidates a minimum and a maximum score, respectively. The game-theoretical analysis shows that this claim is not fully general, but holds in most cases. Another strategic voting tactic is given by the weighted mean utility theorem, maximum score for all candidates preferred compared to the expected winners weighted with winning probability and minimum score for all others.

Papers have found that &quot;experimental results support the concept of bias toward unselfish outcomes in large elections.&quot; The authors observed what they termed ethical considerations dominating voter behavior as pivot probability decreased. This would imply that larger elections, or those perceived as having a wider margin of victory, would result in fewer tactical voters.

How voters precisely grade candidates is a topic that is not fully settled, although experiments show that their behavior depends on the grade scale, its length, and the possibility to give negative grades.

STAR voting (Score Then Automatic Runoff) is a variant proposed to address some concerns about strategic exaggeration in score voting. Under this system, each voter may assign a score (from 0 to the maximum) to any number of candidates. Of the two highest-scoring candidates, the winner is the one most voters ranked higher. The runoff step was introduced to mitigate the incentive to exaggerate ratings in ordinary score voting.

==Advocacy==

Albert Heckscher was one of the earliest proponents, advocating for a form of score voting he called the &quot;immanent method&quot; in his 1892 dissertation, in which voters assign any number between -1 and +1 to each alternative, simulating their individual deliberation.

Currently, score voting is advocated by The Center for Election Science. Since 2014, the Equal Vote Coalition advocates a variant method (STAR) with an extra second evaluation step to address some of the criticisms of traditional score voting.

<text>The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show, commonly referred to as simply Ren &amp; Stimpy, is an American animated comedy television series created by John Kricfalusi and developed by Kricfalusi, Bob Camp, Jim Smith and Lynne Naylor for Nickelodeon. Originally produced by Spümcø, the series aired on Nickelodeon from August 11, 1991, to December 16, 1995, with its last episode airing on MTV on October 20, 1996, spanning for a total of five seasons and 52 episodes. The series follows the misadventures of Ren Höek, an emotionally unstable and psychotic chihuahua dog; and Stimpy, a good-natured and dimwitted Manx cat. It is the third to be aired of the original three Nickelodeon animated series known as &quot;Nicktoons&quot;, alongside &quot;Doug&quot; and &quot;Rugrats&quot;, and is considered to be one of the progenitor series of the brand.

&quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; has received widespread critical acclaim from critics and audiences, with praise going to its visuals, animation, and surreal nature. However, it has also generated significant controversy for its dark humor, adult humor, violence, and shock value. This controversy contributed to the production staff&#x27;s altercations with Nickelodeon&#x27;s Standards and Practices department, in addition to Spümcø&#x27;s failure to deliver episodes on time, all of which led to Kricfalusi&#x27;s termination from the show in 1992. Games Animation would produce the remaining three seasons of the series, during which it received criticism of a perceived decline in quality. One episode was banned from ever airing on Nickelodeon, while three were initially left unaired in North America until it was broadcast on MTV, one on January 13, 1993 and two on October 20, 1996.

A reboot for adult audiences, &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;, was produced by Kricfalusi and Spümcø and aired in 2003 on Spike TV. Only three episodes were aired before the series was canceled due to both production delays and negative critical reception from both critics and fans of the original series, with three additional episodes (all incomplete at the time of the cancellation) being released straight to DVD in 2006.

On August 5, 2020, Comedy Central announced that they had ordered a second reboot of the series to be produced without the involvement of Kricfalusi.

==Premise==

The series centers on Ren Höek (voiced by John Kricfalusi in seasons 1–2; Billy West in seasons 3–5), a hot-tempered, psychotic, &quot;asthma-hound&quot; Chihuahua, and Stimpson J. &quot;Stimpy&quot; Cat (also voiced by Billy West), a dimwitted and happy-go-lucky Manx cat. The duo fill various roles from episode to episode, including outer-space explorers, Old West horse thieves, and nature-show hosts, and are usually at odds with each other in these situations. While the show was sometimes set in the present day, the show&#x27;s crew tended to avoid &quot;contemporary&quot; jokes about current events. The show extensively features off-color and absurdist humor, as well as slapstick akin to animated shorts of the 1950s.

The show features a host of supporting characters. Due to the nature of the show, they do not have consistent appearances or even designs; those who do appear repeatedly have different roles in each appearance. They may either be part of the storyline or make cameo appearances with little bearing on the plot. Some, such as Mr. Horse, are exclusively cameo-based, spontaneously appearing as a running gag. George Liquor makes his first appearances in the show through cameos or as a supporting character, as demonstrated in &quot;Dog Show&quot; and &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;.

==Development and history==
===Conception===
According to animator Bill Wray, John Kricfalusi created the characters Ren and Stimpy in 1978 for &quot;personal amusement&quot; while studying at Sheridan College in Ontario, Canada. He was inspired to create Ren by an Elliott Erwitt photograph, printed on a postcard, called &quot;New York City, 1946&quot;, showing a sweatered chihuahua at a woman&#x27;s feet. Stimpy&#x27;s design was inspired by a Tweety cartoon called &quot;A Gruesome Twosome&quot;, where the cats in the animation had big noses.

When Nickelodeon approached Kricfalusi, he presented three shows, among them a variety show titled &quot;Your Gang&quot; or &quot;Our Gang&quot; with a live-action host presenting different cartoons, each cartoon parodying a different genre. Ren and Stimpy were pets of one of the children in &quot;Your Gang&quot;, serving as a parody of the &quot;cat and dog genre&quot;. The network&#x27;s vice president of animation production Vanessa Coffey was dissatisfied with the other projects but liked Ren and Stimpy, singling them out for their own series. Production of the series&#x27; pilot episode began in the summer of 1989 after Kricfalusi pitched and sold &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; to Nickelodeon. The pilot was produced by Kricfalusi&#x27;s Los Angeles-based animation company, Spümcø, and screened at film festivals for several months before the show was announced in Nickelodeon&#x27;s 1991 cartoons line-up.

===Spümcø (1991–1993)===
The series premiered on August 11, 1991, alongside &quot;Doug&quot; and &quot;Rugrats&quot; as the original Nicktoons. Spümcø continued to produce the show for the next two years while encountering issues with Nickelodeon&#x27;s Standards and Practices department. The show was known for its lack of early merchandising; according to Wray, the initial lack of merchandise was &quot;the unique and radical thing&quot; about &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, as no toy company planned for any merchandise for the show, and Nickelodeon did not want to use &quot;over-exploitive&quot; merchandising.

Kricfalusi described his early period with Nickelodeon as being &quot;simple&quot;, as he got along with Coffey, the sole executive of the program. When another executive was added, they wanted to alter or discard some of the &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; episodes, but Kricfalusi says the episodes stayed intact since he did a &quot;trade&quot; with Coffey: he would have some &quot;really crazy&quot; episodes in exchange for some &quot;heart-warming&quot; episodes. Kricfalusi also said that the program was the &quot;safest project [he] ever worked on&quot; while explaining the meaning of &quot;safe&quot; as &quot;spend a third of what they spend now per picture, hire proven creative talent, and let them entertain.&quot; He estimated Spümcø&#x27;s run of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; cost around $6 million to produce.

The relationship between Kricfalusi and Nickelodeon deteriorated to the point where Kricfalusi would communicate with Nickelodeon only through his lawyer. News outlets and several of the series&#x27; staff ascribe the tension to episodes not being delivered promptly. Author Andy Mangels, writing for &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine, commented that &quot;Kricfalusi&#x27;s lax treatment of deadlines angered not only the networks, but his loyal viewers as well.&quot; However, some of the delays were attributed to Nickelodeon&#x27;s prolonged approval process and withdrawal of approval from scenes and episodes that had been previously approved. Another point of contention was the direction of the series. Kricfalusi cites the episode &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; as the primary reason for his dismissal; the character George Liquor is depicted in the episode as an abusive father figure, and Nickelodeon did not want the show to be so frightening and dramatic.

===Games Animation (1993–1996)===
Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi&#x27;s contract in late September 1992 and offered him the position of consultant for &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;, but he refused to &quot;sell out&quot;. The network moved production from Spümcø to its newly founded animation studio, Games Animation, which later became Nickelodeon Animation Studio. Bob Camp replaced Kricfalusi as director, while West, having refused Kricfalusi&#x27;s request to leave along with him, voiced Ren in addition to Stimpy.

Fans and critics felt this was a turning point in the show, with the new episodes being a considerable step down from the standard of those that preceded them. Ted Drozdowski, resident critic of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, stated that &quot;the bloom faded&quot; on &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;. Animation historian Michael Barrier writes that while the creators of the Games episodes used crude jokes that were similar to those used by Kricfalusi, they did not &quot;find the material particularly funny; they were merely doing what was expected&quot;.

The series ended its original run on Nickelodeon on December 16, 1995, with &quot;A Scooter for Yaksmas&quot;, and had a total of five seasons and 51 episodes, although one episode from the final season, &quot;Sammy and Me/The Last Temptation&quot;, remained unaired. Almost a year later, the episode aired on Nickelodeon&#x27;s sister network, MTV, on October 20, 1996.

==Production==
===Process===
The animation production methods used in &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; were similar to those found in Golden Age cartoons of the early 20th century, where a director supervised the entire process. These methods are in contrast with animation production methods in the 1980s, where there was one director for animation and a different director for voice actors, and the cartoons were created with a &quot;top-down&quot; approach to tie in with toy production.

Animator Vincent Waller compared working on &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; in an interview: &quot;Working on &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; and &quot;SpongeBob&quot; was very similar. They&#x27;re both storyboard-driven shows, which means they give us an outline from a premise after the premise has been approved. We take the outline and expand on it, writing the dialogue and gags. That was very familiar.&quot;

===Animation===
The show&#x27;s aesthetics draw on Golden Age cartoons, particularly those of animator Bob Clampett from the 1940s in the way the characters&#x27; emotions powerfully distort their bodies. The show&#x27;s style emphasizes unique expressions, intense and specific acting and strong character poses. One of the show&#x27;s most notable visual trademarks is the detailed paintings of gruesome close-ups, along with the blotchy ink stains that on occasion replace the standard backgrounds, reminiscent of &quot;holes in reality or the vision of a person in a deep state of dementia&quot;. This style was developed from Clampett&#x27;s &quot;Baby Bottleneck&quot;, which features several scenes with color-cards for backgrounds. The show incorporated norms from &quot;the old system in TV and radio&quot; where the animation would feature sponsored products to tie in with the cartoon, but in lieu of real advertisements, it featured fake commercial breaks advertising nonexistent products, most notably &quot;Log&quot;.

Kricfalusi cited Carbunkle Cartoons, an animation studio headed by Bob Jaques and Kelly Armstrong, for beautifully animating the show&#x27;s best episodes, improving the acting with subtle nuances and wild animation that could not be done with overseas animation studios. Some of the show&#x27;s earlier episodes were rough to the point Kricfalusi felt the need to patch up the animation with sound effects and &quot;music bandaids&quot;, helping the segments &quot;play better, even though much of the animation and timing weren&#x27;t working on their own&quot;. KJ Dell&#x27;Antonia of &quot;Common Sense Media&quot; describes the show&#x27;s style as changing &quot;from intentionally rough to much more polished and plushie-toy ready.&quot;

===Voice acting===
Kricfalusi originally voiced Ren, styled after a demented Peter Lorre from the film &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. When Nickelodeon terminated Kricfalusi&#x27;s contract, Billy West, already the voice of Stimpy, took the role using a combination of Burl Ives, Kirk Douglas, and a slight &quot;south of the border accent&quot; for the rest of the Nickelodeon run. West voiced Stimpy for the Spümcø and Games Animation episodes, basing the voice on an &quot;amped-up&quot; Larry Fine. Some notable artists and performers who voiced incidental characters on the show were Frank Zappa (in his final public performance before his death), Jack Carter, Stan Freberg, Tommy Davidson, Randy Quaid, Gilbert Gottfried, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, Dom DeLuise, Phil Hartman, Mark Hamill and Soleil Moon Frye.

===Music===

&quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; features a wide variety of music, spanning rockabilly, folk, pop, jazz, classical music, jingles, and more. The opening theme, &quot;Dog Pound Hop&quot;, was performed by a group of Spümcø employees under the name &quot;Die Screaming Leiderhôsens&quot;; they include developer Jim Smith, animator Chris Reccardi and production assistant Scott Huml. Three &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; albums have been released. In 1993 a compilation album, &quot;You Eediot!&quot;, was released as a soundtrack album. The album&#x27;s front cover is a parody of The Beatles&#x27; 11th studio album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.

Stimpy&#x27;s rousing anthem titled &quot;Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy&quot; was composed by Chris Reccardi and written by Charlie Brissette and John Kricfalusi. A cover of this song, performed by Wax, is included on the 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits&quot;, produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.

==Controversy and censorship==
The program&#x27;s staff did not want to create an &quot;educational&quot; series, a stance that bothered Nickelodeon, leading to the series being criticized by parent groups. Some segments of the show were altered to exclude references to religion, politics, alcohol, violence, and tobacco. The episode &quot;Powdered Toast Man&quot; had a cross removed from the Pope&#x27;s hat and the credit was changed to &quot;the man with the pointy hat&quot;. The same episode had a segment featuring the burning of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights that was removed, while in &quot;Dog Show&quot;, the last name of the character George Liquor was removed, being changed to simply &quot;George, American&quot;. Many other episodes included someone smoking a cigar, pipe, or a cigarette.

Several episodes had violent, gruesome, or suggestive scenes shortened or removed, including a sequence involving a severed head, a close-up of Ren&#x27;s face being grated against a man&#x27;s stubble, and a scene that was shortened where Ren receives multiple punches to the stomach from a baby. In the second-season episode &quot;Sven Höek&quot;, during the scene where Ren fantasizes about Stimpy and his cousin Sven&#x27;s deaths after they break all of his prized possessions, his line &quot;Then...I&#x27;m going to gouge your eyes out...yeah...&quot; was cut. One infamous episode, &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, was banned by Nickelodeon for its violent content. Neither Nickelodeon nor MTV would air the episode. Years later on Spike TV, the show&#x27;s revival, &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;, debuted with this banned episode as their unofficial pilot, even receiving a TV-MA rating. Games Animation, however, was allowed to include more risqué content and even occasional graphic violence.

==Episodes==

The series ran for five seasons, spanning 52 episodes. The show was produced by Kricfalusi&#x27;s animation studio Spümcø for the first two seasons. Beginning with season three (1993–94), the show was produced by Nickelodeon&#x27;s Games Animation. The episode &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; was produced for season two, but the episode was shelved and debuted with the show&#x27;s 2003 reboot. Another episode, &quot;Sammy and Me / The Last Temptation&quot;, aired on MTV on October 20, 1996, almost a year after the original Nickelodeon run ended.

==Reception==

&quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; received widespread critical acclaim. Matt Groening, creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, praised the show for its outrageousness and called it &quot;the only good cartoon on TV&quot; other than &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; he was later critical of Kricfalusi&#x27;s firing. Terry Thoren, former CEO and president of Klasky Csupo, said that Kricfalusi &quot;tapped into an audience that was a lot hipper than anybody thought. He went where no man wanted to go before – the caca, booger humor&quot;. Jonathan Valania of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; called it &quot;high voltage yuks and industrial-strength weirdness&quot;, John Lyttle of &quot;The Independent&quot; described it as &quot;a gooey media meltdown, absolutely grotesque and instantly recognisable&quot; and did not consider it a children&#x27;s cartoon.

As of 2024, the first season of the show holds a rare 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 12 reviews from critics, though the remaining seasons have not been rated.

The show came to garner high ratings for Nickelodeon, having double the viewership of the other Nickelodeon cartoons for its first season and later averaging three times their viewership. Due to the first season&#x27;s high ratings, Nickelodeon renewed the series for twenty additional episodes in November 1991, alongside the second season of &quot;Rugrats&quot; and the second and third season of &quot;Doug&quot;. The show for a time was the most popular cable TV show, with several airings being the most-watched scripted cable TV show in 1993 in the United States. The show quickly developed a cult following in college campuses, and was included in the launch of Nickelodeon&#x27;s SNICK, a late-night block for shows that appeal to both children and adults.

==Legacy and influence==
The immediate influence of the show was the spawning of two &quot;clones&quot;. Kricfalusi&#x27;s previous employer Hanna-Barbera produced &quot;2 Stupid Dogs&quot;, in which Kricfalusi contributed jokes. Walt Disney Television Animation produced &quot;The Shnookums &amp; Meat Funny Cartoon Show&quot; to mimic the show&#x27;s success. The Disney series failed to gain any recognition and remained obscure.&quot;&quot; 

However, &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; had a wider influence on the future of animation. Mike Judge credits the success of &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; reruns on MTV for the network&#x27;s willingness to commission &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. Writer Larry Brody credits &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; for leading a new golden age of animation, as other networks followed Nickelodeon and invested in new cartoons, opening the way for more adult-oriented satirical shows like &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;.

David Feiss, an animation director on the first season of the show, went on to create Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Cow and Chicken&quot;. John Kricfalusi became a teacher of sorts for Fred Seibert, and was the first person Seibert called while looking for new talent for the project &quot;What A Cartoon!&quot;. Writer/animator Allan Neuwirth writes that &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; &quot;broke the mold&quot; and started several trends in TV animation, chiefly the revival of credits at the beginning of each episode, the use of grotesque close-ups, and a shift in cartoon color palettes to richer, more harmonious colors.

A direct influence can be seen in the series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; with the physically extreme drawings that contrast with the characters&#x27; usual appearance, the &quot;grotesque close-ups&quot;. Series veteran Vincent Waller currently serves as a showrunner on &quot;SpongeBob&quot;.

The characters became a cultural touchstone in the mid-1990s, and were featured in works such as the films &quot;Clueless&quot; (1995), &quot;The Cable Guy&quot;, and &quot;Jack&quot; (both 1996). &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; placed 31st in TV Guide&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; in 2002. The cover story of the October 2001 issue of &quot;Wizard&quot;, a magazine for comic book fans, listed the 100 Greatest Toons ever as selected by their readers, with &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; ranked at number 12. Other entertainment journals similarly hold &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; as one of the best cartoons of the &#x27;90s and cartoons for adults.

== Revivals==
===&quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot; (2003)===

In 2003, a reboot of the series helmed by John Kricfalusi, titled &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;, was launched on a late night programming block on Spike TV and was rated TV-MA. The new series is more adult-oriented than the original, and features an explicitly homosexual relationship between the main characters, strong profanity, graphic violence and female nudity.

Billy West declined to participate in &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;, saying that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t funny&quot; and joining it would have damaged his career. Eric Bauza subsequently replaced West as the voice of Stimpy in the series, while Kricfalusi reprised his roles as both Ren and Mr. Horse. The series premiered with the banned Nickelodeon episode &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, before debuting new episodes thereafter. From the first episode, fans and critics alike were put off by this revival, which featured the consumption of bodily fluids such as nasal mucus, saliva and vomit. Much like the original series, Kricfalusi showed apparent disregard for meeting production deadlines, with only three out of the ordered nine episodes being completed on time. After the first three episodes aired, Spike&#x27;s entire animation block was removed from its programming schedule and three more episodes, already in production and completed by the time &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot; was canceled, were subsequently released three years later in 2006 on the &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy: The Lost Episodes&quot; DVD.

===Appearances in Nicktoons crossover film and cancelled short===
In February 2016, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that characters from &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; were scheduled to appear in an upcoming &quot;Nicktoons&quot; feature-length film. Three months later, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Nickelodeon was in negotiations with Kricfalusi about another revival of the characters. Bob Camp and William Wray revealed in an April 2016 panel discussion that Kricfalusi was developing a new &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; short that would be shown in theaters with the third &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; film, and later said that they were &quot;not invited to that party&quot; and would not be involved with the short&#x27;s production. However, Kricfalusi later denied making such a cartoon on Twitter. Despite this, an animatic of the short that was originally made as a promotion for &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; before being cancelled was released as a bonus feature on the &quot;Cans Without Labels&quot; DVD in May 2019.

==Reboot==
On August 5, 2020, it was announced that a new &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; reboot has been greenlit by Comedy Central, along with &quot;Daria&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. Though a new creative staff has been employed, Billy West was expected to return along with a few of the original series&#x27; writers. Due to the sexual abuse allegations surrounding him, it has been confirmed that Kricfalusi will not be involved in the production of the new reboot nor will he receive any compensation from it. Originally set to be produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio, production on the reboot has been moved to Awesome Inc in October 2021, while Snipple Animation announced their involvement in September 2022. According to West, development was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, contrary to earlier rumors that the project had been canceled. Paramount Global (at the time operating as ViacomCBS), the parent company of Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, has not responded to requests for a comment about the status of the show, though West reiterated that it was still in production. On September 14, 2021, West confirmed that he was reprising his roles as Ren and Stimpy.

Other returning crew members from the original series include Bob Jaques, Chris Sauve and former Spümcø alumni Robyn Byrd, who previously advocated to get the reboot canceled.

==Home media==
===VHS, LaserDisc and UMD===
Sony Wonder initially distributed collections of episodes of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; on VHS, which were not grouped by air dates or season. For instance, &quot;The Classics Volume 1&quot; VHS was released in 1993 and included three episodes from Season 1 (&quot;Space Madness&quot;, &quot;Untamed World&quot; and &quot;Stimpy&#x27;s Invention&quot;), as well as the short segment &quot;Breakfast Tips&quot; and a &quot;Log&quot; commercial. Other Nickelodeon compilation tapes, including two themed after the &quot;SNICK&quot; programming block, were also released containing individual &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; cartoons.

Perhaps because of the show&#x27;s adult following, it was also granted a LaserDisc set (the only ever LaserDisc release from Sony Wonder, and one of the only few LaserDiscs of a Nickelodeon original series), &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show -- The Essential Collection: Classics I &amp; II&quot;, was released in 1995. This included all the episodes previously released on VHS from the Classics I and Classics II volumes, as well as the shorts included on said VHS releases.

Eventually, the rights for Nickelodeon&#x27;s programming on home video transferred from Sony to Paramount Home Video. Paramount only released one video of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;, &quot;Have Yourself a Stinky Little Christmas&quot;, which was a re-release of a Sony video from 1993.

In 2005, Paramount released &quot;The First Ten Cartoons&quot; on UMD, only for playback on Sony&#x27;s PSP portable video game system. Presumably due to poor sales of UMD movies and shows, no further episodes were released on the format.

===DVD===
====United States====
Time Life released several episodes of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; in a &quot;Best of&quot; set in September 2003. This set is now out of print. On October 12, 2004, Paramount Home Entertainment released the first two complete seasons in a three-disc box set; although the cover art and press materials said the episodes were &quot;uncut&quot;, a handful of episodes were edited, due to the use of Spike TV masters where Spike TV would cut some scenes from episodes to make room for longer commercial breaks. One of the episodes from the second season, &quot;Svën Höek&quot;, did have footage reinserted from a work-in-progress VHS tape, but with an editing machine timecode visible on-screen; the scene was later restored by fans. Three other episodes (&quot;Powdered Toast Man&quot;, &quot;Dog Show&quot;, and &quot;Big House Blues&quot;) contain extra footage that was not originally broadcast on Nickelodeon. The DVD set even includes the banned episode &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; as a bonus feature. A set for &quot;Seasons Three and a Half-ish&quot;, containing all of season three and the first half of season four up to &quot;It&#x27;s a Dog&#x27;s Life/Egg Yölkeo&quot;, followed on June 28, 2005. &quot;Season Five and Some More of Four&quot; completed the DVD release of the Nickelodeon series on September 20. Like the previous DVDs, some scenes were removed in these releases.

A two-disc set dubbed &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; was released on July 17, 2006, featuring both the aired and unaired episodes from &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon&quot;.

Paramount released &quot;The Almost Complete Series&quot; 9-disc set that combines the individual season discs into a single package, on February 6, 2018, and was re-released on January 11, 2022.

====Europe====
The original series was released entirely as a 9-disc set in Germany on October 4, 2013. After people said that two episodes on the second disc were not completely uncensored, Turbine Classics offered to send everybody proof of purchase of an uncensored disc. The set comprises a mix of the known US airings and the German TV airings which included some exclusive scenes of various episodes. Since the set is the first to include all scenes ever broadcast worldwide, it is considered the first truly uncensored DVD release of the series.

==Other media==
===Video games===
Seven action games based directly on the television series were released between 1992 and 1995.
* The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Space Cadet Adventures was developed by Imagineering, published by THQ and released for the Game Boy in November 1992. The game&#x27;s premise centers on Stimpy attempting to rescue a stranded Ren, who is simultaneously traversing alien worlds attempting to return to their ship. The game received middling reviews and was praised for its faithful humor and visuals but was criticized for its repetitive and unimaginative gameplay.
* The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Veediots! was developed by Gray Matter, published by THQ and released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy in October 1993. The game is composed of four stages based on episodes from the television series. Both versions of the game received middling reviews. The SNES version was praised for its faithful visuals and audio but was criticized for its repetitive stages, standard gameplay and sluggish controls. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; commented that the Game Boy version had good graphics but poor controls and challenge.
* The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Stimpy&#x27;s Invention was developed by BlueSky Software, published by Sega and released for the Sega Genesis in November 1993. The game&#x27;s premise follows Ren and Stimpy as they travel through their neighborhood and collect scattered pieces of Stimpy&#x27;s latest invention, the Mutate-O-Matic. The game features a two-player mode in which each player controls one of the two titular characters. The reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the game&#x27;s faithful and humorous visuals and audio but derided the two-player mode as &quot;more aggravating than fun&quot; and &quot;twice as hard as a one-player [game]&quot;.
* Quest for the Shaven Yak Starring Ren Hoëk &amp; Stimpy was developed by Realtime Associates, published by Sega and released for the Game Gear in November 1993. It was also released for the Master System in Brazil in 1995. The game&#x27;s premise centers on Ren and Stimpy&#x27;s mission to return the hooves of the Great Shaven Yak. Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the music as &quot;worth the price of admission&quot; and the graphics as &quot;very good by Game Gear standards&quot;.
* The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Buckeroo$! was developed by Imagineering, published by THQ, and released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1993, and for the SNES in April 1995. The game features twelve levels based on the television episodes &quot;Space Madness&quot;, &quot;Out West&quot;, and &quot;Robin Höek&quot;. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;&#x27;s review noted that the NES version&#x27;s graphics &quot;capture the artistic flavor of the cartoon series&quot; but criticized the poor controls and unengaging game elements. Conversely, the SNES version was commended for having more gameplay variety than previous &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; titles, but the graphics were described as &quot;[not] very &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;ish&quot;.
* The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Fire Dogs was developed by Argonaut Software, published by THQ, and released for the SNES in March 1994. The game is split into two distinct parts; in the first part, the player controls Stimpy, who must traverse through a firehouse and gather all the equipment for a firetruck in a limited time while avoiding the Fire Chief, while the second part puts the player in control of both Ren and Stimpy, who must catch items that are thrown out of a burning building. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; commended the game&#x27;s graphics, humor, audio, and inclusion of a password feature but criticized the lack of variety, limited time allotted for collecting items, and repetition of the two levels.
* The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Time Warp was developed by Sculptured Software, published by THQ, and released for the SNES in October 1994. The game&#x27;s premise centers on Ren and Stimpy&#x27;s efforts to navigate through time and stop Muddy Mudskipper from ruining history. The reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; praised the game&#x27;s animations and various attacks but stated that the controls &quot;could be tweaked up a little more&quot;. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the game, rating it one star out of five, and stated that &quot;When Nickelodeon fired creator John Kricfalusi, the heart, and soul were sucked out of the pair. This game puts the final nail in the coffin.&quot;

Aside from these dedicated titles, Ren, Stimpy, and other characters from the series make appearances in the Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker, &quot;Nicktoons Racing&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Nicktoons MLB&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway&quot;, and &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2&quot;. A &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; game by Acclaim Entertainment was planned for the Atari Lynx but never released.

===Comic books===
Marvel Comics optioned the rights to produce comic books based on Nickelodeon properties in 1992. The initial plan was to have an anthology comic featuring several Nicktoons properties. Marvel produced 44 issues of the ongoing series, along with several specials under the &quot;Marvel Absurd&quot; imprint. Most of these were written by comic scribe Dan Slott.

One &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; special #3, &quot;Masters of Time and Space&quot;, was set up as a &quot;Choose Your Adventure&quot; and with a time travel plot, took Slott six months to plot out in his spare time. It was designed so that it was possible to choose a path that would eventually be 20 pages longer than the comic itself. Issue #6 of the series starred Spider-Man battling Powdered Toast Man.

The editors named the &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; section &quot;Ask Dr. Stupid&quot;, and at least one letter in every column would be a direct question for Dr. Stupid to answer. This comic series lasted from December 1992 – July 1996.

===Cancelled film adaptation===
In May 1993, Nickelodeon and 20th Century Fox signed a two-year production deal for the development and production of both animated and live-action feature-length films based on their new or existing properties; &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; was mentioned as a possible property for development, alongside &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;Doug&quot;. However, the show&#x27;s &quot;cynical and gross humor&quot; was a poor fit for a conventional, &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; family film. After the deal expired with no films produced, Nickelodeon would later start its own film studio after parent company Viacom purchased Paramount Pictures, which would distribute Nickelodeon&#x27;s films instead of Fox.

At the Wizard World Cleveland convention in March 2017, Camp revealed that Paramount rejected a pitch for a &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; feature-length film due to the &quot;sour taste&quot; left by &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;&quot;, and as such, the studio did not want any further connection with the characters.

<doc id="25913" wikidata="Q55673" url="?curid=25913" title="R-Type">
<text>is a horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game developed and released by Irem in 1987 and the first game in the &quot;R-Type&quot; series. The player controls a star ship, the R-9 &quot;Arrowhead&quot;, in its efforts to destroy the Bydo, a powerful alien race bent on wiping out all of mankind. The R-9 can acquire a glowing orbicular device called a &quot;Force&quot;, protecting it from enemy fire and providing additional firepower. The arcade version was distributed by Nintendo in North America; it is the last arcade title Nintendo distributed.

&quot;R-Type&quot; was the first game to run on Irem&#x27;s 16-bit M72 arcade system. The development team drew inspiration from &quot;Gradius&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot; and works by H.R. Giger. The music was composed by Masato Ishizaki, while character designs were by Akio Oyabu. The game&#x27;s title stems from the word &quot;ray&quot;, as in a ray of light, in reference to the player&#x27;s raylike weapons used throughout the game.

&quot;R-Type&quot; was commercially successful and celebrated by critics for its graphics and addictive gameplay, but was criticized for its difficulty. It is commonly cited as one of the best shoot &#x27;em up video games, and one of the greatest video games of all time. Its success inspired several sequel and spinoff games, and home ports and releases for digital distribution services. A remake of the game was released as &quot;R-Type DX&quot; for the Game Boy Color in 2000. A 3D remake, &quot;R-Type Dimensions&quot;, was released for the Xbox 360 in 2009; for the PlayStation 3 in 2014; for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2018; and for iOS in 2019.

==Gameplay==
The game has a generally slower pace than similar shooting games of the time and emphasizes enemy pattern memorization as much as player speed. It is composed of eight levels, with a boss enemy at the end of each. The player controls a small spacecraft and must navigate terrain and fight enemies using the various ship weapons. The player&#x27;s spacecraft has, by default, a weak but rapid-firing main gun; and a more powerful gun called the Wave Cannon, which requires the player to hold their fire to build up power for the cannon.

During the game, the player can obtain an auxiliary device called a Force. This resembles a glowing orange ball. The Force can be attached to the front or back of the player&#x27;s spacecraft, or detached to fly freely. When attached, the Force provides one of three different powerful weapons, in addition to the main gun and the Wave Cannon.

When detached, these weapons cannot be used, but the Force will instead resort to a secondary set of guns, which can be fired by the player even if the Force is at a distance from the spacecraft. The Force has a secondary use as a shield; it is completely indestructible and can block most things fired at it, as well as damage or destroy enemies on contact. Game designer AKIBO mentioned the behavior of dung beetles as an inspiration for the Force.

The R- in the series title stands for &quot;ray&quot;, as in a ray of light, in reference to the many different types of rayed weapons that players use in the series.

==Development==

Development on the Commodore 64 version began when Activision&#x27;s Electric Dreams Software subsidiary obtained the rights. David Jolliff was planning on to program the game with James Smart assisting in program help. The original version was shelved, and as a result of the settlement between the creators of &quot;Katakis&quot; and Activision, Manfred Trenz of Rainbow Arts had the right to do a port, which was made in six weeks.

==Release==
Hudson Soft developed a fairly accurate port of R-Type that was released for the TurboGrafx-16 (a.k.a. PC Engine) console, although it suffered from a slightly lower resolution, reduced colour palette, sprite flickering and slowdown. Due to the slightly reduced resolution, the playfield also scrolls slightly in the vertical axis whenever the player&#x27;s ship approaches the top or bottom of the screen. The Japanese release was split across two game cards (HuCards) titled and and the later North American release contained the entire game on a single card. The TurboGrafx-16 version of &quot;R-Type&quot; has a boss at the end of Stage 6, rather than a prolonged wave of enemies as in all other versions.

The Xbox Live Arcade game &quot;R-Type Dimensions&quot; was released on February 4, 2009, by Tozai Games. It is a port of the original &quot;R-Type&quot; and the sequel &quot;R-Type II&quot;. It can be played either with the original 2D graphics or with new 3D graphics, and has added co-op gameplay functionality. An analogous version for PS3 has been released in May, 2014.

The TurboGrafx-16 version of &quot;R-Type&quot; was one of the first games confirmed for Nintendo&#x27;s Virtual Console. The Japanese release for the Wii is split between two downloads, mirroring the original format of the game. The Japanese releases for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U use the North American version instead of the Japanese one, presenting the game as a single download; however, the game was removed from the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U stores on July 30, 2020.

The Master System version became available as well on the Virtual Console for Japan on May 19, 2009, for North America on November 2, 2009, and for Europe on September 25, 2009; however, due to licensing issues, this version was delisted on September 30, 2011, in North America and Europe and October 18, 2011, in Japan.

In 2010, DotEmu developed an iOS port of &quot;R-Type&quot;, published by Electronic Arts, released also for Android in September 2011.

Tozai Games returned in 2018 and re-issued an updated digital-only release of &quot;R-Type Dimensions&quot;, now carrying the title &quot;R-Type Dimensions EX&quot;, now landing on Steam, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. Strictly Limited Games released physical copies of the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch versions in February 2019. These were limited to 2,000 and 3,000 copies respectively. Collector&#x27;s Edition variants were also issued which contained a hardcover artbook, dog tags, stickers and cards, once again limited to 1,000 on the PlayStation 4 and 2,000 on the Nintendo Switch.

==Reception==
===Arcade===
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;R-Type&quot; on their August 1, 1987 issue as being the most-successful table arcade cabinet of the month. It went on to be Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing table arcade game of 1987. Later in 1988, it was the year&#x27;s third highest-grossing arcade conversion kit and sixth highest overall arcade game.

The original &quot;R-Type&quot; was well received by most gaming critics. However, it was also infamous for its relentless difficulty. Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; selected &quot;R-Type&quot; as the &quot;game of the month&quot; in July 1987. The following month, &quot;Commodore User&quot; magazine gave it a highly positive review and noted that it drew large crowds queuing up at arcades.

===Consoles===
According to &quot;Mega Guide&quot; in 1992, &quot;R-Type&quot; had sold &quot;squillions on hand-held&quot;.

A successful 1988 port to the Master System was immediately recognized as one of the best games available in the Sega library. A &quot;Mean Machines&quot; magazine review praised in particular the graphics and the high quality of the challenge offered by the game, awarding it an overall rating of 92%. In 1989, &quot;ACE&quot; listed it as one of the top five best games available for both the PC Engine and Master System.

A 1995 article in &quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that the &quot;PC Engine [TurboGrafx-16] conversion of Irem&#x27;s arcade smash &quot;R-Type&quot; is still regarded as the system&#x27;s definitive contribution to the shoot &#x27;em up genre.&quot; The following year they listed both it and the arcade original (but not any other ports of the game) at number 98 in their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, praising its art direction, graphics, design innovations, and huge bosses.

In a retrospective review, Allgame editor Shawn Sackenheim described the TurboGrafx-16 version of R-Type as &quot;(the) most accurate home conversion (of the arcade version) of the game&quot;, furthermore stating that &quot;it&#x27;s the shooter that started it all and it&#x27;s still a thrill ride from beginning to end&quot;.

===Computers===
The ZX Spectrum version of &quot;R-Type&quot; was awarded 9/10 in the January 1989 issue of &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; and was placed at number 6 in their official top 100. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; praised the &quot;incredible use of colour&quot; and that it &quot;blows away almost every other shoot&#x27;em up on the Spectrum&quot;. &quot;Crash&quot; congratulated Electric Dreams for &quot;retaining the frenetic arcade feel and producing such a brilliant game&quot;. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; praised the weapons system and difficulty curve. &quot;C+VG&quot; concluded their review by saying &quot;an excellent shoot&#x27;em up that&#x27;s both challenging and addictive. An absolute must for Spectrum blasting fanatics&quot;.

The game was runner-up in the category of Best 8-Bit Coin-Op Conversion of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, behind &quot;Operation Wolf&quot;.

The implementation of the music in the C64 version was well received, however this port got average reviews due to performance issues and glitches.

==Legacy==
Irem has developed a number of sequels and related games, including &quot;R-Type II&quot; and &quot;Armed Police Unit Gallop&quot;. Their &quot;XMultiply&quot;, although not part of the series, has similar themes and gameplay, and was released around the same time as &quot;R-Type II&quot;. However, before any of these games was &quot;Katakis&quot;, a 1987 clone produced by Factor 5 for the Commodore 64 and the Amiga.

In 1991, Konami released &quot;Xexex&quot;, a game heavily influenced by &quot;R-Type&quot; and &quot;XMultiply&quot;. The game used similar weapons and concepts, such as the &quot;Flint&quot; being a combination of &quot;R-Type&quot; Force and &quot;X Multiply&quot; tentacle equipment.

Other games similar to &quot;R-Type&quot; are &quot;Rezon&quot;, released by Allumer in 1991, Aicom&#x27;s &quot;Pulstar&quot; and &quot;Blazing Star&quot; (the latter published under Yumekobo) for the Neo Geo, and Technosoft&#x27;s 1992 title &quot;Thunder Force IV&quot; for the Sega Genesis.

On April 1, 2019, Granzella announced the development of R-Type Final 2, a sequel to R-Type Final.

Chris Huelsbeck composed new title songs for Amiga and Commodore 64 versions which have remained as popular targets for game music remixers. Anthem-like Amiga theme is composed by Huelsbeck alone while C64&#x27;s faster theme is composed by Huelsbeck with Ramiro Vaca.

<text>Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich ( , ; 7 March 1904 – 4 June 1942) was a German high-ranking SS and police official during the Nazi era and a principal architect of the Holocaust. He held the rank of SS-. Many historians regard Heydrich as one of the darkest figures within the Nazi regime, and Adolf Hitler described him as &quot;the man with the iron heart.&quot;

Heydrich was chief of the Reich Security Main Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD). He was also (Deputy/Acting Reich-Protector) of Bohemia and Moravia. He served as president of the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC, now known as Interpol) and chaired the January 1942 Wannsee Conference which formalised plans for the &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish question&quot;—the deportation and genocide of all Jews in German-occupied Europe.

He was the founding head of the (Security Service, SD), an intelligence organisation charged with seeking out and neutralising resistance to the Nazi Party via arrests, deportations, and murders. He helped organise , a series of coordinated attacks against Jews throughout Nazi Germany and parts of Austria on 9–10 November 1938. The attacks were carried out by SA stormtroopers and civilians and presaged the Holocaust. Upon his arrival in Prague, Heydrich sought to eliminate opposition to the Nazi occupation by suppressing Czech culture and deporting and executing members of the Czech resistance. He was directly responsible for the , the special task forces that travelled in the wake of the German armies and murdered more than two million people by mass shooting and gassing including 1.3 million Jews.

Heydrich was mortally wounded in Prague on 27 May 1942 as a result of Operation Anthropoid. He was ambushed by a team of Czech and Slovak soldiers who had been sent by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile to kill him; the team was trained by the British Special Operations Executive. Heydrich died from his injuries on 4 June 1942. Nazi intelligence falsely linked the Czech and Slovak soldiers and resistance partisans to the villages of Lidice and Ležáky. Both villages were razed; the men and boys age 14 and above were shot and most of the women and children were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps.

==Early life==
Reinhard Tristan Eugen Heydrich was born in 1904 in Halle an der Saale to composer and opera singer Richard Bruno Heydrich and his wife, Elisabeth Anna Maria Amalia Heydrich (née Krantz). His father came from a Protestant family, but converted to Elisabeth&#x27;s Roman Catholic faith upon marriage. Reinhard was an altar boy, attending evening prayers and Mass every week with his mother as part of the Catholic minority in Halle. Two of his forenames were musical references: &quot;Reinhard&quot; referred to the hero from his father&#x27;s opera &quot;Amen&quot;, and &quot;Tristan&quot; stems from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. Heydrich&#x27;s third name, &quot;Eugen&quot;, was his late maternal grandfather&#x27;s forename (Eugen Krantz had been the director of the Dresden Royal Conservatory).

Heydrich&#x27;s family held social standing and substantial financial means. Music was a part of Heydrich&#x27;s everyday life; his father founded the Halle Conservatory of Music, Theatre, and Teaching and his mother taught piano there. As the oldest son, Reinhard was expected to inherit his father&#x27;s music conservatory and was trained in music by his father. He learned the piano and violin by the time he was six years old. Heydrich developed a passion for the violin and carried that interest into adulthood; he impressed listeners with his musical talent.

His father was a German nationalist with loyalties to the Kaiser, who instilled patriotic ideas in his three children but was not affiliated with any political party until after World War I. The household was strict. Heydrich, initially a frail and sickly youth, was encouraged by his parents to exercise to build up his strength. He engaged his younger brother, Heinz, in mock fencing duels. He excelled in his schoolwork at the secular &quot;Reformgymnasium&quot;, especially in the sciences. A talented athlete, he became an expert swimmer and fencer. He was shy, insecure, and was frequently bullied for his high-pitched voice and rumoured Jewish ancestry. These rumours increased after his maternal uncle Hans Krantz married a Hungarian Jew named Iza Jarmy. His family maintained cordial relations with the Jewish community; many Jewish students attended the Halle Conservatory, and its cellar was rented out to a Jewish salesman. Heydrich was friends with Abraham Lichtenstein, son of the cantor.

In 1918, World War I ended with Germany&#x27;s defeat. In late February 1919, civil unrest—including strikes and clashes between communist and anti-communist groups—took place in Heydrich&#x27;s home town of Halle. Under Defense Minister Gustav Noske&#x27;s directives, a right-wing paramilitary unit was formed and ordered to &quot;recapture&quot; Halle. Heydrich, then 15 years old, joined Maercker&#x27;s Volunteer Rifles (a paramilitary Freikorps unit). This was largely symbolic, as Heydrich was too young for military service. There is no evidence that he participated in the fighting, and when the skirmishes ended, he was part of the force assigned to protect private property. Heydrich began to form positive opinions about the &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement and anti-communism, as well as a distaste for the Treaty of Versailles and the positioning of the German-Polish border. Heydrich stated he joined the &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund&quot; (National German Protection and Shelter League), an antisemitic organisation. However, there is very little documentation of this, beyond a single postcard he received.

As a result of the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles as well as Germany&#x27;s large war debt, hyperinflation spread across Germany and many lost their life savings. Halle was not spared. By 1921, few townspeople there could afford a musical education at Bruno Heydrich&#x27;s conservatory. This led to a financial crisis for the Heydrich family.

==Naval career==
In 1922, Heydrich joined the German Navy (&quot;Reichsmarine&quot;), taking advantage of the security, structure, and pension it offered. He became a naval cadet at Kiel, Germany&#x27;s primary naval base. Many of Heydrich&#x27;s fellow cadets falsely regarded him as Jewish. To counteract these rumours, Heydrich told people he had joined several antisemitic and nationalist organisations, such as the &quot;Deutschvölkischer Schutz und Trutzbund&quot;. On 1 April 1924 he was promoted to senior midshipman (&quot;Oberfähnrich zur See&quot;) and sent to officer training at the Naval Academy Mürwik. In 1926 he advanced to the rank of ensign (&quot;Leutnant zur See&quot;) and was assigned as a signals officer on the battleship SMS &quot;Schleswig-Holstein&quot;, the flagship of Germany&#x27;s North Sea Fleet. With the promotion came greater recognition. He received good evaluations from his superiors and had few problems with other crewmen. He was promoted on 1 July 1928 to the rank of first lieutenant.

Heydrich became notorious for his numerous affairs. In December 1930 he attended a rowing-club ball and met Lina von Osten. They became romantically involved and soon announced their engagement. Lina was already a Nazi Party follower and antisemite; she had attended her first rally in 1929. Early in 1931 Heydrich was charged with &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman&quot; for a breach of promise, having been engaged to marry another woman he had known for six months before the Lina von Osten engagement. Admiral Erich Raeder dismissed Heydrich from the navy in April. He received severance pay of 200 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; () a month for the next two years. Heydrich married Lina in December 1931.

==Career in the SS==
On 30 May 1931, Heydrich&#x27;s discharge from the navy became legally binding, and either the following day or on 1 June he joined the Nazi Party in Hamburg. Six weeks later, on 14 July, he joined the SS. His party number was 544,916 and his SS number was 10,120. Those who joined the party after Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power in January 1933 faced suspicions from the &quot;Alte Kämpfer&quot; (Old Fighters; the earliest party members) that they had joined for reasons of career advancement rather than a true commitment to Nazi ideology. Heydrich&#x27;s date of enlistment in 1931 was early enough to quell suspicion that he had joined only to further his career, but was not early enough for him to be considered an Old Fighter.

In 1931, Heinrich Himmler began setting up a counterintelligence division of the SS. Acting on the advice of his associate Karl von Eberstein, who was Lina&#x27;s friend and Heydrich&#x27;s godbrother, Himmler agreed to interview Heydrich, but cancelled their appointment at the last minute. Lina ignored this message, packed Heydrich&#x27;s suitcase, and sent him to Munich. Eberstein met Heydrich at the railway station and took him to see Himmler. Himmler asked Heydrich to convey his ideas for developing an SS intelligence service. Himmler was so impressed that he hired Heydrich immediately.

Although the starting monthly salary of 180 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; () was low, Heydrich decided to take the job because Lina&#x27;s family supported the Nazi movement, and the quasi-military and revolutionary nature of the post appealed to him. At first he had to share an office and typewriter with a colleague, but by 1932 Heydrich was earning 290 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; a month (), a salary he described as &quot;comfortable&quot;. As his power and influence grew throughout the 1930s, his wealth grew commensurately; in 1935 he received a base salary of 8,400 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; () and an allowance of 12,000 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; () and by 1938 his income increased to 17,371 &quot;Reichsmarks&quot; (), annually. Heydrich later received a Totenkopfring from Himmler for his SS service.

On 1 August 1931, Heydrich began his job as chief of the new &#x27;Ic Service&#x27; (intelligence service). He set up office at the Brown House, the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich. By October he had created a network of spies and informers for intelligence-gathering purposes and to obtain information to be used as blackmail to further political aims. Information on thousands of people was recorded on index cards and stored at the Brown House. To mark the occasion of Heydrich&#x27;s December wedding, Himmler promoted him to the rank of SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; (major).

In 1932, rumours were spread by Heydrich&#x27;s enemies of his alleged Jewish ancestry. Wilhelm Canaris said he had obtained copies of documents proving Heydrich&#x27;s Jewish ancestry. Nazi Gauleiter Rudolf Jordan claimed Heydrich was not a pure Aryan. Within the Nazi organisation such innuendo could be damning, even for the head of the Reich&#x27;s counterintelligence service. Gregor Strasser passed the allegations on to the Nazi Party&#x27;s racial expert, Achim Gercke, who investigated Heydrich&#x27;s genealogy. Gercke reported that Heydrich was &quot;... of German origin and free from any coloured and Jewish blood&quot;. He insisted that the rumours were baseless. Even so, Heydrich privately engaged SD member Ernst Hoffmann to further investigate and dispel the rumours.

===Gestapo and SD===

In mid-1932, Himmler appointed Heydrich chief of the renamed security service—the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD). Heydrich&#x27;s counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror and intimidation. With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states. They began with Bavaria. In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using intimidation tactics. Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the political police.

In 1933, Hitler became Chancellor of Germany, and through a series of decrees became Germany&#x27;s &quot;Führer und Reichskanzler&quot; (leader and chancellor). The first concentration camps, which were originally intended to house political opponents, were established in early 1933. By year&#x27;s end there were over fifty camps.

Hermann Göring founded the Gestapo in 1933 as a Prussian police force. When Göring transferred full authority over the Gestapo to Himmler in April 1934, it immediately became an instrument of terror under the SS&#x27;s purview. Himmler named Heydrich to head the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Also in April, Göring made Heydrich an advisor to the Prussian government with an appointment to the Prussian State Council. On 9 June 1934, Rudolf Hess declared the SD the official Nazi intelligence service.

===Crushing the SA===

Beginning in April 1934, and at Hitler&#x27;s request, Heydrich and Himmler began building a dossier on &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) leader Ernst Röhm in an effort to remove him as a rival for party leadership. At this point, the SS was still part of the SA, the early Nazi paramilitary organisation which now numbered over 3 million men. At Hitler&#x27;s direction, Heydrich, Himmler, Göring, and Viktor Lutze drew up lists of those who should be killed, starting with seven top SA officials and including many more. On 30 June 1934 the SS and Gestapo acted in coordinated mass arrests that continued for two days. Röhm was shot without trial, along with the leadership of the SA. The purge became known as the Night of the Long Knives. Up to 200 people were killed in the action. Lutze was appointed SA&#x27;s new head and it was converted into a sports and training organisation.

With the SA out of the way, Heydrich began building the Gestapo into an instrument of fear. He improved his index-card system, creating categories of offenders with colour-coded cards. The Gestapo had the authority to arrest citizens on the suspicion that they might commit a crime, and the definition of a crime was at their discretion. The Gestapo Law, passed in 1936, gave police the right to act extra-legally. This led to the sweeping use of &quot;Schutzhaft&quot;—&quot;protective custody&quot;, a euphemism for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings. The courts were not allowed to investigate or interfere. The Gestapo was considered to be acting legally as long as it was carrying out the leadership&#x27;s will. People were arrested arbitrarily, sent to concentration camps, or killed.

Himmler began developing the notion of a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church in favour of the &quot;Gottgläubig&quot; movement. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only felt he could no longer be a member, but came to consider the church&#x27;s political power and influence a danger to the state.

===Consolidating the police forces===

On 17 June 1936, all police forces throughout Germany were united, following Hitler&#x27;s appointment of Himmler as Chief of German Police. With this appointment by Hitler, Himmler and his &quot;de facto&quot; deputy, Heydrich, became two of the most powerful men in the internal administration of Germany. Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups: the &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot; (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Secret State Police; Gestapo) and &quot;Kriminalpolizei&quot; (Criminal Police; Kripo). At that point, Heydrich was head of the SiPo and SD. Heinrich Müller was the Gestapo&#x27;s operations chief.

Heydrich was assigned to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda aims of the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of &quot;Der Stürmer&quot;. For his part in the games&#x27; success, Heydrich was awarded the &quot;Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen&quot; or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).

In January 1937, Heydrich directed the SD to secretly begin collecting and analysing public opinion and report back its findings. He then had the Gestapo carry out house searches, arrests, and interrogations, thus in effect exercising control over public opinion. In February 1938 when the Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resisted Hitler&#x27;s proposed merger with Germany, Heydrich intensified the pressure on Austria by organising Nazi demonstrations and distributing propaganda in Vienna emphasising the common Germanic blood of the two countries. In the &quot;Anschluss&quot; on 12 March, Hitler declared the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany.

In mid-1939, Heydrich created the Stiftung Nordhav Foundation to obtain real estate for the SS and Security Police to use as guest houses and vacation spots. The Wannsee Villa, which Stiftung Nordhav acquired in November 1940, was the site of the Wannsee Conference (20 January 1942). Heydrich was the lead speaker. At Wannsee, senior Nazi officials formalised plans to deport and exterminate all Jews in German-occupied territory and those countries not yet conquered. This action was to be coordinated among the representatives from the Nazi state agencies present at the meeting.

On 27 September 1939, the SD and SiPo—made up of the Gestapo and the Criminal Police, or Kripo—were folded into the new Reich Security Main Office or &quot;Reichssicherheitshauptamt&quot; (RSHA), which was placed under Heydrich&#x27;s control. The title of &quot;Chef der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD&quot; (Chief of Security Police and SD) or CSSD was conferred on Heydrich on 1 October. Heydrich became the president of the International Criminal Police Commission (later known as Interpol) on 24 August 1940, and its headquarters were transferred to Berlin. He was promoted to SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer und General der Polizei&quot; on 24 September 1941.

===Red Army purges===
In 1936, Heydrich learned that a top-ranking Soviet officer was plotting to overthrow Joseph Stalin. Sensing an opportunity to strike a blow at both the Soviet Army and Admiral Canaris of Germany&#x27;s Abwehr, Heydrich decided that the Soviet officer should be &quot;unmasked&quot;. He discussed the matter with Himmler and both in turn brought it to Hitler&#x27;s attention. Hitler approved Heydrich&#x27;s plan to act immediately. But the &quot;information&quot; Heydrich had received was actually misinformation planted by Stalin himself in an attempt to legitimise his planned purges of the Red Army&#x27;s high command. Stalin ordered one of his best NKVD agents, General Nikolai Skoblin, to pass Heydrich false information suggesting that Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other Soviet generals were plotting against Stalin.

Heydrich&#x27;s SD forged documents and letters implicating Tukhachevsky and other Red Army commanders. The material was delivered to the NKVD. The Great Purge of the Red Army followed on Stalin&#x27;s orders. While Heydrich believed they had deluded Stalin into executing or dismissing 35,000 of his officer corps, the importance of Heydrich&#x27;s part is a matter of conjecture. Soviet military prosecutors did not use SD forged documents against the generals in their secret trial; they instead relied on false confessions extorted or beaten out of the defendants.

===Night-and-Fog decree===

By late 1940, German armies had invaded most of Western Europe. The following year, Heydrich&#x27;s SD was given responsibility for carrying out the &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; (Night-and-Fog) decree. According to the decree, &quot;persons endangering German security&quot; were to be arrested in a maximally discreet way: &quot;under the cover of night and fog&quot;. People disappeared without a trace with no one told of their whereabouts or fate. For each prisoner, the SD had to fill in a questionnaire that listed personal information, country of origin, and the details of their crimes against the Reich. This questionnaire was placed in an envelope inscribed with a seal reading &quot;Nacht und Nebel&quot; and submitted to the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA). In the WVHA &quot;Central Inmate File&quot;, as in many camp files, these prisoners would be given a special &quot;covert prisoner&quot; code, as opposed to the code for POW, Felon, Jew, Gypsy, etc. The decree remained in effect after Heydrich&#x27;s death. The exact number of people who vanished under it has never been positively established, but it is estimated to be 7,000.

===Anti-Polish policies===
Heydrich created the &quot;Zentralstelle IIP Polen&quot; unit of the Gestapo to coordinate the ethnic cleansing of Poles in &quot;Operation Tannenberg&quot; and the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot;, two codenames for extermination actions directed at the Polish people during the German occupation of Poland. Among the 100,000 people murdered in the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; operations in 1939–1940, approximately 61,000 were members of the Polish intelligentsia: scholars, clergy, former officers, and others, whom the Germans identified as political targets in the &quot;Special Prosecution Book-Poland&quot;, compiled before the war began in September 1939.

===Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia===
On 27 September 1941, Heydrich was appointed Deputy Reich Protector of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia (the part of Czechoslovakia incorporated into the Reich on 15 March 1939) and assumed control of the territory. The Reich Protector, Konstantin von Neurath, remained the territory&#x27;s titular head, but was sent on &quot;leave&quot; because Hitler, Himmler, and Heydrich felt his &quot;soft approach&quot; to the Czechs had promoted anti-German sentiment and encouraged anti-German resistance via strikes and sabotage. Upon his appointment, Heydrich told his aides: &quot;We will Germanize the Czech vermin.&quot;

Heydrich came to Prague to enforce policy, fight resistance to the Nazi regime, and keep up production quotas of Czech motors and arms that were &quot;extremely important to the German war effort&quot;. He viewed the area as a bulwark of Germandom and condemned the Czech resistance&#x27;s &quot;stabs in the back&quot;. To realise his goals, Heydrich demanded racial classification of those who could and could not be Germanized. He explained, &quot;Making this Czech garbage into Germans must give way to methods based on racist thought.&quot;

Heydrich started his rule by terrorising the population: he proclaimed martial law, and 142 people were executed within five days of his arrival in Prague. Their names appeared on posters throughout the occupied country. Most of them were the members of the resistance that had previously been captured and were awaiting trial.

According to Heydrich&#x27;s estimate, between 4,000 and 5,000 people were arrested and between 400 and 500 were executed by February 1942. Those who were not executed were sent to Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, where only four per cent of Czech prisoners survived the war. Czech prime minister Alois Eliáš was among those arrested the first day. He was put on trial in Berlin and sentenced to death, but was kept alive as a hostage. He was later executed in retaliation for Heydrich&#x27;s assassination.

In March 1942, further sweeps against Czech cultural and patriotic organisations, the military, and the intelligentsia resulted in the practical paralysis of the London-based Czech resistance. Almost all avenues by which Czechs could express the Czech culture in public were closed. Although small disorganised cells of Central Leadership of Home Resistance (Ústřední vedení odboje domácího, ÚVOD) survived, only the communist resistance was able to function in a coordinated manner (although it also suffered arrests). The terror also served to paralyse resistance in society, with public and widespread reprisals by the Nazis against any action resisting German rule. Heydrich&#x27;s brutal policies during that time quickly earned him the nickname &quot;the Butcher of Prague&quot;. The reprisals are referred to by Czechs as the &quot;Heydrichiáda&quot;.

As Acting Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Heydrich applied carrot-and-stick methods. Labor was reorganised on the basis of the German Labour Front. Heydrich used equipment confiscated from the Czech gymnastics organisation Sokol to organise events for workers. Food rations and free shoes were distributed, pensions were increased, and (for a time) free Saturdays were introduced. Unemployment insurance was established for the first time. The black market was suppressed. Those associated with it or the resistance movement were tortured or executed. Heydrich labelled them &quot;economic criminals&quot; and &quot;enemies of the people&quot;, which helped gain him support. Conditions in Prague and the rest of the Czech lands were relatively peaceful under Heydrich, and industrial output increased. Still, those measures could not hide shortages and increasing inflation; reports of growing discontent multiplied.

Despite public displays of goodwill towards the populace, privately Heydrich was very clear about his eventual goal: &quot;This entire area will one day be definitely German, and the Czechs have nothing to expect here.&quot; Eventually up to two-thirds of the populace were to be either removed to regions of Russia or exterminated after Nazi Germany won the war. Bohemia and Moravia faced annexation directly into the German Reich.

The Czech workforce was exploited as Nazi-conscripted labour. More than 100,000 workers were removed from &quot;unsuitable&quot; jobs and conscripted by the Ministry of Labour. By December 1941, Czechs could be called to work anywhere within the Reich. Between April and November 1942, 79,000 Czech workers were taken in this manner for work within Nazi Germany. Also, in February 1942, the work day was increased from eight to twelve hours.

Heydrich was, for all intents and purposes, military dictator of Bohemia and Moravia. His changes to the government&#x27;s structure left President Emil Hácha and his cabinet virtually powerless. He often drove alone in a car with an open roofa show of his confidence in the occupation forces and in his government&#x27;s effectiveness.

By 3 October 1941, Czechoslovak military intelligence in London had made the decision to kill Heydrich.

==Role in the Holocaust==
Historians regard Heydrich as the most fearsome member of the Nazi elite. Hitler called him &quot;the man with the iron heart&quot;. He was one of the main architects of the Holocaust during the early war years, answering to and taking orders from only Hitler, Göring, and Himmler in all matters pertaining to the deportation, imprisonment, and extermination of Jews.

Heydrich was one of the organisers of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, a pogrom against Jews throughout Germany on the night of 9–10 November 1938. Heydrich sent a telegram that night to various SD and Gestapo offices, helping to coordinate the pogrom with the SS, SD, Gestapo, uniformed police (Orpo), SA, Nazi party officials, and even the fire departments. In the telegram, Heydrich granted permission for arson and destruction of Jewish businesses and synagogues, and ordered the confiscation of all &quot;archival material&quot; from Jewish community centres and synagogues. The telegram ordered that &quot;as many Jewsparticularly affluent Jewsare to be arrested in all districts as can be accommodated in existing detention facilities ... Immediately after the arrests have been carried out, the appropriate concentration camps should be contacted to place the Jews into camps as quickly as possible.&quot; Twenty thousand Jews were sent to concentration camps in the days immediately following; historians consider &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; the beginning of the Holocaust.

When Hitler asked for a pretext for the invasion of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich Müller masterminded a false flag plan code-named Operation Himmler. It involved a fake attack on the German radio station at Gleiwitz on 31 August 1939. Heydrich masterminded the plan and toured the site, which was about from the Polish border. Wearing Polish uniforms, 150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border. Hitler used the ruse as an excuse to launch his invasion.
On Himmler&#x27;s instructions, Heydrich formed the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; (task forces) to travel in the wake of the German armies at the start of World War II. On 21 September 1939, Heydrich sent out a teleprinter message on the &quot;Jewish question in the occupied territory&quot; to the chiefs of all &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; with instructions to round up Jewish people for placement into ghettos, called for the formation of Judenräte (Jewish councils), ordered a census, and promoted Aryanization plans for Jewish-owned businesses and farms, among other measures. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; units followed the army into Poland to implement the plans. Later, in the Soviet Union, they were charged with rounding up and murdering Jews via firing squad and gas vans. Historian Raul Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; and related auxiliary troops murdered more than two million people, including 1.3 million Jews. Heydrich ensured the safety of certain athletes, such as Paul Sommer, a Jewish German champion fencer he knew from his pre-SS days, and the Polish Olympic fencing team that competed at the 1936 Summer Olympics.


On 29 November 1939, Heydrich issued a cable about the &quot;Evacuation of New Eastern Provinces&quot;, detailing the deportation of people by railway to concentration camps, and giving guidance surrounding the December 1939 census, which would be the basis on which those deportations were performed. In May 1941 Heydrich drew up regulations with Quartermaster general Eduard Wagner for the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, which ensured that the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; and army would co-operate in murdering Soviet Jews.

On 10 October 1941, Heydrich was the senior officer at a &quot;Final Solution&quot; meeting of the RSHA in Prague that discussed deporting 50,000 Jews from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to ghettos in Minsk and Riga. Given his position, Heydrich was instrumental in carrying out these plans since his Gestapo was ready to organise deportations in the West and his &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were already conducting extensive killing operations in the East. The officers attending also discussed taking 5,000 Jews from Prague &quot;in the next few weeks&quot; and handing them over to the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; commanders Arthur Nebe and Otto Rasch. Establishing ghettos in the Protectorate was also planned, resulting in the construction of the Theresienstadt Ghetto, where 33,000 people would eventually die. Tens of thousands more passed through the camp before being sent East to be murdered. In 1941 Himmler named Heydrich as &quot;responsible for implementing&quot; the forced movement of 60,000 Jews from Germany and Czechoslovakia to the Łódź (Litzmannstadt) Ghetto in Poland.

Earlier on 31 July 1941, Hermann Göring gave written authorisation to Heydrich to ensure the co-operation of administrative leaders of various government departments in the implementation of a &quot;Final Solution to the Jewish question&quot; in territories under German control. On 20 January 1942, Heydrich chaired a meeting, now called the Wannsee Conference, to discuss the implementation of the plan.

==Death==

In London, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile resolved to kill Heydrich. Jan Kubiš and Jozef Gabčík headed the team chosen for the mission, trained by the British Special Operations Executive (SOE). On 28 December 1941 they parachuted into the Protectorate, where they lived in hiding, preparing for the mission.

On 27 May 1942, Heydrich planned to meet Hitler in Berlin. German documents suggest that Hitler intended to transfer him to German-occupied France where the French Resistance was gaining ground. To get from his home to the airport, Heydrich would have to pass a section where the Dresden-Prague road merges with a road to the Troja Bridge. The junction in the Prague suburb of Libeň was well suited for the attack because motorists have to slow for a hairpin bend. As Heydrich&#x27;s car slowed, Gabčík took aim with a Sten submachine gun, but it jammed and failed to fire. Heydrich ordered his driver, Klein, to halt and attempted to confront Gabčík rather than speed away. Kubiš, who had not been spotted by Heydrich or Klein, threw a converted anti-tank mine at the car as it stopped. It landed against the rear wheel. The explosion ripped through the right rear fender and wounded Heydrich with metal fragments and fibres from the upholstery causing serious damage to his left side: he suffered major injuries to his diaphragm, spleen, and one lung, as well as a broken rib. Kubiš received a minor shrapnel wound to his face. After Kubiš fled, Heydrich ordered Klein to chase Gabčík on foot, but Gabčík escaped after he shot and wounded Klein.

A Czech woman went to Heydrich&#x27;s aid and flagged down a delivery van. He was placed on his stomach in the back of the van and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. A splenectomy was performed and the chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided. Himmler ordered Karl Gebhardt to fly to Prague to assume care. Despite a fever, Heydrich&#x27;s recovery appeared to progress well. Hitler&#x27;s personal doctor Theodor Morell suggested the use of the new antibacterial drug sulfonamide, but Gebhardt thought that Heydrich would recover and declined the suggestion. Heydrich reconciled himself to his fate on 2 June, during a visit by Himmler, by reciting a quotation from one of his father&#x27;s operas:

&lt;poem lang=&quot;de&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Ja, die Welt ist nur ein Leierkasten,
den unser Herrgott selber dreht.
Jeder muß nach dem Liede tanzen,
das gerade auf der Walze steht.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;The world is just a barrel-organ
which the Lord God turns Himself.
We all have to dance to the tune
which is already on the drum.&lt;/poem&gt;

On 3 June, Heydrich fell into a coma; he died the following day. An autopsy concluded that he died of sepsis. Professors R. J. Defalque and A. J. Wright of the University of Alabama at Birmingham suggest that pulmonary embolism and/or brain ischemia may have been decisive factors. He was 38 years old.

===Funeral===
After an elaborate funeral held in Prague on 7 June 1942, Heydrich&#x27;s coffin was placed on a train to Berlin where a second ceremony was held in the new Reich Chancellery on 9 June. Himmler gave the eulogy. Hitler attended and placed Heydrich&#x27;s decorations—including the highest grade of the German Order, the Blood Order Medal, the Wound Badge in Gold, and the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords—on his funeral pillow. Although Heydrich&#x27;s death was employed for pro-Reich propaganda, Hitler privately blamed Heydrich for his own death through carelessness:

Heydrich was interred in Berlin&#x27;s Invalidenfriedhof, a military cemetery. The exact burial spot is no longer public knowledge—a temporary wooden marker that disappeared when the Red Army overran the city in 1945 was never replaced, so that Heydrich&#x27;s grave could not become a rallying point for Neo-Nazis. Nevertheless, on 16 December 2019, the BBC reported that Heydrich&#x27;s unmarked grave had been opened by unknown persons, without anything being taken. A photograph of Heydrich&#x27;s burial shows the wreaths and mourners to be in section A, which abuts the north wall of the Invalidenfriedhof and Scharnhorststraße, at the front of the cemetery. A recent biography of Heydrich also places the grave in Section A. Hitler planned for Heydrich to have a monumental tomb (designed by sculptor Arno Breker and architect Wilhelm Kreis) but, due to Germany&#x27;s declining fortunes, it was never built.

Heydrich&#x27;s widow, Lina, won the right to a pension following a series of court cases against the West German government in 1956 and 1959. She was declared entitled to a substantial pension as her husband was a German general killed in action. The government had previously declined to pay due to Heydrich&#x27;s role in the Holocaust. The couple had four children: Klaus, born in 1933, killed in a traffic accident in 1943; Heider, born in 1934; Silke, born in 1939; and Marte, born shortly after her father&#x27;s death in 1942. Lina wrote a memoir, &quot;Leben mit einem Kriegsverbrecher&quot; (&quot;Living With a War Criminal&quot;), which was published in 1976. She remarried once and died in 1985.

===Aftermath===
Heydrich&#x27;s assailants hid in safe houses and eventually took refuge in Saints Cyril and Methodius Cathedral, an Orthodox church in Prague. After a traitor in the Czech resistance betrayed their location, the church was surrounded by 800 members of the SS and Gestapo. Several Czechs were killed, and the remainder hid in the church&#x27;s crypt. The Germans attempted to flush the men out with gunfire and tear gas, and by flooding the crypt. Eventually an entrance was made using explosives. Rather than surrender, the soldiers killed themselves. Supporters of the assassins who were killed in the wake of these events included the church&#x27;s leader, Bishop Gorazd, who is now revered as a martyr of the Orthodox Church.

Infuriated by Heydrich&#x27;s death, Hitler ordered the arrest and execution of 10,000 randomly selected Czechs. But after consultations with Karl Hermann Frank, he altered his response. The Czech lands were an important industrial zone for the German military, and indiscriminate killing could reduce the region&#x27;s productivity. Hitler ordered a quick investigation. Intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the villages of Lidice and Ležáky. A Gestapo report stated that Lidice, north-west of Prague, was suspected as the assailants&#x27; hiding place because several Czech army officers, then in England, had come from there; additionally, the Gestapo had found a resistance radio transmitter in Ležáky. On 9 June, after discussions with Himmler and Karl Hermann Frank, Hitler ordered brutal reprisals. On 9 June, in the village of Lidice 172 boys and men between age 14 and 84 were shot. Thereafter, all adults in Ležáky were murdered on 24 June.

All but four of the women from Lidice were deported immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnantthey were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and the women were then sent to the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were murdered in gas vans at the Chełmno extermination camp. Both towns were burned and Lidice&#x27;s ruins were levelled. Overall, at least 1,300 Czechs, including 200 women, were killed in reprisal for Heydrich&#x27;s assassination.

Heydrich&#x27;s replacements were Ernst Kaltenbrunner as the chief of RSHA, and Karl Hermann Frank (27–28 May 1942) and Kurt Daluege (28 May 194214 October 1943) as the new acting &quot;Reichsprotektors&quot;. After Heydrich&#x27;s death, implementation of the policies formalised at the Wannsee conference he chaired was accelerated. The first three true death camps, designed for mass murder with no legal process or pretext, were built and operated at Treblinka, Sobibór, and Bełżec. The project was named Operation Reinhard after Heydrich.

==Service record==
Heydrich&#x27;s time in the SS was a mixture of rapid promotions, reserve commissions in the regular armed forces, and front-line combat service. During his 11 years with the SS Heydrich &quot;rose from the ranks&quot; and was appointed to every rank from private to full general. He was also a major in the Luftwaffe, flying nearly 100 combat missions until 22 July 1941, when his plane was hit by Soviet anti-aircraft fire. After this, Hitler personally ordered Heydrich to return to Berlin to resume his SS duties. His service record also gives him credit as a Navy Reserve Lieutenant, but in 1931 he was dismissed for conduct unbecoming an officer with loss of rank, and during World War II he had no contact with the Navy Reserve.

Heydrich began training as a pilot in 1935, and undertook fighter pilot training at the flight school at Werneuchen in 1939. Himmler initially forbade Heydrich from flying combat missions, but later relented, allowing him to join &quot;Jagdgeschwader 77&quot; &quot;Herz As&quot; (Ace of Hearts) in Norway, where he was stationed from 15 April 1940 during Operation Weserübung. He returned to Berlin on 14 May after his plane crashed at Stavanger the previous day. While in Norway, Heydrich also organised the arrests of political opponents and arranged for a contingent of 200 SiPo and SD men to be stationed in several major cities.

On 20 July 1941, without seeking authorisation from Himmler, Heydrich rejoined &quot;Jagdgeschwader 77&quot; during Operation Barbarossa, arriving at Yampil, Vinnytsia Oblast in a borrowed Bf 109. His aircraft was hit by Soviet flak in action near the Dniester on 22 July, and he had to land the plane in enemy territory. He avoided capture and returned to Berlin after being rescued by a patrol. It was his final combat mission.

Heydrich received a number of Nazi and military awards. These included the German Order, Blood Order, Golden Party Badge, Luftwaffe Pilot&#x27;s Badge, bronze and silver Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe for combat missions, and the Iron Cross First and Second Classes.

<doc id="25915" wikidata="Q631897" url="?curid=25915" title="Raëlism">
<text>Raëlism, also known as Raëlianism, is a UFO religion founded in 1970s France by Claude Vorilhon, now known as Raël. Scholars of religion classify Raëlism as a new religious movement. The group is formalised as the International Raëlian Movement (IRM) or Raëlian Church, a hierarchical organisation under Raël&#x27;s leadership.

Raëlism teaches that an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim created humanity using their advanced technology. An atheistic religion, it holds that the Elohim have historically been mistaken for gods. It claims that throughout history the Elohim have created 40 Elohim/human hybrids who have served as prophets preparing humanity for news about their origins. Among them are The Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad, with Raël himself the 40th and final prophet. Raëlists believe that since the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945, humanity has entered an Age of Apocalypse in which it threatens itself with nuclear annihilation. Raëlism holds that humanity must find a way to harness new scientific and technological development for peaceful purposes, and that when this has been achieved the Elohim will return to Earth to share their technology with humanity and establish a utopia. To this end, Raëlians have sought to build an embassy for the Elohim that incorporates a landing pad for their spaceship. Raëlians engage in daily meditation, hope for physical immortality through human cloning, and promote a liberal ethical system with a strong emphasis on sexual experimentation.

Raël first published his claims to have been contacted by the Elohim in his 1974 book &quot;Le Livre Qui Dit La Verité&quot; (The Book that Tells the Truth). He subsequently established an organisation devoted to promoting his ideas, MADECH, which in 1976 disbanded and was replaced by the Raëlian Church. Raël headed the new organisation, which was structured around a hierarchy of seven levels. Attracting more followers, the group obtained a country estate in France before relocating its operations to Quebec. In 1998, Raël established the Order of Angels, an internal all-female group whose members are largely sequestered from wider society and tasked with training themselves to become the Elohim&#x27;s consorts. In 1997 Raël initiated Clonaid, an organisation engaged in research in human cloning directed by senior Raëlian Brigitte Boisselier. In 2002, the company claimed to have produced a human clone, a baby named Eve, bringing much critical scrutiny and media attention. The Movement has attracted further attention through its public protests endorsing causes such as women&#x27;s and gay rights and against nuclear testing.

The International Raëlian Movement claims tens of thousands of members, the majority in Francophone areas of Western Europe and North America and parts of East Asia. Criticism of the philosophy has come from journalists, ex-Raëlians, and anti-cultists, while it has also been studied by scholars of religion.

== Definition and classification ==

Raëlism is classified as a new religious movement by scholars of religion. It has also been described as a UFO religion, a UFO movement, and an ETI (extra-terrestrial intelligence) religion. The organization promoting Raëlianism is the International Raëlian Movement (IRM), or the Raëlian Church. In France, where the religion originated, the government&#x27;s Parliamentary Commission on Cults labels it a &quot;&quot;secte&quot;&quot;, a French term with negative connotations similar to the English word &quot;cult&quot;. In 1997, a parliamentary inquiry commission issued a report through the Belgian Chamber of Representatives that also categorized the Belgian Raelian Movement (&quot;Mouvement Raëlien Belge&quot;) as a &quot;secte&quot;.

Raëlism is among the largest UFO religions in existence, and in the mid-2000s, the scholar of religion Andreas Grünschloß called it &quot;one of the most consolidated UFO groups internationally active today.&quot; In its beliefs, Raëlism differs from many other UFO-based philosophies, with the scholar of religion James R. Lewis terming it &quot;the most thoroughly secular of all the UFO religions.&quot; Most other UFO religions, such as the Aetherius Society, Ashtar Command, and Heaven&#x27;s Gate, use many of the beliefs of the late-19th-century religion Theosophy; Raëlism does not. Raëlists have also been characterised as having a &quot;belief in ufology&quot;, but Raëlians often stress that they do not regard themselves as ufologists.

Raëlism is materialistic and rejects the existence of the supernatural, endorsing atheism and rejecting the idea that gods exist. The religion&#x27;s founder, Raël, characterises traditional religion as irrational and unscientific, presenting his alternative as a philosophy free from &quot;obscurantism and mysticism&quot;. Raëlians call their belief system a &quot;scientific religion&quot;, with the International Raëlian Movement using the motto &quot;Science is our religion; religion is our science.&quot; The religion emphasizes the use of science to solve the world&#x27;s problems, and practitioners regard Raël as a pioneer of science who will one day be regarded as a peer of Galileo and Copernicus. Many of its members call it an &quot;atheistic religion&quot; and compare it to Buddhism, some branches of which similarly do not promote belief in gods (especially Theravāda Buddhism).

Along with science, the other main basis of Raël&#x27;s ideas is the Bible. Noting the &quot;central role&quot; of the Bible in Raëlism, the scholar of religion Eugene V. Gallagher suggested that it was a &quot;thoroughly biblical and thoroughly Christian&quot; philosophy. Similarly, the sociologist of religion Susan J. Palmer characterised Raëlism as both fundamentalist and Abrahamic in its reliance on the Bible. Raël nevertheless criticised Christianity for what he believed was its role in perverting the Bible&#x27;s message, presenting himself as an opponent of the Roman Catholic Church. Raëlism is not inclusive of other religions, with new members expected to formally renounce any previous religious affiliations.

== Beliefs ==
During the early 2000s, the scholar of religion George D. Chryssides said that Raëlism exhibits &quot;a coherent worldview&quot;, but added that the movement remained in the &quot;very early developmental stage&quot;. The religion is based on the teachings of Raël. Raël&#x27;s claims are taken literally by practitioners of Raëlism, who regard his writings as scripture. From Palmer&#x27;s extensive study of the philosophy and Raël himself, she thought that he genuinely believed his claims. The sociologist of religion Christopher Partridge noted that Raëlianism exhibits &quot;a &quot;strong&quot; physicalist belief system&quot;.

Raëlism presents a form of the ancient astronauts theory which was well known at the time that the religion was formed. Several French authors, such as Jean Sendy, Serge Hutin, and Jacques Bergier, had already published books during the late 1960s and early 1970s stating that Earth was the outpost of an ancient extraterrestrial society. Swiss writer Erich von Däniken presented the same idea in his 1968 book &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; Similar ideas had also been put forward in science fiction, such as the U.S. television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Raëlians often deny the effect of von Däniken on the philosophy, instead believing that it derives entirely from Raël&#x27;s revelations.

=== The Elohim ===
Raëlism teaches that there exists an extraterrestrial species known as the Elohim. Raël has said that the word &quot;Elohim&quot;, which is used for God in the Old Testament, is actually a plural term which he translates as &quot;those who came from the sky.&quot; Raël calls individual members of the Elohim &quot;Eloha&quot;. He claims that the Elohim gave him the honorific name &quot;Raël&quot;, a term deriving from &quot;Israel&quot;, which he translates as &quot;the messenger of those who come from the sky.&quot;

In his first book, &quot;Le Livre Qui Dit La Verité&quot;, published in 1974, Raël claimed that he initially encountered these alien beings on 13 December 1973, when he was 27 years old. He wrote that he was walking along the Puy de Lassolas volcanic crater in the Clermont-Ferrand mountains when one of their spaceships appeared and an Eloha emerged, who asked him to return the next day and bring a Bible. Raël did so, and the over six days Eloha explained to him the true meaning of its contents, revealing more about the Elohim&#x27;s involvement in human history. In his 1976 book &quot;Les Extra-Terrestres M&#x27;ont Emmené sur Leur Planète&quot; (&quot;The Extraterrestrials Took Me to Their Planet&quot;), Raël added that he was contacted by the Elohim again on 7 October 1975, when they took him aboard their spaceship and transported him to their home planet. Here he was offered six biological robot women with which to have sex, saw the Elohim create his clone, and taught the techniques of sensual meditation. The scholar of religion James R. Lewis noted that Raël&#x27;s account of encountering the Elohim was similar to those of the &quot;classic UFO contactees&quot; of the 1950s and 1960s.

The Elohim are described as physically smaller than humans, with pale green skin and almond-shaped eyes, and divide into seven different races. Raëlians are forbidden from painting or sketching them. According to Raël, their planet is outside the Solar System but within the Milky Way. Raël says there are 90,000 Elohim on their planet, that they are all quasi-immortal, and that they do not wear clothes. All are permitted to engage in free love with one another, and sexual jealousy has been eliminated. All are regarded as feminine in manner; &quot;the most feminine woman on Earth is only 10% as feminine as the Elohim.&quot; They are not allowed to procreate, and many undergo a sterilisation operation to ensure this. Raël also reports that the Elohim can communicate with humans because they understand all human languages.

==== The Elohim on Earth ====
Raëlism teaches that about 25,000 years ago the Elohim arrived at the Earth and transformed it so that life could develop. It states that the Elohim used their advanced technology to establish all life on the planet. Raël characterises humans as &quot;biological robots&quot; that have been created and programmed by the Elohim. Raëlism teaches that humanity is modelled physically on the Elohim; for practitioners, this is indicated by the passage at Genesis 1:26. Also representing his own interpretation of Genesis, Raël teaches that the Elohim scientist responsible for creating humanity was named Yahweh and that the first two humans to be created were named Adam and Eve. Raëlians believe that there were originally seven human races, modelling the seven Elohim races, but that the purple, blue, and green races have died out. In believing humanity was created by the Elohim, Raëlians reject Darwinian evolution and espouse creationism and intelligent design; Raëlians term their beliefs &quot;scientific creationism.&quot; Raëlians believe that the Elohim were also created by an earlier species, and they before them, &quot;ad infinitum&quot;. They believe that the cosmos expands indefinitely, both in time and space; infinity is an important concept for them.

Raëlians believe that accounts of gods in various mythologies around the world are misinterpretations of memories about the Elohim. The philosophy states that the sacred scriptures of many other religions describe the ongoing activities of the Elohim on Earth. The tale of Adam and Eve&#x27;s expulsion from the Garden of Eden, recounted in Genesis, is, for instance, interpreted as representing humanity&#x27;s difficult transition from the Elohim&#x27;s laboratories to life on Earth, where they had to become self-sufficient. The resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, as presented in the Gospels, is described as representing how the Elohim cloned Jesus to restore him to life after death. References to Satan are interpreted as referring to the chief of a group on the Elohim&#x27;s planet who were opposed to genetic experiments on Earth and who argued that humanity should be destroyed as a potential threat. According to the Raëlians, the Great Flood narrative recounts an attempt by the anti-human aliens to wipe out humanity, but that humanity was rescued by an alien spacecraft which provided the basis for the story of Noah&#x27;s Ark.

Various figures who established or inspired religions throughout human history, including Jesus, the Buddha, Muhammad, and Joseph Smith, are portrayed by the Raëlians as having been guided by the Elohim. These are characterised as being 39 prophets sent to humanity at various times. Each is believed to have revealed information to humanity that they could comprehend at the given time, and Raëlism, therefore, emphasises the idea of progressive truth. Raël claims that he is the fortieth and final prophet of the Elohim, sent because humanity is now sufficiently developed to understand the truth about the Elohim. He initially claimed that he was chosen for this role because he had a Roman Catholic mother and a Jewish father and was thus &quot;an ideal link between two very important peoples in the history of the world.&quot; He added that he was also selected because he lived in France, which the Elohim considered a more open-minded country than most others.

Raël subsequently stated that these prophets are themselves the result of a human mother breeding with an Eloha father, with the human mothers having been chosen for the purity of their genetic code, beamed onto an Elohim spacecraft, impregnated, and then returned to Earth with their memory of the event erased. In his 1979 book, &quot;Let&#x27;s Welcome Our Fathers from Space&quot;, Raël added that he was the biological son of the Eloha whom he first encountered, Yahweh. He noted that Yahweh was also the father of Jesus, making the latter Raël&#x27;s half-brother. In 2003, Raël publicly identified himself as Maitreya, the prophesied future bodhisattva of Mahayana Buddhism. He maintains that he continues to be in telepathic contact with the Elohim, hearing Yahweh&#x27;s voice guiding him in making decisions affecting Raëlianism.

The religion also teaches that the Elohim continue to monitor every human individual on Earth, remotely, from their planet. This is done so that the Elohim can decide which individuals merit being offered the opportunity of eternal life. It argues that the Elohim continue to visit the Earth, as evidenced by crop circles, which adherents regard as the landing spaces of the Elohim&#x27;s spacecraft. Raëlians generally understand sightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) as confirmation of their belief in the Elohim, although their opinion of Ufology is ambiguous. Raëlians also consider the appearance of &quot;angel hair&quot; as evidence of the Elohim&#x27;s presence, stating that it has appeared at various Raëlian summer gatherings. They typically express scepticism regarding claims by alleged alien contactees other than Raël. Raëlians believe that they are all capable of linking telepathically with the Elohim but that only Raël is permitted to meet with them physically or receive their revelations.

=== The Age of Apocalypse and the Elohim&#x27;s Return ===
Raëlism is a millenarian philosophy. Raël claims that since the U.S. military&#x27;s use of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, humanity have been living in the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; or &quot;Revelation&quot;. It states that the human species must now choose whether to use science and technology to enhance life or to use it to bring about nuclear annihilation. It claims that if humans successfully get through this present age, they will live in an era of advanced technology in which society will be tolerant and sexually liberated. Raël claimed that he was destined to help lead humanity away from its path of destruction.

According to Raël, beginning a peaceful age will cause the return of the Elohim to Earth. He added that they will bring with them the 39 immortal prophets whom they had previously sent to guide humanity. Raël stated that humanity has to build an embassy for the Elohim prior to their arrival on Earth and that it must include a landing pad for their spaceship. He stated that it needed to be located on internationally recognised neutral territory so as not to indicate favour towards any one particular nation-state. Initially, Raël sought permission to build it in Israel, explaining this by reference to how the ancient Israelites were once in contact with the Elohim. He also stated that this embassy would constitute the &quot;Third Temple&quot; referred to in Jewish prophecy.

Receiving little help for this venture from the Israeli government, Raël instead suggested that a neighbouring country might be suitable, proposing Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt as possible locations. None of the governments of these countries were favorable. Senior people of the Raëlian Movement suggested Hawaii as a possible alternative, and in 1998 Raël stated that he had received a new revelation from the Elohim stating that this location would be acceptable. Chryssides noted that should the Elohim not arrive in 2035, the Raëlians will have to adapt to the new circumstance in which their eschatology remains unfulfilled. On 16 April 1987, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; estimated the funding for the &quot;cosmic kibbutz&quot; at $1 million. In 1997–1998, the funding had risen to $7 million. In 2001, group members claimed they had saved $9 million for the embassy; and in October 2001, the funding had reached $20 million.

Once on Earth, Raël claims, the Elohim will share their advanced technology and scientific understanding with humanity and will help to usher in a utopia. Raël teaches that the Elohim&#x27;s arrival will herald a new and improved political system on Earth. This will be a single world government that Raël terms a &quot;geniocracy,&quot; or &quot;rule of geniuses,&quot; and which he discusses in his fifth book, &quot;Geniocracy&quot;. According to this system, only those who are fifty percent more intelligent that the average person will be permitted to rule. Raël&#x27;s proposed geniocratic system bears similarities with the style of governance that Plato promoted in his work &quot;Republic&quot;. Raëlians thus reject democracy, believing that it fails to ensure that society has the best leadership. Raël claims that this future society will have no war, and crime will have been ended through genetic engineering. In this future, Raël states, humanity will be able to travel beyond the Earth to colonise other planets. He claims that robots will assume menial tasks, allowing humans to devote their time to pleasurable pursuits. He also argued that there would be biological robots which would serve as sex slaves, akin to those which Raël states he encountered on his visit to the Elohim planet. A single world currency will be introduced, as a prelude to the total abolition of money, while a unified world calendar will also be adopted.

=== Cloning and survival after death ===

Raëlians reject the existence of the ethereal soul that survives physical death, and instead argue that the only hope for immortality is through scientific means. The Raëlians claim that the Elohim will clone and thus recreate dead individuals, but only those particular individuals who they deem merit this recreation. In this, they believe in a &quot;conditional immortality&quot;, with immortality for a minority and oblivion for the majority. The resurrection of Jesus, as recounted in the Gospels, is for instance explained as an example of Elohim cloning.

Raëlists advocate for the development of human cloning technology on Earth. Raëlians also believe that deceased individuals can be cloned so that they could be tried and punished for their crimes. After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States, in which the attackers killed themselves, the Raëlists proposed that they could be resurrected through cloning to be tried for their actions. Due to its emphasis upon attaining immortality, Raëlism deplores suicide; after the Heaven&#x27;s Gate group engaged in a mass suicide in 1997, the Raëlian Church was among the new religions that issued press releases condemning suicide.

As opposed to the scientific definition of reproductive cloning, which is simply the creation of a genetically identical living organism, Raëlians seek to both genetically clone individuals, rapidly accelerate growth of the clone to adulthood through a process like guided self-assembly of rapidly expanded cells or even nanotechnology. Raël told lawmakers that banning the development of human cloning was comparable to outlawing medical advances such &quot;antibiotics, blood transfusions, and vaccines&quot;.

=== Morality, ethics, and gender roles ===
Raëlism insists on a strict ethical code for its followers. Members are expected to take responsibility for their own actions, respect cultural and racial difference, promote non-violence, strive for world peace, and share wealth and resources. They are also encouraged to uphold democracy, in the belief that humanity will ultimately make a democratic choice to introduce geniocracy. The Raëlian opinion is that everything should be permitted so long as it harms no one and does not impede scientific and technological advance. Members are nevertheless advised against using recreational drugs or stimulants so as not to harm their health, although some practitioners have acknowledged that they use alcohol and cigarettes.

John M. Bozeman characterized the religion&#x27;s morality as &quot;progressive,&quot; while Palmer referred to the group&#x27;s &quot;liberal social values&quot;, and Chryssides called Raëlist values &quot;worldly and hedonistic&quot;. The scholar of religion Paul Oliver said that the philosophy&#x27;s ethics are &quot;relativistic&quot; in that practitioners are encouraged to act in a manner that they feel appropriate to the context. Several scholars have also argued that it is a &quot;world-affirming&quot; religion, using the typology established by Roy Wallis.

Raël considered gender as an artificial construct and emphasized its fluidity. Raël avoided a macho persona and is instead often described by his followers as being &quot;gentle&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot;. Palmer suggested that Raël regarded women as being superior to men because they were described as being more like the Elohim. In Raël&#x27;s account, the inhabitants of the Elohim planet &quot;have 10 percent of masculinity and 90 percent of femininity.&quot; Raël also proposed that if women were in positions of political power across the world, there would be no war. The Raëlians have participated with public protests for women&#x27;s rights. At its June 2003 &quot;Joy of Being Woman&quot; demonstration, Raëlian women danced naked through the streets of Paris. Palmer described the Raëlians as feminists, although Raël criticized mainstream feminism, arguing that it &quot;copied the shortcomings of men&quot;. Generally adopting the belief that the human body is malleable, Raëlism has a positive opinion of plastic surgery to improve physical appearance.

Raëlism teaches that the Elohim created humanity to feel sexual desire as a panacea for their violent impulses. It states that through the pursuit of sexual pleasure, new pathways between the neurons in the brain are forged, thus enhancing an individual&#x27;s intelligence. Raëlism encourages its members to explore their sexuality; while Raël is often photographed with beautiful women and appears to be heterosexual, he encourages homosexual experimentation. Adopting an accepting attitude towards different forms of sexual orientation and expression, Raëlism teaches that differences in sexual orientation are rooted in the Elohim&#x27;s primordial genetic programming and are something to be celebrated. Researching about the Raëlians of Quebec, Palmer found that many of them avoided categorizing themselves by using terms like &quot;heterosexual&quot;, &quot;homosexual&quot;, or &quot;bisexual&quot;, finding those labels to be too limiting.

The Raëlians have stressed the need for respect and mutual consent in sexual behaviour. The group places a strong taboo on incest, rape, and sexual activities involving children. Anyone involved in the Movement who is found to have been involved in these latter activities is excommunicated, while Raël has recommended that paedophiles be castrated or placed in mental institutions. Those believed to have forced unwelcome sexual attention upon another person are excommunicated from the Movement for seven years– the amount of time Raëlians believe it takes for all of a person&#x27;s biological cells to be regenerated.

The Raëlists reject both enforced monogamy and marriage, regarding these as institutions that have been enforced to enslave women and suppress sexual expression. The religion discourages its members from marrying. Members are also discouraged from contributing to global overpopulation; members are urged not to have more than two children, and ideally none at all. Raël states that should two individuals wish to procreate, their psychic control during the act of conception can affect any child resulting. The Raëlists also believe that once human cloning has been developed, biological reproduction will be obsolete. As well as endorsing the use of birth control and contraceptives, Raëlists endorse the use of abortion to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Raël has also argued that if a woman does not want a child who has been born then she should give it up to be raised by society.

Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians&#x27; opinions about Sensual Meditation with a fear that Raëlians are a threat to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. They argue that such liberalized sex education that teaches children how to obtain sexual gratification would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.

=== Religious symbol ===

The symbol initially used to signify Raëlism was a six-pointed star with a swastika in the centre. Raël stated that this was the symbol he originally saw on the hull of the Elohim&#x27;s spaceship. Raëlians regard this as a symbol of infinity. Practitioners also believe that this symbol helps facilitate their own telepathic contact with the Elohim.
Raëlists typically wear a medallion of the symbol around their neck.

The Raëlian use of the swastika, a symbol that had been prominently used by Germany&#x27;s Nazi Party during the 1930s and 1940s, resulted in accusations from the Montreal anti-cult organization Info-Cult that the Raëlians promoted fascism and racism. Outside Info-Cult&#x27;s office, Raëlians spoke against the act of discriminating against a religious minority. On 2 January 1992, a dozen people protested against the use of the swastika in the Raëlian logo in Miami&#x27;s Eden Roc Hotel. The use of the swastika and other Raëlian practices has resulted in criticism from the group Hineni of Florida, an Orthodox Jewish organization.

In 1992, the Raëlian Movement altered their symbol, replacing the central swastika with a swirling shape. They explained that this was due to a request from the Elohim to change the symbol in order to help in negotiations with Israel for the building of the Extraterrestrial Embassy, although the country continued to deny their request. Raël also stated that the change was made to show respect to the victims of the Holocaust. The newly added swirling shape was explained as a depiction of a swirling galaxy. In 2005, the Israeli Raëlian Guide Kobi Drori stated that the Lebanese government was discussing proposals by the Raëlian movement to build their interplanetary embassy in Lebanon. However, one condition was that the Raëlians not display their logo on top of the building because it mixes a swastika and a Star of David. According to Drori, the Raëlians involved refused this offer, as they wished to keep the symbol as it was. From 1991 to 2007, the official Raëlian symbol in Europe and America did not have the original swastika, but Raël decided to make the original symbol, the Star of David intertwined with a swastika, the only official symbol of the Raëlian Movement worldwide.

== Practices ==

Raëlism involves a series of monthly meetings, initiations, and meditation rituals. Where possible, Raëlians congregate with fellow practitioners on the third Sunday of the month. It is the group&#x27;s policy that these events occur in rented rooms rather than property that the Raëlian Movement itself has purchased. At the monthly meetings in Montreal, Raël himself often appeared.

The main ritual in Raëlism is the &quot;transmission of the cellular plan&quot;, in which a Raëlian Guide placed their hands upon another individual&#x27;s head, through which the Guide is believed to receive the individual&#x27;s cellular code and then telepathically transmit it to the Elohim. Doing so denotes the initiate&#x27;s formal recognition of the Elohim as the creators of humanity. This is used as part of the &quot;baptism&quot;, or initiation ceremony for new members joining the Movement. Those in the Movement who hold the rank of bishop and priest are permitted to conduct these initiation ceremonies. In some instances, when the necessary individuals are present, Raël touches the head of a Raëlian bishop, who in turn touches that of a Raëlian priest, who touches the head of the initiate to ensure the &quot;transmission&quot;. These &quot;transmissions&quot; are permitted to take place on one of four days in the year that play a prominent role in the Raëlian calendar. The first examples took place in April 1976, when Raël carried out the &quot;transmission&quot; ceremonies of forty initiates on the Roc Plat.

The Raëlian calendar begins with the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Each year after this date is referred to as &quot;AH&quot; or &quot;après Hiroshima&quot; (&quot;after Hiroshima&quot;). The Raëlians celebrate four religious festivals each year, two of which mark Raël&#x27;s claimed encounters with the Elohim. These are the first Sunday in April, which is the date on which Raëlians believe the Elohim created the first humans; August 6th, which marks the day of the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima in 1945; October 7th, which is the day in which Raël claims that he encountered the Elohim for the second time, in 1974; and December 13th, which is the day that Raël allegedly first encountered the Elohim in 1973.

=== Sensual meditation ===

A major practice in Raëlism is &quot;sensual meditation&quot;, something that Raël outlined in his 1980 book &quot;La méditation sensuelle&quot;.
Raëlians are encouraged to take part in this guided meditation or visualisation on a daily basis, with the intent of transmitting love and telepathic links to the Elohim and achieving harmony with infinity. In this, practitioners are often assisted in this meditation through listening to an instruction tape. Sensual meditation sessions also take place communally at the group&#x27;s monthly meetings, during which the assembled adherents sit or lie on the floor in a dimly lit room. They are then guided through it by a Raëlian Guide speaking through a microphone; the meditation may be accompanied by New Age music.

Sensual meditation begins with a relaxation exercise known as &quot;harmonisation avec l&#x27;infini&quot; (&quot;harmonization with the infinite&quot;). One stage of this process is &quot;oxygenation&quot;, which entails deep breathing. Practitioners are taught to relax and then envision themselves expanding their frame of reference until the self becomes only a tiny speck within the universe. They are then tasked with visualising the bones and organs of the body, and ultimately the atoms within the body itself. The guided meditation then encourages the meditators to imagine themselves being on the Elohim&#x27;s planet and communicating telepathically with these aliens.

Palmer found that Raëlians varyingly described a sense of physical well-being, psychic abilities, or sexual arousal during these meditations and interpreted these as evidence that they were in telepathic contact with the Elohim. The goal of sensual meditation is to achieve a &quot;cosmic orgasm&quot;, which is characterised as the ultimate experience a person can have. Palmer quoted one senior Raëlian as describing the &quot;cosmic orgasm&quot; as &quot;the sensual experience of the unity between the self and the universe&quot;.

=== Seminars ===
The Raëlian Church holds week-long summer seminars called &quot;Stages of Awakening.&quot; These involve daily lectures by Raël, sensual meditation sessions, periods of fasting and feasting, testimonials, and various alternative therapies. Activities that have attracted press attention have include dressing in the clothes of the opposite gender as part of an exercise to play with the fluidity of gender expression, and observing one&#x27;s own genitals and masturbating.

Raëlians use these seminars as an opportunity to form friendships or sexual relationships. Attendees wear white togas with name tags. In 1991, a French journalist attended a seminar and taped couples having sexual intercourse in tents, something then much-publicised.
Following these seminars, a second seminar, this time restricted to members of the Structure, takes place.

== History ==
=== Origins ===

Claude Vorilhon was born in Ambert, France on 30 September 1946. He was the illegitimate son of a 15-year-old mother; his father had been a Sephardi Jew then in hiding from the Nazi authorities. Vorilhon later recounted being raised as an atheist by his grandmother and aunt, although for a time attended a Roman Catholic boarding school. As a teenager, Vorilhon hitch-hiked to Paris where he pursued a career as a singer, releasing singles using the name &quot;Claude Celler.&quot; He then married a nurse and had two children with her. In 1973, he founded the racing car magazine &quot;Auto Pop&quot; and also worked as a test driver for such vehicles. In November 1973, a new law was introduced in France banning speeding on the highway, ending his work as a test driver. &quot;Auto Pop&quot; ceased publication in September 1974.

There had been a range of reported UFO sightings in 1970s France, and the ancient astronaut theory was &quot;very much in vogue&quot; in the country by the middle of that decade. In early 1974, Vorilhon announced that in December 1973 he had been contacted by the Elohim while walking along the Puy Lassolas mountain. He began promoting these ideas in interviews on French television and radio. He began lecturing on his alleged experiences in Paris, where he attracted a group of followers, many of whom were science-fiction fans or amateur ufologists. In December 1974 an organisation based on his ideas, the Mouvement pour l&#x27;accueil des Elohims créateurs de l&#x27;humanité (MADECH; &quot;Movement for the Welcoming of the Elohim, Creators of Humanity&quot;), was launched. Vorilhon began referring to himself as &quot;Raël.&quot; A newsletter, &quot;Apocalypse&quot;, began publication in October 1974. MADECH began raising money for the self-publication of Vorilhon&#x27;s first book, which appeared as &quot;Le livre qui dit la verité&quot; that year. Raëlians treat his first book with reverence, often referring to it simple as &quot;Le livre&quot; (&quot;the book&quot;).

Some members of MADECH wanted the organisation to take a broader interest in Ufology beyond Raël&#x27;s own claims and also desired to restrict his authority within the group. Amid an internal power struggle, Raël called an emergency meeting in April 1975; the feud continued and in July he dismissed MADECH&#x27;s executives and replaced them with seven of his own supporters. Raël also announced that he had been contacted by the Elohim for a second time and that on this occasion they had taken him to visit their planet. He outlined these claims in his 1975 book &quot;Les Extra-Terrestres M&#x27;ont Emmené sur Leur Planète&quot;. Opposition to Raël remained evident in MADECH and in 1976 he disbanded the group, beginning the Raëlian Movement as a replacement in February 1976. It operated along a strict hierarchy, with Raël as its director, referred to as the &quot;Guide of Guides.&quot; Unlike MADECH, it promoted a broader religious structure, including ritual practices. It continued publication of &quot;Apocalypse&quot; to spread its message.

In 1976, the Raëlians sent a mission to the Canadian province of Quebec to attract converts in the Francophone region. The next year a Quebecois branch of the Movement was established. Raël&#x27;s first two books were then published in a single English edition, titled &quot;Space Aliens Took Me to Their Planet&quot; in 1978 and republished as &quot;The Message Given To Me By Extra-Terrestrials: They Took Me to their Planet&quot; in 1986 and, in a new translation, as &quot;The Final Message&quot; in 1998. He expanded on his ideas with several additional books: &quot;Accueiller Les Extra-Terrestes&quot; in 1979 (translated as &quot;Let&#x27;s Welcome Our Fathers from Space&quot; in 1986), &quot;La Méditation Sensuelle&quot; in 1980 (translated as &quot;Sensual Meditation&quot; in 1986), and &quot;Geniocracy&quot;.

=== Later development ===
In 1980, the Raëlians sent a mission to Japan, followed by another to Africa in 1982 and to Australia in 1990. In the early 1980s the Movement bought a campground near Albi in southern France, which they named Eden. In 1984, Raël underwent a year&#x27;s retreat in which he avoided public appearance. The following year, his first wife left both him and the movement; he subsequently began a relationship with a Japanese Raëlian, Lisa Sunagawa, for several years. During the mid-1990s, Raël returned to his hobby of motor racing, competing in rounds two and three of the 1995 Magna Enduro Racing Championship and the 1998 Motorola Cup in Miami before retiring from the sport in 2001. In 1992, a schism appeared in the religion as a group of about forty practitioners were expelled. They formed a rival, smaller group, the Apostles of the Last Days, espousing the belief that Raël had been the original spokesman of the Elohim but had been taken over by Satan.

In 1992, the Raëlian Movement bought 115 hectares near Valcourt in Quebec, naming this property Le Jardin du Prophète (&quot;the Garden of the Prophet&quot;). It was here in 1997 that the organisation opened UFOLand, a museum about ufology. Its purpose was to raise money for the Elohim Embassy, but in 2001 it closed to the public, having proved financially unviable. It was also during 1997, a month after Ian Wilmut announced the birth of Dolly the Sheep, a successful clone, that Raël established the company Valiant Venture to explore the commercial applications of cloning. Through it came Clonaid, of which the Raëlian Bishop Brigitte Boisselier was co-founder, director, and spokesperson. The initiation of this group and its promotion of human cloning incited much debate among other religious figures, scientists, and ethicists. Raël and Boisselier both spoke before US President Bill Clinton&#x27;s Congress hearing on human cloning in March 2001.

At the July 1998 training camp in the Jardins des Prophètes, Raël announced that in December 1997 he had received another revelation from the Elohim, commanding him to form a new grouping within the Raëlian Movement, the Order of Raël&#x27;s Angels. This was to be a secret society, open only to women who would become the consorts of the Elohim after their arrival on Earth. A newsletter, &quot;Plumes d&#x27;Anges&quot; (Angel Feathers), was issued containing information about the Order. Palmer noted that by emphasizing the unique qualities of women, this group challenged the established Raëlian doctrine that men and women are wholly equal and interchangeable.

In 2001, Raël toured Asia, giving seminars. That year he married for a second time, to a 16-year-old ballet student. Raëlism discourages marriage, and this instance was done for expediency, because he had been questioned by customs officials when traveling with her across borders. They subsequently divorced but remained a couple. In November 2002, a local man vandalised the group&#x27;s Jardins des Prophètes property, causing significant damage. Raël stated that this had been a preliminary test of the &quot;Abraham Project,&quot; a joint operation between the Central Intelligence Agency and the French intelligence agencies to assassinate him using schizophrenics directed through mind control.

In December 2002, Boisselier announced that Clonaid&#x27;s work had resulted in the birth of a baby, Eve, which she claimed was the world&#x27;s first human clone. The child was not presented for scrutiny by scientists; the IRM&#x27;s allegations regarding Baby Eve were never substantiated by the scientific community. Many commentators believed the announcement had been a hoax. In January 2003 the Raëlians declared that Eve&#x27;s parents had hidden themselves to evade attention. Baby Eve&#x27;s appearance gained the Raëlians much international press coverage, and also much ridicule. The group claimed this publicity generated around 5000 new members. Boisellier announced periodically that further clone infants had been born, in the Netherlands, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, although the press increasingly deemed these hoaxes and stopped attending Raëlian press conferences.

In January 2003, Raël announced Boisellier as his appointed successor, and also published &quot;The Maitreya&quot;, in which he identified himself with the eponymous figure from Buddhist prophecy. In response to Raël&#x27;s association with Clonaid, South Korean immigration authorities denied him entry to their country in 2003. The group then protested near South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Health and Welfare that ordered him to leave. Raël appeared alongside a group of women, &quot;Raël&#x27;s Girls&quot;, in the October 2004 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. In 2005, two amateur documentary makers, Abdullah Hashem and Joseph McGowen, attended and filmed a Raëlian seminar in Las Vegas, claiming that they were making a student film. They then used the footage as the basis of a documentary, which they presented as an exposé of the group. In 2009, the Church announced plans for a new UFOLand in Las Vegas.

== Organization and structure ==

A strictly hierarchical organization, there are two levels of membership. The majority of members are referred to simply as &quot;Raëlians&quot;, while those who are in the higher levels controlling the Movement are referred to as the &quot;Structure.&quot;

=== Member hierarchy ===

The Structure is divided along a six-tiered system. Raël is at the top of the Raëlian Church, being referred to as the &quot;Guide of Guides.&quot; Senior members of the Structure re-elect him to that position each seven years. Below Raël are the &quot;Bishop Guides&quot;, then the &quot;Priest Guides&quot;, then the &quot;Animators&quot;, then the &quot;Assistant Animators&quot;, and finally the &quot;Probationers&quot;. Those characterised as &quot;Guides&quot; are expected to be exemplars for the rest of the movement, for instance by strictly adhering to the avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and recreational drugs. Race, gender, and sexual orientation are no barrier to rising through the ranks of the group&#x27;s leadership structure. However, Palmer noted that by the mid-1990s there were few women in leadership positions within the organisation.

Members of the Raëlian structure begin as level 0 &quot;trainees&quot; during annual seminars. The Raelian structure said in 2007 to have about 2,300 members, 170 &quot;Raëlian guides&quot;, and 41 bishops.

Three Raëlian Bishops sit on a &quot;Council of the Wise&quot; which monitors heresy and arranges punishment for transgressors. When they seek to punish an individual it is usually for a seven-year &quot;excommunication&quot;; it lasts seven years because Raëlians believe that it takes this long for every cell in the human body to be replaced. In more severe cases, the council can oversee a &quot;demarking&quot;, by which they cancel the transmission of the cellular code, believing that this revokes the individual&#x27;s hope for immortality through cloning.

Members pay an annual membership fee to the Raëlian Movement. Full members of the Movement are encouraged to tithe 10% of their income to the organisation. This tithe is then divided up, with 3% going to the national branch and 7% to the International Movement&#x27;s central administration. An additional 1% may go to Raël himself. Tithing is however not enforced. In her research, Palmer found many practitioners who admitted to not paying the tithe; a 1991 survey of Raëlians found that a third of respondents did not pay, while in an interview, Raël suggested that over 60 percent do not. It is these tithes and membership fees, coupled with the sales of Raël&#x27;s books, that represent the International Raëlian Movement&#x27;s main income. This money is then saved toward the construction of the Elohim Embassy or spent on the production of flyers, books, videos, and other material used to disseminate the Raëlian message.

The group initially owned a country estate in Albi, France, before later obtaining one in Valcourt, Quebec.

=== Order of Angels ===

In 1998, Raël established an internal all-female group, the Order of Raël&#x27;s Angels, whose members are trained to become the consorts of the Elohim. He stated that these women would be the only humans permitted contact with the Elohim after the latter arrive on Earth. He further claimed that they will serve as the Elohim&#x27;s liaisons with human politicians, scientists, and journalists. Raël stated that it was only women who could be Angels because men were not feminine enough for the extremely gentle, delicate, and sensitive Elohim. Trans women were permitted entry; Raël praised one transgender member for &quot;choosing to be a woman&quot;.

The Angels are meant to cultivate their feminine and nurturing side. They are tasked with pursuing self-transformation, striving to please the Elohim and to resemble them more closely by cultivating discipline, serenity, harmony, purity, humility, charisma, and both internal and external beauty. The Angels are instructed to regularly pray to the Elohim and regularly meditate. They are encouraged to limit their meat consumption and to avoid carbohydrates and sugar so as to maintain their physical beauty. They have proved useful for the group&#x27;s public relations and have also provided volunteers for its human cloning experiments. The Order has also engaged in the selling of human ova on the internet, launching a website to do so in 1999. Raël stated that this would help the Angels achieve financial independence.

The Order of Raël&#x27;s Angels has a six-tiered structure, symmetrical with the six-tiered structure of the Raëlian Movement as a whole. Raël divides the Angels into three groups: the White, Pink, and Golden Ribbon Angels. White Angels wear white feathers on a necklace, can choose human lovers, and are tasked with operating in the world to attract more women into the Raëlian movement. Pink Angels wear a pink feather on a necklace and are considered by Raël to be the &quot;Chosen Ones&quot; who will become the consorts of the Elohim. They are expected to live a sequestered life, initially in the Jardins des Prophètes community, and are expected to reserve their sexual activity for the extraterrestrials. The Gold Ribbon Angels are characterised by a gold cord worn around the neck. They are handpicked by Raël for their physical beauty, and are described as being the first humans who will approach the Elohim on the latter&#x27;s arrival on Earth. The Pink and Gold Ribbon Angels are expected to abstain from sexual activity with most other humans but should receive instruction in alien lovemaking from Raël himself as well as engaging in sexual acts alone or with other Angels.

The Order was insulated from the rest of the religion, with the Angels&#x27; living quarters for instance being off-limits to non-Angels. Access to the Angels is strictly limited for both journalists and scholars. Gold Ribbon Angels have been demoted from this status as they have aged, on the explanation that as their physical beauty has deteriorated they are no longer suited to greeting the Elohim. These demoted individuals are then tasked with training younger replacements. Other individuals have been deprived of their status as Angels altogether, when they are perceived to have acted in contravention of the group&#x27;s ethos.

The initiation rites include declaring an oath or making a contract in which one agrees to become defender of the Raëlian ideology and its founder Raël. A few days later, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that French chemist Brigitte Boisselier was an Order of Angels member. Around this time, cult specialist Mike Kropveld termed the Order of Angels &quot;one of the most transparent movements&quot; he had witnessed, though he was alarmed by the women&#x27;s promise to defend Raël&#x27;s life with their own bodies.

Raël has instructed some women members to play a pro-sex feminist role in the Raëlian Church. &quot;Rael&#x27;s Girls&quot; is another group of women in the religion which are against the suppression of feminine acts of pleasure, including sexual intercourse with men or women. Rael&#x27;s Girls consists solely of women who work in the sex industry. The women of Rael&#x27;s Girls say there is not any reason to repent for performing striptease or being a prostitute. This organization was established &quot;to support the choice of the women who are working in the sex industry&quot;.

== Outreach and advocacy ==
The International Raëlian Movement has established various projects through which to promote its ideology.
In 1997 it created Clonaid, a company devoted to human cloning. Clients can bank a sample of their DNA with the group, which offers to then produce a single clone of the individual after they die. Another Raëlian company, Ovulaid, seeks to provide ovaries for individuals and couples who cannot biologically produce their offspring. It expresses its intention to develop technologies that can create &quot;designer babies&quot; to the desired specification of their client. An additional project, Insuraclone, is designed to clone organs for an individual in the event of future organ failure, while Clonapet intended to clone people&#x27;s pets after the latter died.

The Raëlians are known for their socio-political activism, specifically for women&#x27;s rights, gay rights, opposition to racism, banning nuclear testing, and promoting genetically-modified foods. Throughout the history of Raëlism, members of the Raëlian Church have toured public settings advocating masturbation, condoms, and birth control. Through its activities, Palmer stated that the Raëlian Movement was involved in &quot;concocting, then carefully monitoring, a mild level of cultural conflict&quot; to generate publicity for the group, something coupled with &quot;blatant courtship of the media&quot;. She compared these tactics to those of Anton LaVey&#x27;s Church of Satan in the 1960s and 1970s. When media has adopted a mocking tone toward the religion, Raël has urged its followers to defend their beliefs, resulting in letter-writing campaigns and sometimes lawsuits.

In 1992, the IRM launched protests against the Montreal Catholic School Commission&#x27;s decision to veto the addition of condom machines to the bathrooms of Roman Catholic high schools in Quebec. The Raëlians parked a &quot;condom-mobile&quot; outside Roman Catholic high schools in Quebec and Ontario from which they dispensed contraceptives to the pupils. In 1993, the Raëlians organized a conference on masturbation in Quebec, at which speeches were given by Raël and Betty Dodson. Advertising this cause, Raëlians handed out badges with &quot;Oui à la masturbation (Yes to masturbation)&quot; on them at the Montreal Jazz Festival.

In 2000, the Raëlians launched NOPEDO, a group to combat paedophilia. In 2001, they publicly distributed leaflets in Italy and Switzerland protesting the existence of over a hundred child molesters among Roman Catholic clergy in France. Geneva&#x27;s Episcopal vicar sued the Raëlian Church for libel but the judge dismissed the charges as the Raëlian accusation was deemed to only target convicted priests and not the Roman Catholic Church as a whole. In 2002, Raëlians held an anti-clerical parade in Montreal, where they gave high school students Christian crosses and invited the students to both burn them and sign letters of apostasy to the Roman Catholic Church. The Quebec Association of Bishops called this &quot;incitement to hatred&quot;, and several school boards attempted to prevent their students from meeting Raëlians.

The movement supports genetically-modified foods. In 2003, naked members arranged themselves into the shape of the phrases &quot;J&#x27;aime OGM&quot; and &quot;I love GM&quot; in a Quebec field.
In 2006, about 30 Raëlians, some of them topless, took part in an anti-war demonstration in Seoul, South Korea. In 2003, Raëlians in white alien costumes bore signs bearing the message &quot;NO WAR ... ET wants Peace, too!&quot; to protest the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.
In 2009 it launched its &quot;Adopt a Clitoris&quot; project to raise money to create a hospital in Africa to reverse damage caused by female genital mutilation (FGM); it has also established Clitoraid, an organization whose mission is to oppose FGM. Another of the groups established by the Raëlian Church is ARAMIS (Active Raelian Association for Multiplicity In Sexuality), which is the Raëlian Association of Sexual Minorities and an LGBT rights group.

Several Raëlian groups in the United States have organized annual protests, claiming that women should have the same legal right to go topless in public that men enjoy without fear of arrest for indecent exposure. Some people have called this a publicity stunt designed to recruit members. Go Topless Day is their annual event, with women protesting topless except for nipple pasties to avoid arrest. It is held near 26 August, the anniversary of Women&#x27;s Equality Day.

== Demographics ==
Established in France, Raëlism initially spread in Francophone areas of Europe, Africa, and North America. As of the mid-1990s, membership clustered predominantly in France, Quebec, and Japan. Palmer noted that in Canada, Raëlism had faced difficulty spreading from Quebec and into the country&#x27;s Anglophone provinces. In 1999, Bozeman said that the Movement had around 35,000 members, while in 2003 Chryssides said it had about 55,000 members worldwide. By the early 2010s, the group was claiming 60,000 members internationally, a number Palmer and Sentes thought was &quot;probably inflated&quot;. In Britain, the sociologist Eileen Barker said that there were &quot;only a dozen or so&quot; committed members of the religion in 1989. By 2001, the sociologist David V. Barrett suggested that there were around 40 to 50 committed members in the country and around 500 sympathisers; two years later, Chryssides thought there were about 40 members and 200 sympathisers in Britain.

An internal survey of the group&#x27;s members in 1988 found that there were almost double as many men as women in the Movement. Similarly, based on her attendance at Raëlian events in Quebec, Palmer noted that men usually outnumbered women. She observed that many of the men acted in an effeminate fashion, and were often attracted to other men. Palmer also observed several transvestites at the meetings, and found that a significant number of the women present worked as strippers. On these grounds, she suggested that Raëlism had a particular appeal for &quot;people who define themselves as sexually marginal&quot;. Palmer also suggested that Raëlism had an appeal for &quot;committed atheists who are hopelessly secularized yet suffering from the existential angst of living in a world devoid of order and higher values&quot;.

=== Conversion ===
Raëlians engage in missionary activities to attract converts. Members buy Raël&#x27;s books to sell on the street, hoping to recoup their original costs. They often encounter much resistance to their attempts to convert others; Raël explains that this is to be expected, for the Elohim told him that only 4% of humanity is intelligent enough to be receptive to the Raëlian message. Any Raëlian found trying to force someone to convert is banned from the organisation for seven years, the period which Raëlians believe it takes for every cell in the body to be replaced.

Since 1979, new members of the Raëlian Movement have been expected to sign an &quot;Act of Apostasy,&quot; and send a letter of apostasy to any religious organisation that they were previously involved with. They also sign a contract permitting a mortician to cut a piece of bone from their forehead after death, which they understand as the &quot;Third Eye.&quot; This specimen will be stored in ice at a Swiss facility until the Elohim return, at which time it may be used to clone the deceased individual. This process is known as the &quot;lifting of the frontal bone.&quot; In addition, those joining are expected to bequeath their assets to the local Raëlian group, although this is not obligatory.

Some former Christian clergy have joined the Raëlians, sometimes being swiftly promoted to the level of Priest or Bishop due to the skills brought with them from their previous religious organisation. In 2004, for example, Ron Boston, a former bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, joined the Raëlian Movement, stating that doing so would allow him to embrace his homosexuality.

== Reception ==

According to sociologist Susan J. Palmer, in society, Raëlism is &quot;universally mocked&quot;, and even at conferences of scholars of religion, where individuals are accustomed to studying a diverse range of belief systems, attendees have treated Raëlian beliefs with &quot;incredulity or even mirth&quot;. Non-members often regard Raël&#x27;s claims as a deliberate forgery to fool his followers. An especially critical reception has come from ex-Raëlians and the anti-cult movement. Jean-Denis Saint-Cyr, a high-ranking member of the Raëlian movement, for instance accused Raël of plagiarising the earlier writings of Sendy in creating his religion. Another prominent apostate, the Quebecois Erick Lamarche – who calls himself Exraël – quit while claiming that too much money was being donated to Raël and the senior members so that they could have luxurious lifestyles. Critics repeatedly drew comparisons between Raëlism and Nazism, for instance for its promotion of a governance system where people are graded by their intelligence, its emphasis on genetic engineering, and its use of the swastika.

Raëlism has undergone academic research from scholars of religion, especially from Palmer, who first encountered the religion in Montreal in 1987. She initially thought that she &quot;had never encountered an NRM that was so cooperative, that actually liked being studied.&quot; Between 2002 and 2003, Palmer was blacklisted by the group; they banned her from their meetings and told her she had lost the opportunity to meet the Elohim on their arrival. Palmer then drew upon both her interviews with active members and Raël&#x27;s publications for her 2004 book on Raëlism, &quot;Aliens Adored&quot;.

Palmer related that journalists she had encountered were often &quot;fishing&quot; for &quot;bad things&quot; to say about the Raëlians. Many journalists sought to portray Raël as a danger to his followers, akin to David Koresh or Jim Jones, although Palmer thought this &quot;ludicrous&quot;, stating that Raël was &quot;not prone to violence&quot;. Journalists also sought to present him as someone who sexually exploited his female members, which again Palmer found no evidence for. Following statements that the Order of Raël&#x27;s Angels would do anything for Raël, there was also press speculation that the group would engage in mass suicide akin to that of the Order of the Solar Temple. Palmer argued that the Raëlians lacked the paranoid mentality and demonization of the outside world that had been common to new religious movements that resorted to violence.

<text>Romantic music is a stylistic movement in Western Classical music associated with the period of the 19th century commonly referred to as the Romantic era (or Romantic period). It is closely related to the broader concept of Romanticism—the intellectual, artistic, and literary movement that became prominent in Western culture from about 1798 until 1837.

Romantic composers sought to create music that was individualistic, emotional, dramatic, and often programmatic; reflecting broader trends within the movements of Romantic literature, poetry, art, and philosophy. Romantic music was often ostensibly inspired by (or else sought to evoke) non-musical stimuli, such as nature, literature, poetry, super-natural elements, or the fine arts. It included features such as increased chromaticism and moved away from traditional forms.

==Background==

The Romantic movement was an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement that originated in the second half of the 18th century in Europe and strengthened in reaction to the Industrial Revolution. In part, it was a revolt against social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment and a reaction against the scientific rationalization of nature. It was embodied most strongly in the visual arts, music, literature, and education, and was in turn influenced by developments in natural history.

One of the first significant applications of the term to music was in 1789, in the &quot;Mémoires&quot; by the Frenchman André Grétry, but it was E. T. A. Hoffmann who established the principles of musical romanticism, in a lengthy review of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony published in 1810, and an 1813 article on Beethoven&#x27;s instrumental music. In the first of these essays Hoffmann traced the beginnings of musical Romanticism to the later works of Haydn and Mozart. It was Hoffmann&#x27;s fusion of ideas already associated with the term &quot;Romantic&quot;, used in opposition to the restraint and formality of Classical models, that elevated music, and especially instrumental music, to a position of pre-eminence in Romanticism as the art most suited to the expression of emotions. It was also through the writings of Hoffmann and other German authors that German music was brought to the center of musical Romanticism.

==Traits==
The classical period often used short, even fragmentary, thematic material while the Romantic period tended to make greater use of longer, more fully defined and more emotionally evocative themes.

Characteristics often attributed to Romanticism:

* a new preoccupation with and surrender to nature;
*a turn towards the mystic and supernatural, both religious and unearthly;
*a focus on the nocturnal, the ghostly, the frightful, and terrifying;
*a new attention given to national identity;
*discontent with musical formulas and conventions;
*a greater emphasis on melody to sustain musical interest;
*increased chromaticism;
*a harmonic structure based on movement from tonic to subdominant or alternative keys rather than the traditional dominant, and use of more elaborate harmonic progressions (Wagner and Liszt are known for their experimental progressions);
*large, grand orchestras were common during this period;
*increase in virtuosic players featured in orchestrations;
*the use of new or previously not so common musical structures like the song cycle, nocturne, concert etude, arabesque, and rhapsody, alongside the traditional classical genres;
*Program music became somewhat more common;
*the use of a wider range of dynamics, for example from ppp to fff (from pianississimo, or very, very quiet to fortississimo, very, very loud), supported by large orchestration;
*a greater tonal range (for example, using the lowest and highest notes of the piano);

In music, there is a relatively clear dividing line in musical structure and form following the death of Beethoven. Whether one counts Beethoven as a &quot;romantic&quot; composer or not, the breadth and power of his work gave rise to a feeling that the classical sonata form and, indeed, the structure of the symphony, sonata and string quartet had been exhausted.

==Trends of the 19th century==

=== Non-musical influences ===
Events and changes in society such as ideas, attitudes, discoveries, inventions, and historical events often affect music. For example, the Industrial Revolution was in full effect by the late 18th century and early 19th century. This event profoundly affected music: there were major improvements in the mechanical valves and keys that most woodwinds and brass instruments depend on. The new and innovative instruments could be played with greater ease and they were more reliable.

Another development that affected music was the rise of the middle class. Composers before this period lived under the patronage of the aristocracy. Many times their audience was small, composed mostly of the upper class and individuals who were knowledgeable about music. The Romantic composers, on the other hand, often wrote for public concerts and festivals, with large audiences of paying customers, who had not necessarily had any music lessons. Composers of the Romantic Era, like Elgar, showed the world that there should be &quot;no segregation of musical tastes&quot; and that the &quot;purpose was to write music that was to be heard&quot;.

&quot;The music composed by Romantic [composers]&quot; reflected &quot;the importance of the individual&quot; by being composed in ways that were often less restrictive and more often focused on the composer&#x27;s skills as a person than prior means of writing music.

=== Nationalism ===

During the Romantic period, music often took on a much more nationalistic purpose. Composers composed with a distinct sound that represented their home country and traditions. For example, Jean Sibelius&#x27; &quot;Finlandia&quot; has been interpreted to represent the rising nation of Finland, which would someday gain independence from Russian control.

Frédéric Chopin was one of the first composers to incorporate nationalistic elements into his compositions. Joseph Machlis states, &quot;Poland&#x27;s struggle for freedom from tsarist rule aroused the national poet in Poland. ... Examples of musical nationalism abound in the output of the Romantic era. The folk idiom is prominent in the Mazurkas of Chopin&quot;. His mazurkas and polonaises are particularly notable for their use of nationalistic rhythms. Moreover, &quot;During World War II the Nazis forbade the playing of ... Chopin&#x27;s Polonaises in Warsaw because of the powerful symbolism residing in these works&quot;.

Other composers, such as Bedřich Smetana, wrote pieces that musically described their homelands. In particular, Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Vltava&quot; is a symphonic poem about the Moldau River in the modern-day Czech Republic, the second in a cycle of six nationalistic symphonic poems collectively titled &quot;Má vlast&quot; (My Homeland). Smetana also composed eight nationalist operas, all of which remain in the repertory. They established him as the first Czech nationalist composer as well as the most important Czech opera composer of the generation who came to prominence in the 1860s.

==History==
===Early Romantic===
The transition of Viennese classicism to Romanticism can be found in the work of Ludwig van Beethoven. Many typically romantic elements are encountered for the first time in his works. These works stand here in contrast to vocal music and are &quot;purely&quot; instrumental music. According to Hoffmann, the pure instrumental music of Viennese classical music, especially that of Beethoven, since it is free of material or program, is the embodiment of the romantic art idea. Another one of the most important representatives of late classicism and early romanticism is Franz Schubert. Because only with him did romantic features come into the German-language opera with his chamber music works and later also symphonies. In this field, his work is supplemented by the ballads of Carl Loewe. Carl Maria von Weber is important for the development of the German opera, especially with his popular Freischütz. In addition, there are fantastic-horrious materials by Heinrich Marschner and finally the cheerful opera by Albert Lortzing, while Louis Spohr became known mainly for his instrumental music. Still largely attached to classical music is the work of Johann Nepomuk Hummel, Ferdinand Ries, and the Frenchman George Onslow.

Italy experienced the heyday of the Belcanto opera in early Romanticism, associated with the names of Gioachino Rossini, Gaetano Donizetti, and Vincenzo Bellini. While Rossini&#x27;s comic operas are primarily known today, often only through their rousing overtures, Donizetti and Bellini predominate tragic content. The most important Italian instrumental composer of this time was the legendary &quot;devil&#x27;s violinist&quot; Niccolò Paganini.
In France, on the one hand, the light Opéra comique developed, its representatives are François-Adrien Boieldieu, Daniel-François-Esprit Auber, and Adolphe Adam, the latter also known for his ballets. One can also quote the famous eccentric composer and harpist Robert Nicolas-Charles Bochsa (seven operas). In addition, the Grand opéra came up with pompous stage sets, ballets and large choirs. Her first representative was Gaspare Spontini, her most important Giacomo Meyerbeer.

Music development has now also taken an upswing in other European countries. The Irishman John Field composed the first Nocturnes for piano, Friedrich Kuhlau worked in Denmark and the Swede Franz Berwald wrote four very idiosyncratic symphonies.

===High Romantic===

The high romanticism can be divided into two phases. In the first phase, the actual romantic music reaches its peak. The Polish composer Frédéric Chopin explored previously unknown depths of emotion in his character pieces and dances for piano. Robert Schumann, mentally immersed at the end of his life, represents in person as well as in music almost the prototype of the passionate romantic artist, shadowed by tragedy. His idiosyncratic piano pieces, chamber music works and symphonies should have a lasting influence on the following generation of musicians.

Franz Liszt, who came from the German minority in Hungary, was on the one hand a swarmed piano virtuoso, but on the other hand also laid the foundation for the progressive &quot;New German School&quot; with his harmoniously bold symphonic poems. Also committed to program music was the technique of the Idée fixe (leitmotif) of the Frenchman Hector Berlioz, who also significantly expanded the orchestra. Felix Mendelssohn was again more oriented towards the classicist formal language and became a role model especially for Scandinavian composers such as the Dane Niels Wilhelm Gade.
In opera, the operas of Otto Nicolai and Friedrich von Flotow still dominated in Germany when Richard Wagner wrote his first romantic operas. The early works of Giuseppe Verdi were also still based on the Belcanto ideal of the older generation. In France, the Opéra lyrique was developed by Ambroise Thomas and Charles Gounod. Russian music found its own language in the operas of Mikhail Glinka and Alexander Dargomyzhsky.

The second phase of high romanticism runs in parallel with the style of realism in literature and the visual arts. In the second half of his creation, Wagner now developed his leitmotif technique, with which he holds together the four-part ring of the Nibelungen, composed without arias; the orchestra is treated symphonically, the chromaticism reaches its extreme in Tristan and Isolde. A whole crowd of disciples is under the influence of Wagner&#x27;s progressive ideas, among them, for example, Peter Cornelius. On the other hand, an opposition arose from numerous more conservative composers, to whom Johannes Brahms, who sought a logical continuation of classical music in symphony, chamber music and song, became a model of scale due to the depth of the sensation and a masterful composition technique. Among others, Robert Volkmann, Friedrich Kiel, Carl Reinecke, Max Bruch, Josef Gabriel Rheinberger, and Hermann Goetz are included in this party.

In addition, some important loners came on the scene, among whom Anton Bruckner particularly stands out. Although a Wagner supporter, his clear-form style differs significantly from that of that composer. For example, the block-based instrumentation of Bruckner&#x27;s symphonies is derived from the registers of the organ. In the ideological struggle against Wagner&#x27;s adversaries, he was portrayed by his followers as a counterpart of Brahms. Felix Draeseke, who originally wrote &quot;future music in classical form&quot; starting from Liszt, also stands between the parties in composition.

Verdi also reached the way to a well-composed musical drama, albeit in a different way than Wagner. His immense charisma made all other composers fade in Italy, including Amilcare Ponchielli and Arrigo Boito, who was also the librettist of his late operas Otello and Falstaff.
In France, on the other hand, the light muse triumphed first in the form of the socio-critical operettas of Jacques Offenbach. Lyrical opera found its climax in the works of Jules Massenet, while in the Carmen by Georges Bizet, realism came for the first time. Louis Théodore Gouvy built a stylistic bridge to German music. The operas, symphonies and chamber music works of the extremely versatile Camille Saint-Saëns were, as were the ballets of Léo Delibes, more tradition-oriented. New orchestra colors were found in the compositions of Édouard Lalo and Emmanuel Chabrier. The Belgian-born César Franck was accompanied by a revival of organ music, which was continued by Charles-Marie Widor, later Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire.

A specific national romanticism had by now emerged in almost all European countries. The national Russian current started by Glinka was continued in Russia by the &quot;Group of Five&quot;: Mily Balakirev, Alexander Borodin, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, and César Cui. More western oriented were Anton Rubinstein and Pyotr Tchaikovsky, whose ballets and symphonies gained great popularity.
Bedřich Smetana founded Czech national music with his operas and the Symphony poems oriented towards Liszt. The symphonies, concerts and chamber music works of Antonín Dvořák, on the other hand, have Brahms as a model. In Poland, Stanisław Moniuszko was the leading opera composer, in Hungary Ferenc Erkel. Norway produced its best-known composers with Edvard Grieg, creator of lyrical piano works, songs and orchestral works such as the Peer-Gynt Suite; England&#x27;s voice resonated with the Brahms-oriented Hubert Parry and symphonist, as well as the comic operas of Arthur Sullivan.

===Late Romantic===
In late Romanticism, also called post-Romanticism, the traditional forms and elements of music are further dissolved. An increasingly colorful orchestral palette, an ever-increasing range of musical means, the spread of tonality to its limits, exaggerated emotions and an increasingly individual tonal language of the individual composer are typical features; the music is led to the threshold of modernity.
Thus, the symphonies of Gustav Mahler reached previously unknown dimensions, partly give up the traditional four-sentence and often contain vocal proportions. But behind the monumental facade is the modern expressiveness of the Fin de siècle. This psychological expressiveness is also contained in the songs of Hugo Wolf, miniature dramas for voice and piano. More committed to tradition, particularly oriented towards Bruckner, are the symphonies of Franz Schmidt and Richard Wetz, while Max Reger resorted to Bach&#x27;s polyphony in his numerous instrumental works, but developed it harmoniously extremely boldly. Among the numerous composers of the Reger successor, Julius Weismann and Joseph Haas stand out. Among the outstanding late romantic sound creators is also the idiosyncratic Hans Pfitzner. Although a traditionalist and decisive opponent of modern currents, quite a few of his works are quite close to the musical progress of the time. His successor include Walter Braunfels, who mainly emerged as an opera composer, and the symphonist Wilhelm Furtwängler.
The opera stage was particularly suitable for increased emotions. The folk and fairy tale operas of Engelbert Humperdinck, Wilhelm Kienzl and Siegfried Wagner, the son of Richard Wagner, were still quite good. But even Eugen d&#x27;Albert and Max von Schillings irritated the nerves with a German variant of verism. Erotic symbolism can be found in the stage works of Alexander von Zemlinsky and Franz Schreker. Richard Strauss went even further to the limits of tonality with &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot; before he took more traditional paths with &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;. In the style related to the works of Strauss, the compositions of Emil von Reznicek and Paul Graener are shown.

In Italy, opera still dominated during this time. This is where verism developed, an exaggerated realism that could easily turn into the striking and melodramatic on the opera stage. Despite their extensive work, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Pietro Mascagni, Francesco Cilea, and Umberto Giordano have only become known through one opera at a time. Only Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s work has been completely preserved in the repertoire of the opera houses, although he was also often accused of sentimentality. Despite some veristic works, Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari was mainly considered a revival of the Opera buffa. Ferruccio Busoni, a temporarily defender of modern classicity living in Germany, left behind a rather conventional, little played work. Thus, instrumental music actually only found its place in Italian music again with Ottorino Respighi, who was influenced by Impressionism.

The term Impressionism comes from painting, and like there, it also developed in music in France. In the works of Claude Debussy, the structures dissolved into the finest nuances of rhythm, dynamics and timbre. This development was prepared in the work of Vincent d&#x27;Indy, Ernest Chausson and above all in the songs and chamber music of Gabriel Fauré. All subsequent French composers were more or less influenced by Impressionism. The most important among them was Maurice Ravel, a brilliant orchestral virtuoso. Albert Roussel first processed exotic topics before he anticipated Neoclassical tendencies like Ravel. Gabriel Pierné, Paul Dukas, Charles Koechlin, and Florent Schmitt also dealt with symbolic and exotic-oriental substances. The loner Erik Satie was the creator of spun piano pieces and idol of the next generation. Nevertheless, Impressionism is often attributed to the epoch of modernity, if not seen as its own epoch.
Hubert Parry and the Irishman Charles Villiers Stanford initiated late Romanticism in England, which had its first important representative in Edward Elgar. While he revived the oratorio and wrote symphonies and concerts, Frederick Delius devoted himself to particularly small orchestral images with his own variant of Impressionism. Ethel Smyth wrote mainly operas and chamber music in a style that reminded Brahms. Ralph Vaughan Williams, whose works were inspired by English folk songs and Renaissance music, became the most important symphonist of his country. Gustav Holst incorporated Greek mythology and Indian philosophy into his work. Very idiosyncratic composer personalities in the transition to modernity were also Havergal Brian and Frank Bridge.

In Russia, Alexander Glazunov decorated his traditional composition technique with a colorful orchestral palette. The mystic Alexander Scriabin dreamed of a synthesis of colors, sound and scents. Sergei Rachmaninov wrote melancholic-pathetic piano pieces and concertos full of intoxicating virtuosity, while the piano works of Nikolai Medtner are more lyrical.

In the Czech Republic, Leoš Janáček, deeply rooted in the music of his Moravian homeland, found new areas of expression with the development of the language melody in his operas. The local sounds are also unmistakable in the music of Zdeněk Fibich, Josef Bohuslav Foerster, Vítězslav Novák, and Josef Suk. On the other hand, there is a slightly morbid exoticism and later classicist measure in the work of the Polish Karol Szymanowski.
The most important Danish composer is Carl Nielsen, known for symphonies and concerts. Even more dominant in his country is the position of the Finn Jean Sibelius, also a symphonist of melancholy expressiveness and clear line design. In Sweden, the works of Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, Wilhelm Stenhammar, and Hugo Alfvén show a typical Nordic conservatism, and the Norwegian Christian Sinding also composed traditionally.

The music of Spain also increased in popularity again after a long time, first in the piano works of Isaac Albéniz and Enrique Granados, then in the operas, ballets and orchestral works of Manuel de Falla, influenced by Impressionism.

Finally, the first important representatives of the United States also appeared with Edward MacDowell and Amy Beach. But even the work of Charles Ives belonged only partly to late Romanticism - much of it was already radically modern and pointed far into the 20th century.

==Schools==
===New German School===
The New German School was a loose collection of composers and critics informally led by Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner who strove for pushing the limits of chromatic harmony and program music as opposed to absolute music which they believed had reached its limit under Ludwig van Beethoven.

This group also pushed for the development and innovation of the symphonic poem, thematic transformation in musical form, and radical changes in tonality and harmony.

Other important members of this movement includes the critic Richard Pohl and composers Felix Draeseke, Julius Reubke, Karl Klindworth, William Mason, and Peter Cornelius.

=== The German Conservatives===

The conservatives were a broad group of musicians and critics who maintained the artistic legacy of Robert Schumann who adhered to composing and promoting absolute music.

They believed in continuing along the footsteps of Ludwig van Beethoven of composing the symphony genre in the classical mold, though they would implement their own musical language.

The most prominent members of this circle were Johannes Brahms, Joseph Joachim, Clara Schumann, and the Leipzig Conservatoire, which had been founded by Felix Mendelssohn.

===The Mighty Five===
The Mighty Five were a group of Russian composers centered in Saint Petersburg who collaborated with each other from 1856 to 1870 to create a distinctly Russian national style of classical music. They were often at odds with Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky who favored a more Western approach to classical composition.

Led by Mily Balakirev the group&#x27;s main members also consisted of César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin.

===The Belyayev Circle===

The Belyayev circle was a society of Russian musicians who met in Saint Petersburg from 1885 and 1908 who sought to continue the development of the national Russian style of classical music following in the footsteps of the Mighty Five although they were far more tolerant of the Western compositional style of Tchaikovsky.

This group was founded by Russian music publisher philanthropist Mitrofan Belyayev. The two most important composers of this group were Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Glazunov. Members also included Vladimir Stasov, Anatoly Lyadov, Alexander Ossovsky, Witold Maliszewski, Nikolai Tcherepnin, Nikolay Sokolov, and Alexander Winkler.

==Transition to Modernism==
During the later half of the 19th Century, some prominent composers began exploring the limits of the traditional tonal system. Important examples include Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner and Bagatelle sans tonalité by Franz Liszt. This limit was finally reached during the Late Romantic period where progressive tonality is demonstrated in the works of composers such as Gustav Mahler. With these developments, Romanticism finally began to break apart into several new parallel movements forming in response, bringing way to Modernism.

Some notable movements to form in response to Romanticism&#x27;s collapse include Expressionism with Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School being its main promoters and Primitivism with Igor Stravinsky being its most influential composer.

==Genres==
===Symphony===

Carried to the highest degree by Ludwig van Beethoven, the symphony becomes the most prestigious form to which many composers devote themselves. The most conservative respect to the Beethovenian model includes composers such as Franz Schubert, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Johannes Brahms. Others show an imagination that makes them go beyond this framework, in form or in the spirit: the most daring of them being Hector Berlioz.

Finally, some will also tell a story throughout their symphonies; like Franz Liszt, they will create the symphonic poem, a new musical genre, usually composed of a single movement and inspired by a theme, character or literary text. Since the symphonic poem is articulated around a leitmotiv (musical motif to identify a character, the hero for example), it is to be compared to music with a symphonic program.

===Lied===

This musical genre appeared with the evolution from pianoforte to piano during the romantic period. The lied is vocal music most often accompanied by this instrument. The singing is taken from romantic poems and this style makes it possible to bring the voice as close to feelings as possible. One of the first and most famous lieder composers is Franz Schubert, with Erlkönig, however, many other romantic composers have devoted themselves to the lied genre such as Saint-Saëns, Duparc, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Hugo Wolf, Gustav Mahler, and Richard Strauss.

===Concerto===

It is Beethoven who inaugurates the romantic concerto, with his five piano concertos (especially the fifth) and his violin concerto where many characteristics of classicism can still be recognized. His example is followed by many composers: the concerto rivals the symphony in the repertoire of major orchestral formations.

Finally, the concerto will allow instrumentalist composers to reveal their virtuosity, such as Niccolò Paganini on the violin, and Frédéric Chopin, Robert Schumann, and Franz Liszt on the piano.

===Nocturne===
The nocturne is presented as a short-lived confidential piece, which the Irish composer John Field was one of the first to cultivate. Immersed in the climate of the night, an atmosphere privileged by romantics, it is often of ABA structure, with a very flexible and ornate melody, accompanied by a left hand with undulating arpeggios. The tempo is usually slow, and the central part is often more agitated.

Frédéric Chopin has set the most famous form of the nocturnes. He wrote 21, from 1827 to 1846. First published in series of three (opus 9 and 15), they are then grouped in pairs (opus 27, 32, 37, 48, 55, 62).

===Ballet===

The Romantic ballet was developed throughout the 19th century, especially by composers such as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in Russia and Léo Delibes in France.

===Opera===
====France====
During the 19th century, romanticism took a hold of opera and it was Paris that became one of its main centers. Most romantic operas were composed by composers living in France, such as Luigi Cherubini, Gaspare Spontini, François-Adrien Boieldieu, and Daniel-François-Esprit Auber. The apogee of the style of great operas is marked by the works of Giacomo Meyerbeer. Hector Berlioz&#x27;s Les Troyens was first ignored, Benvenuto Cellini is consputed during the premiere, while Charles Gounod&#x27;s Faust is one of the most popular French operas of the mid-19th century.

During the second part of the 19th century, Georges Bizet will revolutionize opera with Carmen: &quot;local color based on the use of Spanish songs and dances&quot; according to Nietzsche, it is &quot;a ray of Mediterranean light dissipating the fog of the Wagnerian ideal&quot;. Interest in &quot;local color&quot; works is confirmed with Lakmé by Léo Delibes, and Samson and Dalila by Camille Saint-Saëns. The most productive French composer of operas of the last part of the century was Jules Massenet composing works such as Manon, Werther, and Thaïs.

Jacques Offenbach, who composed Les Contes d&#x27;Hoffmann, established himself as the master of French opera-comique of the 19th century, inventing a new genre, the French opéra bouffe, which later was confused with the operetta.

At the beginning of the 20th century, romanticism in France was gradually abandoned in favor of other currents such as Impressionism or symbolism, carried in particular by Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; (1902).

====Germany====

Carl Maria von Weber, with Der Freischütz (1821) creates the first German romantic opera; the first important opera being Beethoven&#x27;s Fidelio (1805), the only operatic work of this composer.

Richard Wagner, from the Der fliegende Holländer, introduces the leitmotiv and the &quot;cyclical melody&quot; process. He revolutionizes opera by duration and instrumental power. His major work, Tetralogy is one of the summits of German opera. He creates the &quot;musical drama&quot; in which the orchestra now becomes the protagonist in the same way as the characters. In 1876, the Bayreuth Festival was created dedicated to the exclusive representation of Wagner&#x27;s works.

Wagner&#x27;s influence continues in virtually all operas, even in Hänsel und Gretel by Engelbert Humperdinck. The dominant figure is then Richard Strauss, who uses orchestration and vocal techniques similar to those of Wagner in &quot;Salome&quot; and &quot;Elektra&quot; while developing his own path. &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; is the work of Strauss that had the most flamboyant success at the time.

====Italy====
Italian romanticism begins with Gioachino Rossini who composed works such as The Barber of Seville and La Cenerentola. He created the &quot;bel canto&quot; style, a style adopted by his contemporaries Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti.

However, the face of Italian opera is Giuseppe Verdi whose Nabucco&#x27;s slave choir is a very important hymn to all of Italy. The trilogy formed by Rigoletto, Il trovatore and La traviata are among his major works but he reaches the peak of his art with Otello and Falstaff at the end of his career. He has infuled his works with unparalleled dramatic vigour and rhythmic vitality.

In the second part of the 19th century, Giacomo Puccini, Verdi&#x27;s undisputed successor, transcends realism into verism. La Bohème, Tosca, Madame Butterfly, and Turandot are melodic operas loaded with emotion.

====Other countries====

Other works of national inspiration:

* In Russia, a national school is developing with Mikhail Glinka who composed A Life for the Tsar, Ruslan and Ludmila. Other great Russian works: Sadko by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Prince Igor by Alexander Borodin, Boris Godunov by Modest Mussorgsky, Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades by Pyotr Ilich Tchaikovsky.
* In the Czech Republic, the national spirit is embodied by The Bartered Bride of Bedřich Smetana, Rusalka of Antonín Dvořák, Šárka of Zdeněk Fibich, and Jenůfa of Leoš Janáček.
* In Great Britain, Michael William Balfe, who composed The Bohemian Girl, the British romantic opera par excellence. He also composes for the French scene.

<text>Rapids are sections of a river where the river bed has a relatively steep gradient, causing an increase in water velocity and turbulence. Flow, gradient, constriction, and obstacles are four factors that are needed for a rapid to be created.

== Physical factors ==
Rapids are hydrological features between a &quot;run&quot; (a smoothly flowing part of a stream) and a &quot;cascade&quot;. Rapids are characterized by the river becoming shallower with some rocks exposed above the flow surface. As flowing water splashes over and around the rocks, air bubbles become mixed in with it and portions of the surface acquire a white color, forming what is called &quot;whitewater&quot;. Rapids occur where the bed material is highly resistant to the erosive power of the stream in comparison with the bed downstream of the rapids. Very young streams flowing across solid rock may be rapids for much of their length. Rapids cause water aeration of the stream or river, resulting in better water quality.

For a rapid to form, a necessary condition is the presence of a gradient, which refers to the river or stream&#x27;s downward slope. When a river has a larger gradient, the water flows downhill faster. Gradients are typically measured in feet per mile. This impacts the river&#x27;s flow or discharge, which is measured as a volume of water per unit of time. The faster the water flows, the more likely a rapid will form.

Rapids typically form due to differential erosion in the sloping strata forming the streambed in presence of a gradient, the softer rocks erode away faster whereas the harder rocks persist resulting in an uneven streambed.

The safety of a section of river is measured by classes or levels, generally running from I to VI on basis of how navigable the rapids are. A Class 5 rapid may be categorized as Class 5.1-5.9. While Class I rapids are easy to navigate and require little maneuvering, Class VI rapids pose threat to life with little or no chance for rescue, often classified as &#x27;U&#x27; for Uraftable. River rafting sports are carried out where many rapids are present in the course.

Constriction refers to when rivers flow through narrower channels, thus increasing the velocity of the water. This may also lead to the creation of obstructions due to sediment transportation and erosion. Obstacles may occur by human activity, natural landslides and earthquakes, or accumulation of sediment or debris. The more prominent these four factors are present in a river, the more likely that river is to be a rapid river.

<text>Rutherfordium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Rf and atomic number 104. It is named after physicist Ernest Rutherford. As a synthetic element, it is not found in nature and can only be made in a particle accelerator. It is radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 267Rf, has a half-life of about 48 minutes.

In the periodic table, it is a d-block element and the second of the fourth-row transition elements. It is in period 7 and is a group 4 element. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homolog to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare well with the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.

In the 1960s, small amounts of rutherfordium were produced at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. Priority of discovery and hence the name of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name of the element.

==Introduction==
==History==

===Discovery===
Rutherfordium was reportedly first detected in 1964 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna (Soviet Union at the time). Researchers there bombarded a plutonium-242 target with neon-22 ions; a spontaneous fission activity with half-life 0.3 ± 0.1 seconds was detected and assigned to 260104. Later work found no isotope of element 104 with this half-life, so that this assignment must be considered incorrect.

In 1966–1969, the experiment was repeated. This time, the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with ZrCl4. The team identified spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-hafnium properties.

: + → 264−&quot;x&quot;104 → 264−&quot;x&quot;104Cl4

The researchers considered the results to support the 0.3 second half-life. Although it is now known that there is no isotope of element 104 with such a half-life, the chemistry does fit that of element 104, as chloride volatility is much greater in group 4 than in group 3 (or the actinides).

In 1969, researchers at University of California, Berkeley conclusively synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with carbon-12 ions and measured the alpha decay of 257104, correlated with the daughter decay of nobelium-253:
: + → 257104 + 4 

They were unable to confirm the 0.3-second half-life for 260104, and instead found a 10–30 millisecond half-life for this isotope, agreeing with the modern value of 21 milliseconds. In 1970, the American team chemically identified element 104 using the ion-exchange separation method, proving it to be a group 4 element and the heavier homologue of hafnium.

The American synthesis was independently confirmed in 1973 and secured the identification of rutherfordium as the parent by the observation of K-alpha X-rays in the elemental signature of the 257104 decay product, nobelium-253.

===Naming controversy===

As a consequence of the initial competing claims of discovery, an element naming controversy arose. Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name &quot;kurchatovium&quot; (Ku) in honor of Igor Kurchatov (1903–1960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. This name had been used in books of the Soviet Bloc as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed &quot;rutherfordium&quot; (Rf) for the new element to honor New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford, who is known as the &quot;father&quot; of nuclear physics. In 1992, the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 in 1969, and that credit should be shared between the two groups. In particular, this involved the TWG performing a new retrospective reanalysis of the Russian work in the face of the later-discovered fact that there is no 0.3-second isotope of element 104: they reinterpreted the Dubna results as having been caused by a spontaneous fission branch of 259104.

The American group wrote a scathing response to the findings of the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians, considered the TWG&#x27;s retrospective treatment of the Russian work based on unpublished documents to have been &quot;highly irregular&quot;, noted that there was no proof that 259104 had a spontaneous fission branch at all (as of 2021 there still is not), and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that this was not the case and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery.

The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted &quot;unnilquadium&quot; (Unq) as a temporary, systematic element name, derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested a set of names for elements 104 through 109, in which &quot;dubnium&quot; (Db) became element 104 and &quot;rutherfordium&quot; became element 106. This recommendation was criticized by the American scientists for several reasons. Firstly, their suggestions were scrambled: the names &quot;rutherfordium&quot; and &quot;hahnium&quot;, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were respectively reassigned to elements 106 and 108. Secondly, elements 104 and 105 were given names favored by JINR, despite earlier recognition of LBL as an equal co-discoverer for both of them. Thirdly and most importantly, IUPAC rejected the name &quot;seaborgium&quot; for element 106, having just approved a rule that an element could not be named after a living person, even though the IUPAC had given the LBNL team the sole credit for its discovery. In 1997, IUPAC renamed elements 104 to 109, and gave elements 104 and 106 the Berkeley proposals &quot;rutherfordium&quot; and &quot;seaborgium&quot;. The name &quot;dubnium&quot; was given to element 105 at the same time. The 1997 names were accepted by researchers and became the standard.
==Isotopes==

Rutherfordium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Seventeen different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 252 to 270 (with the exceptions of 264 and 269). Most of these decay predominantly through spontaneous fission, particularly isotopes with even neutron numbers, while some of the lighter isotopes with odd neutron numbers also have significant alpha decay branches. 

===Stability and half-lives===
Out of isotopes whose half-lives are known, the lighter isotopes usually have shorter half-lives. The three lightest known isotopes have half-lives of under 50 μs, with the lightest reported isotope 252Rf having a half-life shorter than one microsecond. The isotopes 256Rf, 258Rf, 260Rf are more stable at around 10 ms; 255Rf, 257Rf, 259Rf, and 262Rf live between 1 and 5 seconds; and 261Rf, 265Rf, and 263Rf are more stable, at around 1.1, 1.5, and 10 minutes respectively. The most stable known isotope, 267Rf, is one of the heaviest, and has a half-life of about 48 minutes. Rutherfordium isotopes with an odd neutron number tend to have longer half-lives than their even–even neighbors because the odd neutron provides additional hindrance against spontaneous fission.

The lightest isotopes were synthesized by direct fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes have only been observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been reported as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission. It seems likely that the same is true for 270Rf, a possible daughter of 270Db. These three isotopes remain unconfirmed.

In 1999, American scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, announced that they had succeeded in synthesizing three atoms of 293Og. These parent nuclei were reported to have successively emitted seven alpha particles to form 265Rf nuclei, but their claim was retracted in 2001. This isotope was later discovered in 2010 as the final product in the decay chain of 285Fl.

==Predicted properties==
Very few properties of rutherfordium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that rutherfordium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties have been measured, but properties of rutherfordium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.

===Chemical===
Rutherfordium is the first transactinide element and the second member of the 6d series of transition metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of hafnium and very different from that of lead. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium&#x27;s basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements, below titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore rutherfordium should also exhibit a stable +4 state. In addition, rutherfordium is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state. The standard reduction potential of the Rf4+/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than −1.7 V.

Initial predictions of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves like the rest of the group 4 elements. Later it was shown in ab initio calculations with the high level of accuracy that the Rf atom has the ground state with the 6d2 7s2 valence configuration and the low-lying excited 6d1 7s2 7p1 state with the excitation energy of only 0.3–0.5 eV.

In an analogous manner to zirconium and hafnium, rutherfordium is projected to form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.

In the aqueous phase, the Rf4+ ion hydrolyzes less than titanium(IV) and to a similar extent as zirconium and hafnium, thus resulting in the RfO2+ ion. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes and . For the fluoride complexes, zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta- and octa- complexes. Thus, for the larger rutherfordium ion, the complexes , and are possible.

===Physical and atomic===
&lt;section begin=properties /&gt;
Rutherfordium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and have a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (&quot;c&quot;/&quot;a&quot; = 1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a metal with density ~17 g/cm3. The atomic radius of rutherfordium is expected to be ~150 pm. Due to relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologs. When under high pressure (variously calculated as 72 or ~50 GPa), rutherfordium is expected to transition to body-centered cubic crystal structure; hafnium transforms to this structure at 71±1 GPa, but has an intermediate ω structure that it transforms to at 38±8 GPa that should be lacking for rutherfordium.&lt;section end=properties /&gt;

==Experimental chemistry==
===Gas phase===

Early work on the study of the chemistry of rutherfordium focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent rutherfordium radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies, though the long-lived isotope 267Rf (produced in the decay chain of 291Lv, 287Fl, and 283Cn) may be advantageous for future experiments. The experiments relied on the expectation that rutherfordium would be a 6d element in group 4 and should therefore form a volatile molecular tetrachloride, that would be tetrahedral in shape. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.

A series of experiments confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as a typical member of group 4, forming a tetravalent chloride (RfCl4) and bromide (RfBr4) as well as an oxychloride (RfOCl2). A decreased volatility was observed for when potassium chloride is provided as the solid phase instead of gas, highly indicative of the formation of nonvolatile mixed salt.

===Aqueous phase===
Rutherfordium is expected to have the electron configuration [Rn]5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.

The most conclusive aqueous chemistry studies of rutherfordium have been performed by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of rutherfordium, hafnium, zirconium, as well as the pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for rutherfordium. A comparison with its lighter homologues placed rutherfordium firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, in a manner similar to hafnium and zirconium.

: + 6 → 

Very similar results were observed in hydrofluoric acid solutions. Differences in the extraction curves were interpreted as a weaker affinity for fluoride ion and the formation of the hexafluororutherfordate ion, whereas hafnium and zirconium ions complex seven or eight fluoride ions at the concentrations used:

: + 6 → 

Experiments performed in mixed sulfuric and nitric acid solutions shows that rutherfordium has a much weaker affinity towards forming sulfate complexes than hafnium. This result is in agreement with predictions, which expect rutherfordium complexes to be less stable than those of zirconium and hafnium because of a smaller ionic contribution to the bonding. This arises because rutherfordium has a larger ionic radius (76 pm) than zirconium (71 pm) and hafnium (72 pm), and also because of relativistic stabilisation of the 7s orbital and destabilisation and spin–orbit splitting of the 6d orbitals.

Coprecipitation experiments performed in 2021 studied rutherfordium&#x27;s behaviour in basic solution containing ammonia or sodium hydroxide, using zirconium, hafnium, and thorium as comparisons. It was found that rutherfordium does not strongly coordinate with ammonia and instead coprecipitates out as a hydroxide, which is probably Rf(OH)4.

<text>Johannes Müller von Königsberg (6 June 1436 – 6 July 1476), better known as Regiomontanus (), was a mathematician, astrologer and astronomer of the German Renaissance, active in Vienna, Buda and Nuremberg. His contributions were instrumental in the development of Copernican heliocentrism in the decades following his death.

Regiomontanus wrote under the Latinized name of &quot;Ioannes de Monteregio&quot; (or &quot;Monte Regio&quot;; &quot;Regio Monte&quot;); the toponym &quot;Regiomontanus&quot; was first used by Philipp Melanchthon in 1534. He is named after Königsberg in Lower Franconia, not the larger Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad) in Prussia.

==Life==

Although little is known of Regiomontanus&#x27; early life, it is believed that at eleven years of age, he became a student at the University of Leipzig, Saxony. In 1451 he continued his studies at Alma Mater Rudolfina, the university in Vienna, in the Duchy of Austria, where he became a pupil and friend of Georg von Peuerbach. In 1452 he was awarded his bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;baccalaureus&quot;), and he was awarded his master&#x27;s degree (&quot;magister artium&quot;) at the age of 21 in 1457. He lectured in optics and ancient literature.

In 1460 the papal legate Basilios Bessarion came to Vienna on a diplomatic mission. Being a humanist scholar with a great interest in the mathematical sciences, Bessarion sought out Peuerbach&#x27;s company. George of Trebizond who was Bessarion&#x27;s philosophical rival had recently produced a new Latin translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; from the Greek, which Bessarion, correctly, regarded as inaccurate and badly translated, so he asked Peuerbach to produce a new one. Peuerbach&#x27;s Greek was not good enough to do a translation but he knew the &quot;Almagest&quot; intimately so instead he started work on a modernised, improved abridgement of the work. Bessarion also invited Peuerbach to become part of his household and to accompany him back to Italy when his work in Vienna was finished. Peuerbach accepted the invitation on the condition that Regiomontanus could also accompany them. However Peuerbach fell ill in 1461 and died having completed only the first six books of his abridgement of the &quot;Almagest&quot;. On his death bed Peuerbach made Regiomontanus promise to finish the book and publish it.

In 1461 Regiomontanus left Vienna with Bessarion and spent the next four years travelling around Northern Italy as a member of Bessarion&#x27;s household, looking for and copying mathematical and astronomical manuscripts for Bessarion, who possessed the largest private library in Europe at the time. Regiomontanus also made the acquaintance of the leading Italian mathematicians of the age such as Giovanni Bianchini and Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli who had also been friends of Peuerbach during his prolonged stay in Italy more than twenty years earlier.

In 1467, he went to work for János Vitéz, archbishop of Esztergom. There he calculated extensive astronomical tables and built astronomical instruments. Next he went to Buda, and the court of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, for whom he built an astrolabe, and where he collated Greek manuscripts for a handsome salary. The trigonometric tables that he created while living in Hungary, his &quot;Tabulae directionum profectionumque&quot; (printed posthum., 1490), were designed for astrology, including finding astrological houses. The &quot;Tabulae&quot; also contained several tangent tables.

In 1471 Regiomontanus moved to the Free City of Nuremberg, in Franconia, then one of the Empire&#x27;s important seats of learning, publication, commerce and art, where he worked with the humanist and merchant Bernhard Walther. Here he founded the world&#x27;s first scientific printing press, and in 1472 he published the first printed astronomical textbook, the &quot;Theoricae novae Planetarum&quot; of his teacher Georg von Peurbach.

Regiomontanus and Bernhard Walther observed the comet of 1472. Regiomontanus tried to estimate its distance from Earth, using the angle of parallax. According to David A. Seargeant:
The 1472 comet was visible from Christmas Day 1471 to 1 March 1472 (Julian Calendar), a total of 59 days.

In 1475, Regiomontanus was called to Rome by Pope Sixtus IV on to work on the planned calendar reform. Sixtus promised substantial rewards, including the title of bishop of Regensburg, but it is unlikely that he was actually appointed to the role.

On his way to Rome, stopping in Venice, he commissioned the publication of his &quot;Calendarium&quot; with Erhard Ratdolt (printed in 1476). Regiomontanus reached Rome, but he died there after only a few months, in his 41st year, on 6 July 1476. According to a rumor repeated by Gassendi in his Regiomontanus biography, he was poisoned by relatives of George of Trebizond whom he had criticized in his writing; it is however considered more likely that he died from the plague.

==Work==

During his time in Italy he completed Peuerbach&#x27;s abridgement of &quot;Almagest&quot;, &quot;Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei&quot;. In 1464, he completed &quot;De triangulis omnimodis&quot; (&quot;On Triangles of All Kinds&quot;). &quot;De triangulis omnimodis&quot; was one of the first textbooks presenting the current state of trigonometry and included lists of questions for review of individual chapters. In it he wrote:

In 1465, he built a portable sundial for Pope Paul II.

In &quot;Epytoma in almagesti Ptolemei&quot;, he critiqued the translation of &quot;Almagest&quot; by George of Trebizond, pointing out inaccuracies. Later Nicolaus Copernicus would refer to this book as an influence on his own work.

A prolific author, Regiomontanus was internationally famous in his lifetime. Despite having completed only a quarter of what he had intended to write, he left a substantial body of work. Nicolaus Copernicus&#x27; teacher, Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara, referred to Regiomontanus as having been his own teacher. There is speculation that Regiomontanus had arrived at a theory of heliocentrism before he died; a manuscript shows particular attention to the heliocentric theory of the Pythagorean Aristarchus, mention was also given to the motion of the earth in a letter to a friend.

Much of the material on spherical trigonometry in Regiomontanus&#x27; &quot;On Triangles&quot; was taken directly from the twelfth-century work of Jabir ibn Aflah otherwise known as Geber, as noted in the sixteenth century by Gerolamo Cardano.

==Legacy==
Simon Stevin, in his book describing decimal representation of fractions (De Thiende), cites the trigonometric tables of Regiomontanus as suggestive of positional notation.

Regiomontanus designed his own astrological house system, which became one of the most popular systems in Europe.

In 1561, Daniel Santbech compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus, &quot;De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque&quot; (first published in 1533) and &quot;Compositio tabularum sinum recto&quot;, as well as Santbech&#x27;s own &quot;Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem&quot;. It was published in Basel by Henrich Petri and Petrus Perna.

There is an image of him in Hartmann Schedel&#x27;s 1493 &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot;. He is holding an astrolabe. Yet, although there are thirteen illustrations of comets in the &quot;Chronicle&quot; (from 471 to 1472), they are stylized, rather than representing the actual objects.

The crater Regiomontanus on the Moon is named after him.

<text>The two-round system (TRS or 2RS), sometimes called ballotage, top-two runoff, or two-round [[First-past-the-post voting|plurality]], is a single-winner voting method involving two rounds by choose-one voting, where the voter marks a single favorite candidate. The two candidates with the most votes in the first round then move on to a second round. The two-round system falls under the plurality-rule family of voting rules, along with similar rules like instant-runoff (ranked-choice) voting and first-preference plurality (FPP).

The two-round system first emerged in France and has since become the most common single-winner electoral system worldwide. Despite this, runoff-based rules like the two-round system and RCV have faced criticism from social choice theorists as a result of their susceptibility to center squeeze (a kind of spoiler effect favoring extremists) and problems like the no-show paradox. This has led to the rise of electoral reform movements which seek to replace the two-round system with other systems like rated voting, particularly in France.

In the United States, the first round is often called a jungle or top-two primary. Georgia, Louisiana, California, and Washington use the two-round system for all non-presidential elections. Mississippi uses it for state offices, while Alaska and Maine use the similar ranked-choice voting (RCV) system which does not require multiple rounds. Most other states use a partisan primary system that is often described as behaving like a two-round system in practice, with primaries narrowing down the field to two frontrunners who typically receive almost all the votes. Studies have found little-to-no difference between top-two and traditional partisan primaries on most outcomes like political polarization, but lower levels of electoral participation and more voter confusion under nonpartisan primaries.

== Origins ==
The French system of ballotage was first established as part of the reforms of the July Monarchy, with the term appearing in the Organic Decree of 2 February 1832 of the French government, which mandated a second-round election &quot;when none of the candidates obtains an absolute majority&quot;. The rule has since gained substantial popularity in South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa, where it is now the dominant system.

Some variants of the two-round system use slightly different rules for eliminating candidates in the first round, allowing more than two candidates to proceed to the second round in some cases. Under such systems, it is sufficient for a candidate to receive a plurality of votes (more votes than anyone else) to be elected in the second round.

== Example ==

=== 2002 French presidential election ===
In the 2002 French presidential election, the two contenders described by the media as possible winners were Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin, who represented the largest two political parties in France at the time. However, 16 candidates were on the ballot, including Jean-Pierre Chevènement (5.33%) and Christiane Taubira (2.32%) from the Plural Left coalition of Jospin, who refused by excess of confidence to dissuade them.

With the left vote divided among a number of candidates, a third contender, Jean-Marie Le Pen, unexpectedly obtained slightly more than Jospin in the first round:

* Jacques Chirac (Centre-right, Gaullist): 19.88%
* Jean-Marie Le Pen (Far-right, National Front): 16.86%
* Lionel Jospin (Centre-left, Socialist): 16.18%

The other candidates received smaller percentages on the first round.

Because no candidate had obtained an absolute majority of the votes in the first round, the top two candidates went into the second round. Most supporters of the parties which did not get through to the second round (and Chirac&#x27;s supporters) voted for Chirac, who won with a very large majority:

* Jacques Chirac (Center-right, Gaullist): 82.21%
* Jean-Marie Le Pen (Far-right, National Front): 17.79%
Despite the controversy over Jospin&#x27;s early elimination, polls showed Chirac was preferred to Jospin by a majority of voters and that Chirac was the majority-preferred candidate, meaning the election was not spoiled.

=== 2024 French legislative election ===
French legislative elections allow more than two candidates to advance to the second round, leading to many triangular elections, such as in the 2024 French legislative election. It is common for all but two candidates to withdraw from the second round (so they don&#x27;t spoil the chances of another similar candidate) which makes the result similar to top-two two-round systems.

== Variants ==

=== Two-party runoff vote ===
A two-party vote is used for elections to the Bhutanese National Assembly, where the first round selects two parties that are allowed to compete in the second round. Then, a second round is held using single-member districts with first-past-the-post.

=== Top-two primaries ===

In the United States, a two-round system called the jungle primary and used in Louisiana in place of traditional primary elections to choose each party&#x27;s candidate. In this state, the first round is held on Election Day with runoffs occurring soon after.

Washington adopted a two-round system in a 2008 referendum, called the nonpartisan blanket primary or top-two primary. California approved the system in 2010, which was first used for the 36th congressional district special election in February 2011. The first election (the primary) is held &quot;before&quot; the general election in November and the top two candidates enter the general election. The general election is always held, even if a candidate gets over 50%.

Georgia can have a second round after Election Day if the winner of the first round does not get more than 50%. However normal partisan primaries are used so it is rare to have more than 2 competitive candidates in the first round.

=== Exhaustive ballot ===
The exhaustive ballot (EB) is similar to the two-round system, but involves more rounds of voting rather than just two. If no candidate receives an absolute majority in the first round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. This continues until one candidate has an absolute majority. Because voters may have to cast votes several times, EB is not used in large-scale public elections. Instead it is used in smaller contests such as the election of the presiding officer of an assembly; one long-standing example of its use is in the United Kingdom, where local associations (LCAs) of the Conservative Party use EB to elect their prospective parliamentary candidates (PPCs). Exhaustive ballot is also used by FIFA and the International Olympic Committee to select hosts.

=== Contingent vote ===
The &quot;contingent&quot; or &quot;supplementary&quot; vote is a variant of instant-runoff voting that has been used in Queensland and was previously used in the United Kingdom to elect some mayors; it was ultimately abandoned as a result of its complex election administration. Under the contingent vote, voters rank the top-two candidates. However it involves only two rounds of counting and uses the same rule for eliminating candidates as the two-round system. After the first round all but the two candidates with most votes are eliminated. Therefore, one candidate always achieves an absolute majority in the second round. Because of these similarities, the contingent vote tends to elect the same winner as the two-round system and instant-runoff voting.

=== Instant-runoff voting ===
Instant-runoff voting (IRV), like the exhaustive ballot, involves multiple reiterative counts in which the candidate with fewest votes is eliminated each time. Whilst the exhaustive ballot and the two-round system both involve voters casting a separate vote in each round, under instant-runoff, voters vote only once. This is possible because, rather than voting for only a single candidate, the voter ranks all of the candidates in order of preference. These preferences are then used to transfer the votes of those whose first preference has been eliminated during the course of the count. Because the two-round system and the exhaustive ballot involve separate rounds of voting, voters can use the results of one round to decide how they will vote in the next, whereas this is not possible under IRV. Because it is necessary to vote only once, IRV is used for elections in many places. For such as Australian general and state elections (called &quot;preferential voting&quot;). In the United States, it is known as ranked-choice voting and is used in a growing number of states and localities.

In Ireland it is known as the single transferable vote (STV) and is used for presidential elections and parliamentary elections. However, STV as applied in multi-member districts is a proportional voting system, not a majoritarian one; and candidates need only achieve a quota (or the highest remaining fraction of a quota), to be elected. STV is used in Northern Ireland, Malta, the Australian senate and various other jurisdictions in Australia. It is often used for municipal elections in lieu of more party-based forms of proportional representation.

==Compliance with voting method criteria==
Most of the mathematical criteria by which voting methods are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal preferences. Some methods, like approval voting, request information than cannot be unambiguously inferred from a single set of ordinal preferences. The two-round system is such a method, because the voters are not forced to vote according to a single ordinal preference in both rounds.

If the voters determine their preferences before the election and always vote directly consistent to them, they will emulate the contingent vote and get the same results as if they were to use that method. Therefore, in that model of voting behavior, the two-round system passes all criteria that the contingent vote passes, and fails all criteria the contingent vote fails.

Since the voters in the two-round system do not have to choose their second round votes while voting in the first round, they are able to adjust their votes as players in a game. More complex models consider voter behavior when the voters reach a game-theoretical equilibrium from which they have no incentive, as defined by their internal preferences, to further change their behavior. However, because these equilibria are complex, only partial results are known. With respect to the voters&#x27; internal preferences, the two-round system passes the majority criterion in this model, as a majority can always coordinate to elect their preferred candidate. Also, in the case of three candidates or less and a robust political equilibrium, the two-round system will pick the Condorcet winner whenever there is one, which is not the case in the contingent vote model.

The equilibrium mentioned above is a perfect-information equilibrium and so only strictly holds in idealized conditions where every voter knows every other voter&#x27;s preference. Thus it provides an upper bound on what can be achieved with rational (self-interested) coordination or knowledge of others&#x27; preferences. Since the voters almost surely will not have perfect information, it may not apply to real elections. In that matter, it is similar to the perfect competition model sometimes used in economics. To the extent that real elections approach this upper bound, large elections would do so less so than small ones, because it is less likely that a large electorate has information about all the other voters than that a small electorate has.

==Tactical voting and strategic nomination==


Runoff voting is intended to reduce the potential for eliminating &quot;wasted&quot; votes by tactical voting. Under the plurality voting system (also known as first past the post), voters are encouraged to vote tactically, by voting for only one of the two leading candidates, because a vote for any other candidate will not affect the result. Under runoff voting, this tactic, known as &quot;compromising&quot;, it is sometimes unnecessary because even if a voter&#x27;s favorite candidate is eliminated in the first round, they will still have an opportunity to influence the result of the election by voting for a more popular candidate in the second round. However the tactic of compromising can still be used in runoff voting—it is sometimes necessary to compromise as a way of influencing which two candidates will survive to the second round. In order to do this it is necessary to vote for one of the &quot;three&quot; leading candidates in the first round, just as in an election held under the plurality method it is necessary to vote for one of the &quot;two&quot; leading candidates.

Runoff voting is also vulnerable to another tactic called &quot;push over&quot;. This is a tactic by which voters vote tactically for an unpopular &quot;push over&quot; candidate in the first round as a way of helping their true favorite candidate win in the second round. The purpose of voting for the push over, in theory, is to ensure that it is this weak candidate, rather than a stronger rival, who survives to challenge one&#x27;s preferred candidate in the second round. But in practice, such a tactic may prove counter-productive. If so many voters give their first preferences to the &quot;weak&quot; candidate that it ends up &quot;winning&quot; the first round, it is highly likely they will gain enough campaign momentum to have a strong chance of winning the runoff, too, and with it, the election. At the very least, their opponent would have to start taking the so-called weak candidate seriously, particularly if the runoff follows quickly after the first round.

Runoff voting can be influenced by strategic nomination; this is where candidates and political factions influence the result of an election by either nominating extra candidates or withdrawing a candidate who would otherwise have stood. Runoff voting is vulnerable to strategic nomination for the same reasons that it is open to the voting tactic of compromising. This is because a candidate who knows they are unlikely to win can ensure that another candidate they support makes it to the second round by withdrawing from the race before the first round occurs, or by never choosing to stand in the first place. By withdrawing candidates a political faction can avoid the spoiler effect, whereby a candidate &quot;splits the vote&quot; of its supporters. A famous example of this spoiler effect occurred in the 2002 French presidential election, when so many left-wing candidates stood in the first round that all of them were eliminated and two right-wing candidates advanced to the second round. Conversely, an important faction may have an interest in helping fund the campaign of smaller factions with a very different political agenda, so that these smaller parties end up weakening their own agenda.

The intention of runoff voting is that the winning candidate will have the support of an absolute majority of voters. Under the first past the post method the candidate with most votes (a plurality) wins, even if they do not have an absolute majority (more than half) of votes. The two-round system tries to overcome this problem by permitting only two candidates in the second round, so that one must receive an absolute majority of votes.

Critics argue that the absolute majority obtained by the winner of runoff voting is an artificial one. Instant-runoff voting and the exhaustive ballot are two other voting methods that create an absolute majority for one candidate by eliminating weaker candidates over multiple rounds. However, in cases where there are three or more strong candidates, runoff voting will sometimes produce an absolute majority for a different winner than the candidate elected by the other two.

Advocates of Condorcet methods argue that a candidate can claim to have majority support only if they are the &quot;Condorcet winner&quot; – that is, the candidate who would beat every other candidate in a series of one-on-one elections. In runoff voting the winning candidate is only matched, one-on-one, with one of the other candidates. When a Condorcet winner exists, the candidate does not necessarily win a runoff election due to insufficient support in the first round.

Runoff advocates counter that voters&#x27; first preference is more important than lower preferences because that is where voters are putting the most effort of decision and that, unlike Condorcet methods, runoffs require a high showing among the full field of choices in addition to a strong showing in the final head-to-head competition. Condorcet methods can allow candidates to win who have minimal first-choice support and can win largely on the compromise appeal of being ranked second or third by more voters.

==Impact on factions and candidates==

Runoff voting encourages candidates to appeal to a broad cross-section of voters. This is because, in order to win an absolute majority in the second round, it is necessary for a candidate to win the support of voters whose favorite candidate has been eliminated. Under runoff voting, between rounds of voting, eliminated candidates, and the factions who previously supported them, often issue recommendations to their supporters as to whom to vote for in the second round of the contest. This means that eliminated candidates are still able to influence the result of the election. This influence leads to political bargaining between the two remaining candidates and the parties and candidates who have been eliminated, sometimes resulting in the two successful candidates making policy concessions to the less successful ones. Because it encourages conciliation and negotiation in these ways, runoff voting is advocated, in various forms, by some supporters of deliberative democracy.

Runoff voting is designed for single-seat constituencies. Therefore, like other single-seat methods, if used to elect a council or legislature it will not produce proportional representation (PR). This means that it is likely to lead to the representation of a small number of larger parties in an assembly, rather than a proliferation of small parties. In practice, runoff voting produces results very similar to those produced by the plurality method, and encourages a two-party system similar to those found in many countries that use plurality. Under a parliamentary system, it is more likely to produce single-party governments than are PR methods, which tend to produce coalition governments. While runoff voting is designed to ensure that each individual candidate elected is supported by a majority of those in their constituency, if used to elect an assembly it does not ensure this result on a national level. As in other non-PR methods, the party or coalition which wins a majority of seats will often not have the support of an absolute majority of voters across the nation.

=== Polling ===
In Australian politics, the two-party-preferred vote (TPP or 2PP) is the result of the final round of an election or opinion poll after preferences have been distributed to the highest two candidates, who in some cases can be independents. For the purposes of TPP, the Liberal/National Coalition is usually considered a single party, with Labor being the other major party. Typically the TPP is expressed as the percentages of votes attracted by each of the two major parties, e.g. &quot;Coalition 45%, Labor 55%&quot;, where the values include both primary votes and preferences. The TPP is an indicator of how much swing has been attained/is required to change the result, taking into consideration later preferences.

==Practical implications==
In smaller elections, such as those in assemblies or private organizations, it is sometimes possible to conduct both rounds in quick succession. More commonly, however, large-scale public elections the two rounds of runoff voting are held on separate days, and so involve voters going to the polls twice and governments conducting two elections. As a result, one of the most common criticisms against the two-round system is that the cost and difficulty of casting a ballot is effectively doubled. However, the system may sometimes still be cheaper than holding a ranked-choice runoff (RCV), as the counting of votes in each round is simple. By contrast, ranked-choice runoff voting involves a longer and more complex count that often requires a centralized count, as it is impossible to tally or audit RCV results locally.

The two-round voting system also has the potential to cause political instability between the two rounds of voting.

== Usage ==
The two-round system is the most common way used to elect heads of state (presidents) of countries worldwide, a total of 87 countries elect their heads of state directly with a two-round system as opposed to only 22 countries that used single-round plurality (first-past-the-post).

===Other examples of use===
Two-round voting is used in French departmental elections. In Italy, it is used to elect mayors, but also to decide which party or coalition receives a majority bonus in city councils.

Historically it was used to elect the Reichstag in the German Empire between 1871 and 1918 and the Storting of Norway from 1905 to 1919, in New Zealand in the 1908 and 1911 elections, and in Israel to elect the Prime Minister in the 1996, 1999 and 2001 elections.

<text>Rio de Janeiro (), or simply Rio, is the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is the second-most-populous city in Brazil (after São Paulo) and the sixth-most-populous city in the Americas.

Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. In 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court moved to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal. She subsequently, under the leadership of her son the prince regent John VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio remained as the capital of the pluricontinental monarchy until 1822, when the Brazilian War of Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonizing country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília.

Rio de Janeiro has the second largest municipal GDP in the country, and 30th-largest in the world in 2008. This is estimated at R$343 billion. In the city are the headquarters of Brazilian oil, mining, and telecommunications companies, including two of the country&#x27;s major corporations, Petrobras and Vale, and Latin America&#x27;s largest telemedia conglomerate, Grupo Globo. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second-largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17 percent of national scientific output according to 2005 data. Despite the high perception of crime, the city actually has a lower incidence of crime than most state capitals in Brazil.

Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its natural settings, carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches such as Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon. In addition to the beaches, landmarks include the giant statue of &quot;Christ the Redeemer&quot; atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World; Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the &quot;Sambódromo&quot; (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world&#x27;s largest football stadiums. Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to ever host the events, and the third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city. The Maracanã Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games. The city hosted the G20 summit in 2024, and will host the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup in 2027.

==History==


=== Pre-Cabraline period ===

The region of Rio was inhabited by the Tupi, Puri, Botocudo and Maxakalí peoples.

=== Colonial period ===

Europeans first encountered Guanabara Bay on 1 January 1502 (hence Rio de Janeiro, &quot;January River&quot;), during a Portuguese expedition under explorer Gaspar de Lemos, captain of a ship in Pedro Álvares Cabral&#x27;s fleet, or under Gonçalo Coelho. Allegedly the Florentine explorer Amerigo Vespucci participated as an observer at the invitation of King Manuel I in the same expedition.

In 1555, one of the islands of Guanabara Bay, now called Villegagnon Island, was occupied by 500 French colonists under the French admiral Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon. Consequently, Villegagnon built Fort Coligny on the island when attempting to establish the France Antarctique colony. Eventually this French settlement became too much of a threat to the established Portuguese colony and in 1560 the order was made to get rid of them. A years-long military aggression was then initiated by the new Governor General of Brazil Mem De Sa, and later continued by his nephew Estacio De Sa. On 20 January 1567, a final defeat was imposed on the French forces and they were decisively expelled from Brazil for good.

The city of Rio de Janeiro proper was founded on 1 March 1565 by the Portuguese, led by Estácio de Sá, including . It was named &quot;São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro&quot;, in honour of St. Sebastian, the saint who was the namesake and patron of the Portuguese then-monarch Sebastião. &quot;Rio de Janeiro&quot; was the name of Guanabara Bay. Until early in the 18th century, the city was threatened or invaded by several mostly French pirates and buccaneers, such as Jean-François Duclerc and René Duguay-Trouin.

In the late 17th century, still during the Sugar Era, the Bandeirantes discovered gold and diamonds in the neighboring captaincy of Minas Gerais, thus Rio de Janeiro became a much more practical port for exporting wealth (gold, precious stones, besides the sugar) than Salvador, Bahia, much farther northeast. On 27 January 1763, the colonial administration in Portuguese America was moved from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. The city remained primarily a colonial capital until 1808, when the Portuguese royal family and most of the associated Lisbon nobles, fleeing from Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Portugal, moved to Rio de Janeiro.

===Portuguese royal period===
The kingdom&#x27;s capital was transferred to the city, which, thus, became the only European capital outside of Europe. As there was no physical space or urban structure to accommodate hundreds of noblemen who arrived suddenly, many inhabitants were simply evicted from their homes. In the first decade, several educational establishments were created, such as the Military Academy, the Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts and the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, as well as the National Library of Brazil – with the largest collection in Latin America – and The Botanical Garden. The first printed newspaper in Brazil, the , came into circulation during this period. When Brazil was elevated to Kingdom in 1815, it became the capital of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves until the return of the Portuguese Royal Family to Lisbon in 1821, but remained as capital of the Kingdom of Brazil.

From the colonial period until the first independent era, Rio de Janeiro was a city of slaves. There was a large influx of African slaves to Rio de Janeiro: in 1819, there were 145,000 slaves in the captaincy. In 1840, the number of slaves reached 220,000 people. Between 1811 and 1831, 500,000 to a million slaves arrived in Rio de Janeiro through Valongo Wharf, which is now a World Heritage Site. The Port of Rio de Janeiro was the largest port of slaves in America.

=== Imperial period ===
When Prince Pedro proclaimed the independence of Brazil in 1822, he decided to keep Rio de Janeiro as the capital of his new empire while the place was enriched with sugar cane agriculture in the Campos region and, especially, with the new coffee cultivation in the Paraíba Valley. In order to separate the province from the capital of the Empire, the city was converted in Neutral Municipality in 1834, passing the province of Rio de Janeiro to have Niterói as capital.

As a political center of the country, Rio concentrated the political-partisan life of the Empire. It was the main stage of the abolitionist and republican movements in the last half of the 19th century. At that time the number of slaves was drastically reduced and the city was developed, with modern drains, animal trams, train stations crossing the city, gas and electric lighting, telephone and telegraph wiring, water and river plumbing. Rio continued as the capital of Brazil after 1889, when the monarchy was replaced by a republic.

On 6 February 1889 the Bangu Textile Factory was founded, with the name of Industrial Progress Company of Brazil (Companhia Progresso Industrial do Brasil). The factory was officially opened on 8 March 1893, in a complex with varying architectural styles like Italianate, Neo-Gothic and a tower in Mansard Roof style. After the opening in 1893, workers from Great Britain arrived in Bangu to work in the textile factory. The old farms became worker villages with red-bricks houses, and a neo-gothic church was created, which still exists as the Saint Sebastian and Saint Cecilia Parish Church. Street cinemas and cultural buildings also appeared. In May 1894, Thomas Donohoe, a British worker from Busby, Scotland, arrived in Bangu.

Donohoe was amazed to discover that there was absolutely no knowledge of football among Brazilians. So he wrote to his wife, Elizabeth, asking her to bring a football when she joined him. And shortly after her arrival, in September 1894, the first football match in Brazil took place in the field beside the textile factory. It was a five-a-side match between British workers, and took place six months before the first game organized by Charles Miller in São Paulo. However, the Bangu Football Club was not formally created until 1904.

===Republican period===
At the time Brazil&#x27;s Old Republic was established, the city lacked urban planning and sanitation, which helped spread several diseases, such as yellow fever, dysentery, variola, tuberculosis and even black death. Pereira Passos, who was named mayor in 1902, imposed reforms to modernize the city, demolishing the cortiços where most of the poor population lived. These people then moved to live in the city&#x27;s hills, creating the first favelas. Inspired by the city of Paris, Passos built the Municipal Theatre, the National Museum of Fine Arts and the National Library in the city&#x27;s center; brought electric power to Rio and created larger avenues to adapt the city to automobiles. Passos also named Oswaldo Cruz as Director General of Public Health. Cruz&#x27;s plans to clean the city of diseases included compulsory vaccination of the entire population and forced entry into houses to kill mosquitoes and rats. The people of the city rebelled against Cruz&#x27;s policy, in what would be known as the Vaccine Revolt.
In 1910, Rio saw the Revolt of the Lash, where Afro-Brazilian crew members in the Brazilian Navy mutinied against the heavy use of corporal punishment, which was similar to the punishment slaves received. The mutineers took control of the battleship &quot;Minas Geraes&quot; and threatened to fire on the city. Another military revolt occurred in 1922, the Copacabana Fort revolt, a march against the Old Republic&#x27;s coronelism and café com leite politics. This revolt marked the beginning of Tenentism, a movement that resulted in the Brazilian Revolution of 1930 that started the Vargas Era.

Until the early years of the 20th century, the city was largely limited to the neighborhood now known as the historic city center (see below), on the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The city&#x27;s center of gravity began to shift south and west to the so-called Zona Sul (South Zone) in the early part of the 20th century, when the first tunnel was built under the mountains between Botafogo and the neighborhood that is now known as Copacabana. Expansion of the city to the north and south was facilitated by the consolidation and electrification of Rio&#x27;s streetcar transit system after 1905. Botafogos natural environment, combined with the fame of the Copacabana Palace Hotel, &quot;the&quot; luxury hotel of the Americas in the 1930s, helped Rio to gain the reputation it still holds today as a beach party town. This reputation has been somewhat tarnished in recent years by favela violence resulting from the narcotics trade and militias.
Plans for moving the nation&#x27;s capital city from Rio de Janeiro to the center of Brazil had been occasionally discussed, and when Juscelino Kubitschek was elected president in 1955, it was partially on the strength of promises to build a new capital. Though many thought that it was just campaign rhetoric, Kubitschek managed to have Brasília and a new Federal District built, at great cost, by 1960. On 21 April of that year, the capital of Brazil was officially moved to Brasília. The territory of the former Federal District became its own state, Guanabara, after the bay that borders it to the east, encompassing just the city of Rio de Janeiro. After the 1964 coup d&#x27;état that installed a military dictatorship, the city-state was the only state left in Brazil to oppose the military. Then, in 1975, a presidential decree known as &quot;The Fusion&quot; removed the city&#x27;s federative status and merged it with the State of Rio de Janeiro, with the city of Rio de Janeiro replacing Niterói as the state&#x27;s capital, and establishing the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region.

In 1992, Rio hosted the Earth Summit, a United Nations conference to fight environmental degradation. Twenty years later, in 2012, the city hosted another conference on sustainable development, named United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development. The city hosted the World Youth Day in 2013, the second World Youth Day in South America and first in Brazil. In the sports field, Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2007 Pan American Games and the 2014 FIFA World Cup Final. On 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee announced that Rio de Janeiro would host the 2016 Olympic Games and the 2016 Paralympic Games, beating competitors Chicago, Tokyo, and Madrid. The city became the first South American city to host the event and the second Latin American city (after Mexico City in 1968) to host the Games. Since the early 2010s, Rio de Janeiro has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its arts, urban culture and designed landscapes set around a natural environment.

==Geography==

Rio de Janeiro is near the west end of a strip (from Cabo Frio to just east of Ilha Grande) of Brazil&#x27;s Atlantic coast close to the Tropic of Capricorn where the shoreline is oriented east and west; the city thus faces largely south. It was founded at the entrance to an inlet, Guanabara Bay (Baía de Guanabara), which is marked by a point of land called Sugar Loaf (Pão de Açúcar) – a &quot;calling card&quot; of the city.

The population of the city of Rio de Janeiro, occupying an area of , is about 6,000,000. The population of the greater metropolitan area is estimated at 11–13.5 million. Residents of the city are known as &quot;cariocas&quot;. The official song of Rio is &quot;Cidade Maravilhosa&quot;, by composer André Filho.

===Parks===

The city has parks and ecological reserves such as the Tijuca National Park, the world&#x27;s first urban forest and UNESCO Environmental Heritage and Biosphere Reserve; Pedra Branca State Park, which houses the highest point of Rio de Janeiro, the peak of Pedra Branca; the Quinta da Boa Vista complex; the Botanical Garden; Rio&#x27;s Zoo; Parque Lage; and the Passeio Público, the first public park in the Americas. In addition the Flamengo Park is the largest landfill in the city, extending from the center to the south zone, and containing museums and monuments, in addition to much vegetation.

Since 1961, the Tijuca National Park (Parque Nacional da Tijuca), the largest city-surrounded urban forest and the second largest urban forest in the world, has been a National Park. The largest urban forest in the world is the Floresta da Pedra Branca (White Rock Forest), which is located in the West Zone of Rio de Janeiro.

===Environment===
Due to the high concentration of industries in the metropolitan region, the city has faced serious problems of environmental pollution. The Guanabara Bay has lost mangrove areas and suffers from residues from domestic and industrial sewage, oils and heavy metals. Although its waters renew when they reach the sea, the bay is the final receiver of all the tributaries generated along its banks and in the basins of the many rivers and streams that flow into it. The levels of particulate matter in the air are twice as high as that recommended by the World Health Organization, in part because of the large numbers of vehicles in circulation.

The waters of Sepetiba Bay are slowly following the path traced by Guanabara Bay, with sewage generated by a population of the order of 1.29 million inhabitants being released without treatment in streams or rivers. With regard to industrial pollution, highly toxic wastes, with high concentrations of heavy metals – mainly zinc and cadmium – have been dumped over the years by factories in the industrial districts of Santa Cruz, Itaguaí and Nova Iguaçu, constructed under the supervision of State policies.

The Marapendi lagoon and the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon have suffered with the leniency of the authorities and the growth in the number of apartment buildings close by. The illegal discharge of sewage and the consequent deaths of algae diminished the oxygenation of the waters, causing fish mortality.

There are, on the other hand, signs of decontamination in the lagoon made through a public-private partnership established in 2008 to ensure that the lagoon waters will eventually be suitable for bathing. The decontamination actions involve the transfer of sludge to large craters present in the lagoon itself, and the creation of a new direct and underground connection with the sea, which will contribute to increase the daily water exchange between the two environments. However, during the Olympics the lagoon hosted the rowing competitions and there were numerous concerns about potential infection resulting from human sewage.

===Climate===

Rio has a tropical savanna climate (&quot;Aw&quot;) that closely borders a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification, and is often characterized by long periods of heavy rain between December and March. The city experiences hot, humid summers, and warm, sunny winters. In inland areas of the city, temperatures above are common during the summer, though rarely for long periods, while maximum temperatures above can occur on a monthly basis.

Along the coast, the breeze, blowing onshore and offshore, moderates the temperature. Because of its geographic situation, the city is often reached by cold fronts advancing from Antarctica, especially during autumn and winter, causing frequent weather changes. In summer there can be strong rains, which have, on some occasions, provoked catastrophic floods and landslides. The mountainous areas register greater rainfall since they constitute a barrier to the humid wind that comes from the Atlantic. The city has had rare frosts in the past. Some areas within Rio de Janeiro state occasionally have falls of snow grains and ice pellets (popularly called ) and hail.

Drought is very rare, albeit bound to happen occasionally given the city&#x27;s strongly seasonal tropical climate. The Brazilian drought of 2014–2015, most severe in the Southeast Region and the worst in decades, affected the entire metropolitan region&#x27;s water supply (a diversion from the Paraíba do Sul River to the Guandu River is a major source for the state&#x27;s most populous mesoregion). There were plans to divert the Paraíba do Sul to the Sistema Cantareira (Cantareira system) during the water crisis of 2014 in order to help the critically drought-stricken Greater São Paulo area. However, availability of sufficient rainfall to supply tap water to both metropolitan areas in the future is merely speculative.

Roughly in the same suburbs (Nova Iguaçu and surrounding areas, including parts of Campo Grande and Bangu) that correspond to the location of the March 2012, February–March 2013 and January 2015 pseudo-hail (&quot;granizo&quot;) falls, there was a tornado-like phenomenon in January 2011, for the first time in the region&#x27;s recorded history, causing structural damage and long-lasting blackouts, but no fatalities. The World Meteorological Organization has advised that Brazil, especially its southeastern region, must be prepared for increasingly severe weather occurrences in the near future, since events such as the catastrophic January 2011 Rio de Janeiro floods and mudslides are not an isolated phenomenon. In early May 2013, winds registering above caused blackouts in 15 neighborhoods of the city and three surrounding municipalities, and killed one person. Rio saw similarly high winds (about ) in January 2015.
Temperature also varies according to elevation, distance from the coast, and type of vegetation or land use. During the winter, cold fronts and dawn/morning sea breezes bring mild temperatures; cold fronts, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (in the form of winds from the Amazon Forest), the strongest sea-borne winds (often from an extratropical cyclone) and summer evapotranspiration bring showers or storms. Thus the monsoon-like climate has dry and mild winters and springs, and very wet and warm summers and autumns. As a result, temperatures over , that may happen about year-round but are much more common during the summer, often mean the actual &quot;feels-like&quot; temperature is over , when there is little wind and the relative humidity percentage is high.

According to data from the Brazilian National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), since 1931, the absolute minimum temperature recorded in Rio de Janeiro was 6.4 °C on August 18, 1933, at the meteorological station in the Bangu neighborhood (deactivated in March 2004). This same station, located in the city&#x27;s hottest neighborhood, recorded a maximum temperature of 43.1 °C on January 14, 1984, which held the record for the highest temperature in the city until December 26, 2012, when 43.2 °C was recorded at the Santa Cruz station. The record for rainfall within 24 hours is 349.4 mm, recorded on February 26, 1971, at the former station in the Engenho de Dentro neighborhood.



==Demographics==
According to the 2010 IBGE Census, there were 5,940,224 people residing in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Since 1960, when it was surpassed by São Paulo, the city of Rio de Janeiro has been the second-most populous city in Brazil.

=== Ethnic groups ===

The 2022 census revealed the following numbers: White Brazilian (45.4% or 2,821,619); Mixed (38.7% or 2,403,895); Black (15.6% or 968,428); Asian (10,514 or 0.2%); Indigenous (6,531 or 0.1%). The population of Rio de Janeiro was 53.2% female and 46.8% male.

The black community was formed by residents whose ancestors had been brought as slaves, mostly from Angola and Mozambique, as well by people of Angolan, Mozambican and West African descent who moved to Rio from other parts of Brazil. Nearly half of the city&#x27;s population is by phenotype mixed or black. White in Brazil is defined more by having a European-looking phenotype rather than ancestry, and two full siblings can be of different &quot;racial&quot; categories in a skin color and phenotype continuum from &quot;pálido&quot; (&quot;branco&quot;) or fair-skinned, through &quot;branco &quot; or swarthy Caucasian, &quot;mestiço claro&quot; or lighter skinned multiracial, &quot;pardo&quot; (mixed race) to &quot;negro&quot; or black. Pardo, for example, in popular usage includes those who are &quot;caboclos&quot; (mestizos), &quot;mulatos&quot; (mulattoes), &quot;cafuzos&quot; (zambos), &quot;juçaras&quot; (archaic term for tri-racials) and westernized Amerindians (which are called &quot;caboclos&quot; as well), being more of a skin color rather than a racial group in particular.

===Immigration and migration===

Different ethnic groups contributed to the formation of the population of Rio de Janeiro. Before European colonization, there were at least seven different indigenous peoples speaking 20 languages in the region. A part of them joined the Portuguese and the other the French. Those who joined the French were then exterminated by the Portuguese, while the other part was assimilated.

Rio de Janeiro is home to the largest Portuguese population outside of Lisbon in Portugal. After independence from Portugal, Rio de Janeiro became a destination for hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Portugal, mainly in the early 20th century. The immigrants were mostly poor peasants who subsequently found prosperity in Rio as city workers and small traders.
The Portuguese cultural influence is still seen in many parts of the city (and many other parts of the state of Rio de Janeiro), including architecture and language. Most Brazilians with some cultural contact with Rio know how to easily differentiate between the local dialect, &quot;Carioca &quot;, and other Brazilian dialects. People of Portuguese ancestry predominate in most of the state. The Brazilian census of 1920 showed that 39.7% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil lived in Rio de Janeiro. Including all of the Rio de Janeiro, the proportion raised to 46.3% of the Portuguese who lived in Brazil. The numerical presence of the Portuguese was extremely high, accounting for 72% of the foreigners who lived in the capital. Portuguese born people accounted for 20.4% of the population of Rio, and those with a Portuguese father or a Portuguese mother accounted for 30.8%. In other words, native born Portuguese and their children accounted for 51.2% of the inhabitants of Rio, or a total of 267,664 people in 1890.
As a result of the influx of immigrants to Brazil from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also found in Rio de Janeiro and its metropolitan area are communities of Levantine Arabs who are mostly Christian or Irreligious, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Japanese, 
According to an autosomal DNA study from 2009, conducted on a school in the poor suburb of Rio de Janeiro, the &quot;pardos&quot; there were found to be on average about 80% European, and the &quot;whites&quot; (who thought of themselves as &quot;very mixed&quot;) were found to carry very little Amerindian and/or African admixtures. The results of the tests of genomic ancestry are quite different from the self made estimates of European ancestry. In general, the test results showed that European ancestry is far more important than the students thought it would be. The &quot;pardos&quot; for example thought of themselves as European, African and Amerindian before the tests, and yet their ancestry on average reached 80% European. Other studies showed similar results

===Religion===
Religion in Rio de Janeiro is diverse, with Catholic Christianity being the majority religion. According to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2010 the population of Rio de Janeiro had 3,229,192 Roman Catholics (51.1%), 1,477,021 Protestants (23.4%), 372.851 Spiritists (5.9%), 37,974 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (0.6%), 75,075 Buddhists (0.2%), 52,213 Umbanda (0.8%), 21,800 Jews (0.3%), 25,743 Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church (0.4%), 16,776 new eastern religious (0.2%), 28,843 Candomblé (0.4%), 3,853 Mormons (&lt;0.1%), 5,751 Eastern Orthodox Christians (&lt;0.1%), 7,394 spiritualists (0.1%), 964 Muslims (&lt;0.1%), 5,662 esoteric (&lt;0.1%) and 802 Hindus (&lt;0.1%). 858,704 had no religion (13.5%), and 113,530 followed other forms of Christianity (1.8%).
Rio de Janeiro has had a rich and influential Catholic tradition. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro is the second largest archdiocese in Brazil after São Paulo. The Rio de Janeiro Cathedral was inaugurated in 1979, in the central region of the city. Its installations have a collection of great historical and religious value: the Archdiocesan Museum of Sacred Art and the Archdiocesan Archive. In a Contemporary architecture, it has a conical shape, with 96 meters of internal diameter and capacity to receive up to 20 thousand faithful. The splendor of the building, with straight and sober lines, is due to the changing stained glass windows carved on the walls up to the dome. Its design and execution was coordinated by Monsignor Ivo Antônio Calliari (1918–2005). Saint Sebastian is recognized as the city&#x27;s patron saint, which is why it received the canonical name of &quot;Saint Sebastian of Rio de Janeiro.&quot;

Many Protestant creeds coexist in the city, Presbyterian, Congregational, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. In addition to evangelical churches such as the Baptist, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist and Pentecostal churches, such as the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assembly of God, Christian Congregation in Brazil and The Foursquare Church.

Afro-Brazilian religions such as Umbanda and Candomblé find support in various social segments, although professed by less than 2% of the population, many Cariocas simultaneously observe those practices with Roman Catholicism.
==== Christianity ====
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro, the Metropolitan See of its respective Ecclesiastical Province, belongs to the Regional Episcopal Council Leste I of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB) (headquartered in Rio until 1977). Founded in 1676, it covers a territory of 1,721 km2.

The &quot;Cathedral of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro&quot;, or &quot;Metropolitan Cathedral&quot;, was inaugurated in 1979 in the central region of the city. Its facilities house a collection of great historical and religious value: the Archdiocesan Museum of Sacred Art and the Archdiocesan Archive. The Banco da Providência and the Archdiocesan Caritas are also based there. In a contemporary architectural style, it has a conical shape, with an internal diameter of 96 meters and a capacity to hold up to 20,000 worshippers. The splendor of the building, with its straight and sober lines, is due to the changing stained glass windows carved into the walls up to the dome. Its design and execution were coordinated by Monsignor Ivo Antônio Calliari (1918–2005). Saint Sebastian is recognized as the patron saint of the city, which is why it received the canonical name &quot;São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro&quot;.

The city is home to various Protestant or reformed denominations, exemplified by the Presbyterian, Congregational, Lutheran and Anglican churches. There are also evangelical churches such as the Baptist, Methodist, Seventh-day Adventist churches, and those of Pentecostal origin: Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, Assembly of God, Christian Congregation in Brazil, Foursquare Gospel, House of Blessing, God is Love Pentecostal Church, Christian Maranatha, and New Life.

===Education===

The Portuguese language is the official and national language, and thus the primary language taught in schools. English and Spanish are also part of the official curriculum. There are also international schools, such as the American School of Rio de Janeiro, Our Lady of Mercy School, SIS Swiss International School, the Corcovado German School, the Lycée Français and the British School of Rio de Janeiro.

The city has several universities and research institutes. The Ministry of Education has certified approximately 99 upper-learning institutions in Rio. The most prestigious university is the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. It is the fifth-best in Latin America; the second-best in Brazil, second only to the University of São Paulo; and the best in Latin America, according to the QS World University Rankings.

Some notable higher education institutions are Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ); Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO); Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ); Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ, often nicknamed &quot;Rural&quot;); Fluminense Federal University (UFF); Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio); Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV); Military Institute of Engineering (IME); Superior Institute of Technology in Computer Science of Rio de Janeiro (IST-Rio); College of Publicity and Marketing (ESPM); The Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF); National Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA); Superior institute of Education of Rio de Janeiro (ISERJ) and Federal Center of Technological Education Celso Suckow da Fonseca (CEFET/RJ). There are more than 137 upper-learning institutions in whole Rio de Janeiro state.
The Rio de Janeiro State University (public), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (public), Brazilian Institute of Capital Markets (private) and Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (private) are among the country&#x27;s top institutions of higher education. Other institutes of higher learning include the Colégio Regina Coeli in Usina, notable for having its own narrow-gauge funicular railway on its grounds.

Primary schools are largely under municipal administration, while the state plays a more significant role in the extensive network of secondary schools. There are also a small number of schools under federal administration, as is the case of Pedro II School, Colégio de Aplicação da UFRJ and the Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica of Rio de Janeiro (CEFET-RJ). In addition, Rio has an ample offering of private schools that provide education at all levels. Rio is home to many colleges and universities. The literacy rate for cariocas aged 10 and older is nearly 95 percent, well above the national average. In Rio, there were 1,033 primary schools with 25,594 teachers and 667,788 students in 1995. There are 370 secondary schools with 9,699 teachers and 227,892 students. There are 53 University-preparatory schools with 14,864 teachers and 154,447 students. The city has six major universities and 47 private schools of higher learning.

===Social issues===

There are significant disparities between the rich and the poor in Rio de Janeiro, and different socioeconomic groups are largely segregated into different neighborhoods. Although the city clearly ranks among the world&#x27;s major metropolises, large numbers live in slums known as favelas, where 95% of the population are poor, compared to 40% in the general population.

There have been a number of government initiatives to counter this problem, from the removal of the population from favelas to housing projects such as Cidade de Deus to the more recent approach of improving conditions in the favelas and bringing them up to par with the rest of the city, as was the focus of the &quot;Favela Bairro&quot; program and deployment of Pacifying Police Units.

Rio has more people living in slums than any other city in Brazil, according to the 2010 Census. More than 1,500,000 people live in its 763 favelas, 22% of Rio&#x27;s total population. São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil, has more favelas (1,020), but proportionally has fewer people living in favelas than Rio.

Rio also has a large proportion of state-sanctioned violence, with about 20% of all killings committed by state security. In 2019, police killed an average of five people each day in the state of Rio de Janeiro, with a total of 1,810 killed in the year. This was more police killings than any year since official records started in 1998.

== Politics ==

=== Municipal government ===
In Rio de Janeiro, the executive power is represented by the mayor and the cabinet of secretaries, in accordance with the model proposed by the Federal Constitution. The Organic Law of the Municipality and the current Master Plan, however, stipulate that the public administration must provide the population with effective tools for the exercise of participatory democracy. In this way, the city is divided into subprefectures, each of which is headed by a sub-mandatory appointed directly by the mayor.

Legislative power is constituted by the municipal council, composed of 51 councilors elected for four-year terms (in compliance with the provisions of article 29 of the Constitution, which disciplines a minimum number of 42 and a maximum of 55 for municipalities with more than five million inhabitants). It is up to the House to prepare and vote on fundamental laws for the administration and the Executive, especially the participatory budget (Lei de Diretrizes Orçamentárias). Although the veto power is granted to the mayor, the process of voting on the laws that oppose him usually generates conflicts between the Executive and the Legislative.

There are also municipal councils, which complement the legislative process and the work engendered in the secretariats. Compulsorily formed by representatives of various sectors of organized civil society, they are on different fronts — although their effective representation is sometimes questioned. The following are currently in operation: Municipal Council for the Protection of Cultural Heritage (CMPC), Defense of the Environment (CONDEMAM), Health (CMS), the Rights of Children and Adolescents (CMDCA), Education (CME), Social Assistance (CMAS) and Anti-Drugs.

=== State government ===
As the capital of the homonymous state, the city is the seat of the state government. The Guanabara Palace (formerly known as Paço Isabel) is located in the Laranjeiras neighborhood, in the south zone, and is the official seat of the Rio de Janeiro executive power. Not to be confused with Palácio Laranjeiras, situated in the same neighborhood, which is the official residence of the governor of Rio de Janeiro.

The Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro (ALERJ) is the state legislative body and is headquartered at Tiradentes Palace, where the Chamber of Deputies of Brazil previously functioned.

The Court of Justice of the State of Rio de Janeiro (TJRJ) is the highest body of the judiciary in the state. Its central court is located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, but, from 2013 to July 2018, some of the courts of this court were moved to Cidade Nova.

=== Federal government ===
The city of Rio de Janeiro was successively the capital of the Portuguese colony of the State of Brazil (1621–1815), after the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (1815–1822), the Empire of Brazil (1822–1889) and from the Republic of the United States of Brazil (1889–1968) until 1960, when the seat of government was definitively transferred to the then newly built Brasília.

Despite the change in the federal capital, 59% of civil servants in the Executive Branch of federal agencies and public companies remained in the city. Rio de Janeiro is also the only Brazilian state where the number of federal employees exceeds the number of state employees. About a third of all federal public bodies and companies remain in the former capital, with 50 public offices, including agencies, autarchies, foundations and public companies, such as the National Library, the National Nuclear Energy Commission, Fiocruz, BNDES, Petrobras, Eletrobras, IBGE, Casa da Moeda, the National Archives, among others.

===Subdivisions===

The city is commonly divided into the historic center (Centro); the tourist-friendly wealthier South Zone (Zona Sul); the residential less wealthy North Zone (Zona Norte); peripheries in the West Zone (Zona Oeste), among them Santa Cruz, Campo Grande and the wealthy newer Barra da Tijuca district. Rio de Janeiro is administratively divided into 33 &quot;distritos&quot; (districts) named &quot;Regiões Administrativas&quot; (&quot;Administrative Regions&quot;) and 165 &quot;bairros&quot; (neighborhoods).

Subprefectures are officially grouped into four regions (or &quot;zones&quot;), taking into account geographic position and occupation history; however these do not have any administrative or political power over the municipality. The official political division of the municipality takes into account historical-cultural characteristics to divide the neighborhoods. Most of its population is concentrated in the neighborhoods of Campo Grande, Santa Cruz, Bangu, Tijuca, Realengo, Jacarepaguá, Copacabana, Barra da Tijuca, Maré, Guaratiba and Taquara together, these eleven neighborhoods concentrate a population of 1.5 million inhabitants, according to the 2010 census.

&quot;Centro&quot; or Downtown is the historic core of the city, as well as its financial center. Sites of interest include the Paço Imperial, built during colonial times to serve as a residence for the Portuguese governors of Brazil; many historic churches, such as the Candelária Church (the former cathedral), São Jose, Santa Lucia, Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Santa Rita, São Francisco de Paula, and the monasteries of Santo Antônio and São Bento. The Centro also houses the modern concrete Rio de Janeiro Cathedral. Around the Cinelândia square, there are several landmarks of the &quot;Belle Époque&quot; of Rio, such as the Municipal Theatre and the National Library building. Among its several museums, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes (National Museum of Fine Arts) and the Museu Histórico Nacional (National Historical Museum) are the most important. 

Within the Cultural Corridor, one of the districts with the highest level of architectural and historical preservation in Rio&#x27;s City Center is the Sociedade de Amigos das Adjacências da Rua da Alfândega (In English: Society of Friends of the Adjacencies of Alfândega Street.), the famous &quot;SAARA&quot;. It is an association formed by merchants who operate near Rua da Alfândega, in Historic Center of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The area is famous for housing stores specializing in popular home goods and fabrics, with several historic buildings.
The name comes from the occupation of the region by Muslim, Jewish and Maronite Christian immigrants from the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century, for commercial purposes. The region preserves examples of various architectural styles, from Portuguese colonial, through Neoclassical, Eclectic, Art Deco and Modernism, making the region a rich tapestry of historical architecture that refers to the city&#x27;s colonial and imperial past.


The South Zone () is composed of several districts, among which are São Conrado, Leblon, Ipanema, Arpoador, Copacabana, and Leme, which compose Rio&#x27;s Atlantic beach coastline. The neighborhood of Copacabana beach hosts one of the world&#x27;s most spectacular New Year&#x27;s Eve parties (&quot;Reveillon&quot;), as more than two million revelers crowd onto the sands to watch the fireworks display. From 2001, the fireworks have been launched from boats, to improve the safety of the event.

The North Zone () begins at Grande Tijuca (the middle class residential and commercial &quot;bairro&quot; of Tijuca), just west of the city center, and sprawls for miles inland until Baixada Fluminense and the city&#x27;s Northwest. This region is home to the Maracanã (located in Grande Tijuca), once the world&#x27;s highest capacity football venue, able to hold nearly 199,854 people, as it did for the World Cup final of 1950. This region is also home to most of the samba schools of Rio de Janeiro such as Mangueira, Salgueiro, Império Serrano, Unidos da Tijuca, Imperatriz Leopoldinense, among others. Some of the main neighborhoods of Rio&#x27;s North Zone are Alto da Boa Vista which shares the Tijuca Rainforest with the South and Southwest Zones; Tijuca, Vila Isabel, Méier, São Cristovão, Madureira, Penha, Manguinhos, Fundão, Olaria among others. Many of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s slums (&quot;favelas&quot;), are located in the North Zone.

West Zone (&quot;Zona Oeste&quot;) of Rio de Janeiro is a vaguely defined area that covers some 50% of the city&#x27;s entire area, including Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes neighborhoods. The West Side of Rio has many historic sites because of the old &quot;Royal Road of Santa Cruz&quot; that crossed the territory in the regions of Realengo, Bangu, and Campo Grande, finishing at the Royal Palace of Santa Cruz in the Santa Cruz region. The highest peak of the city of Rio de Janeiro is the Pedra Branca Peak (Pico da Pedra Branca) inside the Pedra Branca State Park. It has an altitude of 1024m. The Pedra Branca State Park (Parque Estadual da Pedra Branca) is the biggest urban state park in the world comprising 17 neighborhoods in the west side, being a &quot;giant lung&quot; in the city with trails, waterfalls and historic constructions like an old aqueduct in the Colônia Juliano Moreira in the neighborhood of Taquara and a dam in Camorim. Santa Cruz and Campo Grande Region have exhibited economic growth, mainly in the Campo Grande neighborhood. Industrial enterprises are being built in lower and lower middle class residential Santa Cruz, one of the largest and most populous of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s neighborhoods, most notably Ternium Brasil, a new steel mill with its own private docks on Sepetiba Bay, which is planned to be South America&#x27;s largest steel works. A tunnel called &quot;Túnel da Grota Funda&quot;, opened in 2012, creating a public transit facility between Barra da Tijuca and Santa Cruz, lessening travel time to the region from other areas of Rio de Janeiro.

==Economy==


Rio de Janeiro has the second-largest GDP of any city in Brazil, surpassed only by São Paulo. According to the IBGE, it was approximately US$201 billion in 2008, equivalent to 5.1% of the national total. Taking into consideration the network of influence exerted by the urban metropolis (which covers 11.3% of the population), this share in GDP rises to 14.4%, according to a study released in October 2008 by the IBGE.

Greater Rio de Janeiro, as perceived by the IBGE, has a GDP of US$187 billion, constituting the second largest hub of national wealth. Per capita GDP is US$11,786. It concentrates 68% of the state&#x27;s economic strength and 7.9% of all goods and services produced in the country. The services sector comprises the largest portion of GDP (65.5%), followed by commerce (23.4%), industrial activities (11.1%) and agriculture (0.1%).

Benefiting from the federal capital position it had for a long period (1763–1960), the city became a dynamic administrative, financial, commercial and cultural center. Rio de Janeiro became an attractive place for companies to locate when it was the capital of Brazil, as important sectors of society and of the government were present in the city. The city was chosen as headquarters for state-owned companies such as Petrobras, Eletrobras, Caixa Econômica Federal, National Economic and Social Development Bank and Vale (which was privatized in the 1990s). The Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange (BVRJ), which currently trades only government securities, was the first stock exchange founded in Brazil in 1845.

The off-shore oil exploration in the Campos Basin began in 1968 and became the main site for oil production of Brazil. This caused many oil and gas companies to be based in Rio de Janeiro, such as the Brazilian branches of Shell, EBX and Esso. For many years Rio was the second largest industrial hub of Brazil, with oil refineries, shipbuilding industries, steel, metallurgy, petrochemicals, cement, pharmaceutical, textile, processed foods and furniture industries.

Major international pharmaceutical companies have their Brazilian headquarters in Rio such as: Merck, Roche, Arrow, Darrow, Baxter, Mayne, and Mappel.

Recent decades have seen a sharp transformation in its economic profile, which is becoming more and more one of a major national hub of services and businesses. The city is the headquarters of large telecom companies, such as Intelig, Oi and Embratel. Major Brazilian entertainment and media organizations are based in Rio de Janeiro like Organizações Globo and also some of Brazil&#x27;s major newspapers: &quot;Jornal do Brasil&quot;, &quot;O Dia&quot;, and &quot;Business Rio&quot;.

Tourism and entertainment are other key aspects of the city&#x27;s economic life. The city is the nation&#x27;s top tourist attraction for both Brazilians and foreigners.

In Greater Rio, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in Brazil, retail trade is substantial. Many of the most important retail stores are located in the center, but others are scattered throughout the commercial areas of the other districts, where shopping centers, supermarkets, and other retail businesses handle a large volume of consumer trade.

Rio de Janeiro is () the second largest exporting municipality in Brazil. Annually, Rio exported a total of $7.49B (USD) worth of goods. The top three goods exported by the municipality were crude petroleum (40%), semi finished iron product (16%), and semi finished steel products (11%). Material categories of mineral products (42%) and metals (29%) make up 71% of all exports from Rio.

Compared to other cities, Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s economy is the second-largest in Brazil, behind São Paulo, and the 30th largest in the world with a GDP of R$ 201,9 billion in 2010. The per capita income for the city was R$22,903 in 2007 (around ). Largely because of the strength of Brazil&#x27;s currency at the time, Mercer&#x27;s city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees, reported that Rio de Janeiro ranked 12th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2011, up from the 29th position in 2010, just behind São Paulo (ranked 10th), and ahead of London, Paris, Milan, and New York. Rio also had the most expensive hotel rates in Brazil, and the daily rate of its five star hotels were the second most expensive in the world after only New York.
=== Highlighted Sectors ===

Rio de Janeiro is home to many of Brazil&#x27;s largest business conglomerates. Among them are the three largest multinationals in the energy and mining sectors: Petrobras, Vale S.A., and the EBX Group; the largest media and communications group in Latin America, Grupo Globo; and major telecommunications companies like CorpCo (owner of Oi and Portugal Telecom), TIM, Embratel, Intelig, and Star One (the largest satellite management company in Latin America).

In the petrochemical sector, there are more than 700 companies, including Brazil&#x27;s largest (Shell, Esso, Ipiranga, Chevron, PRIO, Repsol). Most maintain research centers throughout the state and together produce over four-fifths of the petroleum and fuels distributed at service stations nationwide. The Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN), Ternium Brasil (the largest steel mill in Latin America) and the Brazilian branch of BHP Billiton play significant roles in the mining sector. The city also hosts the main national and international groups of the shipbuilding industry and the largest shipyards in the state and throughout Brazil, which produce about 90% of the ships and offshore equipment in Brazil.

Americanas, Coca-Cola Brasil, Eletrobras, Michelin, Neoenergia, Xerox do Brasil, GE Oil &amp; Gas, Light, Chemtech, Transpetro, BAT Brasil, Grupo SulAmérica and Vibra Energia are among the major companies headquartered in the city. The city has a significant number of pharmaceutical industries, including Schering-Plough, GlaxoSmithKline, Roche, and Merck.

Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural vocation from its past. It currently hosts the main production centers of Brazilian television: the Estúdios Globo of TV Globo, the Casablanca Estúdios of Record, and the &quot;Polo de Cinema de Jacarepaguá&quot; — responsible for creating about 10,000 direct jobs and 30,000 indirect jobs. In 2006, 65% of Brazilian cinema production was done exclusively by studios in Rio, generating 91 million reais in federal funds through tax incentive laws. A significant part of the Brazilian editorial graphic industry is also present. In the phonographic industry, companies such as EMI, Universal Music, Sony Music, Warner Music and Som Livre are present.

Many state-owned companies, public foundations, and federal autarchies have their headquarters in the city, including the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), the Casa da Moeda do Brasil, the Indústrias Nucleares do Brasil (INB), the Financiadora de Estudos e Projetos (FINEP), the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE), the Instituto Nacional de Metrologia, Normalização e Qualidade Industrial (Inmetro), the Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI), the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM), and the Comissão Nacional de Energia Nuclear (CNEN).

===Tourism ===

Rio de Janeiro is Brazil&#x27;s primary tourist attraction and resort. It receives the most visitors per year of any city in South America with 2.82 million international tourists a year.

Attractions in the city include approximately 80 kilometers of beaches, Corcovado and Sugarloaf mountains, and the Maracanã Stadium. While the city had in past had a thriving tourism sector, the industry entered a decline in the last quarter of the 20th century. Annual international airport arrivals dropped from 621,000 to 378,000 and average hotel occupancy dropped to 50% between 1985 and 1993. The fact that Brasília replaced Rio de Janeiro as the Brazilian capital in 1960 and that São Paulo replaced Rio as the country&#x27;s commercial, financial and main cultural center during the mid-20th century, has also been cited as a leading cause of the decline.

Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s government has since undertaken to modernize the city&#x27;s economy, reduce its chronic social inequalities, and improve its commercial standing as part of an initiative for the regeneration of the tourism industry.

Rio de Janeiro is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight. The city is an important global LGBT destination, with 1 million LGBT tourists visiting each year.

The Farme de Amoedo Street &quot;Rua Farme de Amoedo&quot; is located in Ipanema, a neighborhood in the South Zone of the city. The street and the nearby beach are popular in the LGBT community.

As of 2025, the airport&#x27;s passenger capacity is capped by the federal government at 6.5 million per year. The airport is connected to the city&#x27;s light rail system, which connects it to several other transport modes in the city centre.
*Jacarepaguá-Roberto Marinho Airport: used by general aviation and home to the Aeroclube do Brasil (Brasil Flying club). It also has some short-haul commercial flights. The airport is located in the district of .

Military airports include:

*Afonsos Air Force Base: One of the historical Brazilian Air Force airbases. It is also the location of the University of the Air Force (Universidade da Força Aérea), the Museu Aeroespacial, and where air shows take place.

==== Ports ====
The Port of Rio de Janeiro is Brazil&#x27;s third busiest port in terms of cargo volume, and it is the main port for cruise vessels. Located on the west coast of the Guanabara Bay, it serves the States of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Espírito Santo. The port is managed by Companhia Docas do Rio de Janeiro. The Port of Rio de Janeiro covers territory from Mauá Pier in the east to Caju Wharf in the north. The Port of Rio de Janeiro contains almost of continuous wharf and an pier. The Companhia Docas do Rio de Janeiro directly administers the Gamboa Wharf general cargo terminal: the wheat terminal with two warehouses capable of moving 300 tons of grains; General Load Terminal 2 with warehouses covering over , and the São Cristóvão Wharves with terminals for wheat and liquid bulk.

At Gamboa Wharf, leaseholders operate terminals for sugar, paper, and iron and steel products. Leaseholders at Caju Wharf operate terminals for roll-on/roll-off cargoes, containers, and liquid bulk. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over seven million tons of cargo on almost 1700 vessels. In 2004, the Port of Rio de Janeiro handled over two million tons of containerized cargo in almost 171 thousand TEUs. The port handled 852 thousand tons of wheat, more than 1.8 million tons of iron and steel, over a million tons of liquid bulk cargo, almost 830 thousand tons of dry bulk, over five thousand tons of paper goods, and over 78 thousand vehicles. In 2003, over 91 thousand passengers moved through the Port of Rio Janeiro on 83 cruise vessels.

====Public transportation====
In Rio de Janeiro, buses are the main form of public transportation. There are nearly 440 municipal bus lines serving over four million passengers every day, in addition to intercity lines. Although cheap and frequent, Rio&#x27;s transportation policy has been moving towards trains and subway in order to reduce surface congestion and increase carrier capacity. Rio&#x27;s public transportation service has been a target of many critics and the motive of the 2013 protests and manifestations. According to the people, the raise in the bus and subway fares are invalid, seeing that the amount charged is too high for the low quality of the services.

In 2022, the average amount of time people spent commuting with public transit in Rio de Janeiro on a weekday was 67 minutes. 12% of public transit riders had commutes that took more than two hours per day. The average amount of time people waited at a stop or station for public transit was 21 minutes, with 12% of riders waiting less than 5 minutes and 41% of riders waiting for over 20 minutes. The average distance people usually traveled in a single trip with public transit was . The average distance people walked on their commute was . 11% of people made exactly two transfers during their commute, and 2% of commuters made 3 or more transfers.

=====Urban rail=====

Rio de Janeiro nominally has three metro lines, though two of them (Lines 1 and 4) are operationally run as a single line. The system runs on of track and has 41 stations. Line 1/4 runs from Uruguai/Tijuca station in Tijuca to Jardim Oceânico/Barra da Tijuca station in Barra da Tijuca; Line 2 runs from Pavuna station in Pavuna to Botafogo station in Botafogo. There is partial fare integration with other modes of transport when using the Bilhete Único Intermunicipal.

The city also has a suburban rail system operated by SuperVia that connects the city of Rio with other locations in Greater Rio de Janeiro. It has 8 lines on of track with 103 stations in 12 municipalities (Rio de Janeiro, Belford Roxo, Duque de Caxias, Guapimirim, Japeri, Magé, Mesquita, Nilópolis, Nova Iguaçu, Paracambi, Queimados and São João de Meriti.). It carries around 320,000 passengers per day.

The Rio de Janeiro Light Rail is a modern light rail system that runs on of track with 30 stations distributed along 4 lines. The trams are the first in the world to use a combination of ground-level power supply (APS) and on-board supercapacitor energy storage (SRS), in order to eliminate overhead lines along the entire route. The network uses 32 Alstom Citadis 402 low-floor trams carrying 420 passengers each. They are bi-directional, air-conditioned, have seven sections, and eight doors per side.

The Santa Teresa Tram is the oldest operating electric tramway in Latin America, commenced electric operation in 1896, replacing horse-drawn trams and extending the route. At this time the gauge was altered to . It was designated a national historic monument in 1985. After a derailment occurred on 27 August 2011, which left six dead, tram service was suspended to improve the system. The elderly tramcars, which dated from the 1950s, were retired and replaced with newly built replicas that have the appearance of the old fleet but with new mechanical equipment and additional safety features; delivery began in 2014. The line&#x27;s track was also rebuilt, and after some delays, about one-third of the line reopened in July 2015. More sections reopened later in stages, following repair of additional sections of track. The line was restored to its full pre-2011 length of in January 2019.

=====Ferry=====
The most geographically close sister city to Rio that is on the other side of Guanabara Bay is Niterói. Many people who live in Niterói, as well its neighboring municipalities São Gonçalo and Maricá, commute to Rio de Janeiro to study and work. There are several ferry services that operate between the Rio Centro (Praça XV) and Niterói (Centro and Charitas). There is a traditional boat as well as several &quot;fast cat&quot; hydrofoil boats. One of the city neighborhoods is Paquetá Island, which can only be accessed by ferryboats or hydrofoil boats. The ferryboat to Paquetá leaves every hour, from early in the morning until around midnight. There is also a ferry to Cocotá.

=====Buses=====

City buses, which come in both non-air conditioned and air conditioned versions, cost about R$4,30 to ride. The system may be relatively safe by day but less so at night. Integration of bus lines has been recently implemented, allowing users to take two non-air conditioned bus rides in two hours paying just one ticket. It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the &quot;&quot;Bilhete Único Carioca (BUC)&quot;) in order to benefit of this system.

Another type of local bus is called the &quot;Frescão&quot;&quot; (air-conditioned). These buses run several routes, the main being from Centro through Botafogo, Copacabana and Ipanema to Leblon (and vice versa), and from the International Airport to Barra, through the beach road. They are air conditioned – about – more upscale/comfortable and cost between R$13.35–R$19.95. However, it is only available during weekdays. The buses also run more frequently during the rush hours in the morning and evening. Going in the direction of Centro (city center), the bus can be flagged down on the beach road (buses with plaques showing &quot;Castelo&quot;).

====Road transport====

Driving in Rio de Janeiro, as in most large cities of Brazil, might not be the best choice because of the large car numbers. The city is served by a number of expressways, like Linha Vermelha, Linha Amarela, Avenida Brasil, Avenida das Américas and Avenida Infante Dom Henrique (Aterro do Flamengo); in spite of this, traffic jams are very common. Because of the organization of the 2016 Olympics the city is installing four BRT systems to link Barra da Tijuca with other major neighborhoods: TransOlimpica (between Barra and Deodoro); TransBrasil (over the Avenida Brasil expressway); TransCarioca (between Barra and the Galeão International Airport); and TransOeste (between Barra and Santa Cruz, over Avenida das Américas).

In Brazil, most interstate transportation is done by road. A large terminal for long-distance buses is in the Santo Cristo neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. There are also two port facilities for cargo and passenger ships (Rio de Janeiro and Sepetiba port). Rio has roads to all neighbor States. Some roads (like Via Dutra, to São Paulo, and a stretch of the BR-101 which covers the Rio-Niterói bridge) were chartered to private enterprises. The quality of the highways improved much, but was accompanied by a significant increase of the toll fees. From São Paulo: take the BR-116 (Presidente Dutra Federal Highway) or the BR-101 (Rio-Santos Federal Highway). From Belo Horizonte: BR-040. From Salvador: BR-101 or BR-324/BR-116/BR-393/BR-040.

====Bicycles====

The city has of cycle paths that, wherever they exist, are very much preferable to riding in the city&#x27;s traffic. Most paths run alongside beaches and extend intermittently from the Marina da Glória, Centro, through Flamengo, Copacabana and Ipanema, to Barra da Tijuca and Recreio dos Bandeirantes. of cycle paths traverse the Tijuca National Park.

The Bike Rio began operations in October 2011. This bicycle sharing system is sponsored by the municipal government of Rio de Janeiro in partnership with Banco Itaú. The bike sharing system has 600 bicycles available at 60 rental stations in 14 neighborhoods throughout the city.

===Water and sanitation===
 only 65% of sewage was properly treated, leaving 35% to be improperly discharged. there were at least 400 illicit sewage disposal points in the drainage network.

National policy changes in 2020–2021 for the universalization of sanitation kept the 2007 policy defining the municipality as the provider of sanitation service, delegating the organization, supervision, and provision of services to third parties. The (ANA) is responsible for the setting standards regulating basic public sanitation services. In 2021–2022, distribution and treatment of sewage of the Rio State (CEDAE) was divided into four blocks and auctioned to Aegea (Águas do Rio) and Iguá; CEDAE remained in control of water collection and treatment of drinking water. The Rio State (INEA) has primary responsibility for water pollution monitoring and enforcement.

==Culture ==

Rio de Janeiro is a main cultural hub in Brazil. Its architecture embraces churches and buildings dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries, blending with the world-renowned designs of the 20th century. Rio was home to the Portuguese Imperial family and capital of the country for many years, and was influenced by Portuguese, English, and French architecture.

Rio de Janeiro has inherited a strong cultural role from the past. In the late 19th century, there were sessions held of the first Brazilian film and since then, several production cycles have spread out, eventually placing Rio at the forefront of experimental and national cinema. The Rio de Janeiro International Film Festival has been held annually since 1999.

Rio currently brings together the main production centers of Brazilian television. Major international films set in Rio de Janeiro include &quot;Blame it on Rio&quot;; the James Bond film &quot;Moonraker&quot;; the Oscar award-winning, critically acclaimed &quot;Central Station&quot; by Walter Salles, who is also one of Brazil&#x27;s best-known directors; and the Oscar award-winning historical drama, &quot;Black Orpheus&quot;, which depicted the early days of Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. Internationally distributed Brazilian-made movies illustrating a darker side of Rio de Janeiro include &quot;Elite Squad&quot; and &quot;City of God&quot;.

Rio has many important cultural landmarks, such as the Biblioteca Nacional (National Library), one of the largest libraries in the world with collections totalling more than 9 million items; the Theatro Municipal; the National Museum of Fine Arts; the Carmen Miranda Museum; the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden; the Parque Lage; the Quinta da Boa Vista; the Imperial Square; the Brazilian Academy of Letters; the Museu de Arte Moderna do Rio de Janeiro; and the Natural History Museum.

===Architecture===
Rio de Janeiro’s architectural heritage is a vivid chronicle of its layered history—from its early colonial foundations through its imperial grandeur, its mid‑20th‑century modernist breakthroughs, to its current phase of dynamic urban renewal. This architectural panorama not only mirrors the cultural and historical shifts that have shaped the city but also its ongoing dialogue with nature, technology, and contemporary urban life.

1. Colonial and Imperial Foundations
During the colonial era, Rio’s buildings were characterized by the pragmatic yet elegant designs of Portuguese architecture. Early structures—such as churches, convents, and public buildings—employed robust masonry, simple forms, and decorative azulejos (ceramic tiles) that served both aesthetic and defensive functions. With the arrival of the Portuguese Royal Court in 1808, the city witnessed an explosion of opulent construction. Imperial residences and palaces, including the Paço Imperial and Catete Palace, were remodeled in neoclassical styles featuring grand porticos, ornate stucco work, imported marble, and expansive courtyards. These edifices were designed to convey the power and sophistication of the empire and remain emblematic of Rio’s imperial past.

2. Modernist Innovations 

The 20th century introduced a wave of Modernism that redefined Rio’s built environment. Visionary architects embraced the use of reinforced concrete, glass, and clean, geometric lines to create structures that were both functional and expressive. Landmarks such as the Theatro Municipal exemplify this era: its lavish interiors combine modern construction techniques with classical ornamentation, symbolizing a bridge between tradition and modernity. Similarly, institutions like the Museu de Arte Moderna (MAM) and public housing projects reflect a commitment to functional design that responds to Rio’s tropical climate, integrating natural light and ventilation into their design.

3. Contemporary Urban Renewal and Global Recognition 

In recent decades, Rio’s architecture has entered a dynamic phase of urban renewal, particularly in its Central and Port Zones. Historic neighborhoods such as Gamboa, Saúde, and Morro do Livramento—once home to colonial sobrados and industrial warehouses—are being rejuvenated through adaptive reuse. Former warehouses have been transformed into cultural centers, creative hubs, and commercial spaces, while new public spaces and promenades blend seamlessly with restored historic facades. This revitalization not only preserves the city’s heritage but also stimulates economic growth and cultural expression.

In a landmark moment reflecting its rich and diverse architectural tapestry, In January 2019, Rio was named the first World Capital of Architecture by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the International Union of Architects (UIA). This accolade recognized the city’s unique ability to fuse its storied colonial and imperial past with bold modernist interventions and innovative contemporary designs. The award highlighted how Rio’s landmark buildings, from the majestic Municipal Theater to the iconic Catete Palace, and its ongoing urban renewal projects, create a built environment that is as dynamic as it is historic.

4. Harmonious Integration with Nature 

A striking feature of Rio’s architecture is its deep connection with the natural landscape. Nestled between dramatic mountains, expansive bays, and landmarks like Sugarloaf Mountain and Corcovado, many buildings are designed to frame panoramic views of nature. Residential areas in upscale neighborhoods such as Ipanema and Leblon prioritize open, airy designs that invite natural light and breezes, while public spaces like parks, plazas, and waterfront promenades are meticulously landscaped to enhance both beauty and functionality.

5. Legacy and Ongoing Evolution 

From colonial fortresses and imperial palaces to modernist masterpieces and cutting-edge urban projects, Rio de Janeiro’s architecture tells a story of transformation and resilience. It is a living narrative that continues to evolve—reflecting the city’s complex history, diverse cultural influences, and its ceaseless drive toward reinvention. This multifaceted heritage not only shapes the identity of Rio but also sets a global benchmark in architectural innovation, as recognized by its prestigious title as the “World Capital of Architecture.”

===Literature===

After Brazilian independence from Portugal in 1822, Rio de Janeiro quickly developed a European-style bourgeois cultural life, including numerous newspapers, in which most 19th-century novels were initially published in serial. Joaquim Manuel de Macedo&#x27;s &quot;A Moreninha&quot; (1844) was perhaps the first successful novel in Brazil and inaugurates a recurrent 19th-century theme: a romantic relationship between idealistic young people in spite of cruelties of social fortune.

The first notable work of realism focusing on the urban lower-middle class is Manuel Antônio de Almeida&#x27;s &quot;Memórias de um sargento de milícias&quot; (1854), which presents a series of picaresque scenes, and evokes the transformation of a town into a city with suggestive nostalgia. Romantic and realist modes both flourished through the late 19th century and often overlapped within works.

Machado de Assis is from Rio de Janeiro, and is widely regarded as the greatest writer of Brazilian literature and considered the founder of Realism in Brazil, with the publication of &quot;The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas&quot; (1881). He commented on and criticized the political and social events of the city and country such as the abolition of slavery in 1888 and the transition from Empire to Republic with his numerous chronicles published in newspapers of the time. Many of his short stories and novels, like &quot;Quincas Borba&quot; (1891) and &quot;Dom Casmurro&quot; (1899), are placed in Rio. The headquarters of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is based in Rio de Janeiro. It was satirized by the novelist Jorge Amado in &quot;Pen, Sword, Camisole&quot;. Amado, himself, went on to be one of the 40 members of the academy.

The Biblioteca Nacional (National Library of Brazil) ranks as one of the largest libraries in the world. It is also the largest library in all of Latin America. Located in Cinelândia, the National Library was originally created by the King of Portugal, in 1810. As with many of Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s cultural monuments, the library was originally off-limits to the general public. The most valuable collections in the library include: 4,300 items donated by Barbosa Machado including a precious collection of rare brochures detailing the History of Portugal and Brazil; 2,365 items from the 17th and 18th centuries that were previously owned by Antônio de Araújo de Azevedo, the &quot;Count of Barca&quot;, including the 125-volume set of prints &quot;Le Grand Théâtre de l&#x27;Univers;&quot; a collection of documents regarding the Jesuítica Province of Paraguay and the &quot;Region of Prata;&quot; and the Teresa Cristina Maria Collection, donated by Emperor Pedro II. The collection contains 48,236 items. Individual items of special interest include a rare first edition of &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; by Luis de Camões, published in 1584; two copies of the Mogúncia Bible; and a first edition of Handel&#x27;s Messiah.

The Real Gabinete Português de Leitura (Portuguese Royal Reading Library) is located at Rua Luís de Camões, in the Centro (Downtown). The institution was founded in 1837 by a group of forty-three Portuguese immigrants, political refugees, to promote culture among the Portuguese community in the then capital of the Empire. The history of the Brazilian Academy of Letters is linked to the Real Gabinete, since some of the early meetings of the academy were held there.

===Music===
The official song of Rio de Janeiro is &quot;Cidade Maravilhosa&quot;, which means &quot;marvelous city&quot;. The song is considered the civic anthem of Rio, and is always the favorite song during Rio&#x27;s Carnival in February. Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, are considered the center of the urban music movement in Brazil.

&quot;Rio was popularized by the hit song &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot;, composed by Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes and recorded by Astrud Gilberto and João Gilberto, Frank Sinatra, and Ella Fitzgerald. It is also the main key song of the bossa nova, a music genre born in Rio. A genre unique to Rio and Brazil as a whole is Funk Carioca. While samba music continues to act as the national unifying agent in Rio, Funk Carioca found a strong community following in Brazil. With its genesis in the 1970s as the modern black pop music from the United States, it evolved in the 1990s to describe a variety of electronic music associated with the current US black music scene, including hip hop, modern soul, and house music.&quot;

Brazil&#x27;s return to democracy in 1985 allowed for a new music expression which promoted creativity and experimentation in expressive culture, in a wave of Rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll that swept the 80s. Lobão emerged as the most legendary rocker in Brazil. Commercial and cultural imports from Europe and North America have often influenced Brazil&#x27;s own cultural output. For example, the hip hop that has stemmed from New York is localized into forms of musical production such as Funk Carioca and Brazilian hip hop. Bands from Rio de Janeiro also had influence in the mid-to-late development of the Punk in Brazil, and that of Brazilian thrash metal. Democratic renewal also allowed for the recognition and acceptance of this diversification of Brazilian culture.

Some of the best artists in the history of Brazilian popular music hail from Rio de Janeiro, including aforementioned Lobão, Tim Maia, Agepê, Emílio Santiago, Evandro Mesquita, Byafra, Erasmo Carlos, Elymar Santos, Kátia Cega, Ivan Lins, Marcos Valle, Jorge Ben Jor e Wilson Simonal.

===Theater===

Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s Theatro Municipal is one of the most attractive buildings in the central area of the city. Home of one of the largest stages in Latin America and one of Brazil&#x27;s best-known venues for opera, ballet, and classical music, the building was inspired by the Palais Garnier, home of the Paris Opera. Construction of the Theatro Municipal began in 1905 following designs of the architect Francisco Pereira Passos. The statues on the top, of two women representing Poetry and Music, are by Rodolfo Bernardelli, and the interior is rich with furnishings and fine paintings. Inaugurated in 1909, the Teatro Municipal has close to 1,700 seats. Its interior includes turn of the century stained glass from France, ceilings of rose-colored marble and a 1,000 pound crystal bead chandelier surrounded by a painting of the &quot;Dance of the Hours&quot;. The exterior walls of the building are dotted with inscriptions bearing the names of famous Brazilians as well as many other international celebrities.

Cidade das Artes (City of Arts) is a cultural complex in Barra da Tijuca in the Southwest Zone of Rio de Janeiro, which was originally planned to open in 2004. Formally known as &quot;Cidade da Música&quot; (City of Music), it was finally inaugurated at the beginning of 2013.
The project will host the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra becoming a main center for music as will be the largest modern concert hall in South America, with 1,780 seats. The complex spans approximately and also features a chamber music hall, three theaters, and 12 rehearsal rooms. From the terrace there is a panoramic view of the zone. The building was designed by the French architect Christian de Portzamparc and construction was funded by the city of Rio de Janeiro.

A series of covered theaters collectively known as Lona Cultural, administered by the city&#x27;s Municipal Secretary of Culture, serve throughout the city as venues for cultural activities such as concerts, plays, workshops, art and craft fairs, and courses.

===Events===

Every 31 December, 2.5 million people gather at Copacabana Beach to celebrate New Year&#x27;s in Rio de Janeiro. The crowd, mostly dressed in white, celebrates all night at the hundreds of different shows and events along the beach. It is the second-largest celebration only next to the Carnival. People celebrate the New Year by sharing chilled champagne. It is considered good luck to shake the champagne bottle and spray around at midnight. Chilled champagne adds to the spirit of the festivities.

Rio Carnival is an annual celebration in the Roman Catholic tradition that allows merry-making and red meat consumption before the more sober 40 days of Lent penance which culminates with Holy or Passion Week and Easter. The tradition of Carnaval parades was probably influenced by the French or German courts and the custom was brought by the Portuguese or Brazilian Imperial families who had French and Austrian German ancestors. Up until the time of the marchinhas, the revelry was more of a high class and Caucasian-led event. The influence of the African-Brazilian drums and music became more noticeable from the first half of the 20th century. Rio de Janeiro has many Carnaval choices, including the samba school (&quot;Escolas de Samba)&quot; parades in the sambadrome exhibition center and the popular &quot;blocos de carnaval&quot;, street revelry, which parade in almost every corner of the city. In 1840, the first Carnival was celebrated with a masked ball. As years passed, adorned floats and costumed revelers became a tradition among the celebrants. Carnival is known as a historic root of Brazilian music.

Rock in Rio is a music festival conceived by entrepreneur Roberto Medina for the first time in 1985, and since its creation, recognized as the largest music festival in the Latin world and the largest in the world, with 1.5 million people attending the first event, 700,000 attending the second and fourth, about 1.2 million attending the third, and about 350,000 people attending each of the 3 Lisbon events. It was originally organized in Rio de Janeiro, from where the name comes from, has become a world level event and, in 2004, had its first edition abroad in Lisbon, Portugal, before Madrid, Spain and Las Vegas, United States. The festival is considered the eighth best in the world by the specialized site Fling Festival.

As in the rest of Brazil, association football is the most popular sport. The city&#x27;s major teams are Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Fluminense and Botafogo. Madureira, Bangu, Portuguesa, America and Bonsucesso are small clubs. Players born in the city include Zico, Romário and Ronaldo. Rio de Janeiro was one of the host cities of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, for which on both occasions Brazil was the host nation. In 1950, the Maracanã Stadium hosted 8 matches, including all but one of the host team&#x27;s matches. The Maracanã was also the location of the tournament-deciding match between Uruguay and Brazil, where Brazil only needed a draw to win the final group stage and the whole tournament. Brazil ended up losing 2–1 in front of a home crowd of more than 199,000. In 2014, the Maracanã hosted seven matches, including the final, where Germany beat Argentina 1–0.
On 2 October 2009, the International Olympic Committee selected Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 Summer Olympics. Rio made their first bid for the 1936 Summer Olympics, but lost to Berlin. They later made bids for the 2004 and 2012 Games, but failed to become a candidate city both times. Those games were awarded to Athens and London respectively. Rio is the first Brazilian and South American city to host the Summer Olympics. Rio de Janeiro also became the first city in the southern hemisphere outside of Australia to host the games – Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. In July 2007, Rio successfully organized and hosted the XV Pan American Games. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the 2011 Military World Games from 15 to 24 July 2011. The 2011 Military World Games were the largest military sports event ever held in Brazil, with approximately 4,900 athletes from 108 countries competing in 20 sports. Rio de Janeiro hosted the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics. The Olympic Games were held from 5 to 21 August 2016. The Paralympics were held from 7 to 18 September 2016.

The city has a history as host of major international sports events. The Ginásio do Maracanãzinho was the host arena for the official FIBA Basketball World Championship for its 1954 and 1963 editions. Later, the Jacarepaguá circuit in Rio de Janeiro was the site for the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix from 1978 to 1989. Rio de Janeiro also hosted the MotoGP Brazilian Grand Prix from 1995 to 2004 and the Champ Car event from 1996 to 1999. WCT/WQS surfing championships were contested on the beaches from 1985 to 2001. The Rio Champions Cup Tennis tournament is held in the spring. As part of its preparations to host the 2007 Pan American Games, Rio built a new stadium, Estádio Olímpico João Havelange, to hold 45,000 people. It was named after Brazilian ex-FIFA president João Havelange. The stadium is owned by the city of Rio de Janeiro, but it was rented to Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas for 20 years.

<doc id="25938" wikidata="Q212648" url="?curid=25938" title="Rudy Giuliani">
<text>Rudolph William Louis Giuliani ( , ; born May 28, 1944) is an American politician and disbarred lawyer who served as the 107th mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001. He previously served as the United States Associate Attorney General from 1981 to 1983 and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1983 to 1989.

Giuliani led the 1980s federal prosecution of New York City mafia bosses as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. After a failed campaign for Mayor of New York City in the 1989 election, he succeeded in 1993, and was reelected in 1997, campaigning on a &quot;tough on crime&quot; platform. He led New York&#x27;s controversial &quot;civic cleanup&quot; from 1994 to 2001. and appointed William Bratton as New York City&#x27;s new police commissioner. In 2000, he ran against First Lady Hillary Clinton for a U.S. Senate seat from New York, but left the race once diagnosed with prostate cancer. For his mayoral leadership following the September 11 attacks in 2001, he was called &quot;America&#x27;s mayor&quot; and was named &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Person of the Year for 2001.

In 2002, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners, and acquired, but later sold, an investment banking firm, Giuliani Capital Advisors. In 2005, he joined a law firm, renamed Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. Vying for the Republican Party&#x27;s 2008 presidential nomination, Giuliani was an early frontrunner yet did poorly in the primary election; he later withdrew and endorsed the party&#x27;s subsequent nominee, John McCain. After declining to run for New York governor in 2010 and for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, Giuliani turned his focus to his business firms.

After advising Donald Trump during his 2016 presidential campaign and early administration, Giuliani joined President Trump&#x27;s personal legal team in April 2018, remaining on it during the 2020 presidential election. His activities as Trump&#x27;s attorney have led to allegations that he engaged in corruption and profiteering. In 2019, Giuliani was a central figure in the Trump–Ukraine scandal. Following the 2020 election, he represented Trump in many lawsuits filed in attempts to overturn the election results, making false and debunked allegations about rigged voting machines, polling place fraud, and an international communist conspiracy. Giuliani spoke at the rally preceding the January 6 United States Capitol attack, where he made false claims of voter fraud and called for &quot;trial by combat&quot;. Later, he was also listed as an unindicted co-conspirator in the federal prosecution of Trump&#x27;s alleged attempts to overturn the election. In August 2023, he was indicted in the prosecution related to the 2020 election in Georgia, Later in 2023, Giuliani lost a $148-million defamation lawsuit for his false claims about two election workers in Georgia, and unsuccessfully attempted to declare bankruptcy; he later reached a settlement to pay damages awarded to the election workers. In April 2024, he was indicted on charges related to the 2020 election in Arizona. He was later disbarred in the state of New York in July, and in the District of Columbia in September.

==Early life and education==
Giuliani was born on May 28, 1944, in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York City, which at the time of his birth was a largely Italian American enclave of Brooklyn. He is the only child of working-class parents Helen (née D&#x27;Avanzo) and Harold Angelo Giuliani, both children of Italian immigrants. Harold Giuliani, a plumber and a bartender, had trouble holding a job, was convicted of felony assault and robbery, and served prison time in Sing Sing. Once released, his father worked as an enforcer for his brother-in-law Leo D&#x27;Avanzo, who operated an organized crime-affiliated loan sharking and gambling ring from a restaurant in Brooklyn.

Giuliani was raised a Roman Catholic. When he was seven years old, his family moved from Brooklyn to Garden City South on Long Island, where he attended the local Catholic school, St. Anne&#x27;s. Later, he commuted back to Brooklyn to attend Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School, where he graduated in 1961.

Giuliani attended Manhattan College in Riverdale, Bronx, where he majored in political science with a minor in philosophy.
Giuliani was elected president of his class in his sophomore year, but was not re-elected in his junior year. He joined the Phi Rho Pi college forensic fraternity and honor society. He graduated in 1965.

Giuliani considered becoming a priest but decided to attend New York University School of Law in Manhattan, where he was a member of the &quot;New York University Law Review&quot; and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a Juris Doctor degree in 1968.

==Career==

Giuliani started his career and political life as a Democrat, working as a Democratic Party committeeman on Long Island in the mid-1960s. In 1968, he volunteered for Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s presidential campaign in the 1968 presidential election, and voted for George McGovern for president in the 1972 presidential election.

After graduating from law school, Giuliani clerked for Judge Lloyd Francis MacMahon, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.

Giuliani did not serve in the military during the Vietnam War. His conscription was deferred while he was enrolled at Manhattan College and NYU Law. Upon graduation from law school in 1968, he was classified 1-A (available for military service), but in 1969 he was reclassified 2-A (essential civilian) as Judge MacMahon&#x27;s law clerk. In 1970, Giuliani was reclassified 1-A but received a high 308 draft lottery number and was not called up for service.

===U.S. associate deputy attorney general===
Giuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent in 1975. This occurred during a period of time in which he was recruited for a position in Washington, D.C., with the Ford administration: Giuliani served as the associate deputy attorney general and chief of staff to Deputy Attorney General Harold &quot;Ace&quot; Tyler.

His first high-profile prosecution was of Democratic U.S. Representative Bertram L. Podell (NY-13), who was convicted of corruption. Podell pleaded guilty to conspiracy and conflict of interest for accepting more than $41,000 in campaign contributions and legal fees from a Florida airline to obtain federal rights for a Bahama route. Podell, who maintained a legal practice while serving in Congress, said the payments were legitimate legal fees. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; later reported, &quot;The trial catapulted future New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani to front-page status when, as assistant U.S. attorney, he relentlessly cross-examined an initially calm Rep. Podell. The congressman reportedly grew more flustered and eventually decided to plead guilty.&quot;

From 1977 to 1981, during the Carter administration, Giuliani practiced law at the Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler law firm, as chief of staff to his former boss, Ace Tyler. In later years, Tyler became &quot;disillusioned&quot; by what Tyler described as Giuliani&#x27;s time as US Attorney, criticizing several of his prosecutions as &quot;overkill&quot;.

On December 8, 1980, one month after the election of Ronald Reagan brought Republicans back to power in Washington, he switched his party affiliation from Independent to Republican. Giuliani later said the switches were because he found Democratic policies &quot;naïve&quot;, and that &quot;by the time I moved to Washington, the Republicans had come to make more sense to me.&quot; Others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the Justice Department. Giuliani&#x27;s mother maintained in 1988 that he &quot;only became a Republican after he began to get all these jobs from them. He&#x27;s definitely not a conservative Republican. He thinks he is, but he isn&#x27;t. He still feels very sorry for the poor.&quot;

===U.S. associate attorney general===
In 1981, Giuliani was named associate attorney general in the Reagan administration, the third-highest position in the Department of Justice. As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S. Attorney Offices&#x27; federal law enforcement agencies, the Department of Corrections, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the United States Marshals Service. In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the federal government&#x27;s &quot;detention posture&quot; regarding the internment of more than 2,000 Haitian asylum seekers who had entered the country illegally. The U.S. government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were &quot;economic migrants&quot;. In defense of the government&#x27;s position, Giuliani testified that &quot;political repression, at least in general, does not exist&quot; under President of Haiti Jean-Claude Duvalier&#x27;s regime.

===U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York===
In 1983, Giuliani was appointed to be U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases and because the SDNY is considered the highest-profile United States Attorney&#x27;s Office in the country and as such is often used by those who have held the position as a springboard for running for public office. It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of Wall Street figures Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken. He also focused on prosecuting drug dealers, organized crime, and corruption in government. He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals. As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the perp walk, parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool. After Giuliani &quot;patented the perp walk&quot;, the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide.

Giuliani&#x27;s critics said that he arranged for people to be arrested but then dropped charges for lack of evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his arrests of alleged white-collar criminals at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened sparked controversy and damaged the reputations of the alleged &quot;perps&quot;. He said veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., was guilty of insider trading; in February 1987 he had officers handcuff Wigton and march him through the company&#x27;s trading floor, with Wigton in tears. Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young arbitrageur and former colleague of Wigton, so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond.

Within three months, charges were dropped against both Wigton and Tabor; Giuliani said, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to go to trial. We&#x27;re just the tip of the iceberg&quot;, but no further charges were forthcoming and the investigation did not end until Giuliani&#x27;s successor was in place. Giuliani&#x27;s high-profile raid of the Princeton/Newport firm ended with the defendants having their cases overturned on appeal on the grounds that what they had been convicted of were not crimes.

====Mafia Commission trial====
In the Mafia Commission Trial, which ran from February 25, 1985, through November 19, 1986, Giuliani indicted eleven organized crime figures, including the heads of New York City&#x27;s so-called &quot;Five Families&quot;, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act on charges including extortion, labor racketeering, and murder for hire. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called this &quot;case of cases&quot; possibly &quot;the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943&quot;, and quoted Giuliani&#x27;s stated intention: &quot;Our approach is to wipe out the five families.&quot; Gambino crime family boss Paul Castellano evaded conviction when he and his underboss Thomas Bilotti were murdered on the streets of midtown Manhattan on December 16, 1985. However, three heads of the Five Families were sentenced to 100 years in prison on January 13, 1987. Genovese and Colombo leaders, Tony Salerno and Carmine Persico, received additional sentences in separate trials, with 70-year and 39-year sentences to run consecutively. He was assisted by three Assistant United States Attorneys: Michael Chertoff, the eventual second United States Secretary of Homeland Security and co-author of the Patriot Act; John Savarese, now a partner at Wachtell Lipton Rosen &amp; Katz; and Gil Childers, a later deputy chief of the criminal division for the Southern District of New York and now managing director in the legal department at Goldman Sachs.

According to an FBI memo revealed in 2007, leaders of the Five Families voted in late 1986 on whether to issue a contract for Giuliani&#x27;s death. Heads of the Lucchese, Bonanno, and Genovese families rejected the idea, though Colombo and Gambino leaders, Carmine Persico and John Gotti, encouraged assassination. In 2014, it was revealed by former Sicilian Mafia member and informant Rosario Naimo that Salvatore Riina, a notorious Sicilian Mafia leader, had ordered a murder contract on Giuliani during the mid-1980s. Riina allegedly was suspicious of Giuliani&#x27;s efforts prosecuting the American Mafia and was worried that he might have spoken with Italian anti-Mafia prosecutors and politicians, including Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, who were both murdered in 1992 in separate car bombings. According to Giuliani, the Sicilian Mafia offered $800,000 for his death during his first year as mayor of New York in 1994.

====Boesky and Milken trials====
Ivan Boesky, a Wall Street arbitrageur who had amassed a fortune of about $200million by betting on corporate takeovers, was originally investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders, leading the way for the US Attorney&#x27;s Office of the Southern District of New York to investigate as well. These stock and options acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover. Although insider trading of this kind was illegal, laws prohibiting it were rarely enforced until Boesky was prosecuted. Boesky cooperated with the SEC and informed on several others, including junk bond trader Michael Milken. Per agreement with Giuliani, Boesky received a -year prison sentence along with a $100million fine. In 1989, Giuliani charged Milken under the RICO Act with 98 counts of racketeering and fraud. In a highly publicized case, Milken was indicted by a grand jury on these charges.

===Disbarment===
In June 2021, Giuliani had his license to practice law suspended in the state of New York, pending an investigation related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. On July 2, 2024, he was disbarred in the state of New York. On September 26, 2024, he was disbarred in the District of Columbia under reciprocal discipline.

== Mayoral campaigns ==
Giuliani was U.S. Attorney until January 1989, resigning as the Reagan administration ended. He garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions. He joined the law firm White &amp; Case in New York City as a partner. He remained with White &amp; Case until May 1990, when he joined the law firm Anderson Kill Olick &amp; Oshinsky, also in New York City.

=== 1989 ===
Giuliani first ran for New York City mayor in 1989, when he attempted to unseat three-term incumbent Ed Koch. He won the September 1989 Republican Party primary election against business magnate Ronald Lauder in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was not a true Republican after an acrimonious debate between the two men. In the Democratic primary, Koch was upset by Manhattan Borough president David Dinkins.

In the general election, Giuliani ran as the fusion candidate of both the Republican and the Liberal parties. The Conservative Party, which had often co-lined the Republican party candidate, withheld support from Giuliani and ran Lauder instead. Conservative Party leaders were unhappy with Giuliani on ideological grounds. They cited the Liberal Party&#x27;s endorsement statement that Giuliani &quot;agreed with the Liberal Party&#x27;s views on affirmative action, gay rights, gun control, school prayer, and tuition tax credits&quot;.

During two televised debates, Giuliani framed himself as an agent of change, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m the reformer,&quot; that &quot;If we keep going merrily along, this city&#x27;s going down,&quot; and that electing Dinkins would represent &quot;more of the same, more of the rotten politics that have been dragging us down&quot;. Giuliani pointed out that Dinkins had not filed a tax return for many years and several other ethical missteps, in particular a stock transfer to his son. Dinkins filed several years of returns and said the tax matter had been fully paid off. He denied other wrongdoing, saying that &quot;what we need is a mayor, not a prosecutor&quot; and that Giuliani refused to say &quot;the R-wordhe doesn&#x27;t like to admit he&#x27;s a Republican&quot;. Dinkins won the endorsements of three of the four daily New York newspapers, while Giuliani won approval from the &quot;New York Post&quot;.

In the end, Giuliani lost to Dinkins by a margin of 47,080 votes out of 1,899,845 votes cast, in the closest election in New York City&#x27;s history. The closeness of the race was particularly noteworthy, considering the small percentage of New York City residents who are registered Republicans, and it resulted in Giuliani being the presumptive nominee for a rematch with Dinkins at the next election.

=== 1993 ===

Four years after his defeat to Dinkins, Giuliani again ran for mayor. Once again, Giuliani also ran on the Liberal Party line but not the Conservative Party line, which ran activist George Marlin.

Although crime had begun to fall during the Dinkins administration, Giuliani&#x27;s campaign capitalized on the perception that crime was uncontrolled in the city following events such as the Crown Heights riot and the Family Red Apple boycott. The year prior to the election, Giuliani was a key speaker at a Patrolmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association rally opposing Dinkins, in which Giuliani blamed the police department&#x27;s low morale on Dinkins&#x27; leadership. The rally quickly devolved into a riot, with nearly 4,000 off-duty police officers storming the City Hall and blocking traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge.

Dinkins and Giuliani never debated during the campaign, because they were never able to agree on how to approach a debate. Dinkins was endorsed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Newsday&quot;, while Giuliani was endorsed by the &quot;New York Post&quot; and, in a key switch from 1989, the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;. Giuliani went to visit the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, seeking his blessing and endorsement.

On election day, Giuliani&#x27;s campaign hired off-duty cops, firefighters, and corrections officers to monitor polling places in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and The Bronx for cases of voter fraud. Despite objections from the Dinkins campaign, who said that the effort would intimidate Democratic voters, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly assigned an additional 52 police captains and 3,500 officers to monitor the city&#x27;s polling places.

Giuliani won by a margin of 53,367 votes. He became the first Republican elected mayor of New York City since John Lindsay in 1965. Similar to the election four years prior, Giuliani performed particularly well in the white ethnic neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Giuliani saw especially high returns in the borough of Staten Island, as a referendum to consider allowing the borough to secede from New York City was on the ballot.

=== 1997 ===
Giuliani&#x27;s opponent in 1997 was Democratic Manhattan Borough president Ruth Messinger, who had beaten Al Sharpton in the September 9, 1997, Democratic primary. In the general election, Giuliani once again had the Liberal Party and not the Conservative Party listing. Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani&#x27;s popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.

Throughout the campaign he was well ahead in the polls and had a strong fund-raising advantage over Messinger. On her part, Messinger lost the support of several usually Democratic constituencies, including gay organizations and large labor unions. The local daily newspapers&quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;New York Post&quot; and &quot;Newsday&quot;all endorsed Giuliani over Messinger.

In the end, Giuliani won 58% of the vote to Messinger&#x27;s 41%, becoming the first registered Republican to win a second term as mayor while on the Republican line since Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1941. Voter turnout was the lowest in twelve years, with 38% of registered voters casting ballots. The margin of victory included gains in his share of the African American vote (20% compared to 1993&#x27;s 5%) and the Hispanic vote (43% from 37%) while maintaining his base of white ethnic and Catholic and Jewish voters from 1993.

== Mayoralty ==

Giuliani served as mayor of New York City from 1994 to 2001.

=== Law enforcement ===
In Giuliani&#x27;s first term as mayor, the New York City Police Departmentat the instigation of Commissioner Bill Brattonadopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on James Q. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;broken windows&quot; approach. This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, cannabis possession, and aggressive panhandling by &quot;squeegee men&quot;, on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained. The legal underpinning for removing the &quot;squeegee men&quot; from the streets was developed under Giuliani&#x27;s predecessor, Mayor David Dinkins. Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner Jack Maple, also created and instituted CompStat, a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions. Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data. An extensive study found a high correlation between crime rates reported by the police through CompStat and rates of crime available from other sources, suggesting there had been no manipulation. The CompStat initiative won the 1996 Innovations in Government Award from Harvard Kennedy School.
During Giuliani&#x27;s administration, crime rates dropped in New York City. The extent to which Giuliani deserves the credit is disputed. Crime rates in New York City had started to drop in 1991 under previous mayor David Dinkins, three years before Giuliani took office. A small nationwide drop in crime preceded Giuliani&#x27;s election, and some critics say he may have been the beneficiary of a trend already in progress. Additional contributing factors to the overall decline in New York City crime during the 1990s were the addition of 7,000 officers to the NYPD, lobbied for and hired by the Dinkins administration, and an overall improvement in the national economy. Changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions, which were similar across the country during this time. Because the crime index is based on that of the FBI, which is self-reported by police departments, some have alleged that crimes were shifted into categories the FBI does not collect. Sociologist Frank Zimring, in his 2006 book &quot;The Great American Crime Decline&quot;, claimed that &quot;up to half of New York&#x27;s crime drop in the 1990s, and virtually 100 percent of its continuing crime decline since 2000, has resulted from policing.&quot;

Bratton was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1996. Giuliani reportedly forced Bratton out after two years, in what was seen as a battle of two large egos in which Giuliani was not tolerant of Bratton&#x27;s celebrity. Bratton went on to become chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. Giuliani&#x27;s term also saw allegations of civil rights abuses and other police misconduct under other commissioners after Bratton&#x27;s departure. There were police shootings of unarmed suspects, and the scandals surrounding the torture of Abner Louima and the killings of Amadou Diallo, Gidone Busch and Patrick Dorismond. Giuliani supported the New York City Police Department, by releasing, for example, what he called Dorismond&#x27;s &quot;extensive criminal record&quot; to the public, including a sealed juvenile file.

=== City services ===
The Giuliani administration advocated the privatization of the city&#x27;s public schools, which he called &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, and the reduction of state funding for them. He advocated a voucher-based system to promote private schooling. Giuliani supported protection for illegal immigrants. He continued a policy of preventing city employees from contacting the Immigration and Naturalization Service about immigration violations, on the grounds that illegal aliens should be able to take actions such as sending their children to school or reporting crimes to the police without fear of deportation.

During his mayoralty, gay and lesbian New Yorkers received domestic partnership rights. Giuliani induced the city&#x27;s Democratic-controlled New York City Council, which had avoided the issue for years, to pass legislation providing broad protection for same-sex partners. In 1998, he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners.

=== 2000 U.S. Senate campaign ===

With term limits, Giuliani was ineligible to run in 2001 for a third term as mayor. In November 1998, four-term incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat. Because of his high profile and visibility, Giuliani was supported by the state Republican Party. Giuliani&#x27;s entrance led Democratic Congressman Charles Rangel and others to recruit then-First Lady Hillary Clinton to run for Moynihan&#x27;s seat, hoping she might combat his star power.

In April 1999, Giuliani formed an exploratory committee in connection with the Senate run. By January 2000, polling for the race showed Giuliani nine points ahead of Clinton, in part because his campaign was able to take advantage of several campaign stumbles by Clinton. In March 2000, however, the New York Police Department&#x27;s fatal shooting of Patrick Dorismond inflamed Giuliani&#x27;s strained relations with the city&#x27;s minority communities, and Clinton seized on it as a major campaign issue. By April 2000, reports showed Clinton gaining upstate and generally outworking Giuliani, who said his duties as mayor prevented him from campaigning more. Clinton was now eight to ten points ahead of Giuliani in the polls.

Then followed four tumultuous weeks in which Giuliani learned he had prostate cancer and needed treatment; his extramarital relationship with Judith Nathan became public and the subject of a media frenzy; and he announced a separation from his wife Donna Hanover. After much indecision, on May 19, Giuliani announced his withdrawal from the Senate race.

=== September 11 terrorist attacks ===

==== Response ====
Giuliani received nationwide attention in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September11 and afterwardsfor example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe the dispersion of chemical or biological weaponry into the air was a factor in the attack. In his public statements, Giuliani said:
The 9/11 attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the Democratic and Republican candidates to succeed Giuliani. The primary was immediately delayed two weeks to September 25. During this period, Giuliani sought an unprecedented three-month emergency extension of his term from January1 to April1 under the New York State Constitution (Article3, Section 25). In October 2000, he had considered supporting city council efforts to remove their own term limits, though was not in favor of ending consecutive mayoral term limits. In the end, leaders in the State Assembly and Senate indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary. The election proceeded as scheduled, and the winning candidate, the Giuliani-endorsed Republican convert Michael Bloomberg, took office on January 1, 2002, per normal custom.

Giuliani said he had been at the Ground Zero site &quot;as often, if not more, than most workers... I was there working with them. I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I&#x27;m one of them.&quot; Some 9/11 workers have objected to those claims. While his appointment logs were unavailable for the six days immediately following the attacks, Giuliani logged 29 hours at the site over three months beginning September 17. This contrasted with recovery workers at the site who spent this much time at the site in two to three days.
When Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal suggested the attacks were an indication that the United States &quot;should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the Palestinian cause,&quot; Giuliani asserted, &quot;There is no moral equivalent for this act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they&#x27;re part of the problem.&quot; Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince&#x27;s $10million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack.

==== Criticism and communications problems ====
Giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the Office of Emergency Management headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the 7 World Trade Center building. Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993. The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters. Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7World Trade to power the command center. In May 1997, Giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on Jerome M. Hauer, who had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as New York City&#x27;s first director of emergency management. Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided Fox News and &quot;New York Magazine&quot; with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in Brooklyn but was overruled by Giuliani. Television journalist Chris Wallace interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center. Giuliani laughed during Wallace&#x27;s questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and that Hauer said the WTC site was the best location. Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer&#x27;s directive letter. The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan. The February 1996 memo read, &quot;The [Brooklyn] building is secure and not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan.&quot;
In January 2008, an eight-page memo was revealed which detailed the New York City Police Department&#x27;s opposition in 1998 to the location of the city&#x27;s emergency command center at the Trade Center site. The Giuliani administration overrode these concerns.

The &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot; noted that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks. The commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Family members of 9/11 victims have said these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years. The radios were not working when Fire Department chiefs ordered the 343 firefighters inside the towers to evacuate, and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed. However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission he said the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives. Giuliani testified to the commission, where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements. A 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty. Replacement radios were purchased in a $33million no-bid contract with Motorola, and implemented in early 2001. However, the radios were recalled in March 2001 after a probationary firefighter&#x27;s calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene, leaving firemen with the old analog radios from 1993. A book later published by Commission members Thomas Kean and Lee H. Hamilton, &quot;Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission&quot;, argued that the commission had not pursued a tough enough line of questioning with Giuliani.

An October 2001 study by the National Institute of Environmental Safety and Health said cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear.

==== Public reaction ====
Giuliani gained international attention after the attacks and was widely hailed for his leadership role. Polls taken just six weeks after the attack showed a 79 percent approval rating among New York City voters. This was a dramatic increase over the 36 percent rating he had received a year earlier, which was an average at the end of a two-term mayorship. Oprah Winfrey called him &quot;America&#x27;s Mayor&quot; at a 9/11 memorial service held at Yankee Stadium on September 23, 2001.

Giuliani was praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts, but others argue that &quot;Giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks, casting himself as a hero for political gain.&quot; Giuliani has collected $11.4million from speaking fees in a single year (with increased demand after the attacks). Before September11, Giuliani&#x27;s assets were estimated to be somewhat less than $2million, but his net worth could now be as high as 30 times that amount. He has made most of his money since leaving office.

==== &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year ====
On December 24, 2001, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Giuliani its Person of the Year for 2001. &quot;Time&quot; observed that, before 9/11, Giuliani&#x27;s public image had been that of a rigid, self-righteous, ambitious politician. After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image became that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis. Historian Vincent J. Cannato concluded in September 2006:
==== Aftermath ====
For his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary knighthood (KBE) by Queen Elizabeth II on February 13, 2002.

Giuliani initially downplayed the health effects arising from the September 11 attacks in the Financial District and lower Manhattan areas in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site. He moved quickly to reopen Wall Street, and it was reopened on September 17. In the first month after the attacks, he said &quot;The air quality is safe and acceptable.&quot;
Giuliani took control away from agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, leaving the &quot;largely unknown&quot; city Department of Design and Construction in charge of recovery and cleanup. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed. In June 2007, Christie Todd Whitman, former Republican governor of New Jersey and director of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), reportedly said the EPA had pushed for workers at the WTC site to wear respirators but she had been blocked by Giuliani. She said she believed the subsequent lung disease and deaths suffered by WTC responders were a result of these actions. However, former deputy mayor Joe Lhota, then with the Giuliani campaign, replied, &quot;All workers at Ground Zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators.&quot;

Giuliani asked the city&#x27;s Congressional delegation to limit the city&#x27;s liability for Ground Zero illnesses to a total of $350million. Two years after Giuliani finished his term, FEMA appropriated $1billion to a special insurance fund, called the World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company, to protect the city against 9/11 lawsuits.

In February 2007, the International Association of Fire Fighters issued a letter asserting that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: &quot;Mayor Giuliani&#x27;s actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no closure for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the Fresh Kills Landfill,&quot; it said, adding: &quot;Hundreds remained entombed in Ground Zero when Giuliani gave up on them.&quot; Lawyers for the International Association of Fire Fighters seek to interview Giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that New York City negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the Fresh Kills Landfill.

== Post-mayoralty political career ==

=== Before 2008 election ===
Since leaving office as mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels. When George Pataki became governor in 1995, this represented the first time the positions of both mayor and governor were held simultaneously by Republicans since John Lindsay and Nelson Rockefeller. Giuliani and Pataki were instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to New York City. He was a speaker at the convention, and endorsed President George W. Bush for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell,
Similarly, in June 2006, Giuliani started a website called Solutions America to help elect Republican candidates across the nation.

After campaigning on Bush&#x27;s behalf in the U.S. presidential election of 2004, he was reportedly the top choice for Secretary of Homeland Security after Tom Ridge&#x27;s resignation. When suggestions were made that Giuliani&#x27;s confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals, he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik. After the formal announcement of Kerik&#x27;s nomination, information about Kerik&#x27;s pastmost notably, that he had ties to organized crime, had failed to properly report gifts he had received, had been sued for sexual harassment and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servantbecame known, and Kerik withdrew his nomination.
On March 15, 2006, Congress formed the Iraq Study Group (ISG). This bipartisan ten-person panel, of which Giuliani was one of the members, was charged with assessing the Iraq War and making recommendations. They would eventually unanimously conclude that contrary to Bush administration assertions, &quot;The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating&quot; and called for &quot;changes in the primary mission&quot; that would allow &quot;the United States to begin to move its forces out of Iraq&quot;.

On May 24, 2006, after missing all the group&#x27;s meetings, including a briefing from General David Petraeus, former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former Army Chief of Staff Eric Shinseki, Giuliani resigned from the panel, citing &quot;previous time commitments&quot;. Giuliani&#x27;s fundraising schedule had kept him from participating in the panel, a schedule which raised $11.4million in speaking fees over fourteen months, and that Giuliani had been forced to resign after being given &quot;an ultimatum to either show up for meetings or leave the group&quot; by group leader James Baker. Giuliani subsequently said he had started thinking about running for president, and being on the panel might give it a political spin.

Giuliani was described by &quot;Newsweek&quot; in January 2007 as &quot;one of the most consistent cheerleaders for the president&#x27;s handling of the war in Iraq&quot; and as of June 2007, he remained one of the few candidates for president to unequivocally support both the basis for the invasion and the execution of the war.

Giuliani spoke in support of the removal of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. The group was on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. Even though they were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992, the MEK&#x27;s Marxist opposing branch, which at the time had retained the organization&#x27;s name, claimed responsibility for the killings in their &quot;Military Communique No.24&quot;, concluding that the murders were in retaliation for recent death sentences. Giuliani, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Tom Ridge, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Giuliani and others reportedly received tens of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to advocate for the MEK; some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals&#x27; speaking fees. Several commentators wrote that under the PATRIOT Act, these people could be potentially prosecuted for providing material support for terrorism, a claim Giuliani denied. Giuliani and others wrote an article for the conservative publication &quot;National Review&quot; stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization. They supported their position by pointing out that the United Kingdom and the European Union had already removed the group from their terrorism lists. They further assert that only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group. However, Canada did not delist the group until December 2012.

=== 2008 presidential campaign ===

In November 2006, Giuliani announced the formation of an exploratory committee toward a run for the presidency in 2008. In February 2007, he filed a &quot;statement of candidacy&quot; and confirmed on the television program &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that he was indeed running.
Early polls showed Giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition ever recorded along with high levels of support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007, he was the leader in most nationwide opinion polling among Republicans. Senator John McCain, who ranked a close second behind the New York Mayor, had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared Republican candidates, with only former senator Fred Thompson and former governor Mitt Romney showing greater support in some per-state Republican polls. On November 7, 2007, Giuliani&#x27;s campaign received an endorsement from evangelist, Christian Broadcasting Network founder, and past presidential candidate Pat Robertson. This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that evangelicals and other social conservatives could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.

Giuliani&#x27;s campaign hit a difficult stretch during the last two months of 2007, when Bernard Kerik, whom Giuliani had recommended for the position of Secretary of Homeland Security, was indicted on 16 counts of tax fraud and other federal charges. The media reported that when Giuliani was the mayor of New York, he billed several tens of thousands of dollars of mayoral security expenses to obscure city agencies. Those expenses were incurred while he visited Judith Nathan, with whom he was having an extramarital affair (later analysis showed the billing to likely be unrelated to hiding Nathan). Several stories were published in the press regarding clients of Giuliani Partners and Bracewell &amp; Giuliani who were in opposition to goals of American foreign policy. Giuliani&#x27;s national poll numbers began steadily slipping and his unusual strategy of focusing more on later, multi-primary big states rather than the smaller, first-voting states was seen at risk.
Despite his strategy, Giuliani competed to a substantial extent in the January 8, 2008, New Hampshire primary but finished a distant fourth with 9percent of the vote. Similar poor results continued in other early contests, when Giuliani&#x27;s staff went without pay in order to focus all efforts on the crucial late January Florida Republican primary. The shift of the electorate&#x27;s focus from national security to the state of the economy also hurt Giuliani, as did the resurgence of McCain&#x27;s similarly themed campaign. On January 29, 2008, Giuliani finished a distant third in the Florida result with 15percent of the vote, trailing McCain and Romney. Facing declining polls and lost leads in the upcoming large Super Tuesday states, including that of his home New York, Giuliani withdrew from the race on January 30, endorsing McCain.

Giuliani&#x27;s campaign ended up $3.6million in arrears, and in June 2008 Giuliani sought to retire the debt by proposing to appear at Republican fundraisers during the 2008 general election, and have part of the proceeds go towards his campaign. During the 2008 Republican National Convention, Giuliani gave a prime-time speech that praised McCain and his running mate, Sarah Palin, while criticizing Democratic nominee Barack Obama. He cited Palin&#x27;s executive experience as a mayor and governor and belittled Obama&#x27;s lack of same, and his remarks were met with wild applause from the delegates. Giuliani continued to be one of McCain&#x27;s most active surrogates during the remainder of McCain&#x27;s eventually unsuccessful campaign.

=== After 2008 election ===
Following the end of his presidential campaign, Giuliani&#x27;s &quot;high appearance fees dropped like a stone&quot;. He returned to work at both Giuliani Partners and Bracewell &amp; Giuliani. His consultancy work included advising Keiko Fujimori with her presidential campaign during the 2011 Peruvian general election. Giuliani also explored hosting a syndicated radio show, and was reported to be in talks with Westwood One about replacing Bill O&#x27;Reilly before that position went to Fred Thompson (another unsuccessful 2008 GOP presidential primary candidate). In 2009, Giuliani said the Obama administration and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner lacked executive competence in dealing with the 2007–2008 financial crisis.
Giuliani said his political career was not necessarily over, and did not rule out a 2010 New York gubernatorial or 2012 presidential bid. A November 2008 Siena College poll indicated that although Governor David Patersonpromoted to the office via the Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal a year beforewas popular among New Yorkers, he would have just a slight lead over Giuliani in a hypothetical matchup. By February 2009, after the prolonged Senate appointment process, a Siena College poll indicated that Paterson was losing popularity among New Yorkers, and showed Giuliani with a fifteen-point lead in the hypothetical contest. In January 2009, Giuliani said he would not decide on a gubernatorial run for another six to eight months, adding that he thought it would not be fair to the governor to start campaigning early while the governor tries to focus on his job. Giuliani worked to retire his presidential campaign debt, but by the end of March 2009 it was still $2.4million in arrears, the largest such remaining amount for any of the 2008 contenders. In April 2009, Giuliani strongly opposed Paterson&#x27;s announced push for same-sex marriage in New York and said it would likely cause a backlash that could put Republicans in statewide office in 2010. By late August 2009, there were still conflicting reports about whether Giuliani was likely to run.

On December 23, 2009, Giuliani announced that he would not seek any office in 2010, saying &quot;The main reason has to do with my two enterprises: Bracewell &amp; Giuliani and Giuliani Partners. I&#x27;m very busy in both.&quot; The decisions signaled a possible end to Giuliani&#x27;s political career. During the 2010 midterm elections, Giuliani endorsed and campaigned for Bob Ehrlich and Marco Rubio.

On October 11, 2011, Giuliani announced that he was not running for president. According to Kevin Law, the director of the Long Island Association, Giuliani believed that &quot;As a moderate, he thought it was a pretty significant challenge. He said it&#x27;s tough to be a moderate and succeed in GOP primaries,&quot; Giuliani said &quot;If it&#x27;s too late for (New Jersey Governor) Chris Christie, it&#x27;s too late for me.&quot;

At a Republican fund-raising event in February 2015, Giuliani said, &quot;I do not believe, and I know this is a horrible thing to say, but I do not believe that the president Obama loves America,&quot; and &quot;He doesn&#x27;t love you. And he doesn&#x27;t love me. He wasn&#x27;t brought up the way you were brought up and I was brought up, through love of this country.&quot; In response to criticism of the remarks, Giuliani said, &quot;Some people thought it was racistI thought that was a joke, since he was brought up by a white mother... This isn&#x27;t racism. This is socialism or possibly anti-colonialism.&quot; White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz said he agreed with Giuliani &quot;that it was a horrible thing to say&quot;, but he would leave it up to the people who heard Giuliani directly to assess whether the remarks were appropriate for the event. Although he received some support for his controversial comments, Giuliani said he also received several death threats within 48 hours.

=== Relationship with Donald Trump ===
==== Presidential campaign supporter ====
Giuliani supported Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. He gave a prime time speech during the first night of the 2016 Republican National Convention. Earlier in the day, Giuliani and former 2016 presidential candidate Ben Carson appeared at an event for the pro-Trump Great America PAC. Giuliani also appeared in a Great America PAC ad entitled &quot;Leadership&quot;. Giuliani&#x27;s and Jeff Sessions&#x27; appearances were staples at Trump campaign rallies.

During the campaign, Giuliani praised Trump for his worldwide accomplishments and helping fellow New Yorkers in their time of need. He defended Trump against allegations of racism, sexual assault, and not paying any federal income taxes for as long as two decades.

In August 2016, Giuliani, while campaigning for Trump, said that in the &quot;eight years before Obama&quot; became president, &quot;we didn&#x27;t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States&quot;. It was noted that 9/11 happened during George W. Bush&#x27;s first term. PolitiFact brought up four more counter-examples (the 2002 Los Angeles International Airport shooting, the 2002 D.C. sniper attacks, the 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting and the 2006 UNC SUV attack) to Giuliani&#x27;s claim. Giuliani later said he was using &quot;abbreviated language&quot;.

Giuliani was believed to be a likely pick for secretary of state in the Trump administration. However, on December 9, 2016, Trump announced that Giuliani had removed his name from consideration for any Cabinet post.

==== Advisor to the president ====
The president-elect named Giuliani his informal cybersecurity adviser on January 12, 2017. The status of this informal role for Giuliani is unclear because, in November 2018, Trump created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), headed by Christopher Krebs as director and Matthew Travis as deputy. In the weeks following his appointment, Giuliani was forced to consult an Apple Store Genius Bar when he &quot;was locked out of his iPhone because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times&quot;, belying his putative expertise in the field.

In January 2017, Giuliani said he advised President Trump in matters relating to Executive Order 13769, which barred citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also suspended the admission of all refugees for 120 days.
Giuliani has drawn scrutiny over his ties to foreign nations, regarding not registering per the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).

==== Personal lawyer ====

In mid April 2018, Giuliani joined Trump&#x27;s legal team, which dealt with the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. Giuliani said his goal was to negotiate a swift end to the investigation.

In early May, Giuliani made public that Trump had reimbursed his personal attorney Michael Cohen $130,000 that Cohen had paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels for her agreement not to talk about her alleged affair with Trump. Cohen had earlier insisted he used his own money to pay Daniels, and he implied that he had not been reimbursed. Trump had previously said he knew nothing about the matter. Within a week, Giuliani said some of his own statements regarding this matter were &quot;more rumor than anything else&quot;.

Later in May 2018, Giuliani, who was asked on whether the promotion of the Spygate conspiracy theory is meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, said the investigators &quot;are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president... it is for public opinion&quot; on whether to &quot;impeach or not impeach&quot; Trump. In June 2018, Giuliani said that a sitting president cannot be indicted: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how you can indict while he&#x27;s in office. No matter what it is. If President Trump shot [then-FBI director] James Comey, he&#x27;d be impeached the next day. Impeach him, and then you can do whatever you want to do to him.&quot;

In June 2018, Giuliani also said Trump should not testify to the special counsel investigation because &quot;our recollection keeps changing&quot;. In early July, Giuliani characterized that Trump had previously asked Comey to &quot;give him [then-national security adviser Michael Flynn] a break&quot;. In mid-August, Giuliani denied making this comment: &quot;What I said was, that is what Comey is saying Trump said.&quot; On August 19 on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Giuliani argued that Trump should not testify to the special counsel investigation because Trump could be &quot;trapped into perjury&quot; just by telling &quot;somebody&#x27;s version of the truth. Not the truth.&quot; Giuliani&#x27;s argument continued: &quot;Truth isn&#x27;t truth.&quot; Giuliani later clarified that he was &quot;referring to the situation where two people make precisely contradictory statements&quot;.

In late July, Giuliani defended Trump by saying &quot;collusion is not a crime&quot; and that Trump had done nothing wrong because he &quot;didn&#x27;t hack&quot; or &quot;pay for the hacking&quot;. He later elaborated that his comments were a &quot;very, very familiar lawyer&#x27;s argument&quot; to &quot;attack the legitimacy of the special counsel investigation&quot;. He also described and denied several supposed allegations that have never been publicly raised, regarding two earlier meetings among Trump campaign officials to set up the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting with Russian citizens. In late August, Giuliani said the June 9, 2016, Trump Tower &quot;meeting was originally for the purpose of getting information about Hillary Clinton&quot;.

Additionally in late July, Giuliani attacked Trump&#x27;s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen as an &quot;incredible liar&quot;, two months after calling Cohen an &quot;honest, honorable lawyer&quot;. In mid-August, Giuliani defended Trump by saying: &quot;The president&#x27;s an honest man.&quot;

It was reported in early September that Giuliani said the White House could and likely would prevent the special counsel investigation from making public certain information in its final report which would be covered by executive privilege. Also according to Giuliani, Trump&#x27;s personal legal team is already preparing a &quot;counter-report&quot; to refute the potential special counsel investigation&#x27;s report.

Giuliani privately urged Trump in 2017 to extradite Fethullah Gülen.

In late 2019, Giuliani represented Venezuelan businessman Alejandro Betancourt, meeting with the Justice Department to ask not to bring charges against him.

In an interview with Olivia Nuzzi in &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Giuliani, who is a Roman Catholic of Italian descent, said: &quot;Don&#x27;t tell me I&#x27;m anti-Semitic if I oppose George Soros... I&#x27;m more of a Jew than Soros is.&quot; George Soros is a Hungarian-born Jew who survived the Holocaust. The Anti-Defamation League replied, &quot;Mr. Giuliani should apologize and retract his comments immediately unless he seeks to dog whistle to hardcore anti-Semites and white supremacists who believe this garbage.&quot;

In the last days of the Trump administration, when White House aides were soliciting fees to lobby for presidential pardons, Giuliani said that while he&#x27;d heard that large fees were being offered, he did not work on clemency cases, saying &quot;I have enough money. I&#x27;m not starving.&quot;

As of February 16, 2021, Giuliani was reportedly not actively involved in any of Trump&#x27;s pending legal cases.

By 2023, Giuliani had reportedly incurred seven-figure legal fees in cases related to Donald Trump and the attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. In April 2023, Giuliani and his lawyer Robert Costello met twice with Trump at Mar-a-Lago to ask him for money. In response, a Trump PAC paid $340,000 toward Giuliani&#x27;s data storage bill.

On February 7, 2024, when Giuliani appeared in court to discuss his bankruptcy case, he told a U.S. Trustee attorney that he was owed about $2 million by the Trump campaign and the RNC. He said the Trump campaign &quot;just paid the expenses. Not all, but most. They never paid the legal fees.&quot; He said he did not wish to hold Donald Trump personally responsible for this bill. On July 12, 2024, his bankruptcy case was dismissed, and he was not allowed to file for bankruptcy again for one year.

=== Attempts to get Ukraine to carry out investigations ===

Since at least May 2019, Giuliani has been urging Ukraine&#x27;s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate the oil company Burisma, whose board of directors once included Joe Biden&#x27;s son Hunter Biden, and to check for irregularities in Ukraine&#x27;s investigation of Paul Manafort. He said such investigations would benefit his client&#x27;s defense, and that his efforts had Trump&#x27;s full support. Toward this end, Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials throughout 2019. In July 2019, &quot;Buzzfeed News&quot; reported that two Soviet-born Americans, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were liaisons between Giuliani and Ukrainian government officials in this effort. Parnas and Fruman, prolific Republican donors, have neither registered as foreign agents in the United States, nor been evaluated and approved by the State Department. Giuliani responded, &quot;This (report) is a pathetic effort to cover up what are enormous allegations of criminality by the Biden family.&quot; Yet by September 2019, there had been no clear evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens.

As of October 1, 2019, Giuliani hired former Watergate prosecutor Jon Sale to represent him in the House Intelligence Committee&#x27;s impeachment investigation. The committee also issued a subpoena to Giuliani asking him to release documents related to the Ukraine scandal. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on October 11, 2019, that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, which Giuliani had once led, was investigating him for violating lobbying laws related to his activities in Ukraine. The following month, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that the investigation could extend to bribery of foreign officials or conspiracy, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported Giuliani was being investigated for a possible profit motive in a Ukrainian natural gas venture. Giuliani has denied having any interest in a Ukrainian natural gas venture. In late November, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that federal prosecutors had just issued subpoenas to multiple associates of Giuliani to potentially investigate certain individuals, apparently including Giuliani, on numerous potential charges, including money laundering, obstruction of justice, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements to the federal government, and mail/wire fraud.

Parnas and Fruman were arrested for campaign finance violations while attempting to board a one-way flight to Frankfurt from Washington Dulles International Airport on October 9, 2019. Giuliani was paid $500,000 to consult for Lev Parnas&#x27;s company named &quot;Fraud Guarantee&quot;. Republican donor and Trump supporter Long Island attorney Charles Gucciardo paid Giuliani on behalf of Fraud Guarantee in two $250,000 payments, in September and October 2018. Fruman eventually pled guilty in September 2021 to having solicited a contribution by a foreign national.

In May 2019, Giuliani described Ukraine&#x27;s chief prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko as a &quot;much more honest guy&quot; than his predecessor, Viktor Shokin. After Lutsenko was removed from office, he said in September 2019 that he found no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, and that he had met Giuliani about ten times. Giuliani then reversed his stance, saying that Shokin is the one people &quot;should have spoken to&quot;, while Lutsenko acted &quot;corruptly&quot; and &quot;is exactly the prosecutor that Joe Biden put order to tank the case&quot;.

In September 2019, as reports surfaced that a whistleblower was alleging high-level misconduct related to Ukraine, Giuliani went on CNN to discuss the story. When asked if he had tried to get Ukrainian officials to investigate Biden, he initially replied &quot;No, actually I didn&#x27;t&quot;, but thirty seconds later said, &quot;Of course I did&quot;. In a later tweet he seemed to confirm reports that Trump had withheld military assistance funds scheduled for Ukraine unless they carried out the investigation. He said, &quot;The reality is that the president of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you&#x27;re so damn corrupt that you can&#x27;t investigate allegationsour money is going to get squandered.&quot;

Tom Bossert, a former Homeland Security Advisor in the Trump administration, described Giuliani&#x27;s theory that Ukraine was involved in 2016 U.S. election interference as &quot;debunked&quot;; Giuliani responded that Bossert &quot;doesn&#x27;t know what the hell he&#x27;s talking about&quot;.

On September 30, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee issued a subpoena to Giuliani asking him to release documents concerning the Ukraine scandal to Committee members by October 15, 2019. On October 2, 2019, Steve Linick, the State Department&#x27;s inspector general, delivered a 40-page packet of apparent disinformation regarding former vice president Joe Biden and former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, to Capitol Hill. Linick told congressional aides his office questioned Ulrich Brechbuhl, Pompeo&#x27;s advisor about the origins of the packet. Brechbuhl noted the packet came to him from Pompeo, who said it &quot;came over&quot;, and Brechbuhl reportedly presumed it was from the White House. Later that day, Giuliani acknowledged he passed the packet to Pompeo regarding Ukraine and attacks on Yovanovitch. In a November 2019 interview he confirmed that he had &quot;needed Yovanovitch out of the way&quot; because she was going to make his investigations difficult. &quot;They (the State Department) told me they would investigate it,&quot; Giuliani added. Giuliani persuaded Trump to remove Yovanovitch from office in spring 2019. By April 2021, the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office in Manhattan was investigating the role of Giuliani and his associates in Yovanovitch&#x27;s removal.

U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that Trump delegated American foreign policy on Ukraine to Giuliani. The late 2019 impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump centered around Giuliani&#x27;s actions involving Ukraine. In the compiled testimony and in the December reports of the House Intelligence Committee, Giuliani&#x27;s name was mentioned more than any but Trump&#x27;s. Some experts suggested that Giuliani may have violated the Logan Act.

On November 22, 2019, Giuliani sent a letter to Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, informing him of at least three witnesses from Ukraine who Giuliani said had direct oral, documentary, and recorded evidence of Democratic criminal conspiracy with Ukrainians to prevent Trump&#x27;s election and, after his election, to remove him from office via contrived charges. Giuliani&#x27;s letter also claims that the witnesses had evidence of the Biden family&#x27;s involvement in bribery, money laundering, Hobbs Act extortion, and other possible crimes. The letter sought Graham&#x27;s help obtaining U.S. visas for the witnesses to testify. The next month, Graham invited Giuliani to share his findings with the Judiciary Committee, and soon advised him &quot;to share what he got from Ukraine with the [intelligence community] to make sure it&#x27;s not Russia propaganda&quot;.

Dmytry Firtash is a Ukrainian oligarch who is prominent in the natural gas sector. In 2017, the Justice Department characterized him as being an &quot;upper echelon (associate) of Russian organized crime&quot;. Since his 2014 arrest in Vienna, Austria, at the request of American authorities, he has been living there on $155 million bail while fighting extradition to the United States on bribery and racketeering charges, and has been seeking to have the charges dropped. Firtash&#x27;s attorneys obtained a September 2019 statement from Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was forced out under pressure from multiple countries and non-governmental organizations, as conveyed to Ukraine by Joe Biden. Shokin falsely asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into Burisma. Giuliani, who asserts he has &quot;nothing to do with&quot; and has &quot;never met or talked to&quot; Firtash, promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Giuliani told CNN he met with a Firtash attorney for two hours in New York City at the time he was seeking information about the Bidens.

Firtash is represented by Trump and Giuliani associates Joseph diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, having hired them on Parnas&#x27;s recommendation in July 2019. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in November 2019 that Giuliani had directed Parnas to approach Firtash with the recommendation, with the proposition that Firtash could help provide damaging information on Biden, which Parnas&#x27; attorney described was &quot;part of any potential resolution to [Firtash&#x27;s] extradition matter&quot;. Shokin&#x27;s statement notes that it was prepared &quot;at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash (&#x27;DF&#x27;), for use in legal proceedings in Austria&quot;. Giuliani presented the Shokin statement during American television appearances. &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported on October 18 that during the summer of 2019 Firtash associates began attempting to dig up dirt on the Bidens in an effort to solicit Giuliani&#x27;s assistance with Firtash&#x27;s legal matters. &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; also reported that its sources told them Giuliani&#x27;s high-profile publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political &quot;quid pro quo&quot;. diGenova has said he has known U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr for thirty years, as they both worked in the Reagan Justice Department. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on October 22 that after they began representing Firtash, Toensing and diGenova secured a rare face-to-face meeting with Barr to argue the Firtash charges should be dropped, but he declined to intervene.

On October 18, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that weeks earlier, before his associates Parnas and Fruman were indicted, Giuliani met with officials with the criminal and fraud divisions of the Justice Department regarding what Giuliani characterized as a &quot;very, very sensitive&quot; foreign bribery case involving a client of his. The &quot;Times&quot; did not name whom the case involved, but shortly after publication of the story Giuliani told a reporter it was not Firtash. Two days later, the Justice Department said its officials would not have met with Giuliani had they known his associates were under investigation by the SDNY.

On December 3, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee&#x27;s report included phone records acquired via subpoenas, including numerous phone calls made by Giuliani between April and August 2019. Calls involved Giuliani in contact with Kurt Volker, Republican representative and House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, Lev Parnas, numbers associated with the Office of Management and Budget and the White House switchboard, and an unidentified White House official whose phone number is referenced as &quot;-1&quot;. Chairman Adam Schiff of the House Intelligence Committee announced after the report&#x27;s release that his committee was investigating whether &quot;-1&quot; referred to President Trump, citing grand jury evidence from the trial of convicted Trump-associate Roger Stone in which the phone number &quot;-1&quot; was shown to have referred to Trump. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, analyst Philip Bump reasoned that Giuliani&#x27;s calls with &quot;-1&quot; are &#x27;likely&#x27; calls with Trump citing that Giuliani speaks longer with &quot;-1&quot; than any other person, &quot;-1&quot; always calls Giuliani, and generally after Giuliani calls the White House switchboard, and timing of some of President Trump&#x27;s actions shortly after Giuliani&#x27;s calls with &quot;-1&quot; ended.

In early December 2019, while the House Judiciary Committee began holding public hearings for the impeachment inquiry, Giuliani returned to Ukraine to interview former Ukrainian officials for a documentary series seeking to discredit the impeachment proceedings. U.S. officials told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Giuliani would have been considered a target of Russian intelligence efforts from early in Trump&#x27;s presidency, and particularly after Giuliani turned his focus to Ukrainea former Soviet republic under attack from Russia and with deep penetration by Russian intelligence services. Analysts say Trump&#x27;s and Giuliani&#x27;s habit of communicating over unencrypted lines makes it highly likely that foreign intelligence agencies could be listening in on the president&#x27;s unsecured calls with Giuliani; and that foreign intelligence agencies often collect intelligence about a primary target through monitoring communications of other people who interact with that target.

&quot;NBC News&quot; reported in December 2020 that SDNY investigators, which were reported in late 2019 to be investigating Giuliani&#x27;s activities, had discussed with Justice Department officials in Washington the possibility of acquiring Giuliani&#x27;s emails, which might require headquarters approval due to protection by attorney–client privilege. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in February 2021 that the SDNY had requested a search warrant of Giuliani&#x27;s electronic records in summer 2020, but were met with resistance from high-level political appointees in the Washington headquarters, ostensibly because the election was near, while career officials were supportive of the search warrant. The Justice Department generally avoids taking significant actions relating to political figures that might become public within sixty days of an election. Senior political appointees nevertheless opposed the effort after the election, noting Giuliani played a leading role in challenging the election results. The officials deferred the matter to the incoming Biden administration.

Federal investigators in Manhattan executed search warrants on the early morning of April 28, 2021, at Giuliani&#x27;s office and Upper East Side apartment, seizing his electronic devices and searching the apartment. FBI agents also executed a search warrant that day on Toensing&#x27;s Washington, D.C.-area home and confiscated her cellphone. In April 2021, Giuliani&#x27;s attorney said investigators told him they had searched his client&#x27;s iCloud account beginning in late 2019, later arguing to a judge that the search was illegal and so the subsequent raid on Giuliani&#x27;s properties was &quot;fruit of this poisoned tree,&quot; demanding to review documents justifying the iCloud search. In May 2021, the SDNY confirmed in a court filing that in late 2019 it obtained search warrants for Giuliani&#x27;s iCloud account, and that of Toensing, as part of &quot;an ongoing, multi-year grand jury investigation into conduct involving Giuliani, Toensing, and others,&quot; and argued that attorneys for Giuliani and Toensing were not entitled to review the underlying documents of the warrants prior to any charges. Giuliani and Toensing asserted their attorney-client privilege with clients may have been violated by the iCloud searches, which investigators disputed, saying they employed a &quot;filter team&quot; to prevent them from seeing information potentially protected by attorney-client privilege. Federal judge J. Paul Oetken days later ruled in favor of investigators regarding the warrant documents and granted their request for a special master to ensure attorney-client privilege was maintained. The special master released more than 3,000 of Giuliani&#x27;s communications to prosecutors in January 2022, agreeing to withhold forty messages for which Giuliani had asserted &quot;privilege and/or highly personal&quot; status and rejecting 37 such assertions.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in February 2021 that the SDNY was scrutinizing Giuliani&#x27;s association with Firtash in efforts to discredit the Bidens, and efforts to lobby the Trump administration on behalf of Ukrainian officials and oligarchs. &quot;Time&quot; reported in May 2021 it had spoken with three unidentified witnesses who said they were questioned by investigators, two of whom said they had worked with Giuliani while cooperating with investigators; one witness said investigators were particularly interested in Giuliani&#x27;s association with Firtash.

United States intelligence community analysis released in March 2021 found that Ukrainian politician Andrii Derkach was among proxies of Russian intelligence who promoted and laundered misleading or unsubstantiated narratives about Biden &quot;to US media organizations, US officials, and prominent US individuals, including some close to former President Trump and his administration&quot;. Giuliani met with Derkach in December 2019.

In April 2021, &quot;Forensic News&quot; reported that the SDNY investigation into Giuliani had expanded to include a criminal probe of Derkach and Andrii Artemenko. &quot;The New York Times&quot; confirmed weeks later that Derkach was the subject of a criminal investigation into foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections. &quot;Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have been investigating whether several Ukrainian officials helped orchestrate a wide-ranging plan to meddle in the 2020 presidential campaign, including using Rudolph W. Giuliani to spread their misleading claims about President Biden and tilt the election in Donald J. Trump&#x27;s favor&quot;, the &quot;Times&quot; reported.

On June 8, 2021, CNN uncovered exclusive audio of a 2019 phone call from Giuliani to Ukraine, stating that &quot;Rudy Giuliani relentlessly pressured and coaxed the Ukrainian government in 2019 to investigate baseless conspiracies about then-candidate Joe Biden.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in August 2022 that SDNY was unlikely to indict Giuliani for his activities in Ukraine. Prosecutors confirmed this in a court filing three months later.

=== 2020 election lawsuits===
In November 2020, Trump placed Giuliani in charge of lawsuits related to alleged voter irregularities in the 2020 United States presidential election. On November 7, Giuliani gave a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia to discuss challenging the vote count in Pennsylvania, during which media networks called the presidential election for Biden. Trump designated Giuliani to lead a legal team to challenge the election results, telling Giuliani to &quot;go wild&quot; and &quot;do anything you want&quot; in his efforts to overturn them. This teama self-described &quot;elite strike force&quot; that included Sidney Powell, Joseph diGenova, Victoria Toensing, and Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellisappeared at a November 19 press conference in which they made numerous false and unsubstantiated assertions revolving around an international Communist conspiracy, rigged voting machines, and polling place fraud.

Giuliani repeatedly publicly denounced the use of provisional ballots (in which the poll worker does not see the voter&#x27;s name on the rolls, so the voter swears an affidavit oath that they are registered to vote), arguing that the practice enables fraud, although Giuliani himself had cast this type of ballot on October 31, 2020, in Manhattan.

By January 8, 2021, Trump and his team had lost 63 lawsuits. Giuliani&#x27;s associate Maria Ryan sent a letter to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows requesting that Giuliani be paid $2.5 million and receive a &quot;general pardon&quot;. A month later, when Trump was out of office, Giuliani was no longer representing him in any pending cases, according to a Trump adviser. While Trump continued to fundraise, purportedly for his election-related legal fights, as of the end of July 2021 he had not given any of this money to Giuliani. In October 2021, in another context, Trump remarked: &quot;I do pay my lawyers when they do a good job.&quot;

==== Pennsylvania lawsuit ====
One early lawsuit sought to invalidate up to 700,000 mail-in ballots and stop Pennsylvania from certifying its election results. Giuliani said he had signed affidavits attesting to voter fraud and election official misconduct in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. Despite not having argued a case in any courtroom for over three decades, Giuliani applied for special permission to represent the Trump presidential campaign in the federal court of Pennsylvania. In doing so, Giuliani misrepresented his status with the District of Columbia Bar in his application by stating that he was a member of the bar in good standing, when in fact the District of Columbia had suspended him for nonpayment of fees. In his first day in court on the case, which was November 17, 2020, Giuliani struggled with rudimentary legal processes and was accused by lawyers for the Pennsylvania Secretary of State of making legal arguments that were &quot;disgraceful in an American courtroom&quot;. Judge Matthew Brann questioned how Giuliani could justify &quot;asking this court to invalidate some 6.8 million votes thereby disenfranchising every single voter in the commonwealth.&quot;

His federal lawsuit against Pennsylvania was dismissed with prejudice on November 21, 2020, with the judge citing &quot;strained legal arguments without merit and speculative accusations&quot; which were &quot;unsupported by evidence&quot;. Giuliani and Jenna Ellis reacted by stating that the ruling &quot;helps&quot; the Trump campaign &quot;get expeditiously to the U.S. Supreme Court&quot;. They also pointed out that the judge, Matthew W. Brann, was &quot;Obama-appointed&quot;, though Brann is also a Republican and a former member of the right-leaning Federalist Society.

The Trump campaign appealed the lawsuit to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel on November 27 rejected the Trump campaign&#x27;s attempt to undo Pennsylvania&#x27;s vote certification, because the Trump campaign&#x27;s &quot;claims have no merit&quot;. The panel also ruled that the District Court was correct in preventing the Trump campaign from conducting a second amendment of its complaint. An amendment would be pointless, ruled the judges, because the Trump campaign was not bringing facts before the court, and not even alleging fraud. Judge Stephanos Bibas highlighted that Giuliani himself told the district court that the Trump campaign &quot;doesn&#x27;t plead fraud&quot;, and that this &quot;is not a fraud case&quot;. The panel concluded that neither &quot;specific allegations&quot; nor &quot;proof&quot; was provided in this case, and that the Trump campaign &quot;cannot win this lawsuit&quot;.

Giuliani and Ellis reacted to the appeals court ruling by condemning the &quot;activist judicial machinery in Pennsylvania&quot;. Of the three Appeal Court judges, Stephanos Bibas, who delivered the opinion, was appointed by Trump himself, while judges D. Brooks Smith and Michael Chagares were appointed by Republican president George W. Bush.

==== Dominion and Smartmatic lawsuits ====

As part of Giuliani&#x27;s allegations that voting machines had been rigged, he made several false assertions about two rival companies, Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic. These false claims included that Smartmatic owned Dominion; that Dominion voting machines used Smartmatic software; that Dominion voting machines sent vote data to Smartmatic at foreign locations; that Dominion was founded by the former socialist Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez; and that Dominion is a &quot;radical-left&quot; company with connections to antifa.

Both companies sued Giuliani and Fox News. Dominion filed a defamation lawsuit against Giuliani in January 2021, and separately sued Fox News for $1.6 billion. Fox News settled the case, &quot;Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network&quot;, for $787.5 million; the company&#x27;s lawsuits against Giuliani and Sidney Powell for their election-related lies are still active .

On February 4, 2021, Smartmatic sued Giuliani, Fox News and some of its hosts, and Powell, accusing them of engaging in a &quot;disinformation campaign&quot; against the company; the company sought $2.7billion in damages. A New York State Supreme Court judge, in March 2022, denied the defendants&#x27; motion to dismiss, ruling that the Smartmatic&#x27;s defamation suit against Fox News and Giuliani could proceed; however, the court dismissed two of the sixteen counts against Giuliani. In February 2023, the Appellate Division reinstated the two counts.

On September 10, 2021, Fox News told Giuliani that neither he nor his son Andrew would be allowed on their network for nearly three months.

====Judgment for defaming Georgia election workers ====
In December 2021, two Georgia election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea&#x27; ArShaye Moss, sued Giuliani in DC for defamation, after Giuliani falsely accused them of manipulating vote tallies. He has accused them of &quot;passing around USB ports as if they were vials of heroin or cocaine&quot; and engaging in &quot;surreptitious illegal activity,&quot; citing video footage that, according to Moss, actually showed the women with &quot;a ginger mint&quot;. Moss testified before the U.S. House of Representatives that after Giuliani&#x27;s remarks she and her family were subjected to a barrage of racist threats, including &quot;Be glad it&#x27;s 2020 and not 1920,&quot; in reference to lynching in the United States.

In July 2023, Giuliani was ordered to pay attorneys&#x27; fees to the election workers after being sanctioned for failing to turn over evidence in the case. Later that month, Giuliani admitted his statements had been &quot;defamatory per se&quot; yet denied they had caused &quot;any damages&quot;. On August 4, the judge asked him to explain why he was still fighting the lawsuit, given his admission. Due to his failure to produce documents, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell issued an order on August 30 ruling that he forfeited his case by failing to comply with his discovery obligations. Meanwhile, the court increased what he owed for the plaintiffs&#x27; legal fees, and he did not immediately pay. The plaintiffs subsequently requested money to cover additional attorneys&#x27; fees that arose from discovery disputes during the case. The judge again increased what Giuliani owed; the total was over $230,000.

On October 13, the judge said that due to Giuliani&#x27;s &quot;continued and flagrant disregard of this Court&#x27;s August 30 order that he produce financial-related documents concerning his personal and his businesses&#x27; past and present assets&quot;, she would tell the jurors that he intentionally hid financial documents in defiance of court orders. On December 5, 2023, Giuliani did not appear at a federal court pretrial hearing. Freeman and Moss attended. Giuliani&#x27;s lawyer, Joseph Sibley IV, told the judge he had not understood that Giuliani&#x27;s presence was required and that it was &quot;my mistake&quot;; the judge criticized Giuliani&#x27;s failure to appear.

The trial began on December 11. During the trial on the amount of damages, the plaintiffs&#x27; testified that Giuliani&#x27;s false statements, beginning with one of his tweets, prompted a barrage of threatening phone calls and messages against them, including many that were violent, vulgar, or racist. They also testified that Giuliani&#x27;s lies caused others to show up at Freeman&#x27;s home, to attempt to conduct a &quot;citizen&#x27;s arrest&quot; of Moss at her grandmother&#x27;s home, and to barrage Moss&#x27; teenage son with cell phone messages. During the trial, Giuliani publicly repeated his false claim that Freeman and Moss &quot;were engaged in changing votes&quot; and claimed that &quot;When I testify, the whole story will be definitively clear that what I said was true.&quot; However, Giuliani ultimately declined to testify, and his defense team called no witnesses. Giuliani&#x27;s attorney pointed to another defamation lawsuit Freeman and Moss had filed against &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;, saying the website had likely instigated the harassment against them.

On December 15, 2023, the federal jury ordered Giuliani to pay $148 million to Freeman and Moss, including $75 million in punitive damages. After the verdict, Giuliani said he regretted nothing and said he would appeal. One of his lawyers suggested he would file for bankruptcy. On December 20, concerned that Giuliani would hide his assets given the &quot;ample record in this case of Giuliani’s efforts to conceal or hide his assets,&quot; Judge Beryl A. Howell ordered swift payment of the damages. On December 21, he filed for bankruptcy.

On December 18, Freeman and Moss sued Giuliani again, seeking an injunction to permanently prohibit him from defaming them. They later agreed to drop this lawsuit in exchange for Giuliani&#x27;s promise never again to state, imply, or assist others&#x27; remarks that they &quot;engaged in wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election&quot;.

In January 2024, Freeman and Moss accused Giuliani of taking unfair advantage of the bankruptcy system in a court filing, with their attorneys calling Giuliani&#x27;s approach &quot;a flawed, impermissible litigation tactic from an actor with a history of engaging the judicial system in bad faith.&quot; In February, Giuliani testified about his finances. In March, creditors filed a motion to force him to sell his Florida condo to pay the judgment. In April, he lost his bid to dismiss the judgment against him. A bankruptcy court hearing was set for July 10 to address his creditors&#x27; request to put his funds under the control of an independent trustee so they could begin to collect what they were owed. On July 12, the judge, citing Giuliani&#x27;s lack of transparency over the previous six months of litigation, said he was no longer entitled to bankruptcy protection. On July 31, Giuliani and his creditors revised their agreement.

On October 22, a federal judge in Manhattan ordered Giuliani to turn over his $6 million Manhattan penthouse apartment and other valuable possessions to Freeman and Moss. Giuliani may also need to surrender his $3.5 million primary residence in Palm Beach, Florida. On October 29, Giuliani told the court that his valuables were “being held for wherever Plaintiffs request.” On October 31, Freeman and Moss visited Giuliani’s apartment so they could see the property inside, as they needed to assess how they would move and store it. They discovered that, four weeks earlier, the apartment had been emptied of &quot;the vast majority (if not all) of the valuable receivership property that was known to be stored there,&quot; a fact that, as they told the court, &quot;neither Defendant nor Defendant’s counsel had bothered to mention.&quot; Giuliani&#x27;s lawyers told them that some unspecified property was in a storage facility on Long Island and that his vintage Mercedes (formerly owned by Lauren Bacall) was somewhere in Florida. Additionally, Giuliani’s lawyers provided bank statements showing that a large amount of money had been transferred out of his bank account in July and August and that less than $4,000 remained in the account.

At an in-person hearing on November 7, Giuliani&#x27;s lawyer proposed that the Mercedes might be worth under $4,000, meaning that Giuliani would be allowed to keep it. Giuliani claimed he had no idea of the whereabouts of his other valuables. The judge gave Giuliani until November 15 to turn over his property to the plaintiffs. Two days before that deadline, lawyers Kenneth Caruso and David Labowsky told the judge they did not want to represent Giuliani anymore, and Freeman and Moss learned that the Long Island storage unit contained 20 pallets of moving boxes and furniture. Lawyer Joseph Cammarata took on Giuliani&#x27;s case and told the court on November 15 that he had turned over the Mercedes (but not the title to it), 18 watches, a diamond ring, and had begun a process to turn over $30,000 in cash. A week later, the cash had still not arrived, and Freeman and Moss still did not have the keys to his apartment.

On November 18, Freeman and Moss began to inventory the Long Island storage unit, and Giuliani’s lawyer Joseph Cammarata held a press conference outside the offices of Freeman and Moss&#x27;s lawyers in New York City. On November 22, Freeman and Moss told U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman there had been attempts to &quot;intimidate or interfere&quot; with their access to the storage unit and that it was taking the form of a social media campaign against them.

Giuliani&#x27;s appeal was docketed on November 22. 

At a court hearing on November 26, plaintiffs said that Giuliani had yet to turn over nine additional watches. Giuliani said he had been unable to obtain a copy of the title to the Mercedes.

Giuliani was ruled in contempt by Liman at a hearing on January 3, 2025. On January 10, Howell also found him in contempt for refusing to turn over financial records. She had delayed his civil contempt hearing by one month given his difficulties finding legal representation.

On January 16, the day of a scheduled trial before Liman to enforce payment, the parties settled. Giuliani kept his homes in exchange for compensating Freeman and Moss with an undisclosed amount of money and agreeing to refrain from defaming them again.

===Attack on the Capitol ===

On January 6, 2021, Giuliani spoke at the &quot;Save America March&quot; rally on the Ellipse that was attended by Trump supporters protesting the election results. He repeated conspiracy theories that voting machines used in the election were &quot;crooked&quot; and called for &quot;trial by combat&quot;, which he claimed after the riot had not been a call to violence but a reference to &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;. Trump supporters subsequently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a riot that resulted in the deaths of four people, and temporarily disrupted the counting of the Electoral College vote.

Giuliani had reportedly called Republican lawmakers to urge them to delay the electoral vote count with the intention of throwing the election to Trump. Giuliani attempted to contact Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, a Trump ally, around 7p.m. following the Capitol storming, planning to ask him to &quot;try to just slow it down&quot; by objecting to multiple states and &quot;raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrowideally until the end of tomorrow&quot;. However, Giuliani mistakenly left the message on the voicemail of another senator, who leaked the recording to &quot;The Dispatch&quot;. Rick Perlstein, a noted historian of the American conservative political movement, termed Giuliani&#x27;s effort as treasonous: &quot;Sedition. Open and shut. He talked about the time that was being opened up. He was welcoming, and using, the violence. This needs to be investigated,&quot; Perlstein tweeted days after the riot.

Giuliani faced criticism for his appearance at the rally and the Capitol riot that followed it. Former Congressman and MSNBC host Joe Scarborough called for the arrest of Giuliani, President Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. Manhattan College president Brennan O&#x27;Donnell stated in a January7 open letter to the college community, &quot;one of the loudest voices fueling the anger, hatred, and violence that spilled out yesterday is a graduate of our College, Rudolph Giuliani. His conduct as a leader of the campaign to de-legitimize the election and disenfranchise millions of votershas been and continues to be a repudiation of the deepest values of his alma mater.&quot;

On January 11, the New York State Bar Association, an advocacy group for the legal profession in New York state, announced that it was launching an investigation into whether Giuliani should be removed from its membership rolls, noting both Giuliani&#x27;s comments to the Trump supporter rally at the Ellipse on January 6, and that it &quot;has received hundreds of complaints in recent months about Mr. Giuliani and his baseless efforts on behalf of President Trump to cast doubt on the veracity of the 2020 presidential election and, after the votes were cast, to overturn its legitimate results&quot;. Removal from the group&#x27;s membership rolls would not directly disbar Giuliani from practicing law in New York. New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman and lawyers&#x27; group Lawyers Defending American Democracy, also filed a complaints against Giuliani with the Attorney Grievance Committee of the First Judicial Department of the New York Supreme Court, which has the authority to discipline and disbar licensed New York lawyers.

Also on January 11, 2021, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said that he is looking at whether to charge Giuliani, along with Donald Trump Jr. and Representative Mo Brooks, with inciting the violent attack.

On January 29, 2021, Giuliani said falsely that The Lincoln Project played a role in the organization of the Capitol riot. In response, Steve Schmidt threatened to sue Giuliani for defamation.

On March 5, 2021, Representative Eric Swalwell filed a civil lawsuit against Giuliani and three others (Donald Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Representative Mo Brooks), seeking damages for their alleged role in inciting the Capitol riot.

Responding to a January 2022 subpoena from the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, Giuliani testified on May 20, 2022.

===Indictments===
On August 1, 2023, the Justice Department&#x27;s special counsel investigating Trump&#x27;s efforts to overturn the 2020 election charged Trump with four criminal counts related to those efforts. News reports widely identified Rudy Giuliani as the unnamed &quot;Co-Conspirator 1&quot; (of six) mentioned at least 46 times in the 45-page indictment. In a statement, Giuliani&#x27;s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, acknowledged that it “appears that Mayor Giuliani is alleged to be co-conspirator No. 1.”

On August 14, 2023, Giuliani was indicted, along with Donald Trump and 17 others, by an Atlanta, Georgia, grand jury. The 41-count indictment charged the group of 19 under state racketeering laws for conspiring to &quot;change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump.&quot; Giuliani&#x27;s false testimony, in December 2020, to Georgia lawmakers about election fraud is among the events listed in the indictment. His lawyer (at least for the arraignment) is Brian Tevis. Giuliani turned himself in at the Fulton County Sheriff&#x27;s Office on August 23, 2023. On September 9, he filed to have the charges against him quashed.

In April 2024, Giuliani was also among 18 people who were indicted on charges related to the 2020 election in Arizona. By mid-May, Giuliani was the only defendant yet to be served with a summons to court for this case, with prosecutors stating that they had mailed Giuliani the documents with no response, called Giuliani&#x27;s telephone with no response, and visited his apartment building but were &quot;not granted access&quot;; Giuliani responded: &quot;Arizona officials say they can&#x27;t find Giuliani. So this is perfect evidence that if they&#x27;re so incompetent, they can&#x27;t find me, they also can&#x27;t count votes correctly&quot;. On May 17, during his early 80th birthday celebration, Giuliani posted on social media a photo of himself smiling in a group of people along with balloons, with Giuliani writing: &quot;If Arizona authorities can&#x27;t find me by tomorrow morning; 1. They must dismiss the indictment&quot;; around one hour later, Arizona&#x27;s Attorney General Kris Mayes announced that Giuliani had been successfully served, while Giuliani&#x27;s spokesperson responded by criticizing the &quot;decision to try and embarrass [Giuliani] during his 80th birthday party&quot;. On May 21, 2024, Giuliani and ten other co-defendants pled not guilty after being arraigned in Maricopa County Superior Court. However, Giuliani was among five of these eleven defendants who appeared virtually rather than in-person. The same day, Giuliani was ordered to post a $10,000 bond and was required to book himself into the custody of the Maricopa County Sheriff&#x27;s Office within 30 days as a result of him ducking efforts by the state to serve him with a summons within the past week; In contrast to Giuliani, all of the other ten defendants would be released without bond.

=== Suspension of law license and New York disbarment===
On June 24, 2021, a New York appellate court suspended Giuliani&#x27;s law license. The panel of five justices found that there was &quot;uncontroverted&quot; evidence that Giuliani made &quot;demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public&quot; and that &quot;These false statements were made to improperly bolster (Giuliani&#x27;s) narrative that due to widespread voter fraud, victory in the 2020 United States presidential election was stolen from his client.&quot; The court concluded that Giuliani&#x27;s conduct &quot;immediately threatens the public interest and warrants interim suspension from the practice of law&quot;. His license was also suspended in Washington, D.C., on July 7, 2021.

On July 2, 2024, a New York state appeals court disbarred Giuliani as a result of his efforts to subvert the 2020 election by making false allegations about mass voter fraud.

=== Ethics charges for baseless claims in favor of Trump ===
On June 10, 2022, the DC Bar&#x27;s Office of Disciplinary Counsel filed charges with the DC Court of Appeals&#x27; Board on Professional Responsibility against Giuliani. The ethics charges say that Giuliani&#x27;s federal court filings regarding the 2020 presidential election in Pennsylvania contained baseless claims in favor of Trump.

On December 15, 2022, after a week-long hearing, the D.C. Bar Disciplinary Counsel recommended Giuliani be disbarred for violating rules of professional conduct by making false election fraud claims and trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Pennsylvania. The counsel&#x27;s decision is preliminary and non-binding. On July 7, 2023, an ad hoc hearing committee of the Board on Professional Responsibility recommended that he be disbarred, and on May 31, 2024, the board itself agreed. He was disbarred by the DC Court of Appeals on September 26, 2024.

=== Supermarket incident ===
On June 27, 2022, Giuliani appeared at ShopRite, a supermarket in Staten Island, campaigning on behalf of his son Andrew, who was attempting to become the Republican nominee for governor of New York. After Giuliani&#x27;s appearance, a 39-year-old supermarket employee, Daniel Gill, was arrested and charged with second-degree assault for allegedly slapping Giuliani&#x27;s back in the store. Giuliani responded publicly that it was like &quot;a boulder hit me&quot; or &quot;like somebody shot me&quot;; &quot;it hurt tremendously&quot;. Giuliani further stated that the &quot;very, very heavy shot&quot; by Gill caused him to stumble and &quot;could&#x27;ve easily ... knocked me to the ground and killed me by my head getting hit&quot;, and called for Gill&#x27;s firing and prosecution. The Legal Aid Society, representing Gill, asserted that Giuliani had exaggerated the severity of the slap in order to garner greater amounts of attention from the media: &quot;Our client merely patted Mr. Giuliani, who sustained nothing remotely resembling physical injuries, without malice to simply get his attention, as the video footage clearly showed,&quot; the Legal Aid Society stated in a press release.

Within a day of the incident, &quot;The New York Post&quot; posted video footage of it. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described that the video &quot;contradicted&quot; Giuliani&#x27;s account, showing Gill walking quickly past Giuliani, &quot;patting him on the back&quot;, whereby Giuliani &quot;wobbled slightly forward&quot;. &quot;The Hill&quot; described that the &quot;video shows Giuliani barely moving after a ShopRite employee&#x27;s hand makes contact with his back&quot;, while Giuliani responded that the &quot;videotape that you see is probably a little deceptive&quot;, stressing that he was &quot;hit very, very hard on the back. To such an extent that it knocked me back about two steps.&quot;

After the video was released, Gill&#x27;s charge was reduced to third-degree assault on June 28, while third-degree menacing and second-degree harassment charges were simultaneously added. Gill acknowledged telling Giuliani: &quot;What&#x27;s up, scumbag?&quot; during the incident. In September 2022, Gill agreed to an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, whereby all charges would be dismissed if he does not violate the law in the next six months.

In May 2023, Gill sued Giuliani, seeking monetary damages &quot;for false arrest, civil rights conspiracy resulting in false arrest and false imprisonment, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent infliction of emotional distress&quot;.

=== Sexual assault and misconduct allegations ===
On May 15, 2023, Noelle Dunphy, a former off-the-books employee of Giuliani, filed a civil lawsuit against him. She accused Giuliani of sexual assault, wage theft and unlawful abuse of power. Dunphy claimed that sexually satisfying Giuliani was an &quot;absolute requirement&quot; of her job; the complaint also said that Giuliani &quot;often made outrageous comments that created and added to the hostile work environment that Ms. Dunphy was forced to endure,&quot; and that he was constantly under the effects of alcohol. The lawsuit further alleges Giuliani complained about &quot;&#x27;freakin Arabs&#x27; and Jews,&quot; and &quot;implied that [Jewish men&#x27;s] penises were inferior due to &#x27;natural selection.&#x27;&quot; The lawsuit also alleges that Giuliani and Donald Trump sold pardons for $2 million apiece.

In her 2023 memoir &quot;Enough&quot;, Cassidy Hutchinson says that Giuliani groped her backstage during Donald Trump&#x27;s speech on January 6, 2021.

=== Other legal issues ===
In September 2023, law firm Davidoff Hutcher &amp; Citron sued Giuliani for over $1.3 million in unpaid legal fees. The firm alleged that Giuliani had paid only $214,000 of his total legal bill between November 2019 and July 2023. Giuliani said in a statement that the firm&#x27;s bill &quot;is way in excess to anything approaching legitimate fees.&quot;

Also in September 2023, Hunter Biden filed a civil lawsuit against Giuliani, his companies and attorney Robert Costello, alleging that they had spent years &quot;hacking into, tampering with, manipulating, copying, disseminating, and generally obsessing over data that they were given that was taken or stolen from&quot; his personal devices and caused &quot;total annihilation&quot; of his digital privacy. Biden dropped the lawsuit in June 2024.

In October 2023, Giuliani filed a defamation lawsuit in New Hampshire against President Joe Biden for referring to him as a &quot;Russian pawn&quot; during a 2020 presidential debate. Giuliani alleged that Biden&#x27;s comments were false and that he had been personally harmed by them. Giuliani did not respond to a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in March 2024. The lawsuit was dismissed in September, with the judge saying that Giuliani had &quot;utterly failed&quot; to carry his burden.

== Other post-mayoral ventures ==

=== Giuliani Partners ===
After leaving the New York City mayor&#x27;s office, Giuliani founded a security consulting business, Giuliani Partners LLC, in 2002, a firm that has been categorized by multiple media outlets as a lobbying entity capitalizing on Giuliani&#x27;s name recognition, and which has been the subject of allegations surrounding staff hired by Giuliani and due to the firm&#x27;s chosen client base. Over five years, Giuliani Partners earned more than $100million.

In June 2007, he stepped down as CEO and chairman of Giuliani Partners, although this action was not made public until December 4, 2007; he maintained his equity interest in the firm. Giuliani subsequently returned to active participation in the firm following the election. In late 2009, Giuliani announced that they had a security consulting contract with Rio de Janeiro, Brazil regarding the 2016 Summer Olympics. He faced criticism in 2012 for advising people once allied with Slobodan Milošević who had lauded Serbian war criminals.
=== Bracewell &amp; Giuliani ===
In 2005, Giuliani joined the law firm of Bracewell &amp; Patterson LLP (renamed Bracewell &amp; Giuliani LLP) as a name partner and basis for the expanding firm&#x27;s new New York office. When he joined the Texas-based firm he brought Marc Mukasey, the son of Attorney General Michael Mukasey, into the firm.

Despite a busy schedule, Giuliani was highly active in the day-to-day business of the law firm, which was a high-profile supplier of legal and lobbying services to the oil, gas, and energy industries. Its aggressive defense of pollution-causing coal-fired power plants threatened to cause political risk for Giuliani, but association with the firm helped Giuliani achieve fund-raising success in Texas. In 2006, Giuliani acted as the lead counsel and lead spokesmen for Bracewell &amp; Giuliani client Purdue Pharma, the makers of OxyContin, during their negotiations with federal prosecutors over charges that the pharmaceutical company misled the public about OxyContin&#x27;s addictive properties. The agreement reached resulted in Purdue Pharma and some of its executives paying $634.5million in fines.

Bracewell &amp; Giuliani represented corporate clients before many U.S. government departments and agencies. Some clients have worked with corporations and foreign governments.

Giuliani left the firm in January 2016, by &quot;amicable agreement&quot;, and the firm was rebranded as Bracewell LLP.

=== Greenberg Traurig ===
In January 2016, Giuliani moved to the law firm Greenberg Traurig, where he served as the global chairman for Greenberg&#x27;s cybersecurity and crisis management group, as well as a senior advisor to the firm&#x27;s executive chairman. He took an unpaid leave of absence in April 2018 when he joined Trump&#x27;s legal defense team. He resigned from the firm on May 9, 2018.

=== Lobbying in Romania ===
In August 2018, Giuliani was retained by Freeh Group International Solutions, a global consulting firm run by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, which paid him a fee to lobby Romanian president Klaus Iohannis to change Romania&#x27;s anti-corruption policy and reduce the role of the National Anticorruption Directorate. Giuliani argued that the anti-corruption efforts had gone too far.

=== Podcast ===
Giuliani launched a podcast, &quot;Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s Common Sense&quot;, in January 2020.

=== Television appearances ===
Giuliani was reportedly revealed to be the first unmasking on the seventh season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, which caused judges Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke to leave the set in disgust. Giuliani actually turned out to be the ninth unmasking as &quot;Jack in the Box&quot; of Team Bad. He mentioned that he partook in this show to do it for his newborn granddaughter. It was during his unmasked performance of George Thorogood&#x27;s &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; when Jeong walked off.

== Personal life ==

=== Marriages and relationships ===
Giuliani married Regina Peruggi, his second cousin, whom he had known since childhood, on October 26, 1968. The marriage was in trouble by the mid-1970s and they agreed to a trial separation in 1975. Peruggi did not accompany him to Washington when he accepted the job in the Attorney General&#x27;s Office. Giuliani met local television personality Donna Hanover sometime in 1982, and they began dating when she was working in Miami. Giuliani filed for legal separation from Peruggi on August 12, 1982. The Giuliani-Peruggi marriage legally ended in two ways: a civil divorce was issued by the end of 1982, while a Roman Catholic church annulment of the marriage was granted at the end of 1983, reportedly because Giuliani had discovered that he and Peruggi were second cousins. Alan Placa, Giuliani&#x27;s best man, later became a priest and helped secure the annulment. Giuliani and Peruggi had no children.

Giuliani married Hanover at St. Monica&#x27;s church in Manhattan on April 15, 1984. They had two children: Andrew and Caroline Rose, who is a filmmaker in the LGBTQ+ community and has described herself as &quot;multiverses apart&quot; from her father.
Giuliani was still married to Hanover in May 1999 when he met Judith Nathan, a sales manager for a pharmaceutical company, at Club Macanudo, an Upper East Side cigar bar. By 1996, Donna Hanover had reverted to her professional name and virtually stopped appearing in public with her husband amid rumors of marital problems. Nathan and Giuliani formed an ongoing relationship. In summer 1999, Giuliani charged the costs for his NYPD security detail to obscure city agencies in order to keep his relationship with Nathan from public scrutiny. The police department began providing Nathan with city-provided chauffeur services in early 2000.

By March 2000, Giuliani had stopped wearing his wedding ring. The appearances that he and Nathan made at functions and events became publicly visible, although they were not mentioned in the press. The &quot;Daily News&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot; both broke news of Giuliani&#x27;s relationship with Nathan in early May 2000. Giuliani first publicly acknowledged her on May 3, 2000, when he said Judith was his &quot;very good friend&quot;.

On May 10, 2000, Giuliani held a press conference to announce that he intended to separate from Hanover. Giuliani had not informed Hanover about his plans before the press conference. This was an omission for which Giuliani was widely criticized. Giuliani then went on to praise Nathan as a &quot;very, very fine woman&quot; and said about Hanover that &quot;over the course of some period of time in many ways, we&#x27;ve grown to live independent and separate lives.&quot; Hours later Hanover said, &quot;I had hoped that we could keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy&#x27;s public life because of his relationship with one staff member,&quot; in reference to another woman who worked on Giuliani&#x27;s staff.

Giuliani moved out of Gracie Mansion by August 2001 and into an apartment with a couple he was friends with. Giuliani filed for divorce from Hanover in October 2000, and a public battle broke out between their representatives. Nathan was barred by court order from entering Gracie Mansion or meeting his children before the divorce was final.

In May 2001, Giuliani&#x27;s attorney revealed that Giuliani was impotent due to prostate cancer treatments and had not had sex with Nathan for the preceding year. &quot;You don&#x27;t get through treatment for cancer and radiation all by yourself,&quot; Giuliani said. &quot;You need people to help you and care for you and support you. And I&#x27;m very fortunate I had a lot of people who did that, but nobody did more to help me than Judith Nathan.&quot; In a court case, Giuliani argued that he planned to introduce Nathan to his children on Father&#x27;s Day 2001 and that Hanover had prevented this visit. Giuliani and Hanover finally settled their divorce case in July 2002 after his mayoralty had ended, with Giuliani paying Hanover a $6.8million settlement and granting her custody of their children. Giuliani married Nathan on May 24, 2003, and gained a stepdaughter, Whitney. It was also Nathan&#x27;s third marriage after two divorces.

By March 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily News&quot; reported that Giuliani had become estranged from both his son Andrew and his daughter Caroline. In September 2024, while endorsing Kamala Harris for the 2024 United States presidential election, Caroline wrote that her relationship with her father was &quot;cartoonishly complicated&quot;, and that &quot;Despite his faults, I love him.&quot;

Nathan filed for divorce from Giuliani on April 4, 2018, after 15 years of marriage. According to an interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Nathan said that &quot;For a variety of reasons that I know as a spouse and a nurse . . . he has become a different man.&quot; The divorce was settled on December 10, 2019.

=== Prostate cancer ===
Giuliani&#x27;s father died at age 73 of prostate cancer at Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in April 1981. Nineteen years later, in April 2000, Giuliani, then aged 55, was diagnosed with prostate cancer following a prostate biopsy, after an elevated screening PSA. Giuliani would go on to make a full recovery, becoming a spokesman for cancer survivors.

=== Religious beliefs ===
Giuliani has declined to comment publicly on his religious practice and beliefs, although he identifies religion as an important part of his life. When asked if he is a practicing Catholic, Giuliani answered, &quot;My religious affiliation, my religious practices and the degree to which I am a good or not-so-good Catholic, I prefer to leave to the priests.&quot;

<doc id="25944" wikidata="Q978825" url="?curid=25944" title="Renaissance dance">
<text>Renaissance dances belong to the broad group of historical dances, specifically those during the Renaissance period. During that period, there was a distinction between country dances and court dances. Court dances required the dancers to be trained and were often for display and entertainment, whereas country dances could be attempted by anyone. At Court, the formal entertainment would often be followed by many hours of country dances which all present could join in. Dances described as country dances such as Chiarantana or Chiaranzana remained popular over a long period – over two centuries in the case of this dance. A Renaissance dance can be likened to a ball.

Knowledge of court dances has survived better than that of country dances as they were collected by dancing masters in manuscripts and later in printed books. The earliest surviving manuscripts that provide detailed dance instructions are from 15th century Italy. The earliest printed dance manuals come from late 16th century France and Italy. The earliest dance descriptions in England come from the Gresley manuscript, 1500, found in the Derbyshire Record Office, D77 B0x 38 pp 51–79. These have been recently published as &quot;Cherwell Thy Wyne (Show your joy): Dances of fifteenth-century England from the Gresley manuscript&quot;. The first printed English source appeared in 1651, the first edition of Playford.

The dances in these manuals are extremely varied in nature. They range from slow, stately &quot;processional&quot; dances (bassadance, pavane, almain) to fast, lively dances (galliard, coranto, canario). The former, in which the dancers&#x27; feet were not raised high off the floor were styled the &quot;dance basse&quot; while energetic dances with leaps and lifts were called the &quot;haute dance&quot;. Queen Elizabeth I enjoyed galliards, and &quot;la spagnoletta&quot; was a court favourite.

Some were choreographed, others were improvised on the spot. One dance for couples, a form of the galliard called volta, involved a rather intimate hold between the man and woman, with the woman being lifted into the air while the couple made a turn. Other dances, such as branles or bransles, were danced by many people in a circle or line.

== Fifteenth-century Italian dance ==
Our knowledge of 15th-century Italian dances comes mainly from the surviving works of three Italian dance masters: Domenico da Piacenza, Antonio Cornazzano and Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro. Their work deals with similar steps and dances, though some evolution can be seen. The main types of dances described are bassa danza and &quot;balletto&quot;. These are the earliest European dances to be well-documented, as we have a reasonable knowledge of the choreographies, steps and music used.

<doc id="25945" wikidata="Q232364" url="?curid=25945" title="Rem Koolhaas">
<text>Remment Lucas Koolhaas (; born 17 November 1944) is a Dutch architect, architectural theorist, urbanist and Professor in Practice of Architecture and Urban Design at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard University. He is often cited as a representative of Deconstructivism and is the author of &quot;Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan&quot;.

He is seen by some as one of the significant architectural thinkers and urbanists of his generation, by others as a self-important iconoclast. In 2000, Rem Koolhaas won the Pritzker Prize. In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; put him in their top 100 of &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Influential People&quot;. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2014.

==Early life and career==
Remment Koolhaas was born on 17 November 1944 in Rotterdam, Netherlands, to Anton Koolhaas (1912–1992) and Selinde Pietertje Roosenburg (born 1920). His father was a novelist, critic, and screenwriter. His maternal grandfather, Dirk Roosenburg (1887–1962), was a modernist architect who worked for Hendrik Petrus Berlage, before opening his own practice. Rem Koolhaas has a brother, Thomas, and a sister, Annabel. His paternal cousin was the architect and urban planner Teun Koolhaas (1940–2007). The family lived consecutively in Rotterdam (until 1946), Amsterdam (1946–1952), Jakarta (1952–1955), and Amsterdam (from 1955).

His father strongly supported the Indonesian cause for autonomy from the colonial Dutch in his writing. When the war of independence was won, he was invited over to run a cultural programme for three years and the family moved to Jakarta in 1952. &quot;It was a very important age for me,&quot; Koolhaas recalls &quot;and I really lived as an Asian.&quot;

In 1969, Koolhaas co-wrote &quot;The White Slave&quot;, a Dutch film noir, and later wrote an unproduced script for American soft-porn king Russ Meyer.

He was a journalist in 1963 at age 19 for the &quot;Haagse Post&quot; before starting studies in architecture in 1968 at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, followed, in 1972, by further studies with Oswald Mathias Ungers at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, followed by studies at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York City.

Koolhaas first came to public and critical attention with OMA (The Office for Metropolitan Architecture), the office he founded in 1975 together with architects Elia Zenghelis, Zoe Zenghelis and (Koolhaas&#x27;s wife) Madelon Vriesendorp in London. They were later joined by one of Koolhaas&#x27;s students, Zaha Hadid – who would soon go on to achieve success in her own right. An early work which would mark their difference from the then dominant postmodern classicism of the late 1970s, was their contribution to the Venice Biennale of 1980, curated by Italian architect Paolo Portoghesi, titled &quot;Presence of the Past&quot;. Each architect had to design a stage-like &quot;frontage&quot; to a Potemkin-type internal street; the façades by , Frank Gehry and OMA were the only ones that did not employ Post-Modern architecture motifs or historical references.

Other early critically received (yet unbuilt) projects included the Parc de la Villette, Paris (1982) and the residence for the Prime Minister of Ireland (1979), as well as the Kunsthal in Rotterdam (1992). These schemes would attempt to put into practice many of the findings Koolhaas made in his book &quot;Delirious New York&quot; (1978), which was written while he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York, directed by Peter Eisenman.

==Architectural theory==

===&quot;Delirious New York&quot;===
Koolhaas&#x27;s book &quot;Delirious New York&quot; set the pace for his career. Koolhaas analyzes the &quot;chance-like&quot; nature of city life: &quot;The City is an addictive machine from which there is no escape&quot; &quot;Rem Koolhaas...defined the city as a collection of &#x27;red hot spots&#x27;.&quot; (Anna Klingmann). As Koolhaas himself has acknowledged, this approach had already been evident in the Japanese Metabolist Movement in the 1960s and early 1970s.

A key aspect of architecture that Koolhaas interrogates is the &quot;Program&quot;: with the rise of modernism in the 20th century the &quot;Program&quot; became the key theme of architectural design. The notion of the Program involves &quot;an act to edit function and human activities&quot; as the pretext of architectural design: epitomised in the maxim form follows function, first popularised by architect Louis Sullivan at the beginning of the 20th century. The notion was first questioned in &quot;Delirious New York&quot;, in his analysis of high-rise architecture in Manhattan. An early design method derived from such thinking was &quot;cross-programming&quot;, introducing unexpected functions in room programmes, such as running tracks in skyscrapers. More recently, Koolhaas unsuccessfully proposed the inclusion of hospital units for the homeless into the Seattle Public Library project (2003).

===Project on the city===
Koolhaas&#x27; next publications were a by-product of his position as professor at Harvard University, in the Design school&#x27;s &quot;Project on the City&quot;; firstly the 720-page &quot;Mutations&quot;, followed by &quot;The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Great Leap Forward&quot; (2002).

All three books published student work analysing what others would regard as &quot;non-cities&quot;, sprawling conglomerates such as Lagos in Nigeria, west Africa, which the authors argue are highly functional despite a lack of infrastructure. The authors also examine the influence of shopping habits and the recent rapid growth of cities in China. Critics of the books have criticised Koolhaas for being cynical, – as if Western capitalism and globalization demolish all cultural identity – highlighted in the notion expounded in the books that &quot;In the end, there will be little else for us to do but shop&quot;. Perhaps such caustic cynicism can be read as a &quot;realism&quot; about the transformation of cultural life, where airports and even museums (due to finance problems) rely just as much on operating gift shops. It does, however, demonstrate one of the architect&#x27;s characteristic devices for deflecting criticism: attack the client or subject of study after completing the work.

When it comes to transforming these observations into practice, Koolhaas mobilizes what he regards as the omnipotent forces of urbanism into unique design forms and connections organised along the lines of present-day society. Koolhaas continuously incorporates his observations of the contemporary city within his design activities: calling such a condition the ‘culture of congestion’. Again, shopping is examined for &quot;intellectual comfort&quot;, whilst the unregulated taste and densification of Chinese cities is analysed according to &quot;performance&quot;, a criterion involving variables with debatable credibility: density, newness, shape, size, money etc.

In 2003, &quot;Content&quot;, a 544-page magazine-style book designed by &amp;&amp;&amp; Creative and published by Koolhaas, gives an overview of the last decade of OMA projects including his designs for the Prada shops, the Seattle Public Library, a plan to save Cambridge from Harvard by rechanneling the Charles River, Lagos&#x27; future as Earth&#x27;s third-biggest city, as well as interviews with Martha Stewart and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown.

===Volume Magazine===
In 2005, Rem Koolhaas co-founded &quot;Volume Magazine&quot; together with Mark Wigley and Ole Bouman. &quot;Volume Magazine&quot; – the collaborative project by Archis (Amsterdam), AMO and C-lab (Columbia University NY) – is a dynamic experimental think tank devoted to the process of spatial and cultural reflexivity. It goes beyond architecture&#x27;s definition of ‘making buildings’ and reaches out for global views on architecture and design, broader attitudes to social structures, and creating environments to live in. The magazine stands for a journalism which detects and anticipates, is proactive and even pre-emptive – a journalism which uncovers potentialities, rather than covering done deals.

==Buildings and projects==
In the late nineties he worked on the design for the new headquarters for Universal.

Indeed, online marketing and propaganda has been a hallmark of OMA&#x27;s rise in the current century. It has also led to pointed criticism, such as the critique by &quot;New York Magazine&quot; critic Justin Davidson, who found the 2020 Guggenheim exhibition &quot;Countryside, the Future&quot; &quot;mildly amusing if it weren’t such terrible waste — of attention, of gallery square footage, of resources, talent, and expertise. Bored with being an architect and building things, Koolhaas lets his fingertips graze important topics, genuine insights, and actual lives. He treats them all as ironic bric-a-brac, meaningless souvenirs of his meanderings through a fragile world. How frustrating that the Guggenheim couldn’t force a little more intellectual rigor on this romp.&quot;

===Architecture, fashion, and theatre===

With his Prada projects, Koolhaas ventured into providing architecture for the fleeting world of fashion and with celebrity-studded cachet: not unlike Garnier&#x27;s Opera, the central space of Koolhaas&#x27; Beverly Hills Prada store is occupied by a massive central staircase, ostensibly displaying select wares, but mainly the shoppers themselves. The notion of selling a brand rather than marketing clothes was further emphasised in the Prada store on Broadway in Manhattan, New York, which had previously been owned by the Guggenheim: the museum signs were not removed during the outfitting of the new store, as if emphasizing the premises as a cultural institution. The Broadway Prada store opened in December 2001, cost €32 million to build, and has 2,300 square meters of retail space.

===21st-century projects===

Probably the most costly and celebrated OMA projects of the new century were the massive Central China Television Headquarters Building in Beijing, China, and the new building for the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

In his design for the new CCTV Headquarters in Beijing (2009), Koolhaas did not opt for the stereotypical skyscraper, often used to symbolise and landmark such government enterprises; he patented a &quot;horizontal skyscraper&quot; in the U.S. The building, popularly called &quot;The Big Pants&quot; by Beijing residents, was designed as a series of volumes which attempt to tie together the numerous departments onto the nebulous site, but also introduce routes (again, the concept of cross-programming) for the general public through the site, allowing them some degree of access to the production procedure. An unfortunate incident that highlighted the folly of the circulation scheme (no effective fire egress for people on the upper floors), was the construction fire that nearly destroyed the building and a nearby hotel in 2009.

In February 2020, his exhibition &quot;Countryside, The Future&quot; opened at the Guggenheim in New York City. The exhibition closed within a month, after New York City closed all its major art institutions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==
Koolhaas was previously married to Madelon Vriesendorp, an artist who is the mother of his two children, Charlie, a photographer, and Tomas, a filmmaker. Koolhaas divorced Vriesendorp in 2012. He has known his current partner Petra Blaisse, an interior and landscape designer, since 1986.
