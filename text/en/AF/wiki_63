<text>Stephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author. Widely known for his horror novels, he has been crowned the &quot;King of Horror&quot;. He has also explored other genres, among them suspense, crime, science-fiction, fantasy, and mystery. Though known primarily for his novels, he has written approximately 200 short stories, most of which have been published in collections. 

His debut, &quot;Carrie&quot; (1974), established him in horror. &quot;Different Seasons&quot; (1982), a collection of four novellas, was his first major departure from the genre. Among the films adapted from King&#x27;s fiction are &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), &quot;The Shining&quot; (1980), &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and &quot;Christine&quot; (both 1983), &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), &quot;Misery&quot; (1990), &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994), &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; (1995), &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999), &quot;The Mist&quot; (2007), and &quot;It&quot; (2017). He has published under the pseudonym Richard Bachman and has co-written works with other authors, notably his friend Peter Straub and sons Joe Hill and Owen King. He has also written nonfiction, notably &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; (1981) and &quot;On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft&quot; (2000).

Among other awards, King has won the O. Henry Award for &quot;The Man in the Black Suit&quot; (1994) and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Prize for Mystery/Thriller for &quot;11/22/63&quot; (2011). He has also won honors for his overall contributions to literature, including the 2003 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the 2007 Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America and the 2014 National Medal of Arts. Joyce Carol Oates called King &quot;a brilliantly rooted, psychologically &#x27;realistic&#x27; writer for whom the American scene has been a continuous source of inspiration, and American popular culture a vast cornucopia of possibilities.&quot;

==Early life and education==
King was born in Portland, Maine, on September 21, 1947. His father, Donald Edwin King, a traveling vacuum salesman after returning from World War II, was born in Indiana with the surname Pollock, changing it to King as an adult. King&#x27;s mother was Nellie Ruth King (née Pillsbury). His parents were married in Scarborough, Maine, on July 23, 1939. They lived with Donald&#x27;s family in Chicago before moving to Croton-on-Hudson, New York. King&#x27;s parents returned to Maine towards the end of World War II, living in a modest house in Scarborough. He is of Scots-Irish descent.

When King was two, his father left the family. His mother raised him and his older brother David by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. They moved from Scarborough and depended on relatives in Chicago, Illinois; Croton-on-Hudson; West De Pere, Wisconsin; Fort Wayne, Indiana; Malden, Massachusetts; and Stratford, Connecticut. When King was 11, his family moved to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. After that, she became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged. 

King says he started writing when he was &quot;about six or seven, just copying panels out of comic books and then making up my own stories ... Film was also a major influence. I loved the movies from the start. So when I started to write, I had a tendency to write in images because that was all I knew at the time.&quot; Regarding his interest in horror, he says &quot;my childhood was pretty ordinary, except from a very early age, I wanted to be scared. I just did.&quot; He recalls showing his mother a story he copied out of a comic book. She responded: &quot;I bet you could do better. Write one of your own.&quot; He recalls &quot;an immense feeling of &quot;possibility&quot; at the idea, as if I had been ushered into a vast building filled with closed doors and had been given the key to open any I liked.&quot; King was a voracious reader in his youth: &quot;I read everything from Nancy Drew to &quot;Psycho&quot;. My favorite was &quot;The Shrinking Man&quot;, by Richard Matheson—I was 8 when I found that.&quot; 

King asked a bookmobile driver, &quot;Do you have any stories about how kids really are?&quot; She gave him &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. It proved formative: &quot;It was, so far as I can remember, the first book with hands—strong ones that reached out of the pages and seized me by the throat. It said to me, &#x27;This is not just entertainment; it&#x27;s life or death.&#x27;... To me, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; has always represented what novels are &quot;for,&quot; why they are indispensable.&quot; He attended Durham Elementary School and entered Lisbon High School in Lisbon Falls, Maine, in 1962. He contributed to &quot;Dave&#x27;s Rag&quot;, the newspaper his brother printed with a mimeograph machine, and later sold stories to his friends. His first independently published story was &quot;I Was a Teenage Grave Robber&quot;, serialized over four issues of the fanzine &quot;Comics Review&quot; in 1965. He was a sports reporter for Lisbon&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Enterprise&quot;.

In 1966, King entered the University of Maine at Orono on a scholarship. While there, he wrote for the student newspaper, &quot;The Maine Campus&quot;, and found mentors in the professors Edward Holmes and Burton Hatlen. King participated in a writing workshop organized by Hatlen, where he fell in love with Tabitha Spruce. King graduated in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English, and his daughter Naomi Rachel was born that year. King and Spruce wed in 1971. King paid tribute to Hatlen: &quot;Burt was the greatest English teacher I ever had. It was he who first showed me the way to the pool, which he called &#x27;the language pool, the myth-pool, where we all go down to drink.&#x27; That was in 1968. I have trod the path that leads there often in the years since, and I can think of no better place to spend one&#x27;s days; the water is still sweet, and the fish still swim.&quot;

==Career==
===Beginnings===

King sold his first professional short story, &quot;The Glass Floor&quot;, to &quot;Startling Mystery Stories&quot; in 1967. After graduating from the University of Maine, King earned a certificate to teach high school but was unable to find a teaching post immediately. He sold short stories to magazines like &quot;Cavalier&quot;. Many of these early stories were republished in &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1978). In 1971, King was hired as an English teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels, including the anti-war novel &quot;Sword in the Darkness&quot;, still unpublished.

=== 1970s: &quot;Carrie&quot; to &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; ===
King recalls the origin of his debut, &quot;Carrie&quot;: &quot;Two unrelated ideas, adolescent cruelty and telekinesis, came together.&quot; It began as a short story intended for &quot;Cavalier&quot;; King tossed the first three pages in the trash but his wife, Tabitha, recovered them, saying she wanted to know what happened next. She told him: &quot;You&#x27;ve got something here. I really think you do.&quot; He followed her advice and expanded it into a novel. Per &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot; &quot;is the story of Carrie White, a high-school student with latent—and then, as the novel progresses, developing—telekinetic powers. It&#x27;s brutal in places, affecting in others (Carrie&#x27;s relationship with her almost hysterically religious mother being a particularly damaged one), and gory in even more.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;King does more than tell a story. He is a schoolteacher himself, and he gets into Carrie&#x27;s mind as well as into the minds of her classmates. He also knows a thing or two about symbolism — blood symbolism especially.&quot;

King was teaching &quot;Dracula&quot; to high school students and wondered what would happen if Old World vampires came to a small New England town. This was the germ of &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, which King called &quot;&quot;Peyton Place&quot; meets &quot;Dracula&quot;&quot;. King&#x27;s mother died from uterine cancer around the time &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; was published. After his mother&#x27;s death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado. He paid a visit to the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park which provided the basis for &quot;The Shining&quot;, about an alcoholic writer and his family taking care of a hotel for the winter. 

King&#x27;s family returned to Auburn, Maine in 1975, where he completed &quot;The Stand&quot;, an apocalyptic novel about a pandemic and its aftermath. King recalls that it was the novel that took him the longest to write, and that it was &quot;also the one my longtime readers still seem to like the best&quot;. In 1977, the Kings, with the addition of Owen Philip, their third and youngest child, traveled briefly to England. They returned to Maine that fall, and King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine. The courses he taught on horror provided the basis for his first nonfiction book, &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;. In 1979, he published &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, about an ordinary man gifted with second sight. It was the first of his novels to take place in Castle Rock, Maine. King later reflected that with &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, &quot;I really hit my stride.&quot;

=== 1980s: &quot;Different Seasons&quot; to &quot;The Dark Half&quot; ===
In 1982, King published &quot;Different Seasons&quot;, a collection of four novellas with a more serious dramatic bent than the horror fiction for which he had become famous. Alan Cheuse wrote &quot;Each of the first three novellas has its hypnotic moments, and the last one is a horrifying little gem.&quot; Three of the four novellas were adapted as films: &quot;The Body&quot; as &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986); &quot;Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption&quot; as &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994); and &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; as the film of the same name (1998). The fourth, &quot;The Breathing Method&quot;, won the British Fantasy Award for Best Short Fiction. King recalls &quot;I got the best reviews in my life. And that was the first time that people thought, woah, this isn&#x27;t really a horror thing.&quot;

King struggled with addiction throughout the decade and often wrote under the influence of cocaine and alcohol; he says he &quot;barely remembers writing&quot; &quot;Cujo&quot;. In 1983, he published &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;A love triangle involving 17-year-old misfit Arnie Cunningham, his new girlfriend and a haunted 1958 Plymouth Fury.&quot; Later that year, he published &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, which he had written in the late 1970s, when his family was living near a highway that &quot;used up a lot of animals&quot; as a neighbor put it. His daughter&#x27;s cat was killed, and they buried it in a pet cemetery built by the local children. King imagined a burial ground beyond it that could raise the dead, albeit imperfectly. He initially found it too disturbing to publish, but resurrected it to fulfill his contract with Doubleday. 

In 1985, King published &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;, a book of short fiction including &quot;The Reach&quot; and &quot;The Mist&quot;. He recalls: &quot;I would be asked, &#x27;What happened in your childhood that makes you want to write those terrible things?&#x27; I couldn&#x27;t think of any real answer to that. And I thought to myself, &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you write a final exam on horror, and put in all the monsters that everyone was afraid of as a kid? Put in Frankenstein, the werewolf, the vampire, the mummy, the giant creatures that ate up New York in the old B movies. Put &#x27;em all in there.&quot; These influences coalesced into &quot;It&quot;, about a shapeshifting monster that takes the form of its victims&#x27; fears and haunts the town of Derry, Maine. He said he thought he was done writing about monsters, and wanted to &quot;bring on all the monsters one last time…and call it It.&quot; &quot;It&quot; won the August Derleth Award in 1987.

1987 was an unusually productive year for King. He published &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, a high fantasy novel which he originally wrote for his daughter. He published &quot;Misery&quot;, about a popular writer who is injured in a car wreck and held captive by Annie Wilkes, his self-described &quot;number-one fan&quot;. &quot;Misery&quot; shared the inaugural Bram Stoker Award with &quot;Swan Song&quot; by Robert R. McCammon. King says the novel was influenced by his experiences with addiction: &quot;Annie was my drug problem, and she was my number-one fan. God, she never wanted to leave.&quot; He published &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;, a science fiction novel filled, he says, with metaphors for addiction. After the book was published, King&#x27;s wife staged an intervention, and he agreed to seek treatment for addiction. Two years later, he published &quot;The Dark Half&quot;, about an author whose literary alter-ego takes on a life of his own. In the author&#x27;s note, King writes that &quot;I am indebted to the late Richard Bachman.&quot;

===1990s: &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot; to &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;===
In 1990, King published &quot;Four Past Midnight&quot;, a collection of four novellas with the common theme of time. In 1991, he published &quot;Needful Things&quot;, his first novel since achieving sobriety, billed as &quot;The Last Castle Rock Story&quot;. In 1992, he published &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, two novels about women loosely linked by a solar eclipse. The latter novel is narrated by the title character in an unbroken monolog; Mark Singer described it as &quot;a morally riveting confession from the earthy mouth of a sixty-six-year-old Maine coastal-island native with a granite-hard life but not a grain of self-pity&quot;. King said he based the character of Claiborne on his mother. 

In 1994, King&#x27;s story &quot;The Man in the Black Suit&quot; was published in the Halloween issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. The story went on to win the 1996 O. Henry Award. In 1996, King published &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; the story of a death row inmate, as a serial novel in six parts. It had the distinction of holding the first, fourth, tenth, twelfth, fourteenth, and fifteenth positions on the &quot;New York Times&quot; paperback-best-seller list at the same time. In 1998, he published &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, his first book with Scribner, about a recently widowed novelist. Several reviewers said that it showed King&#x27;s maturation as a writer; Charles de Lint wrote &quot;He hasn&#x27;t forsaken the spookiness and scares that have made him a brand name, but he uses them more judiciously now... The present-day King has far more insight into the human condition than did his younger self, and better yet, all the skills required to share it with us.&quot; &quot;Bag of Bones&quot; won the Bram Stoker and August Derleth Awards. 

In 1999, he published &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;, about a girl who gets lost in the woods and finds solace in listening to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox games, and &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, a book of linked novellas and short stories about coming of age in the 1960s. Later that year, King was hospitalized after being hit by a van. Reflecting on the incident, he said &quot;it occurs to me that I have nearly been killed by a character out of one of my own novels. It&#x27;s almost funny.&quot; He said his nurses were &quot;told in no uncertain terms, don&#x27;t make any &quot;Misery&quot; jokes&quot;.

=== 2000s: &quot;On Writing&quot; to &quot;Under the Dome&quot; ===
In 2000, King published &quot;On Writing&quot;, a mix of memoir and style manual which &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; called &quot;a one-of-a-kind classic&quot;. Later that year he published &quot;Riding the Bullet&quot;, &quot;the world&#x27;s first mass e-book, with more than 500,000 downloads&quot;. Inspired by its success, he began publishing an epistolary horror novel, &quot;The Plant&quot;, in online installments using the pay what you want method. He suggested readers pay $1 per installment, and said he&#x27;d only continue publishing if 75% of readers paid. When &quot;The Plant&quot; folded, the public assumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later said he had simply run out of stories. The unfinished novel is still available from King&#x27;s official site, now free. 

In 2002, King published &quot;From a Buick 8&quot;, a return to the territory of &quot;Christine&quot;. In 2005, he published the mystery &quot;The Colorado Kid&quot; for the Hard Case Crime imprint. In 2006, he published &quot;Cell,&quot; in which a mysterious signal broadcast over cell phones turns users into mindless killers. That same year, he published &quot;Lisey&#x27;s Story&quot;, about the widow of a novelist. He calls it his favorite of his novels, because &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt that marriage creates its own secret world, and only in a long marriage can two people at least approach real knowledge about each other. I wanted to write about that, and felt that I actually got close to what I really wanted to say.&quot; In 2007, King served as guest editor for the annual anthology &quot;The Best American Short Stories&quot;.

In 2008, King published &quot;Duma Key&quot;, his first novel set in Florida, and the collection &quot;Just After Sunset&quot;. In 2009, it was announced he would serve as a writer for &quot;Fangoria&quot;. King&#x27;s novel &quot;Under the Dome&quot; was published later that year, and debuted at No. 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Bestseller List. Janet Maslin said of it, &quot;Hard as this thing is to hoist, it&#x27;s even harder to put down.&quot;

=== 2010s: &quot;Full Dark, No Stars&quot; to &quot;The Institute&quot; ===
In 2010, King published &quot;Full Dark, No Stars&quot;, a collection of four novellas with the common theme of retribution. In 2011, he published &quot;11/22/63&quot;, about a time portal leading to 1958, and an English teacher who travels through it to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. Errol Morris called it &quot;one of the best time travel stories since H. G. Wells&quot;. In 2013, he published &quot;Joyland&quot;, his second book for Hard Case Crime. Later that year, he published &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Shining.&quot;

During his Chancellor&#x27;s Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King said that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer, with the working title &quot;Mr. Mercedes&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Parade&quot;, he confirmed that the novel was &quot;more or less&quot; completed. It was published in 2014 and won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel. He returned to horror with &quot;Revival&quot;, which he called &quot;a nasty, dark piece of work&quot;. King announced in June 2014 that &quot;Mr. Mercedes&quot; was part of a trilogy; the sequel, &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;, was published in 2015. The third book of the trilogy, &quot;End of Watch&quot;, was released in 2016. In 2018, he released &quot;The Outsider&quot;, which features the character Holly Gibney, and the novella &quot;Elevation&quot;. In 2019, he released &quot;The Institute&quot;. 

=== 2020s: &quot;If It Bleeds&quot; to present ===
In 2020, King released &quot;If It Bleeds&quot;, a collection of four novellas. In 2021, he published &quot;Later&quot;, his third book for Hard Case Crime. In 2022, King released the novel &quot;Fairy Tale&quot;. &quot;Holly&quot;, about Holly Gibney was released in September 2023. In November 2023, the short story collection &quot;You Like It Darker&quot;, featuring twelve stories (seven previously published and five unreleased) was published by Scribner in May 2024. The book debuted at No. 1 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; fiction best-seller list for the week ending May 25, 2024. King announced an upcoming novel named &quot;Never Flinch&quot; on November 18, 2024. The novel is set to release on May 27, 2025.

===Pseudonyms===
King published five short novels—&quot;Rage&quot; (1977), &quot;The Long Walk&quot; (1979), &quot;Roadwork&quot; (1981), &quot;The Running Man&quot; (1982) and &quot;Thinner&quot; (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. He explains: &quot;I did that because back in the early days of my career there was a feeling in the publishing business that one book a year was all the public would accept...eventually the public got wise to this because you can change your name but you can&#x27;t really disguise your style.&quot; Bachman&#x27;s surname is derived from the band Bachman–Turner Overdrive and his first name is a nod to Richard Stark, the pseudonym Donald E. Westlake used to publish his darker work. The Bachman books are grittier than King&#x27;s usual fare; King called his alter-ego &quot;Dark-toned, despairing...not a very nice guy.&quot; A Literary Guild member praised &quot;Thinner&quot; as &quot;what Stephen King would write like if Stephen King could really write.&quot; 

Bachman was exposed as King&#x27;s pseudonym in 1985 by Steve Brown, a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk who noticed stylistic similarities between King and Bachman and located publisher&#x27;s records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of &quot;Rage&quot;. King announced Bachman&#x27;s death from &quot;cancer of the pseudonym&quot;. King reflected that &quot;Richard Bachman began his career not as a delusion but as a sheltered place where I could publish a few early books which I felt readers might like. Then he began to grow and come alive, as the creatures of a writer&#x27;s imagination so frequently do... He took on his own reality, that&#x27;s all, and when his cover was blown, he died.&quot; Originally, King planned &quot;Misery&quot; to be released under the pseudonym before his identity was discovered.

When &quot;Desperation&quot; (1996) was released, the companion novel &quot;The Regulators&quot; was published as a &quot;discovered manuscript&quot; by Bachman. In 2006, King announced that he had discovered another Bachman novel, &quot;Blaze&quot;, which was published the following year. The original manuscript had been held at the University of Maine for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.

King has used other pseudonyms. In 1972, the short story &quot;The Fifth Quarter&quot; was published under the name John Swithen (a &quot;Carrie&quot; character) in &quot;Cavalier&quot;. &quot;Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower&quot; was published in 2016 under the pseudonym Beryl Evans and illustrated by Ned Dameron. It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands&quot;.

=== &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; ===

In the late 1970s, King began a series about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the &quot;Man in Black&quot; in an alternate universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first story, &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger&quot;, was initially published in five installments in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. It grew into an eight-volume epic, &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, published between 1978 and 2012.

==Collaborations==
===Literature===
King co-wrote two novels with Peter Straub, &quot;The Talisman&quot; (1984) and &quot;Black House&quot; (2001). Straub recalls that &quot;We tried to make it as difficult as possible for readers to identify who wrote what. Eventually, we were able to successfully imitate each other&#x27;s style... Steve threw in more commas or clauses, and I kind of made things more simple in sentence structure. And I tried to make things as vivid as I could because Steve is just fabulous at that, and also I tried to write more colloquially.&quot; Straub said the only person who could correctly identify who wrote which passages was a fellow author, Neil Gaiman.

King and the photographer f-stop Fitzgerald collaborated on the coffee table book &quot;Nightmares in the Sky: Gargoyles and Grotesques&quot; (1988). He produced an artist&#x27;s book with designer Barbara Kruger, &quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition. 

King co-wrote &quot;Throttle&quot; (2009) with his son Joe Hill. The novella is an homage to Richard Matheson&#x27;s &quot;Duel&quot;. Their second collaboration, &quot;In the Tall Grass&quot; (2012), was published in two parts in &quot;Esquire&quot;. King and his son Owen co-wrote &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot; (2018), set in a West Virginia women&#x27;s prison. King and Richard Chizmar co-wrote &quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Button Box&quot; (2017). A sequel, &quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Magic Feather&quot; (2019), was a solo effort by Chizmar. In 2022, King and Chizmar rejoined forces for &quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Final Task&quot;.

=== Film and television ===
King made his screenwriting debut with George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982), a tribute to EC horror comics. In 1985, he wrote another horror anthology film, &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot;. Rob Reiner, whose film &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986) is an adaptation of King&#x27;s novella &quot;The Body&quot;, named his production company Castle Rock Entertainment after King&#x27;s fictional town. Castle Rock Entertainment would produce other King adaptations, including Reiner&#x27;s &quot;Misery&quot; (1990) and Frank Darabont&#x27;s &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; (1994).

In 1986, King made his directorial debut with &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot;, an adaptation of his story &quot;Trucks&quot;. He recalls: &quot;I was coked out of my mind all through its production, and really didn&#x27;t know what I was doing.&quot; It was neither a critical nor a commercial success; King was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for Worst Director, but lost to Prince, for &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot;.

In the 1990s, King wrote several miniseries: &quot;Golden Years&quot; (1991), &quot;The Stand&quot; (1994), &quot;The Shining&quot; (1997) and &quot;Storm of the Century&quot; (1999). He wrote the miniseries &quot;Rose Red&quot; (2002); &quot;The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red&quot; (2001) was written by Ridley Pearson and published anonymously as a tie-in for the series. He also developed &quot;Kingdom Hospital&quot; (2004), based on Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;The Kingdom&quot;.

===Music and theater===
King collaborated with Stan Winston and Mick Garris on the music video &quot;Michael Jackson&#x27;s Ghosts&quot; (1996). He co-wrote the musical &quot;Ghost Brothers of Darkland County&quot; (2012) with T. Bone Burnett and John Mellencamp. A soundtrack album was released, featuring Taj Mahal, Elvis Costello and Rosanne Cash, among others.

=== Comics ===
In 1985, King wrote a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book &quot;Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men&quot;. He wrote the introduction to &quot;Batman&quot; No. 400, an anniversary issue where he expressed his preference for the character over Superman. In 2010, DC Comics premiered &quot;American Vampire&quot;, a comic book series co-written by King and Scott Snyder and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque. King wrote the backstory of the first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc.

== Style, themes and influences ==

=== Style ===

In &quot;On Writing&quot;, King recalls:When, during the course of an interview for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, I told the interviewer (Mark Singer) that I believed stories are found things, like fossils in the ground, he said that he didn&#x27;t believe me. I replied that that was fine, as long as he believed that &quot;I&quot; believe it. And I do. Stories aren&#x27;t souvenir tee-shirts or GameBoys. Stories are relics, part of an undiscovered pre-existing world. The writer&#x27;s job is to use the tools in his or her toolbox to get as much of each one out of the ground intact as possible. Sometimes the fossil you uncover is small, a seashell. Sometimes it&#x27;s enormous, a &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot; with all those gigantic ribs and grinning teeth. Either way, short story or thousand-page whopper of a novel, the techniques of excavation remain basically the same.King often starts with a &quot;what-if&quot; scenario, asking what would happen if an alcoholic writer was stranded with his family in a haunted hotel (&quot;The Shining&quot;), or if one could see the outcome of future events (&quot;The Dead Zone&quot;), or if one could travel in time to alter the course of history (&quot;11/22/63&quot;). He writes that &quot;The situation comes first. The characters—always flat and unfeatured, to begin with—come next. Once these things are fixed in my mind, I begin to narrate. I often have an idea of what the outcome may be, but I have never demanded a set of characters that they do things my way. On the contrary, I want them to do things &quot;their&quot; way. In some instances, the outcome is what I visualized. In most, however, it&#x27;s something I never expected.&quot; 

Joyce Carol Oates called King &quot;both a storyteller and an inventor of startling images and metaphors, which linger long in the memory.&quot; An example of King&#x27;s imagery is seen in &quot;The Body&quot; when the narrator recalls a childhood clubhouse with a tin roof and rusty screen door: &quot;No matter what time of day you looked out that screen door, it looked like sunset... When it rained, being inside the club was like being inside a Jamaican steel drum.&quot; King writes that &quot;The use of simile and other figurative language is one of the chief delights of fiction—reading it and writing it, as well. [...] By comparing two seemingly unrelated objects—a restaurant bar and a cave, a mirror and a mirage—we are sometimes able to see an old thing in a new and vivid way. Even if the result is mere clarity instead of beauty, I think writer and reader are participating together in a kind of miracle. Maybe that&#x27;s drawing it a little strong, but yeah—it&#x27;s what I believe.&quot;

=== Themes ===
When asked if fear was his main subject, King said &quot;In every life you get to a point where you have to deal with something that&#x27;s inexplicable to you, whether it&#x27;s the doctor saying you have cancer or a prank phone call. So whether you talk about ghosts or vampires or Nazi war criminals living down the block, we&#x27;re still talking about the same thing, which is an intrusion of the extraordinary into ordinary life and how we deal with it. What that shows about our character and our interactions with others and the society we live in interests me a lot more than monsters and vampires and ghouls and ghosts.&quot; 

Joyce Carol Oates said that &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s characteristic subject is small-town American life, often set in fictitious Derry, Maine; tales of family life, marital life, the lives of children banded together by age, circumstance, and urgency, where parents prove oblivious or helpless. The human heart in conflict with itself—in the guise of the malevolent Other. The &#x27;gothic&#x27; imagination magnifies the vicissitudes of &#x27;real life&#x27; in order to bring it into a sharper and clearer focus.&quot; King&#x27;s &quot;The Body&quot; is about coming of age, a theme he has returned to several times, for example in &quot;Joyland&quot;.

King often uses authors as characters, such as Ben Mears in &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, Jack Torrance in &quot;The Shining&quot;, adult Bill Denbrough in &quot;It&quot; and Mike Noonan in &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;. He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including himself as a character in three novels of &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;. Among other things, this allows King to explore themes of authorship; George Stade writes that &quot;Misery&quot; &quot;is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer&#x27;s relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death&quot; while &quot;The Dark Half&quot; &quot;is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer&#x27;s relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes.&quot;

Introducing King at the National Book Awards, Walter Mosley said &quot;Stephen King once said that daily life is the frame that makes the picture. His commitment, as I see it, is to celebrate and empower the everyday man and woman as they buy aspirin and cope with cancer. He takes our daily lives and makes them into something heroic. He takes our world, validates our distrust of it and then helps us to see that there&#x27;s a chance to transcend the muck. He tells us that even if we fail in our struggles, we are still worthy enough to pass on our energies in the survival of humanity.&quot; In his acceptance speech for the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, King said:&quot;Frank Norris, the author of &quot;McTeague&quot;, said something like this: &#x27;What should I care if they, i.e., the critics, single me out for sneers and laughter? I never truckled, I never lied. I told the truth.&#x27; And that&#x27;s always been the bottom line for me. The story and the people in it may be make believe but I need to ask myself over and over if I&#x27;ve told the truth about the way real people would behave in a similar situation... We understand that fiction is a lie to begin with. To ignore the truth inside the lie is to sin against the craft, in general, and one&#x27;s own work in particular.&quot;

===Influences===
In &quot;On Writing&quot;, King says &quot;If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all: read a lot and write a lot.&quot; He emphasizes the importance of good description, which &quot;begins with clear seeing and ends with clear writing, the kind of writing that employs fresh images and simple vocabulary. I began learning my lessons in this regard by reading Chandler, Hammett, and Ross Macdonald; I gained perhaps even more respect for the power of compact, descriptive language from reading T. S. Eliot (those ragged claws scuttling across the ocean floor; those coffee spoons), and William Carlos Williams (white chickens, red wheelbarrow, the plums that were in the ice box, so sweet and so cold).&quot;

King has called Richard Matheson &quot;the author who influenced me most&quot;. Other influences include Ray Bradbury, Joseph Payne Brennan, James M. Cain, Jack Finney, Graham Greene, Elmore Leonard, John D. MacDonald, Don Robertson and Thomas Williams. He often pays homage to classic horror stories by retelling them in a modern context. He recalls that while writing &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, &quot;I decided I wanted to try to use the book partially as a form of literary homage (as Peter Straub had done in &quot;Ghost Story&quot;, working in the tradition of such &#x27;classical&#x27; ghost story writers as Henry James, M. R. James, and Nathaniel Hawthorne). So my novel bears an intentional similarity to Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;, and after a while it began to seem I was playing an interesting—to me, at least—game of literary racquet-ball: &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; itself was the ball and &quot;Dracula&quot; was the wall I kept hitting it against, watching to see how and where it could bounce, so I could hit it again. As a matter of fact, it took some pretty interesting bounces, and I ascribe this mostly to the fact that, while my ball existed in the twentieth century, the wall was very much a product of the nineteenth.&quot; Similarly, King&#x27;s &quot;Revival&quot; is a modern riff on Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. King dedicated it to &quot;the people who built my house&quot;: Shelley, Stoker, H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Donald Wandrei, Fritz Leiber, August Derleth, Shirley Jackson, Robert Bloch, Straub and Arthur Machen, &quot;whose short novel &quot;The Great God Pan&quot; has haunted me all my life&quot;. 

He provided an appreciation for &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot;, a collection of short stories featuring Cather, Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and others: &quot;I first found &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot; in a Lisbon Falls (Maine) bargain barn called the Jolly White Elephant, where it was on offer for $2.25. At that time I only had four dollars, and spending over half of it on one book, even a hardcover, was a tough decision. I&#x27;ve never regretted it... &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot; taught me more about good writing than all the writing classes I&#x27;ve ever taken. It was the best $2.25 I ever spent.&quot;

== Reception and influence ==
=== Critical reception ===
King has been praised for his use of realistic detail. In &quot;A Century of Great Suspense Stories&quot;, editor Jeffery Deaver wrote that &quot;While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that &quot;&#x27;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot; was ″&quot;Peyton Place&quot; meets &quot;Dracula&quot;″. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. &#x27;Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,&#x27; they were told. Well, it&#x27;s stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.&quot; Daniel Mendelsohn, reviewing &quot;Bag of Bones&quot;, wrote that &quot;Stephen King is so widely accepted as America&#x27;s master of paranormal terrors that you can forget his real genius is for the everyday... This is a book about reanimation: the ghosts&#x27;, of course, but also Mike&#x27;s, his desire to re-embrace love and work after a long bereavement that King depicts with an eye for the kind of small but moving details that don&#x27;t typically distinguish blockbuster horror novels.&quot;

Many critics argue that King has matured as a writer. In his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, &quot;The Modern Weird Tale&quot; (2001), S. T. Joshi devotes a chapter to King&#x27;s work. Joshi argues that King&#x27;s best-known works are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to &quot;deus ex machina&quot; endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Game&quot; (1992), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written.

In 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon &amp; Schuster, described King&#x27;s work as &quot;non-literature&quot; and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice: &quot;The decision to give the National Book Foundation&#x27;s annual award for &#x27;distinguished contribution&#x27; to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I&#x27;ve described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.&quot;
King acknowledged the controversy in his acceptance speech: &quot;There are some people who have spoken out passionately about giving me this medal. There are some people who think it&#x27;s an extraordinarily bad idea. There have been some people who have spoken out who think it&#x27;s an extraordinarily good idea. You know who you are and where you stand and most of you who are here tonight are on my side. I&#x27;m glad for that. But I want to say it doesn&#x27;t matter in a sense which side you were on. The people who speak out, speak out because they are passionate about the book, about the word, about the page and, in that sense, we&#x27;re all brothers and sisters. Give yourself a hand.&quot; Shirley Hazzard, whose novel &quot;The Great Fire&quot; was that year&#x27;s National Book Award winner, responded by criticizing King; she later said that she had never read him.

Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;A lot people were outraged when he was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer couldn&#x27;t be taken seriously. But after finding that his book &quot;On Writing&quot; has more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, I have gotten over my own snobbery. King has, after all, been responsible for the movies &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Apt Pupil&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot;, &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Stand By Me&quot; and &quot;Carrie&quot;... And we must not be ungrateful for &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;, which I awarded three stars because it was &#x27;either the worst movie made from a Stephen King story, or the funniest&#x27;, and you know which side of that I&#x27;m gonna come down on.&quot;

=== Appraisal by other authors ===
Cynthia Ozick said that, upon giving a reading with King, &quot;It dawned on me as I listened to him that, never mind all the best sellers and all the stereotypes -- this man is a genuine, true-born &quot;writer&quot;, and that was a revelation. He is not Tom Clancy. He writes sentences, and he has a literary focus, and his writing is filled with literary history. It&#x27;s not glib, it&#x27;s not just contemporary chatter and it&#x27;s not stupid -- that&#x27;s a bad way to say that something&#x27;s smart, but that&#x27;s what I mean.&quot; 

Joyce Carol Oates praised King&#x27;s sense of place: &quot;His fiction is famously saturated with the atmosphere of Maine; much of his mostly vividly imagined work—&quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot;, the elegantly composed story &#x27;The Reach&#x27;, for instance—is a poetic evocation of that landscape, its history and its inhabitants.&quot; Oates included the latter story in the second edition of &quot;The Oxford Book of American Short Stories&quot;.

Peter Straub compared King favorably to Charles Dickens: &quot;Both are novelists of vast popularity and enormous bibliographies, both are beloved writers with a pronounced taste for the morbid and grotesque, both display a deep interest in the underclass.&quot; Straub included King&#x27;s short story &quot;That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French&quot; in the Library of America anthology &quot;American Fantastic Tales&quot;.

David Foster Wallace assigned &quot;Carrie&quot; and &quot;The Stand&quot; while teaching at Illinois State University. Wallace praised King&#x27;s ear for dialogue: &quot;He&#x27;s one of the first people to talk about real Americans and how they live, to capture real American dialogue in all its, like, foulmouthed grandeur... He has a deadly ear for the way people speak... Students come to me and a lot of them have been led to believe that there&#x27;s good stuff and bad stuff, literary books and popular books, stuff that&#x27;s redemptive and commercial shit—with a sharp line drawn between the two categories. It&#x27;s good to show them that there&#x27;s a certain amount of blurring. Surface-wise, King&#x27;s work is a bit televisual, but there&#x27;s really a lot going on.&quot;

=== Influence ===
In an interview, Sherman Alexie recalls the influence of &quot;Stephen King, who was always writing about underdogs, and bullied kids, and kids fighting back against overwhelming, often supernatural forces... The world aligned against them. As an Indian boy growing up on a reservation, I always identified with his protagonists. Stephen King, fighting the monsters.&quot;

Lauren Groff says that &quot;I love Stephen King and I owe him more than I could ever express... I love his wild imagination and his vivid scenes, many of which populate my nightmares even decades after I last read the books they&#x27;re in. But the greatest thing I gleaned most from reading Stephen King is his big-hearted glee, the way he treats writing with gratitude, the way he sees his job not as the source of anguish and pain many writers self-pityingly see it as, but rather as something he&#x27;s over-the-moon delighted to be lucky enough to do. If I could steal one thing from King, and keep it close to my heart forever, it is his sense of almost-holy glee when it comes to writing.&quot;

The hero of Junot Díaz&#x27;s &quot;The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao&quot; dreams of being &quot;the Dominican Stephen King&quot;, and Díaz alludes to King&#x27;s work several times throughout the novel. Colson Whitehead recalls that &quot;The first big book I read was &quot;Night Shift&quot; by Stephen King, you know, a huge book of short stories. And so for many years I just wanted to write horror fiction.&quot; In a talk at Virginia Commonwealth University, Whitehead recalls that in college &quot;I wanted to write the black &quot;Shining&quot; or the black &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;... Take any Stephen King title and put &#x27;the black&#x27; in front of it. That&#x27;s basically what I wanted to do.&quot;

==Views and activism==

King was raised Methodist, but lost his belief in organized religion while in high school. While not conventionally religious, he says he does believe in God. In 1984, King endorsed Gary Hart&#x27;s presidential campaign. In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor and the easy availability of guns, which he believed were the actual causes of violence.

During the 2008 presidential election, King endorsed Barack Obama. On March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement. On April 30, 2012, King published an article in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as &quot;a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion&quot;.

On January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled &quot;Guns&quot; via Amazon.com&#x27;s Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, &quot;Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use.&quot; The essay became the fifth-bestselling nonfiction title for the Kindle.

In 2016, King was one of many writers who signed a letter condemning the candidacy of Donald Trump. It began: &quot;Because, as writers, we are particularly aware of the many ways that language can be abused in the name of power&quot; and concluded &quot;Because the rise of a political candidate who deliberately appeals to the basest and most violent elements in society, who encourages aggression among his followers, shouts down opponents, intimidates dissenters, and denigrates women and minorities, demands, from each of us, an immediate and forceful response; For all these reasons, we, the undersigned, as a matter of conscience, oppose, unequivocally, the candidacy of Donald J. Trump for the Presidency of the United States.&quot;

King criticized former Iowa Rep. Steve King, deeming him a racist and saying he was tired of being confused with him. In June 2018, King called for the release of the Ukrainian filmmaker Oleg Sentsov, who was jailed in Russia. In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, King endorsed Elizabeth Warren&#x27;s campaign. Warren eventually suspended her campaign, and King later endorsed Joe Biden&#x27;s campaign in the 2020 general election. In 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, King expressed support for Ukraine. On his Twitter account, King posted a photo in an &quot;I stand with Ukraine&quot; T-shirt and later tweeted that he refuses to cooperate with Russian publishers.

In July 2022, Stephen King appeared in a video call with the Russian pranksters Vovan and Lexus who played the role of Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the call Stephen King said &quot;You can always find things about people to pull them down. Washington and Jefferson were slave owners—that doesn&#x27;t mean they didn&#x27;t do many good things to the United States of America. There are always people who have flaws, we are humans. On the whole, I think Bandera is a great man, and you&#x27;re a great man, and Viva Ukraine!&quot; However, King later realized that he was pranked and apologized on Twitter, noting that he was not the only victim and &quot;other victims who fell for these guys include J. K. Rowling, Prince Harry, and Justin Trudeau&quot;.

King testified in an August 2022 case brought by the U.S. Justice Department to block a $2.2 billion merger of Penguin Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster (two of the &quot;Big Five&quot; book publishers). &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited King&#x27;s high-profile testimony, which was against his own publisher, with helping to convince presiding judge Florence Y. Pan with ultimately blocking the merger.

King called on Joe Biden to step down from the presidential race: &quot;Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it&#x27;s time for him — in the interests of the America he so clearly loves — to announce he will not run for re-election.&quot; King went on to endorse Kamala Harris.

===Maine politics===
King endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins. King publicly criticized Paul LePage during LePage&#x27;s tenure as Governor of Maine, referring to him as one of The Three Stooges (with then-Florida Governor Rick Scott and then-Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker being the other two). He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a 2015 radio address that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the governor&#x27;s office, but no apology was issued. King said LePage was &quot;full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green&quot; and demanded that LePage &quot;man up and apologize&quot;. LePage declined to apologize to King, stating, &quot;I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King&#x27;s not in Maine right now. That&#x27;s what I said.&quot;

The attention garnered by the LePage criticism led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018. King said he would not run or serve. King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, calling LePage &quot;a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won&#x27;t govern, he should resign.&quot; He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to &quot;go to work or go back home&quot;. On August 27, 2016, King called LePage &quot;a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist&quot;.

==Philanthropy==
King subsidizes the National Poetry Foundation, which was directed by his professor and mentor Burton Hatlen, and has endowed scholarships named for another professor, Edward Holmes. Mark Singer also notes Bangor&#x27;s &quot;most monumental testament to King&#x27;s philanthropy&quot;, the &quot;Shawn T. Mansfield Baseball Complex, dedicated six years ago in memory of the son of a Little League coach and friend of King&#x27;s who died at fourteen of cerebral palsy.&quot; King has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year &quot;to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts&quot;. The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by King and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving, with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.

In 2002, King, Peter Straub, John Grisham and Pat Conroy organized the Wavedancer Benefit, a public reading to raise funds for the actor and audiobook reader Frank Muller, who had been injured in a motorcycle accident. Their reading was released as an audiobook. In November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his hometown of Bangor, Maine, during the winter. In February 2021, King&#x27;s Foundation donated $6,500 to help children from the Farwell Elementary School in Lewiston, Maine, to publish two novels on which they had been working over the course of several prior years, before being stopped due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Maine.

==Personal life==

After meeting her while studying at the University of Maine, King married Tabitha Spruce on January 2, 1971. She is also a novelist and philanthropist. She has been supportive of him throughout his career, even rescuing his early manuscript of &quot;Carrie&quot; from the trash when he doubted himself. They own and divide their time between three houses: one in Bangor, Maine, one in Lovell, Maine, and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. King&#x27;s home in Bangor has been described as an unofficial tourist attraction, and , the couple plan to convert it into a facility housing his archives and a writers&#x27; retreat.
The Kings have three children—two sons and a daughter, Naomi (born June 1, 1970), who is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with their partner, Thandeka. Both of King&#x27;s sons are also professional authors: Owen King (born February 21, 1977) published his first collection of stories, &quot;We&#x27;re All in This Together: A Novella and Stories&quot;, in 2005. Joseph Hillström King (born June 4, 1972), who writes as Joe Hill, published his first collection of short stories, &quot;20th Century Ghosts&quot;, in 2005.
King is a longtime fan of baseball, particularly the Boston Red Sox. In 1990, King published an essay about Owen&#x27;s Little League team in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. King and Stewart O&#x27;Nan coauthored &quot;Faithful&quot;, a chronicle of their correspondence about the historic 2004 Boston Red Sox season which culminated in the Sox winning the 2004 World Series. The game features in King&#x27;s novellas &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot; (1999) and &quot;Blockade Billy&quot; (2010).

Music, particularly rock, plays a role in much of King&#x27;s work. On the BBC program &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, King&#x27;s number one choice was Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Desolation Row&quot;. On another BBC program, &quot;Paperback Writers&quot;, he made new selections, among them AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, Danny &amp; the Juniors&#x27;s &quot;At the Hop&quot; and Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;It Came Out of the Sky&quot;. He played guitar for the Rock Bottom Remainders, a charity supergroup whose members included Amy Tan, Barbara Kingsolver, Dave Barry, Scott Turow, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Greg Iles, Kathi Kamen Goldmark and other authors. They released an album, &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot; (1998), under Goldmark&#x27;s label, Don&#x27;t Quit Your Day Job Records. King and his band-mates coauthored &quot;Midlife Confidential: The Rock Bottom Remainders Tour America With Three Chords and an Attitude&quot; (1994) and the e-book &quot;Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All&quot; (2013). King&#x27;s favorite books about music are Greil Marcus&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot; and &quot;Lipstick Traces&quot; and Chris Willman&#x27;s &quot;Rednecks and Bluenecks&quot;.

King and his wife own the Zone Corporation, a radio station group established in 1983 to acquire WACZ in Bangor, which was renamed WZON. Two additional stations, WKIT-FM and WNSW in Brewer, were added in 1995; WNSW was quickly closed down. A third station, WDME-FM in Dover-Foxcroft (later renamed WZLO), was acquired in 2001. In December 2024, King announced that the stations would shut down at the end of the year. He cited his advancing age and financial losses from the stations as reasons for the closure. Ahead of the planned closure, King reached a deal to sell WKIT to two Bangor businessmen; WZON and WZLO remain slated for closure.

King remains a voracious reader. In J. Peder Zane&#x27;s &quot;The Top Ten: Authors Pick Their Favorite Books&quot;, King chose &quot;The Golden Argosy&quot;, &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, &quot;McTeague&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Bleak House&quot;, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot;, &quot;Light in August&quot; and &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;. In 2022, he provided another list of ten favorite books; &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; and &quot;Blood Meridian&quot; remained, and he added &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, &quot;The Orphan Master&#x27;s Son&quot;, &quot;Invisible Man&quot;, &quot;Watership Down&quot;, &quot;The Hair of Harold Roux&quot;, &quot;American Pastoral&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He added, &quot;Although Anthony Powell&#x27;s novels should probably be on here, especially the sublimely titled &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Chinese Restaurant&quot; and &quot;Books Do Furnish a Room&quot;. And Paul Scott&#x27;s Raj Quartet. And at least six novels by Patricia Highsmith. And what about Patrick O&#x27;Brian? See how hard this is to do?&quot; 

When asked about his reading habits, King replied, &quot;I&#x27;m sort of an omnivore, apt to go from the latest John Sandford to D. H. Lawrence to Cormac McCarthy.&quot; When asked what books we&#x27;d be surprised to find on his shelves, he answered &quot;Poetry, maybe? I love Anne Sexton, Richard Wilbur, W. B. Yeats. The poetry I come back to again and again are the narrative poems of Stephen Dobyns.&quot; When asked which novel he comes back to, he named Thomas Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Hair of Harold Roux.&quot; When asked who his favorite novelist is, he said &quot;Probably Don Robertson, author of &quot;Paradise Falls&quot;, &quot;The Ideal, Genuine Man&quot; and the marvelously titled &quot;Miss Margaret Ridpath and the Dismantling of the Universe.&quot; What I appreciate most in novels and novelists is generosity, a complete baring of the heart and mind, and Robertson always did that. He also wrote the best single line I&#x27;ve ever read in a novel: Of a funeral he wrote, &#x27;There were that day, o Lord, squadrons of birds.&#x27;&quot;
=== Car accident and aftermath ===
On June 19, 1999, at about 4:30 pm, King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5. Early reports at the time from Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker claimed King was hit from behind, and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking. 

However, Smith was later arrested and charged with driving to endanger and aggravated assault. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of driving to endanger and was sentenced to six months in county jail (suspended) and had his driving license suspended for a year. In his book &quot;On Writing&quot;, King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car, also northbound, passed King first followed by a light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, and the woman told her passenger she hoped &quot;that guy in the van doesn&#x27;t hit him&quot;.

King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family but was in considerable pain. He was transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator. After five operations in 10 days and physical therapy, King resumed work on &quot;On Writing&quot; in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about 40 minutes before the pain became unbearable.

King&#x27;s wife got in touch with his lawyer to purchase Smith&#x27;s van, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. He recalls: &quot;When I was in the hospital, mostly unconscious; my wife got a lawyer who&#x27;s just a friend of the family...And she got in touch with him and said, buy it so that somebody else doesn&#x27;t buy it and decide to break it up and sell it on eBay, on the Internet. And so he did. And for about six months, I did have these, sort of, fantasies of smashing the van up. But my wife – I don&#x27;t always listen to her the first time, but sooner or later, she usually gets through. And what she says makes more sense than what I had planned. And her thought was that the best thing to do would be to very quietly remove it from this plane of existence, which is what we did.&quot;

=== Other media appearances ===
In &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;, William Goldman writes that Stephen King is &quot;doing the abridgment&quot; of the fictional book &quot;Buttercup&#x27;s Baby.&quot; King explains this is an inside joke from Goldman, &quot;who&#x27;s an old friend. He&#x27;s done the screen adaptations for a number of my novels. He did &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; and he also did &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;, and although he&#x27;s not credited, he worked on &quot;Dolores Claiborne&quot; as well, so Bill and I go back a long way. I admired his books before I ever met him and as a kind of return tip of the cap, he put me in that book &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.&quot;

In 1988, the band Blue Öyster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song &quot;Astronomy&quot;; the single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King. In 2012, King provided the narration for Shooter Jennings&#x27;s album &quot;Black Ribbons&quot;. King was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity jeopardy!&quot; in 1995 and 1998. He&#x27;s made cameos in adaptations of his work, and appeared as the character Bachman on &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;; the name is a nod to his pseudonym Richard Bachman. He voiced himself in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot;, where he appears with fellow authors Amy Tan, John Updike and Tom Wolfe at a book fair. King tells Marge he is taking a break from horror to write a biography of Benjamin Franklin.

&quot;Carrie&quot; was included on the New York Public Library&#x27;s list of Books of the Century under the category &quot;Pop Culture Mass &amp; Entertainment&quot;. In 2008, &quot;On Writing&quot; was ranked 21st on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s list of &quot;The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008&quot;. It also made &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest nonfiction books published since the magazine&#x27;s founding in 1923. Gilbert Cruz wrote, &quot;it&#x27;s the most practical and unpretentious writer&#x27;s manual around—as practical and unpretentious as its author, who, yes, just happens to be one of the world&#x27;s most famous novelists.&quot;

&quot;11/22/63&quot; (2011) was named one of the five best fiction books of the year in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Throughout his career, King has explored fresh ways to blend the ordinary and the supernatural. His new novel imagines a time portal in a Maine diner that lets an English teacher go back to 1958 in an effort to stop Lee Harvey Oswald and—rewardingly for readers—also allows King to reflect on questions of memory, fate and free will as he richly evokes midcentury America. The past guards its secrets, this novel reminds us, and the horror behind the quotidian is time itself.&quot;

<doc id="26956" wikidata="Q226730" url="?curid=26956" title="Silent film">
<text>A silent film is a film without synchronized recorded sound (or more generally, no audible dialogue). Though silent films convey narrative and emotion visually, various plot elements (such as a setting or era) or key lines of dialogue may, when necessary, be conveyed by the use of inter-title cards.

The term &quot;silent film&quot; is something of a misnomer, as these films were almost always accompanied by live sounds. During the silent era, which existed from the mid-1890s to the late 1920s, a pianist, theater organist—or even, in larger cities, an orchestra—would play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would play either from sheet music, or improvisation. Sometimes a person would even narrate the inter-title cards for the audience. Though at the time the technology to synchronize sound with the film did not exist, music was seen as an essential part of the viewing experience. &quot;Silent film&quot; is typically used as a historical term to describe an era of cinema prior to the invention of synchronized sound, but it also applies to such sound-era films as &quot;City Lights&quot;, &quot;Modern Times&quot; and &quot;Silent Movie&quot; which are accompanied by a music-only soundtrack in place of dialogue.

The term &quot;silent film&quot; is a retronym—a term created to retroactively distinguish something from later developments. Early sound films, starting with &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; in 1927, were variously referred to as the &quot;talkies&quot;, &quot;sound films&quot;, or &quot;talking pictures&quot;. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is older than film (it was suggested almost immediately after Edison introduced the phonograph in 1877), and some early experiments had the projectionist manually adjusting the frame rate to fit the sound, but because of the technical challenges involved, the introduction of synchronized dialogue became practical only in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the advent of the Vitaphone system. Within a decade, the widespread production of silent films for popular entertainment had ceased, and the industry had moved fully into the sound era, in which movies were accompanied by synchronized sound recordings of spoken dialogue, music and sound effects.

Most early motion pictures are considered lost owing to their physical decay, as the nitrate filmstock used in that era was extremely unstable and flammable. Additionally, many films were deliberately destroyed, because they had negligible remaining immediate financial value in that era. It has often been claimed that around 75 percent of silent films produced in the US have been lost, though these estimates&#x27; accuracy cannot be determined due to a lack of numerical data.

== Elements and beginnings (1833–1894) ==


Film projection mostly evolved from magic lantern shows, in which images from handpainted glass slides were projected onto a wall or screen. After the advent of photography in the 19th century, still photographs were sometimes used. Narration of the showman was important in spectacular entertainment screenings and vital in the lecturing circuit.

The principle of stroboscopic animation was well-known since the introduction of the phenakistiscope in 1833, a popular optical toy, but the development of cinematography was hampered by long exposure times for photographic emulsions, until Eadweard Muybridge managed to record a chronophotographic sequence in 1878. After others had animated his pictures in zoetropes, Muybridge started lecturing with his own zoopraxiscope animation projector in 1880.

The work of other pioneering chronophotographers, including Étienne-Jules Marey and Ottomar Anschütz, furthered the development of motion picture cameras, projectors and transparent celluloid film.

Although Thomas Edison was keen to develop a film system that would be synchronised with his phonograph, he eventually introduced the kinetoscope as a silent motion picture viewer in 1893 and later &quot;kinetophone&quot; versions remained unsuccessful.

== Silent era ==
The art of motion pictures grew into full maturity in the &quot;silent era&quot; (1894 in film – 1929 in film). The height of the silent era (from the early 1910s in film to the late 1920s) was a particularly fruitful period, full of artistic innovation. The film movements of Classical Hollywood as well as French Impressionism, German Expressionism, and Soviet Montage began in this period. Silent filmmakers pioneered the art form to the extent that virtually every style and genre of film-making of the 20th and 21st centuries has its artistic roots in the silent era. The silent era was also a pioneering one from a technical point of view. Three-point lighting, the close-up, long shot, panning, and continuity editing all became prevalent long before silent films were replaced by &quot;talking pictures&quot; or &quot;talkies&quot; in the late 1920s. Some scholars claim that the artistic quality of cinema decreased for several years, during the early 1930s, until film directors, actors, and production staff adapted fully to the new &quot;talkies&quot; around the mid-1930s.
The visual quality of silent movies—especially those produced in the 1920s—was often high, but there remains a widely held misconception that these films were primitive, or are barely watchable by modern standards. This misconception comes from the general public&#x27;s unfamiliarity with the medium, as well as from carelessness on the part of the industry. Most silent films are poorly preserved, leading to their deterioration, and well-preserved films are often played back at the wrong speed or suffer from censorship cuts and missing frames and scenes, giving the appearance of poor editing. Many silent films exist only in second- or third-generation copies, often made from already damaged and neglected film stock.

Many early screenings were plagued by flicker on the screen, when the stroboscopic interruptions between frames lay below the critical flicker frequency. This was solved with the introduction of a three-bladed shutter (since 1902), causing two more interruptions per frame.

Another widely held misconception is that silent films lacked color. In fact, color was far more prevalent in silent films than in the first few decades of sound films. By the early 1920s, 80 percent of movies could be seen in some sort of color, usually in the form of film tinting or toning or even hand coloring, but also with fairly natural two-color processes such as Kinemacolor and Technicolor. Traditional colorization processes ceased with the adoption of sound-on-film technology. Traditional film colorization, all of which involved the use of dyes in some form, interfered with the high resolution required for built-in recorded sound, and were therefore abandoned. The innovative three-strip technicolor process introduced in the mid-1930s was costly and fraught with limitations, and color would not have the same prevalence in film as it did in the silents for nearly four decades.

=== Inter-titles ===
As motion pictures gradually increased in running time, a replacement was needed for the in-house interpreter who would explain parts of the film to the audience. Because silent films had no synchronized sound for dialogue, onscreen inter-titles were used to narrate story points, present key dialogue and sometimes even comment on the action for the audience. The &quot;title writer&quot; became a key professional in silent film and was often separate from the &quot;scenario writer&quot; who created the story. Inter-titles (or &quot;titles&quot; as they were generally called at the time) &quot;often were graphic elements themselves, featuring illustrations or abstract decorations that commented on the action&quot;.

=== Live music and other sound accompaniment ===
Showings of silent films almost always featured live music starting with the first public projection of movies by the Lumière brothers on December 28, 1895, in Paris. This was furthered in 1896 by the first motion-picture exhibition in the United States at Koster and Bial&#x27;s Music Hall in New York City. At this event, Edison set the precedent that all exhibitions should be accompanied by an orchestra. From the beginning, music was recognized as essential, contributing atmosphere, and giving the audience vital emotional cues. Musicians sometimes played on film sets during shooting for similar reasons. However, depending on the size of the exhibition site, musical accompaniment could drastically change in scale. Small-town and neighborhood movie theatres usually had a pianist. Beginning in the mid-1910s, large city theaters tended to have organists or ensembles of musicians. Massive theatre organs, which were designed to fill a gap between a simple piano soloist and a larger orchestra, had a wide range of special effects. Theatrical organs such as the famous &quot;Mighty Wurlitzer&quot; could simulate some orchestral sounds along with a number of percussion effects such as bass drums and cymbals, and sound effects ranging from &quot;train and boat whistles [to] car horns and bird whistles; ... some could even simulate pistol shots, ringing phones, the sound of surf, horses&#x27; hooves, smashing pottery, [and] thunder and rain&quot;.

Musical scores for early silent films were either improvised or compiled of classical or theatrical repertory music. Once full features became commonplace, however, music was compiled from photoplay music by the pianist, organist, orchestra conductor or the movie studio itself, which included a cue sheet with the film. These sheets were often lengthy, with detailed notes about effects and moods to watch for. Starting with the mostly original score composed by Joseph Carl Breil for D. W. Griffith&#x27;s epic &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), it became relatively common for the biggest-budgeted films to arrive at the exhibiting theater with original, specially composed scores. However, the first designated full-blown scores had in fact been composed in 1908, by Camille Saint-Saëns for &quot;The Assassination of the Duke of Guise&quot;, and by Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov for &quot;Stenka Razin&quot;.

When organists or pianists used sheet music, they still might add improvisational flourishes to heighten the drama on screen. Even when special effects were not indicated in the score, if an organist was playing a theater organ capable of an unusual sound effect such as &quot;galloping horses&quot;, it would be used during scenes of dramatic horseback chases.

At the height of the silent era, movies were the single largest source of employment for instrumental musicians, at least in the United States. However, the introduction of talkies, coupled with the roughly simultaneous onset of the Great Depression, was devastating to many musicians.

A number of countries devised other ways of bringing sound to silent films. The early cinema of Brazil, for example, featured &quot;fitas cantatas&quot; (singing films), filmed operettas with singers performing behind the screen. In Japan, films had not only live music but also the &quot;benshi&quot;, a live narrator who provided commentary and character voices. The &quot;benshi&quot; became a central element in Japanese film, as well as providing translation for foreign (mostly American) movies. The popularity of the &quot;benshi&quot; was one reason why silent films persisted well into the 1930s in Japan. Conversely, as &quot;benshi&quot;-narrated films often lacked intertitles, modern-day audiences may sometimes find it difficult to follow the plots without specialised subtitling or additional commentary.

=== Score restorations from 1980 to the present ===

Few film scores survived intact from the silent period, and musicologists are still confronted by questions when they attempt to precisely reconstruct those that remain. Scores used in current reissues or screenings of silent films may be complete reconstructions of compositions, newly composed for the occasion, assembled from already existing music libraries, or improvised on the spot in the manner of the silent-era theater musician.

Interest in the scoring of silent films fell somewhat out of fashion during the 1960s and 1970s. There was a belief in many college film programs and repertory cinemas that audiences should experience silent film as a pure visual medium, undistracted by music. This belief may have been encouraged by the poor quality of the music tracks found on many silent film reprints of the time. Since around 1980, there has been a revival of interest in presenting silent films with quality musical scores (either reworkings of period scores or cue sheets, or the composition of appropriate original scores). An early effort of this kind was Kevin Brownlow&#x27;s 1980 restoration of Abel Gance&#x27;s &quot;Napoléon&quot; (1927), featuring a score by Carl Davis. A slightly re-edited and sped-up version of Brownlow&#x27;s restoration was later distributed in the United States by Francis Ford Coppola, with a live orchestral score composed by his father Carmine Coppola.

In 1984, an edited restoration of &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927) was released with a new rock music score by producer-composer Giorgio Moroder. Although the contemporary score, which included pop songs by Freddie Mercury, Pat Benatar, and Jon Anderson of Yes, was controversial, the door had been opened for a new approach to the presentation of classic silent films.

Today, a large number of soloists, music ensembles, and orchestras perform traditional and contemporary scores for silent films internationally. The legendary theater organist Gaylord Carter continued to perform and record his original silent film scores until shortly before his death in 2000; some of those scores are available on DVD reissues. Other purveyors of the traditional approach include organists such as Dennis James and pianists such as Neil Brand, Günter Buchwald, Philip C. Carli, Ben Model, and William P. Perry. Other contemporary pianists, such as Stephen Horne and Gabriel Thibaudeau, have often taken a more modern approach to scoring.

Orchestral conductors such as Carl Davis and Robert Israel have written and compiled scores for numerous silent films; many of these have been featured in showings on Turner Classic Movies or have been released on DVD. Davis has composed new scores for classic silent dramas such as &quot;The Big Parade&quot; (1925) and &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; (1927). Israel has worked mainly in silent comedy, scoring the films of Harold Lloyd, Buster Keaton, Charley Chase, and others. Timothy Brock has restored many of Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s scores, in addition to composing new scores.

Contemporary music ensembles are helping to introduce classic silent films to a wider audience through a broad range of musical styles and approaches. Some performers create new compositions using traditional musical instruments, while others add electronic sounds, modern harmonies, rhythms, improvisation, and sound design elements to enhance the viewing experience. Among the contemporary ensembles in this category are Un Drame Musical Instantané, Alloy Orchestra, Club Foot Orchestra, Silent Orchestra, Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, Minima and the Caspervek Trio, RPM Orchestra. Donald Sosin and his wife Joanna Seaton specialize in adding vocals to silent films, particularly where there is onscreen singing that benefits from hearing the actual song being performed. Films in this category include Griffith&#x27;s &quot;Lady of the Pavements&quot; with Lupe Vélez, Edwin Carewe&#x27;s &quot;Evangeline&quot; with Dolores del Río, and Rupert Julian&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; with Mary Philbin and Virginia Pearson.

The Silent Film Sound and Music Archive digitizes music and cue sheets written for silent films and makes them available for use by performers, scholars, and enthusiasts.

=== Acting techniques ===

Silent-film actors emphasized body language and facial expression so that the audience could better understand what an actor was feeling and portraying on screen. Much silent film acting is apt to strike modern-day audiences as simplistic or campy. The melodramatic acting style was in some cases a habit actors transferred from their former stage experience. Vaudeville was an especially popular origin for many American silent film actors. The pervading presence of stage actors in film was the cause of this outburst from director Marshall Neilan in 1917: &quot;The sooner the stage people who have come into pictures get out, the better for the pictures.&quot; In other cases, directors such as John Griffith Wray required their actors to deliver larger-than-life expressions for emphasis. As early as 1914, American viewers had begun to make known their preference for greater naturalness on screen.

Silent films became less vaudevillian in the mid-1910s, as the differences between stage and screen became apparent. Due to the work of directors such as D. W. Griffith, cinematography became less stage-like, and the development of the close up allowed for understated and realistic acting. Lillian Gish has been called film&#x27;s &quot;first true actress&quot; for her work in the period, as she pioneered new film performing techniques, recognizing the crucial differences between stage and screen acting. Directors such as Albert Capellani and Maurice Tourneur began to insist on naturalism in their films. By the mid-1920s many American silent films had adopted a more naturalistic acting style, though not all actors and directors accepted naturalistic, low-key acting straight away; as late as 1927, films featuring expressionistic acting styles, such as &quot;Metropolis&quot;, were still being released. Greta Garbo, whose first American film was released in 1926, would become known for her naturalistic acting.

According to Anton Kaes, a silent film scholar from the University of California, Berkeley, American silent cinema began to see a shift in acting techniques between 1913 and 1921, influenced by techniques found in German silent film. This is mainly attributed to the influx of emigrants from the Weimar Republic, &quot;including film directors, producers, cameramen, lighting and stage technicians, as well as actors and actresses&quot;.

=== Projection speed ===
Until the standardization of the projection speed of 24 frames per second (fps) for sound films between 1926 and 1930, silent films were shot at variable speeds (or &quot;frame rates&quot;) anywhere from 12 to 40 fps, depending on the year and studio. &quot;Standard silent film speed&quot; is often said to be 16 fps as a result of the Lumière brothers&#x27; , but industry practice varied considerably; there was no actual standard. William Kennedy Laury Dickson, an Edison employee, settled on the astonishingly fast 40 frames per second. Additionally, cameramen of the era insisted that their cranking technique was exactly 16 fps, but modern examination of the films shows this to be in error, and that they often cranked faster. Unless carefully shown at their intended speeds silent films can appear unnaturally fast or slow. However, some scenes were intentionally undercranked during shooting to accelerate the action—particularly for comedies and action films.
Slow projection of a cellulose nitrate base film carried a risk of fire, as each frame was exposed for a longer time to the intense heat of the projection lamp; but there were other reasons to project a film at a greater pace. Often projectionists received general instructions from the distributors on the musical director&#x27;s cue sheet as to how fast particular reels or scenes should be projected. In rare instances, usually for larger productions, cue sheets produced specifically for the projectionist provided a detailed guide to presenting the film. Theaters also—to maximize profit—sometimes varied projection speeds depending on the time of day or popularity of a film, or to fit a film into a prescribed time slot.

All motion-picture film projectors require a moving shutter to block the light whilst the film is moving, otherwise the image is smeared in the direction of the movement. However this shutter causes the image to &quot;flicker&quot;, and images with low rates of flicker are very unpleasant to watch. Early studies by Thomas Edison for his Kinetoscope machine determined that any rate below 46 images per second &quot;will strain the eye&quot;. and this holds true for projected images under normal cinema conditions also. The solution adopted for the Kinetoscope was to run the film at over 40 frames/sec, but this was expensive for film. However, by using projectors with dual- and triple-blade shutters the flicker rate is multiplied two or three times higher than the number of film frames — each frame being flashed two or three times on screen. A three-blade shutter projecting a 16 fps film will slightly surpass Edison&#x27;s figure, giving the audience 48 images per second. During the silent era projectors were commonly fitted with 3-bladed shutters. Since the introduction of sound with its 24 frame/sec standard speed 2-bladed shutters have become the norm for 35 mm cinema projectors, though three-bladed shutters have remained standard on 16 mm and 8 mm projectors, which are frequently used to project amateur footage shot at 16 or 18 frames/sec. A 35 mm film frame rate of 24 fps translates to a film speed of per second. One reel requires 11 minutes and 7 seconds to be projected at 24 fps, while a 16 fps projection of the same reel would take 16 minutes and 40 seconds, or per second.

In the 1950s, many telecine conversions of silent films at grossly incorrect frame rates for broadcast television may have alienated viewers. Film speed is often a vexed issue among scholars and film buffs in the presentation of silents today, especially when it comes to DVD releases of restored films, such as the case of the 2002 restoration of &quot;Metropolis&quot;.

=== Tinting ===

With the lack of natural color processing available, films of the silent era were frequently dipped in dyestuffs and dyed various shades and hues to signal a mood or represent a time of day. Hand tinting dates back to 1895 in the United States with Edison&#x27;s release of selected hand-tinted prints of &quot;Butterfly Dance&quot;. Additionally, experiments in color film started as early as in 1909, although it took a much longer time for color to be adopted by the industry and an effective process to be developed. Blue represented night scenes, yellow or amber meant day. Red represented fire and green represented a mysterious atmosphere. Similarly, toning of film (such as the common silent film generalization of sepia-toning) with special solutions replaced the silver particles in the film stock with salts or dyes of various colors. A combination of tinting and toning could be used as an effect that could be striking.

Some films were hand-tinted, such as &quot;Annabelle Serpentine Dance&quot; (1894), from Edison Studios. In it, Annabelle Whitford, a young dancer from Broadway, is dressed in white veils that appear to change colors as she dances. This technique was designed to capture the effect of the live performances of Loie Fuller, beginning in 1891, in which stage lights with colored gels turned her white flowing dresses and sleeves into artistic movement. Hand coloring was often used in the early &quot;trick&quot; and fantasy films of Europe, especially those by Georges Méliès. Méliès began hand-tinting his work as early as 1897 and the 1899 &quot;Cendrillion&quot; (Cinderella) and 1900 &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; (Joan of Arc) provide early examples of hand-tinted films in which the color was a critical part of the scenography or &quot;mise-en-scène&quot;; such precise tinting used the workshop of Elisabeth Thuillier in Paris, with teams of female artists adding layers of color to each frame by hand rather than using a more common (and less expensive) process of stenciling. A newly restored version of Méliès&#x27; &quot;A Trip to the Moon&quot;, originally released in 1902, shows an exuberant use of color designed to add texture and interest to the image.

Comments by an American distributor in a 1908 film-supply catalog further underscore France&#x27;s continuing dominance in the field of hand-coloring films during the early silent era. The distributor offers for sale at varying prices &quot;High-Class&quot; motion pictures by Pathé, Urban-Eclipse, Gaumont, Kalem, Itala Film, Ambrosio Film, and Selig. Several of the longer, more prestigious films in the catalog are offered in both standard black-and-white &quot;plain stock&quot; as well as in &quot;hand-painted&quot; color. A plain-stock copy, for example, of the 1907 release &quot;Ben Hur&quot; is offered for $120 ($ USD today), while a colored version of the same 1,000-foot, 15-minute film costs $270 ($) including the extra $150 coloring charge, which amounted to 15 cents more per foot. Although the reasons for the cited extra charge were likely obvious to customers, the distributor explains why his catalog&#x27;s colored films command such significantly higher prices and require more time for delivery. His explanation also provides insight into the general state of film-coloring services in the United States by 1908:


By the beginning of the 1910s, with the onset of feature-length films, tinting was used as another mood setter, just as commonplace as music. The director D. W. Griffith displayed a constant interest and concern about color, and used tinting as a special effect in many of his films. His 1915 epic &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; used a number of colors, including amber, blue, lavender, and a striking red tint for scenes such as the &quot;burning of Atlanta&quot; and the ride of the Ku Klux Klan at the climax of the picture. Griffith later invented a color system in which colored lights flashed on areas of the screen to achieve a color.

With the development of sound-on-film technology and the industry&#x27;s acceptance of it, tinting was abandoned altogether, because the dyes used in the tinting process interfered with the soundtracks present on film strips.

== Early studios ==
The early studios were located in the New York City area. Edison Studios were first in West Orange, New Jersey (1892), they were moved to the Bronx, New York (1907). Fox (1909) and Biograph (1906) started in Manhattan, with studios in St George, Staten Island. Other films were shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey. In December 1908, Edison led the formation of the Motion Picture Patents Company in an attempt to control the industry and shut out smaller producers. The &quot;Edison Trust&quot;, as it was nicknamed, was made up of Edison, Biograph, Essanay Studios, Kalem Company, George Kleine Productions, Lubin Studios, Georges Méliès, Pathé, Selig Studios, and Vitagraph Studios, and dominated distribution through the General Film Company. This company dominated the industry as both a vertical and horizontal monopoly and is a contributing factor in studios&#x27; migration to the West Coast. The Motion Picture Patents Co. and the General Film Co. were found guilty of antitrust violation in October 1915, and were dissolved.

The Thanhouser film studio was founded in New Rochelle, New York, in 1909 by American theatrical impresario Edwin Thanhouser. The company produced and released 1,086 films between 1910 and 1917, including the first film serial, &quot;The Million Dollar Mystery&quot;, released in 1914. The first westerns were filmed at Fred Scott&#x27;s Movie Ranch in South Beach, Staten Island. Actors costumed as cowboys and Native Americans galloped across Scott&#x27;s movie ranch set, which had a frontier main street, a wide selection of stagecoaches and a 56-foot stockade. The island provided a serviceable stand-in for locations as varied as the Sahara desert and a British cricket pitch. War scenes were shot on the plains of Grasmere, Staten Island. &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot; and its even more popular sequel &quot;The Exploits of Elaine&quot; were filmed largely on the island. So was the 1906 blockbuster &quot;Life of a Cowboy&quot;, by Edwin S. Porter Company, and filming moved to the West Coast .

== Top-grossing films in the United States ==

The following are American films from the silent film era that had earned the highest gross income as of 1932. The amounts given are gross rentals (the distributor&#x27;s share of the box-office) as opposed to exhibition gross.
== During the sound era ==

=== Transition ===
Although attempts to create sync-sound motion pictures go back to the Edison lab in 1896, only from the early 1920s were the basic technologies such as vacuum tube amplifiers and high-quality loudspeakers available. The next few years saw a race to design, implement, and market several rival sound-on-disc and sound-on-film sound formats, such as Photokinema (1921), Phonofilm (1923), Vitaphone (1926), Fox Movietone (1927) and RCA Photophone (1928).

Warner Bros. was the first studio to accept sound as an element in film production and utilize the Vitaphone, a sound-on-disc technology, to do so. The studio then released &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; in 1927, which marked the first commercially successful sound film, but silent films were still the majority of features released in both 1927 and 1928, along with so-called goat-glanded films: silents with a subsection of sound film inserted. Thus the modern sound film era may be regarded as coming to dominance beginning in 1929.

For a listing of notable silent-era films, see &quot;List of years in film&quot; for the years between the beginning of film and 1928. The following list includes only films produced in the sound era with the specific artistic intention of being silent.
* &quot;City Girl&quot;, F. W. Murnau, 1930
* &quot;Earth&quot;, Aleksandr Dovzhenko, 1930
* &quot;The Silent Enemy&quot;, H.P. Carver, 1930
* &quot;Borderline&quot;, Kenneth Macpherson, 1930
* &quot;City Lights&quot;, Charlie Chaplin, 1931
* &quot;&quot;, F. W. Murnau, 1931
* &quot;I Was Born, But...&quot;, Yasujirō Ozu, 1932
* &quot;Passing Fancy&quot;, Yasujirō Ozu, 1933

=== Later homages ===
Several filmmakers have paid homage to the comedies of the silent era, including Charlie Chaplin, with &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936), Orson Welles with &quot;Too Much Johnson&quot; (1938), Jacques Tati with &quot;Les Vacances de Monsieur Hulot&quot; (1953), Pierre Etaix with &quot;The Suitor&quot; (1962), and Mel Brooks with &quot;Silent Movie&quot; (1976). Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien&#x27;s acclaimed drama &quot;Three Times&quot; (2005) is silent during its middle third, complete with intertitles; Stanley Tucci&#x27;s &quot;The Impostors&quot; has an opening silent sequence in the style of early silent comedies. Brazilian filmmaker Renato Falcão&#x27;s &quot;Margarette&#x27;s Feast&quot; (2003) is silent. Writer/director Michael Pleckaitis puts his own twist on the genre with &quot;Silent&quot; (2007). While not silent, the &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; television series and movies have used the title character&#x27;s non-talkative nature to create a similar style of humor. A lesser-known example is Jérôme Savary&#x27;s &quot;La fille du garde-barrière&quot; (1975), an homage to silent-era films that uses intertitles and blends comedy, drama, and explicit sex scenes (which led to it being refused a cinema certificate by the British Board of Film Classification).

In 1990, Charles Lane directed and starred in &quot;Sidewalk Stories&quot;, a low budget salute to sentimental silent comedies, particularly Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Kid&quot;.

The German film &quot;Tuvalu&quot; (1999) is mostly silent; the small amount of dialog is an odd mix of European languages, increasing the film&#x27;s universality. Guy Maddin won awards for his homage to Soviet-era silent films with his short &quot;The Heart of the World&quot; after which he made a feature-length silent, &quot;Brand Upon the Brain!&quot; (2006), incorporating live Foley artists, narration and orchestra at select showings. &quot;Shadow of the Vampire&quot; (2000) is a highly fictionalized depiction of the filming of Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau&#x27;s classic silent vampire movie &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922). Werner Herzog honored the same film in his own version, &quot;&quot; (1979).

Some films draw a direct contrast between the silent film era and the era of talkies. &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; shows the disconnect between the two eras in the character of Norma Desmond, played by silent film star Gloria Swanson, and &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; deals with Hollywood artists adjusting to the talkies. Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Nickelodeon&quot; deals with the turmoil of silent filmmaking in Hollywood during the early 1910s, leading up to the release of D. W. Griffith&#x27;s epic &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915).

In 1999, the Finnish filmmaker Aki Kaurismäki produced &quot;Juha&quot; in black and white, which captures the style of a silent film, using intertitles in place of spoken dialogue. Special release prints with titles in several different languages were produced for international distribution. In India, the film &quot;Pushpak&quot; (1988), starring Kamal Haasan, was a black comedy entirely devoid of dialog. The Australian film &quot;Doctor Plonk&quot; (2007), was a silent comedy directed by Rolf de Heer. Stage plays have drawn upon silent film styles and sources. Actor/writers Billy Van Zandt and Jane Milmore staged their Off-Broadway slapstick comedy &quot;Silent Laughter&quot; as a live action tribute to the silent screen era. Geoff Sobelle and Trey Lyford created and starred in &quot;All Wear Bowlers&quot; (2004), which started as an homage to Laurel and Hardy then evolved to incorporate life-sized silent film sequences of Sobelle and Lyford who jump back and forth between live action and the silver screen. The animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot; (1940), which is eight different animation sequences set to music, can be considered a silent film, with only one short scene involving dialogue.

Although other animated films &quot;The Apostle&quot; (1917) and &quot;The Adventures of Prince Achmed&quot; (1926) are considered silent, but they have used the synchronized sound and music without dialogues for their respective films.

== Preservation and lost films ==
The vast majority of the silent films produced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are considered lost. According to a September 2013 report published by the United States Library of Congress, some 70 percent of American silent feature films fall into this category. There are numerous reasons for this number being so high. Some films have been lost unintentionally, but most silent films were destroyed on purpose. Between the end of the silent era and the rise of home video, film studios would often discard large numbers of silent films out of a desire to free up storage in their archives, assuming that they had lost the cultural relevance and economic value to justify the amount of space they occupied. Additionally, due to the fragile nature of the nitrate film stock which was used to shoot and distribute silent films, many motion pictures have irretrievably deteriorated or have been lost in accidents, including fires (because nitrate is highly flammable and can spontaneously combust when stored improperly). Examples of such incidents include the 1965 MGM vault fire and the 1937 Fox vault fire, both of which caused catastrophic losses of films. Many such films not completely destroyed survive only partially, or in badly damaged prints. Some lost films, such as &quot;London After Midnight&quot; (1927), lost in the MGM fire, have been the subject of considerable interest by film collectors and historians.

Major silent films presumed lost include:
* &quot;The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays&quot; (1908)
* &quot;Saved from the Titanic&quot; (1912), which featured survivors of the disaster;
* &quot;The Life of General Villa&quot;, starring Pancho Villa himself
* &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1917)
* &quot;Kiss Me Again&quot; (1925)
* &quot;Arirang&quot; (1926)
* &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1926)
* &quot;London After Midnight&quot; (1927)
* &quot;The Patriot&quot; (1928), the only lost Best Picture nominee; only the trailer survives
* &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot; (1928)

Though most lost silent films will never be recovered, some have been discovered in film archives or private collections. Discovered and preserved versions may be editions made for the home rental market of the 1920s and 1930s that are discovered in estate sales, etc. The degradation of old film stock can be slowed through proper archiving, and films can be transferred to safety film stock or to digital media for preservation. The preservation of silent films has been a high priority for historians and archivists.

=== Dawson Film Find ===

Dawson City, in the Yukon territory of Canada, was once the end of the distribution line for many films. In 1978, a cache of more than 500 reels of nitrate film was discovered during the excavation of a vacant lot formerly the site of the Dawson Amateur Athletic Association, which had started showing films at its recreation center in 1903. Works by Pearl White, Helen Holmes, Grace Cunard, Lois Weber, Harold Lloyd, Douglas Fairbanks, and Lon Chaney, among others, were included, as well as many newsreels. The titles were stored at the local library until 1929 when the flammable nitrate was used as landfill in a condemned swimming pool. Having spent 50 years under the permafrost of the Yukon, the reels turned out to be extremely well preserved. Owing to its dangerous chemical volatility, the historical find was moved by military transport to Library and Archives Canada and the US Library of Congress for storage (and transfer to safety film). A documentary about the find, &quot;Dawson City: Frozen Time&quot;, was released in 2016.

<doc id="26961" wikidata="Q9585" url="?curid=26961" title="Shia Islam">
<text>Shia Islam is the second-largest branch of Islam. It holds that Muhammad designated Ali ibn Abi Talib () as his successor () as the imam, that is the spiritual and political leader of the Muslim community. However, his right is understood to have been usurped by a number of Muhammad&#x27;s companions at the meeting of Saqifa where they appointed Abu Bakr () as caliph instead. As such, Sunni Muslims believe Abu Bakr, Umar (), Uthman () and Ali to be &#x27;rightly-guided caliphs&#x27; whereas Shia Muslims only regard Ali as the legitimate successor.

Shia Muslims assert imamate continued through Ali&#x27;s sons Hasan and Husayn, after whom different Shia branches have their own imams. They revere the , the family of Muhammad, maintaining that they possess divine knowledge. Shia holy sites include the shrine of Ali in Najaf, the shrine of Husayn in Karbala and other mausoleums of the . Later events such as Husayn&#x27;s martyrdom in the Battle of Karbala (680 CE) further influenced the development of Shia Islam, contributing to the formation of a distinct religious sect with its own rituals and shared collective memory.

Shia Islam is followed by 10–13% of all Muslims. The three main Shia branches are Twelverism, Isma&#x27;ilism and Zaydism. Shia Muslims form a majority of the population in four countries across the Muslim world: Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan and Bahrain. Significant Shia communities are also found in Lebanon, Kuwait, Turkey, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and the Indian subcontinent. Iran stands as the world&#x27;s only country where Shia Islam forms the foundation of both its laws and governance system.

==Terminology==
The word Shia (or Shīʿa) () () is derived from . Shia Islam is also referred to in English as Shiism (or Shīʿism) (), and Shia Muslims as Shiites (or Shīʿites) ().

The term was first used during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime. At present, the word refers to the Muslims who believe that the leadership of the Muslim community after Muhammad belongs to ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law, and his successors. Nawbakhti states that the term &quot;Shia&quot; refers to a group of Muslims who at the time of Muhammad and after him regarded ʿAlī as the Imam and caliph. Al-Shahrastani expresses that the term &quot;Shia&quot; refers to those who believe that ʿAlī is designated as the heir, Imam, and caliph by Muhammad and that ʿAlī&#x27;s authority is maintained through his descendants. For the adherents of Shia Islam, this conviction is implicit in the Quran and the history of Islam. Shia Muslim scholars emphasize that the notion of authority is linked to the family of the Abrahamic prophets as the Quranic verses and show: &quot;Indeed, Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of ’Imrân above all people. They are descendants of one another. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&quot;

==History==
The original Shia identity referred to the followers of Imam ʿAlī, and Shia theology was formulated after the &quot;hijra&quot; (8th century CE). The first Shia governments and societies were established by the end of the 9th century CE. The 10th century CE has been referred to by the scholar of Islamic studies Louis Massignon as &quot;the Shiite Ismaili century in the history of Islam&quot;.

=== Origins ===


The Shia, originally known as the &quot;partisans&quot; of ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib, Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and Fatima&#x27;s husband, first emerged as a distinct movement during the First Fitna from 656 to 661 CE. Shia doctrine holds that ʿAlī was meant to lead the community after Muhammad&#x27;s death in 632. Historians dispute over the origins of Shia Islam, with many Western scholars positing that Shīʿīsm began as a political faction rather than a truly religious movement. Other scholars disagree, considering this concept of religious-political separation to be an anachronistic application of a Western concept.

Shia Muslims believe that Muhammad designated ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib as his heir during a speech at Ghadir Khumm. The point of contention between different Muslim sects arises when Muhammad, whilst giving his speech, gave the proclamation &quot;Anyone who has me as his &quot;mawla&quot;, has ʿAlī as his &quot;mawla&quot;&quot;. Some versions add the additional sentence &quot;O God, befriend the friend of ʿAlī and be the enemy of his enemy&quot;. Sunnis maintain that Muhammad emphasized the deserving friendship and respect for ʿAlī. In contrast, Shia Muslims assert that the statement unequivocally designates ʿAlī as Muhammad&#x27;s appointed successor. Shia sources also record further details of the event, such as stating that those present congratulated ʿAlī and acclaimed him as &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot; (&quot;commander of the believers&quot;).

When Muhammad died in 632 CE, ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib and Muhammad&#x27;s closest relatives made the funeral arrangements. While they were preparing his body, Abū Bakr, ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb, and Abu Ubaidah ibn al Jarrah met with the leaders of Medina and elected Abū Bakr as the first &quot;rāshidūn&quot; caliph. Abū Bakr served from 632 to 634, and was followed by Umar (634–644) and ʿUthmān (644–656).

With the murder of ʿUthmān in 657 CE, the Muslims of Medina invited ʿAlī to become the fourth caliph as the last source, and he established his capital in Kufa. ʿAlī&#x27;s rule over the early Islamic empire, between 656 CE to 661 CE, was often contested. Tensions eventually led to the First Fitna, the first major civil war between Muslims within the empire, which began as a series of revolts fought against ʿAlī. While the rebels had previously affirmed the legitimacy of ʿAlī&#x27;s &quot;khilafāʾ&quot; (caliphate), they later turned against ʿAlī and fought him. Tensions escalated into the Battle of the Camel in 656, where Ali&#x27;s forces emerged victorious against Aisha, Talhah, and al-Zubayr. However, the Battle of Siffin in 657 turned the tide against ʿAlī, who lost due to arbitration issues with Muawiyah, the governor of Damascus. ʿAlī withdrew to Kufa, overcoming the Kharijis, a faction that had transformed from supporters to bitter rivals, at Nahrawan in 658. In 661, ʿAlī was assassinated by a Khariji assassin in Kufa while in the act of prostration during prayer (&quot;sujud&quot;). Subsequently, Muawiyah asserted his claim to the caliphate.

=== Hasan, Husayn, and Karbala ===

Upon the death of ʿAlī, his elder son Ḥasan became leader of the Muslims of Kufa. After a series of skirmishes between the Kufa Muslims and the army of Muawiyah, Ḥasan ibn Ali agreed to cede the caliphate to Muawiyah and maintain peace among Muslims upon certain conditions: The enforced public cursing of ʿAlī, e.g. during prayers, should be abandoned; Muawiyah should not use tax money for his own private needs; There should be peace, and followers of Ḥasan should be given security and their rights; Muawiyah will never adopt the title of &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot; (&quot;commander of the believers&quot;); Muawiyah will not nominate any successor. Ḥasan then retired to Medina, where in 670 CE he was poisoned by his wife Ja&#x27;da bint al-Ash&#x27;ath, after being secretly contacted by Muawiyah who wished to pass the caliphate to his own son Yazid and saw Ḥasan as an obstacle.

Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, ʿAlī&#x27;s younger son and brother to Ḥasan, initially resisted calls to lead the Muslims against Muawiyah and reclaim the caliphate. In 680 CE, Muawiyah died and passed the caliphate to his son Yazid, and breaking the treaty with Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī. Yazid asked Husayn to swear allegiance (&quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot;) to him. ʿAlī&#x27;s faction, having expected the caliphate to return to ʿAlī&#x27;s line upon Muawiyah&#x27;s death, saw this as a betrayal of the peace treaty and so Ḥusayn rejected this request for allegiance. There was a groundswell of support in Kufa for Ḥusayn to return there and take his position as caliph and Imam, so Ḥusayn collected his family and followers in Medina and set off for Kufa.

En route to Kufa, Husayn was blocked by an army of Yazid&#x27;s men, which included people from Kufa, near Karbala; rather than surrendering, Husayn and his followers chose to fight. In the Battle of Karbala, Ḥusayn and approximately 72 of his family members and followers were killed, and Husayn&#x27;s head was delivered to Yazid in Damascus. The Shi&#x27;a community regard Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī as a martyr (&quot;shahid&quot;), and count him as an Imam from the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot;. The Battle of Karbala and martyrdom of Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī is often cited as the definitive separation between the Shia and Sunnī sects of Islam. Ḥusayn is the last Imam following ʿAlī mutually recognized by all branches of Shia Islam. The martyrdom of Husayn and his followers is commemorated on the Day of Ashura, occurring on the tenth day of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calendar.

===Imamate of the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot;===


Later, most denominations of Shia Islam, including Twelvers and Ismāʿīlīs, became Imamis. Imami Shīʿītes believe that Imams are the spiritual and political successors to Muhammad. Imams are human individuals who not only rule over the Muslim community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret the divine law and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the Imams are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and must be chosen by divine decree (&quot;nass&quot;) through Muhammad. According to this view peculiar to Shia Islam, there is always an Imam of the Age, who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. ʿAlī was the first Imam of this line, the rightful successor to Muhammad, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter Fatimah.

This difference between following either the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; (Muhammad&#x27;s family and descendants) or pledging allegiance to Abū Bakr has shaped the Shia–Sunnī divide on the interpretation of some Quranic verses, hadith literature (accounts of the sayings and living habits attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad during his lifetime), and other areas of Islamic belief throughout the history of Islam. For instance, the hadith collections venerated by Shia Muslims are centered on narrations by members of the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; and their supporters, while some hadith transmitted by narrators not belonging to or supporting the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; are not included. Those of Abu Hurairah, for example, Ibn Asakir in his &quot;Taʿrikh Kabir&quot;, and Muttaqi in his &quot;Kanzuʿl-Umma&quot; report that ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb lashed him, rebuked him, and forbade him to narrate &quot;ḥadīth&quot; from Muhammad. ʿUmar is reported to have said: &quot;Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) So you must stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus.&quot; (An Arab clan in Yemen, to which Abu Hurairah belonged). According to Sunnī Muslims, ʿAlī was the fourth successor to Abū Bakr, while Shia Muslims maintain that ʿAlī was the first divinely sanctioned &quot;Imam&quot;, or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom at the Battle of Karbala of ʿAlī&#x27;s son, Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, and 71 of his followers in 680 CE, who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph.

It is believed in Twelver and Ismāʿīlī branches of Shia Islam that divine wisdom (&quot;ʿaql&quot;) was the source of the souls of the prophets and Imams, which bestowed upon them esoteric knowledge (&quot;ḥikmah&quot;), and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees. Although the Imam was not the recipient of a divine revelation (&quot;waḥy&quot;), he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam, in turn, guides the people. Imamate, or belief in the divine guide, is a fundamental belief in the Twelver and Ismāʿīlī branches of Shia Islam, and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.

===Imam Mahdi, last Imam of the Shia===


In Shia Islam, Imam Mahdi is regarded as the prophesied eschatological redeemer of Islam who will rule for seven, nine, or nineteen years (according to differing interpretations) before the Day of Judgment and will rid the world of evil. According to Islamic tradition, the Mahdi&#x27;s tenure will coincide with the Second Coming of Jesus (ʿĪsā), who is to assist the Mahdi against the Masih ad-Dajjal (literally, the &quot;false Messiah&quot; or Antichrist). Jesus, who is considered the &quot;Masih&quot; (&quot;Messiah&quot;) in Islam, will descend at the point of a white arcade east of Damascus, dressed in yellow robes with his head anointed. He will then join the Mahdi in his war against the Dajjal, where it is believed the Mahdi will slay the Dajjal and unite humankind.

===Dynasties===
In the century following the Battle of Karbala (680 CE), as various Shia-affiliated groups diffused in the emerging Islamic world, several nations arose based on a Shia leadership or population.
*Idrisids (788–985 CE): a Zaydi dynasty in what is now Morocco.
*Qarmatians (899–1077 CE): an Ismaili Iranian dynasty. Their headquarters were in Eastern Arabia and Bahrain. It was founded by Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Jannabi.
*Buyids (934–1055 CE): a Twelver Iranian dynasty. at its peak consisted of large portions of Iran and Iraq.
*Uqaylids (990–1096 CE): a Shia Arab dynasty with several lines that ruled in various parts of al-Jazira, northern Syria and Iraq.
* Ilkhanate (1256–1335): a Persianate Mongol khanate established in Iran in the 13th century, considered a part of the Mongol Empire. The Ilkhanate was based, originally, on Genghis Khan&#x27;s campaigns in the Khwarezmid Empire in 1219–1224, and founded by Genghis&#x27;s grandson, Hulagu, in territories in Western and Central Asia which today comprise most of Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, and Pakistan. The Ilkhanate initially embraced many religions, but was particularly sympathetic to Buddhism and Christianity. Later Ilkhanate rulers, beginning with Ghazan in 1295, chose Islam as the state religion; his brother Öljaitü promoted Shia Islam.
* Bahmanids (1347–1527): a Shia Muslim state of the Deccan Plateau in Southern India, and one of the great medieval Indian kingdoms. Bahmanid Sultanate was the first independent Islamic kingdom in Southern India.

====Fatimid Caliphate====
* Fatimids (909–1171 CE): Controlled much of North Africa, the Levant, parts of Arabia, and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. The group takes its name from Fāṭimah, Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, from whom they claim descent.
** In 909 CE, the Shia military leader Abu Abdallah al-Shiʻi overthrew the Sunni rulers in North Africa, an event which led to the foundation of the Fatimid Caliphate.
** Al-Qaid Jawhar ibn Abdallah (; 966–d. 992) was a Shia Fatimid general. Under the command of Caliph al-Muʻizz, he led the conquest of North Africa and then of Egypt, founded the city of Cairo and the al-Azhar Mosque. A Greek slave by origin, he was freed by al-Muʻizz.

====Safavid Empire====
A major turning point in the history of Shia Islam was the dominion of the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736) in Persia. This caused a number of changes in the Muslim world:
* The ending of the relative mutual tolerance between Sunnīs and Shias that existed from the time of the Mongol conquests onwards and the resurgence of antagonism between the two groups.
* Initial dependence of Shīʿīte clerics on the state followed by the emergence of an independent body of &quot;ulama&quot; capable of taking a political stand different from official policies.
* The growth in importance of Persian centers of Islamic education and religious learning, which resulted in the change of Twelver Shīʿīsm from being a predominantly Arab phenomenon to become predominantly Persian.
* The growth of the Akhbari school of thought, which taught that only the Quran, &quot;ḥadīth&quot; literature, and &quot;sunnah&quot; (accounts of the sayings and living habits attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad during his lifetime) are to be bases for verdicts, rejecting the use of reasoning.

With the fall of the Safavids, the state in Iran—including the state system of courts with government-appointed judges (&quot;qāḍī&quot;)—became much weaker. This gave the &quot;sharīʿa&quot; courts of &quot;mujtahid&quot; an opportunity to fill the legal vacuum and enabled the &quot;ulama&quot; to assert their judicial authority. The Usuli school of thought also increased in strength at this time.

==Beliefs==

Shīʿa Islam encompasses various denominations and subgroups, all bound by the belief that the leader of the Muslim community (&quot;Ummah&quot;) should hail from &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot;, the family of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It embodies a completely independent system of religious interpretation and political authority in the Muslim world.

=== Alī: Muhammad&#x27;s rightful successor ===


Shīʿa Muslims believe that just as a prophet is appointed by God alone, only God has the prerogative to appoint the successor to his prophet. They believe God chose ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib to be Muhammad&#x27;s successor and the first caliph () of Islam. Shīʿa Muslims believe that Muhammad designated Ali as his successor by God&#x27;s command on several instances, but most notably at Eid Al Ghadir. Additionally, ʿAlī was Muhammad&#x27;s first-cousin and closest living male relative as well as his son-in-law, having married Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, Fāṭimah.

=== Profession of faith (&quot;Shahada&quot;) ===
The Shīʿīte version of the &quot;Shahada&quot; (), the Islamic profession of faith, differs from that of the Sunnīs. The Sunnī version of the &quot;Shahada&quot; states &quot;La ilaha illallah, Muhammadun rasulullah&quot; (), but in addition to this declaration of faith Shīʿa Muslims add the phrase &quot;Ali-un-Waliullah&quot; (). The basis for the Shīʿīte belief in ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib as the &quot;Wali&quot; of God is derived from the Qur&#x27;anic verse .

This additional phrase to the declaration of faith embodies the Shīʿīte emphasis on the inheritance of authority through Muhammad&#x27;s family and lineage. The three clauses of the Shīʿīte version of the &quot;Shahada&quot; thus address the fundamental Islamic beliefs of &quot;Tawḥīd&quot; (), &quot;Nubuwwah&quot; (), and &quot;Imamah&quot; ().

=== Infallibility (&quot;Ismah&quot;) ===
&quot;Ismah&quot; () is the concept of infallibility or &quot;divinely bestowed freedom from error and sin&quot; in Islam. Muslims believe that Muhammad, along with the other prophets and messengers, possessed &quot;ismah&quot;. Twelver and Ismāʿīlī Shīʿa Muslims also attribute the quality to Imams as well as to Fāṭimah, daughter of Muhammad, in contrast to the Zaydī Shīʿas, who do not attribute &quot;ismah&quot; to the Imams. Though initially beginning as a political movement, infallibility and sinlessness of the Imams later evolved as a distinct belief of (non-Zaydī) Shīʿīsm.

According to Shīʿa Muslim theologians, infallibility is considered a rational, necessary precondition for spiritual and religious guidance. They argue that since God has commanded absolute obedience from these figures, they must only order that which is right. The state of infallibility is based on the Shīʿīte interpretation of the verse of purification. Thus, they are the most pure ones, the only immaculate ones preserved from, and immune to, all uncleanness. It does not mean that supernatural powers prevent them from committing a sin, but due to the fact that they have absolute belief in God, they refrain from doing anything that is a sin.

They also have a complete knowledge of God&#x27;s will. They are in possession of all knowledge brought by the angels () to the prophets () and the messengers (). Their knowledge encompasses the totality of all times. Thus, they are believed to act without fault in religious matters. Shi&#x27;a Muslims regard ʿAlī ibn Abī Ṭālib as the successor of Muhammad not only ruling over the entire Muslim community in justice, but also in interpreting the Islamic faith, practices, and its esoteric meaning. ʿAlī is regarded as a &quot;perfect man&quot; () similar to Muhammad, according to the Shīʿīte perspective.

=== Occultation (&quot;Ghaybah&quot;) ===


The Occultation is an eschatological belief held in various denominations of Shīʿa Islam concerning a messianic figure, the hidden and last Imam known as &quot;the Mahdi&quot;, that one day shall return on Earth and fill the world with justice. According to the doctrine of Twelver Shīʿīsm, the main goal of Imam Mahdi will be to establish an Islamic state and to apply Islamic laws that were revealed to Muhammad. The Quran does not contain verses on the Imamate, which is the basic doctrine of Shīʿa Islam. Some Shīʿa subsects, such as the Zaydī Shīʿas and Nizārī Ismāʿīlīs, do not believe in the idea of the Occultation. The groups which do believe in it differ as to which lineage of the Imamate is valid, and therefore which individual has gone into Occultation. They believe there are many signs that will indicate the time of his return.

Twelver Shīʿa Muslims believe that the prophesied Mahdi and 12th Shīʿīte Imam, Hujjat Allah al-Mahdi, is already on Earth in Occultation, and will return at the end of time. Ṭayyibi Ismāʿīlīs and Fatimid/Bohra/Dawoodi Bohra believe the same but for their 21st Ṭayyib, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, and also believe that a &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; (&quot;Unrestricted Missionary&quot;) maintains contact with him. Sunnī Muslims believe that the future Mahdi has not yet arrived on Earth.

====Hadith tradition====
Shīʿa Muslims believe that the status of ʿAlī is supported by numerous &quot;ḥadīth&quot; reports, including the Hadith of the pond of Khumm, Hadith of the two weighty things, Hadith of the pen and paper, Hadith of the invitation of the close families, and Hadith of the Twelve Successors. In particular, the Hadith of the Cloak is often quoted to illustrate Muhammad&#x27;s feeling towards ʿAlī and his family by both Sunnī and Shia scholars. Shia Muslims prefer to study and read the hadith attributed to the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; and close associates, and most have their own separate hadith canon.

=== Holy Relics (&quot;Tabarruk&quot;) ===
Shīʿa Muslims believe that the armaments and sacred items of all of the Abrahamic prophets, including Muhammad, were handed down in succession to the Imams of the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot;. Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq, the 6th Shīʿīte Imam, in &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot; mentions that &quot;with me are the arms of the Messenger of Allah. It is not disputable.&quot;

Further, he claims that with him is the sword of the Messenger of God, his coat of arms, his Lamam (pennon) and his helmet. In addition, he mentions that with him is the flag of the Messenger of God, the victorious. With him is the Staff of Moses, the ring of Solomon, son of David, and the tray on which Moses used to offer his offerings. With him is the name that whenever the Messenger of God would place it between the Muslims and pagans no arrow from the pagans would reach the Muslims. With him is the similar object that angels brought.

Al-Ṣādiq also narrated that the passing down of armaments is synonymous to receiving the &quot;Imamat&quot; (leadership), similar to how the Ark of Covenant in the house of the Israelites signaled prophethood. Imam Ali al-Ridha narrates that wherever the armaments among us would go, knowledge would also follow and the armaments would never depart from those with knowledge (&quot;Imamat&quot;).

=== Other doctrines ===

==== Doctrine about necessity of acquiring knowledge ====
According to Muhammad Rida al-Muzaffar, God gives humans the faculty of reason and argument. Also, God orders humans to spend time thinking carefully on creation while he refers to all creations as his signs of power and glory. These signs encompass all of the universe. Furthermore, there is a similarity between humans as the little world and the universe as the large world. God does not accept the faith of those who follow him without thinking and only with imitation, but also God blames them for such actions. In other words, humans have to think about the universe with reason and intellect, a faculty bestowed on us by God. Since there is more insistence on the faculty of intellect among Shia Muslims, even evaluating the claims of someone who claims prophecy is on the basis of intellect.

== Practices ==
Shia religious practices, such as prayers, differ only slightly from the Sunnīs. While all Muslims pray five times daily, Shia Muslims have the option of combining &quot;Dhuhr&quot; with &quot;Asr&quot; and &quot;Maghrib&quot; with &quot;Isha&#x27;&quot;, as there are three distinct times mentioned in the Quran. The Sunnīs tend to combine only under certain circumstances.

=== Holidays ===
Shia Muslims celebrate the following annual holidays:
* Eid ul-Fitr, which marks the end of fasting during the month of Ramadan
* Eid al-Adha, which marks the end of the &quot;Hajj&quot; or pilgrimage to Mecca
* Eid al-Ghadeer, which is the anniversary of the Ghadir Khum, the occasion when Muhammad announced Ali&#x27;s Imamate before a multitude of Muslims. Eid al-Ghadeer is held on the 18th of Dhu al-Hijjah.
* The Mourning of Muharram and the Day of Ashura for Shia Muslims commemorate the martyrdom of Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī, brother of Ḥasan and grandson of Muhammad, who was killed by the army of Yazid ibn Muawiyah in Karbala (central Iraq). Ashura is a day of deep mourning which occurs on the 10th of Muharram.
* Arba&#x27;een commemorates the suffering of the women and children of Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī&#x27;s household. After Ḥusayn was killed, they were marched over the desert, from Karbala (central Iraq) to Shaam (Damascus, Syria). Many children (some of whom were direct descendants of Muhammad) died of thirst and exposure along the route. Arbaein occurs on the 20th of Safar, 40 days after Ashura.
* Mawlid, Muhammad&#x27;s birth date. Unlike Sunnī Muslims, who celebrate the 12th of Rabi&#x27; al-awwal as Muhammad&#x27;s day of birth or death (because they assert that his birth and death both occur in this week), Shia Muslims celebrate Muhammad&#x27;s birthday on the 17th of the month, which coincides with the birth date of Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq, the 6th Shīʿīte Imam.
* Fāṭimah&#x27;s birthday on 20th of Jumada al-Thani. This day is also considered as the &quot;&#x27;women and mothers&#x27; day&quot;
* ʿAlī&#x27;s birthday on 13th of Rajab.
* Mid-Sha&#x27;ban is the birth date of the 12th and final Twelver imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi. It is celebrated by Shia Muslims on the 15th of Sha&#x27;aban.
* Laylat al-Qadr, anniversary of the night of the revelation of the Quran.
* Eid al-Mubahila celebrates a meeting between the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; (household of Muhammad) and a Christian deputation from Najran. Al-Mubahila is held on the 24th of Dhu al-Hijjah.

=== Holy sites ===

After Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities of Islam, the cities of Najaf, Karbala, Mashhad and Qom are the most revered by Shīʿa Muslims. The Sanctuary of Imām ʿAlī in Najaf, the Shrine of Imam Ḥusayn in Karbala, The Sanctuary of Imam Reza in Mashhad and the Shrine of Fāṭimah al-Maʿṣūmah in Qom are very essential for Shīʿa Muslims. Other venerated pilgrimage sites include the Kadhimiya Mosque in Kadhimiya, Al-Askari Mosque in Samarra, the Sahla Mosque, the Great Mosque of Kufa, the Jamkaran Mosque in Qom, and the Tomb of Daniel in Susa.

Most of the Shīʿa sacred places and heritage sites in Saudi Arabia have been destroyed by the Al Saud-Wahhabi armies of the Ikhwan, the most notable being the tombs of the Imams located in the Al-Baqi&#x27; cemetery in 1925. In 2006, a bomb destroyed the shrine of Al-Askari Mosque. (&quot;See&quot;: Anti-Shi&#x27;ism).

=== Purity ===

Shia orthodoxy, particularly in Twelver Shi&#x27;ism, has considered non-Muslims as agents of impurity (&quot;Najāsat)&quot;. This categorization sometimes extends to &quot;kitābῑ&quot;, individuals belonging to the People of the Book, with Jews explicitly labeled as impure by certain Shia religious scholars. Armenians in Iran, who have historically played a crucial role in the Iranian economy, received relatively more lenient treatment.

Shi&#x27;ite theologians and &quot;mujtahids&quot; (jurists), such as Muḥammad Bāqir Majlisῑ, held that Jews&#x27; impurity extended to the point where they were advised to stay at home on rainy or snowy days to prevent contaminating their Shia neighbors. Ayatollah Khomeini, Supreme Leader of Iran from 1979 to 1989, asserted that every part of an unbeliever&#x27;s body, including hair, nails, and bodily secretions, is impure. However, the current leader of Iran, ʿAlī Khameneʾī, stated in a &quot;fatwa&quot; that Jews and other Peoples of the Book are not inherently impure, and touching the moisture on their hands does not convey impurity.

==Demographics==

Shia Islam is the second largest branch of Islam. It is estimated that 10–13% of the global Muslim population are Shias. They may number up to 200 million as of 2009. As of 1985, Shia Muslims are estimated to be 21% of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate.

Shia Muslims form a distinct majority of the population in three countries of the Muslim world: Iran, Iraq, and Azerbaijan. Shia Muslims constitute 36.3% of the entire population (and 38.6% of the Muslim population) of the Middle East.

Estimates have placed the proportion of Shia Muslims in Lebanon between 27% and 45% of the population, 30–35% of the citizen population in Kuwait (no figures exist for the non-citizen population), over 20% in Turkey, 5–20% of the population in Pakistan, and 10–19% of Afghanistan&#x27;s population, and 45% in Bahrain.

Saudi Arabia hosts a number of distinct Shia communities, including the Twelver Baharna in the Eastern Province and Nakhawila of Medina, and the Ismāʿīlī Sulaymani and Zaydī Shias of Najran. Estimations put the number of Shīʿīte citizens at roughly 15% of the local population. Approximately 40% of the population of Yemen are Shia Muslims.

Significant Shia communities also exist in the coastal regions of West Sumatra and Aceh in Indonesia (see Tabuik). The Shia presence is negligible elsewhere in Southeast Asia, where Muslims are predominantly Shāfiʿī Sunnīs.

A significant Shia minority is present in Nigeria, made up of modern-era converts to a Shīʿīte movement centered around Kano and Sokoto states. Several African countries like Kenya, South Africa, Somalia, etc. hold small minority populations of various Shia subsects, primarily descendants of immigrants from South Asia during the colonial period, such as the Khoja.

===Significant populations worldwide===
Figures indicated in the first three columns below are based on the October 2009 demographic study by the Pew Research Center report, &quot;Mapping the Global Muslim Population&quot;.


==Major denominations or branches==


The Shia community throughout its history split over the issue of the Imamate. The largest branch are the Twelvers, followed by the Zaydīs and the Ismāʿīlīs. Each subsect of Shīʿīsm follows its own line of Imamate. All mainstream Twelver and Ismāʿīlī Shia Muslims follow the same school of thought, the Jaʽfari jurisprudence, named after Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq, the 6th Shīʿīte Imam. Shīʿīte clergymen and jurists usually carry the title of &quot;mujtahid&quot; (i.e., someone authorized to issue legal opinions in Shia Islam).

===Twelver===
Twelver Shīʿīsm or Ithnāʿashariyyah is the largest branch of Shia Islam, and the terms &quot;Shia Muslim&quot; and &quot;Shia&quot; often refer to the Twelvers by default. The designation &quot;Twelver&quot; is derived from the doctrine of believing in twelve divinely ordained leaders, known as &quot;the Twelve Imams&quot;. Twelver Shia are otherwise known as &quot;Imami&quot; or &quot;Jaʿfari&quot;; the latter term derives from Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq, the 6th Shīʿīte Imam, who elaborated the Twelver jurisprudence. Twelver Shia constitute the majority of the population in Iran (90%), Azerbaijan (85%), Bahrain (70%), Iraq (65%), and Lebanon (65% of Muslims). Significant populations also exist in Afghanistan, Bahrain and Lebanon.

====Doctrine====
Twelver doctrine is based on five principles. These five principles known as &quot;Usul ad-Din&quot; are as follow:
# Monotheism: God is one and unique;
# Justice: the concept of moral rightness based on ethics, fairness, and equity, along with the punishment of the breach of these ethics;
# Prophethood: the institution by which God sends emissaries, or prophets, to guide humankind;
# Leadership: a divine institution which succeeded the institution of Prophethood. Its appointees (&quot;Imams&quot;) are divinely appointed;
# Resurrection and Last Judgment: God&#x27;s final assessment of humanity.

====Books====
Besides the Quran, which is the sacred text common to all Muslims, Twelver Shias derive scriptural and authoritative guidance from collections of sayings and traditions (hadith) attributed to Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Below is a list of some of the most prominent of these books:
* &quot;Nahj al-Balagha&quot; by Ash-Sharif Ar-Radhi – the most famous collection of sermons, letters &amp; narration attributed to Ali, the first Imam regarded by Shias
* &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot; by Muhammad ibn Ya&#x27;qub al-Kulayni
* &quot;Wasa&#x27;il al-Shiʻah&quot; by al-Hurr al-Amili

====The Twelve Imams====

According to the theology of Twelvers, the successor of Muhammad is an infallible human individual who not only rules over the Muslim community with justice but also is able to keep and interpret the divine law (&quot;sharīʿa&quot;) and its esoteric meaning. The words and deeds of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams are a guide and model for the Muslim community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and Imams must be chosen by divine decree (&quot;nass&quot;) through Muhammad. The twelfth and final Imam is Hujjat Allah al-Mahdi, who is believed by Twelvers to be currently alive and hidden in Occultation.

====Jurisprudence====

The Twelver jurisprudence is called &quot;Jaʽfari jurisprudence&quot;. In this school of Islamic jurisprudence, the &quot;sunnah&quot; is considered to be comprehensive of the oral traditions of Muhammad and their implementation and interpretation by the Twelve Imams. There are three schools of Jaʿfari jurisprudence: Usuli, Akhbari, and Shaykhi; the Usuli school is by far the largest of the three. Twelver groups that do not follow the Jaʿfari jurisprudence include Alevis, Bektashi, and Qizilbash.

The five pillars of Islam to the Jaʿfari jurisprudence are known as &quot;Usul ad-Din&quot;:
# &quot;Tawḥīd&quot;: unity and oneness of God;
# &quot;Nubuwwah&quot;: prophethood of Muhammad;
# &quot;Muʿad&quot;: resurrection and final judgment;
# &quot;ʿAdl&quot;: justice of God;
# &quot;Imamah&quot;: the rightful place of the Shīʿīte Imams.

In Jaʿfari jurisprudence, there are eight secondary pillars, known as &quot;Furu ad-Din&quot;, which are as follows:
# &quot;Salat&quot; (prayer);
# &quot;Sawm&quot; (fasting);
# &quot;Hajj&quot; (pilgrimage) to Mecca;
# &quot;Zakāt&quot; (alms giving to the poor);
# &quot;Jihād&quot; (struggle) for the righteous cause;
# Directing others towards good;
# Directing others away from evil;
# &quot;Khums&quot; (20% tax on savings yearly, after deduction of commercial expenses).

According to Twelvers, defining and interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence (&quot;fiqh&quot;) is the responsibility of Muhammad and the Twelve Imams. Since the 12th Imam is currently in Occultation, it is the duty of Shīʿīte clerics to refer to the Islamic literature, such as the Quran and hadith, and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, clergymen in Twelver Shīʿīsm are believed to be the guardians of &quot;fiqh&quot;, which is believed to have been defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as &quot;ijtihad&quot; and the clerics are known as &quot;marjaʿ&quot;, meaning &quot;reference&quot;; the labels &quot;Allamah&quot; and &quot;Ayatollah&quot; are in use for Twelver clerics.

====Islamists====
Islamist Shīʿīsm () is a new denomination within Twelver Shīʿīsm greatly inspired by the political ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood and mysticism of Ibn Arabi. It sees Islam as a political system and differs from the other mainstream Usuli and Akhbari groups in favoring the idea of the establishment of an Islamic state in Occultation under the rule of the 12th Imam. Hadi Khosroshahi was the first person to identify himself as &quot;ikhwani&quot; (Islamist) Shia Muslim. Because of the concept of the hidden Imam, Muhammad al-Mahdi, Shia Islam is inherently secular in the age of Occultation, therefore Islamist Shia Muslims had to borrow ideas from Sunnī Islamists and adjust them in accordance with the doctrine of Shīʿīsm. Its foundations were laid during the Persian Constitutional Revolution at the start of 20th century in Qajar Empire (1905–1911), when Fazlullah Nouri supported the Persian king Ahmad Shah Qajar against the will of Muhammad Kazim Khurasani, the Usuli &quot;marjaʿ&quot; of the time.

===Ismāʿīlī===
Ismāʿīlīs, otherwise known as &quot;Sevener&quot;, derive their name from their acceptance of Ismāʿīl ibn Jaʿfar as the divinely appointed spiritual successor (Imam) to Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq, the 6th Shīʿīte Imam, wherein they differ from the Twelvers, who recognize Mūsā al-Kāẓim, younger brother of Ismāʿīl, as the true Imam.

After the death or Occultation of Muhammad ibn Imam Ismāʿīl in the 8th century CE, the teachings of Ismāʿīlīsm further transformed into the belief system as it is known today, with an explicit concentration on the deeper, esoteric meaning (&quot;bāṭin&quot;) of the Islamic faith. With the eventual development of Twelver Shīʿīsm into the more literalistic &quot;(zahīr)&quot; oriented Akhbari and later Usuli schools of thought, Shīʿīsm further developed in two separate directions: the metaphorical Ismāʿīlī group focusing on the mystical path and nature of God and the divine manifestation in the personage of the &quot;Imam of the Time&quot; as the &quot;Face of God&quot;, with the more literalistic Twelver group focusing on divine law (&quot;sharī&#x27;ah&quot;) and the deeds and sayings (&quot;sunnah&quot;) attributed to Muhammad and his successors (the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot;), who as A&#x27;immah were guides and a light (&quot;nūr&quot;) to God.
Though there are several subsects amongst the Ismāʿīlīs, the term in today&#x27;s vernacular generally refers to the Shia Imami Ismāʿīlī Nizārī community, often referred to as the &quot;Ismāʿīlīs&quot; by default, who are followers of the Aga Khan and the largest group within Ismāʿīlīsm. Another Shia Imami Ismāʿīlī community are the Dawudi Bohras, led by a &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; (&quot;Unrestricted Missionary&quot;) as representative of a hidden Imam. While there are many other branches with extremely differing exterior practices, much of the spiritual theology has remained the same since the days of the faith&#x27;s early Imams. In recent centuries, Ismāʿīlīs have largely been an Indo-Iranian community, but they can also be found in India, Pakistan, Syria, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, East and South Africa, and in recent years several Ismāʿīlīs have emigrated to China, Western Europe (primarily in the United Kingdom), Australia, New Zealand, and North America.

====Ismāʿīlī Imams====
In the Nizārī Ismāʿīlī interpretation of Shia Islam, the Imam is the guide and the intercessor between humans and God, and the individual through whom God is recognized. He is also responsible for the esoteric interpretation of the Quran (&quot;taʾwīl&quot;). He is the possessor of divine knowledge and therefore the &quot;Prime Teacher&quot;. According to the &quot;Epistle of the Right Path&quot;, a Persian Ismāʿīlī prose text from the post-Mongol period of Ismāʿīlī history, by an anonymous author, there has been a chain of Imams since the beginning of time, and there will continue to be an Imam present on the Earth until the end of time. The worlds would not exist in perfection without this uninterrupted chain of Imams. The proof (&quot;hujja&quot;) and gate (&quot;bāb&quot;) of the Imam are always aware of his presence and are witness to this uninterrupted chain.

After the death of Ismāʿīl ibn Jaʿfar, many Ismāʿīlīs believed that one day the eschatological figure of Imam Mahdi, whom they believed to be Muhammad ibn Imam Ismāʿīl, would return and establish an age of justice. One group included the violent Qarmatians, who had a stronghold in Bahrain. In contrast, some Ismāʿīlīs believed the Imamate &quot;did&quot; continue, and that the Imams were in Occultation and still communicated and taught their followers through a network of &quot;Da&#x27;i&quot; (&quot;Missionaries&quot;).

In 909 CE, Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah, a claimant to the Ismāʿīlī Imamate, established the Fatimid Caliphate. During this period, three lineages of Imams were formed. The first branch, known today as the Druze, began with Al-Ḥākim bi-Amr Allāh. Born in 985 CE, he ascended as ruler at the age of eleven. When in 1021 CE his mule returned without him, soaked in blood, a religious group that was forming in his lifetime broke off from mainstream Ismāʿīlīsm and did not acknowledge his successor. Later to be known as the Druze, they believe Al-Ḥākim to be God incarnate and the prophesied Mahdi on Earth, who would one day return and bring justice to the world. The Druze faith further split from Ismāʿīlīsm as it developed into a distinct monotheistic Abrahamic religion and ethno-religious group with its own unique doctrines, and finally separated from both Ismāʿīlīsm and Islam altogether. Thus, the Druze do not identify themselves as Muslims, and are not considered as such by Muslims either.

The second split occurred between Nizārī and Musta‘lī Ismāʿīlīs following the death of Ma&#x27;ad al-Mustansir Billah in 1094 CE. His rule was the longest of any caliph in any Islamic empire. Upon his death, his sons, Nizār (the older) and Al-Musta‘lī (the younger), fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty. Nizār was defeated and jailed, but according to the Nizārī tradition his son escaped to Alamut, where the Iranian Ismāʿīlī had accepted his claim. From here on, the Nizārī Ismāʿīlī community has continued with a present, living Imam.

The Musta‘lī Ismāʿīlīs split between the Ṭayyibi and the Ḥāfiẓi; Ṭayyibi Ismāʿīlīs, also known as &quot;Bohras&quot;, are further divided between Dawudi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, and Alavi Bohras. The former denomination claims that At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, son of Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, and the Imams following him went into a period of anonymity (&quot;Dawr-e-Satr&quot;) and appointed a &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; (&quot;Unrestricted Missionary&quot;) to guide the community, in a similar manner as the Ismāʿīlīs had lived after the death of Muhammad ibn Imam Ismāʿīl. The latter denomination claims that the ruling Fatimid caliph was the Imam, and they died out with the fall of the Fatimid Empire.

====Pillars====
Ismāʿīlīs have categorized their practices which are known as &quot;seven pillars&quot;:
====Contemporary leadership====
The Nizārīs place importance on a scholarly institution because of the existence of a present Imam. The Imam of the Age defines the jurisprudence, and his guidance may differ with Imams previous to him because of different times and circumstances. For Nizārī Ismāʿīlīs, the current Imam is Karim al-Husayni Aga Khan IV. The Nizārī line of Imams has continued to this day as an uninterrupted chain.

Divine leadership has continued in the Bohra branch through the institution of the &quot;Missionary&quot; (&quot;Da&#x27;i&quot;). According to the Bohra tradition, before the last Imam, At-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim, went into seclusion, his father, the 20th Al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah, had instructed Al-Hurra Al-Malika the Malika (Queen consort) in Yemen to appoint a vicegerent after the seclusion—the &quot;Da&#x27;i al-Mutlaq&quot; (&quot;Unrestricted Missionary&quot;), who as the Imam&#x27;s vicegerent has full authority to govern the community in all matters both spiritual and temporal while the lineage of Musta‘lī-Ṭayyibi Imams remains in seclusion (&quot;Dawr-e-Satr&quot;). The three branches of Musta‘lī Ismāʿīlīs (Dawudi Bohras, Sulaymani Bohras, and Alavi Bohras) differ on who the current &quot;Unrestricted Missionary&quot; is.

===Zaydī===

Zaydism, otherwise known as Zaydiyya or as Zaydī Shīʿism, is a branch of Shia Islam named after Zayd ibn ʿAlī. Followers of the Zaydī school of jurisprudence are called Zaydīs or occasionally &quot;Fivers&quot;. However, there is also a group called &quot;Zaydī Wāsiṭīs&quot; who are Twelvers (see below). Zaydīs constitute roughly 42–47% of the population of Yemen.

====Doctrine====
The Zaydīs, Twelvers, and Ismāʿīlīs all recognize the same first four Imams; however, the Zaydīs consider Zayd ibn ʿAlī as the 5th Imam. After the time of Zayd ibn ʿAlī, the Zaydīs believed that any descendant (&quot;Sayyid&quot;) of Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī or Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī could become the next Imam, after fulfilling certain conditions. Other well-known Zaydī Imams in history were Yahya ibn Zayd, Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya, and Ibrahim ibn Abdullah.

The Zaydī doctrine of Imamah does not presuppose the infallibility of the Imam, nor the belief that the Imams are supposed to receive divine guidance. Moreover, Zaydīs do not believe that the Imamate must pass from father to son but believe it can be held by any &quot;Sayyid&quot; descended from either Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī or Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī (as was the case after the death of the former). Historically, Zaydīs held that Zayd ibn ʿAlī was the rightful successor of the 4th Imam since he led a rebellion against the Umayyads in protest of their tyranny and corruption. Muhammad al-Baqir did not engage in political action, and the followers of Zayd ibn ʿAlī maintained that a true Imam must fight against corrupt rulers.

====Jurisprudence====
In matters of Islamic jurisprudence, Zaydīs follow the teachings of Zayd ibn ʿAlī, which are documented in his book &quot;Majmu&#x27;l Fiqh&quot; (in Arabic: ). Al-Ḥādī ila&#x27;l-Ḥaqq Yaḥyā, the first Zaydī Imam and founder of the Zaydī State in Yemen, is regarded as the codifier of Zaydī jurisprudence, and as such most Zaydī Shias today are known as &quot;Hadawis&quot;.

====Timeline====
The Idrisids () were Arab Zaydī Shias whose dynasty, named after its first sultan, Idris I, ruled in the western Maghreb from 788 to 985 CE. Another Zaydī State was established in the region of Gilan, Deylaman, and Tabaristan (northern Iran) in 864 CE by the Alavids; it lasted until the death of its leader at the hand of the Samanids in 928 CE. Roughly forty years later, the Zaydī State was revived in Gilan and survived under Hasanid leaders until 1126 CE. Afterwards, from the 12th to 13th centuries, the Zaydī Shias of Deylaman, Gilan, and Tabaristan then acknowledged the Zaydī Imams of Yemen or rival Zaydī Imams within Iran.

The Buyids were initially Zaydī Shias, as were the Banu Ukhaidhir rulers of al-Yamama in the 9th and 10th centuries. The leader of the Zaydī community took the title of caliph; thus, the ruler of Yemen was known by this title. Al-Hadi Yahya bin al-Hussain bin al-Qasim ar-Rassi, a descendant of Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī, founded the Zaydī Imamate at Sa&#x27;dah in 893–897 CE, and the Rassid dynasty continued to rule over Yemen until the middle of the 20th century, when the republican revolution of 1962 deposed the last Zaydī Imam. (&quot;See&quot;: Arab Cold War). The founding Zaydī branch in Yemen was the Jarudiyya; however, with increasing interaction with the Ḥanafī and Shāfiʿī schools of Sunnī jurisprudence, there was a shift from the Jarudiyya group to the Sulaimaniyya, Tabiriyya, Butriyya, and Salihiyya. Zaydī Shias form the second dominant religious group in Yemen. Currently, they constitute about 40–45% of the population in Yemen; Jaʿfaris and Ismāʿīlīs constitute the 2–5%. In Saudi Arabia, it is estimated that there are over 1 million Zaydī Shias, primarily based in the western provinces.

Currently, the most prominent Zaydī political movement is the Houthi movement in Yemen, known by the name of &quot;Shabab al-Mu&#x27;mineen&quot; (&quot;Believing Youth&quot;) or &quot;Ansar Allah&quot; (&quot;Partisans of God&quot;). In 2014–2015, Houthis took over the Yemeni government in Sana&#x27;a, which led to the fall of the Saudi Arabian-backed government of Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Houthis and their allies gained control of a significant part of Yemen&#x27;s territory, and resisted the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen seeking to restore Hadi in power. (&quot;See&quot;: Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict). Both the Houthis and the Saudi Arabian-led coalition were being attacked by the Sunnī Islamist militant group and Salafi-jihadist terrorist organization ISIL/ISIS/IS/Daesh.

==Persecution of shia muslims==

The history of Shia–Sunnī relations has often involved religious discrimination, persecution, and violence, dating back to the earliest development of the two competing sects.
At various times throughout the history of Islam, Shia groups and minorities have faced persecution perpetrated by Sunnī Muslims.

Militarily established and holding control over the Umayyad government, many Sunnī rulers perceived the Shias as a threat—both to their political and religious authority. The Sunnī rulers under the Umayyad dynasty sought to marginalize the Shia minority, and later the Abbasids turned on their Shia allies and imprisoned, persecuted, and killed them. The persecution of Shia Muslims throughout history by their Sunnī co-religionists has often been characterized by brutal and genocidal acts. Comprising only about 10–15% of the global Muslim population, Shia Muslims remain a marginalized community to this day in many Sunnī-dominant Arab countries, without the rights to practice their religion and freely organize.

In 1514, the Ottoman sultan Selim I (1512–1520) ordered the massacre of 40,000 Alevis and Bektashi (Anatolian Shia Muslims). According to Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, &quot;Sultan Selim I carried things so far that he announced that the killing of one Shia had as much otherworldly reward as killing 70 Christians.&quot; In 1802, the Al Saud-Wahhabi armies of the Ikhwan from the First Saudi State (1727–1818) attacked and sacked the city of Karbala, the Shia shrine in Najaf (eastern region of Iraq) that commemorates the martyrdom and death of Ḥusayn ibn ʿAlī.

During the rule of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Ba&#x27;athist Iraq, Shia political activists were arrested, tortured, expelled or killed, as part of a crackdown launched after an assassination attempt against Iraq&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz in 1980. In March 2011, the Malaysian government declared Shia Islam a &quot;deviant&quot; sect and banned Shia Muslims from promoting their faith to other Muslims, but left them free to practice it themselves privately.

The most recent campaign of anti-Shia oppression was the Islamic State organization&#x27;s persecution of Shias in its territories in Northern Iraq, which occurred alongside the persecution of various religious groups and the genocide of Yazidis by the same organization during the Second Iraq War.

<text>In physics, the special theory of relativity, or special relativity for short, is a scientific theory of the relationship between space and time. In Albert Einstein&#x27;s 1905 paper, On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies, the theory is presented as being based on just two postulates:
# The laws of physics are invariant (identical) in all inertial frames of reference (that is, frames of reference with no acceleration). This is known as the principle of relativity.
# The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of light source or observer. This is known as the principle of light constancy, or the principle of light speed invariance.
The first postulate was first formulated by Galileo Galilei (see &quot;Galilean invariance&quot;).

== Origins and significance ==

Special relativity was described by Albert Einstein in a paper published on 26 September 1905 titled &quot;On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies&quot;. Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetism appeared to be incompatible with Newtonian mechanics, and the Michelson–Morley experiment failed to detect the Earth&#x27;s motion against the hypothesized luminiferous aether. These led to the development of the Lorentz transformations, by Hendrik Lorentz, which adjust distances and times for moving objects. Special relativity corrects the hitherto laws of mechanics to handle situations involving all motions and especially those at a speed close to that of light (known as &quot;&quot;). Today, special relativity is proven to be the most accurate model of motion at any speed when gravitational and quantum effects are negligible. Even so, the Newtonian model is still valid as a simple and accurate approximation at low velocities (relative to the speed of light), for example, everyday motions on Earth.

Special relativity has a wide range of consequences that have been experimentally verified. These include the relativity of simultaneity, length contraction, time dilation, the relativistic velocity addition formula, the relativistic Doppler effect, relativistic mass, a universal speed limit, mass–energy equivalence, the speed of causality and the Thomas precession. It has, for example, replaced the conventional notion of an absolute universal time with the notion of a time that is dependent on reference frame and spatial position. Rather than an invariant time interval between two events, there is an invariant spacetime interval. Combined with other laws of physics, the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy, as expressed in the mass–energy equivalence formula , where formula_1 is the speed of light in vacuum. It also explains how the phenomena of electricity and magnetism are related.

A defining feature of special relativity is the replacement of the Galilean transformations of Newtonian mechanics with the Lorentz transformations. Time and space cannot be defined separately from each other (as was previously thought to be the case). Rather, space and time are interwoven into a single continuum known as &quot;spacetime&quot;. Events that occur at the same time for one observer can occur at different times for another.

Until several years later when Einstein developed general relativity, which introduced a curved spacetime to incorporate gravity, the phrase &quot;special relativity&quot; was not used. A translation sometimes used is &quot;restricted relativity&quot;; &quot;special&quot; really means &quot;special case&quot;. Some of the work of Albert Einstein in special relativity is built on the earlier work by Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré. The theory became essentially complete in 1907, with Hermann Minkowski&#x27;s papers on spacetime.

The theory is &quot;special&quot; in that it only applies in the special case where the spacetime is &quot;flat&quot;, that is, where the curvature of spacetime (a consequence of the energy–momentum tensor and representing gravity) is negligible. To correctly accommodate gravity, Einstein formulated general relativity in 1915. Special relativity, contrary to some historical descriptions, does accommodate accelerations as well as accelerating frames of reference.

Just as Galilean relativity is now accepted to be an approximation of special relativity that is valid for low speeds, special relativity is considered an approximation of general relativity that is valid for weak gravitational fields, that is, at a sufficiently small scale (e.g., when tidal forces are negligible) and in conditions of free fall. But general relativity incorporates non-Euclidean geometry to represent gravitational effects as the geometric curvature of spacetime. Special relativity is restricted to the flat spacetime known as Minkowski space. As long as the universe can be modeled as a pseudo-Riemannian manifold, a Lorentz-invariant frame that abides by special relativity can be defined for a sufficiently small neighborhood of each point in this curved spacetime.

Galileo Galilei had already postulated that there is no absolute and well-defined state of rest (no privileged reference frames), a principle now called Galileo&#x27;s principle of relativity. Einstein extended this principle so that it accounted for the constant speed of light, a phenomenon that had been observed in the Michelson–Morley experiment. He also postulated that it holds for all the laws of physics, including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics.

== Traditional &quot;two postulates&quot; approach to special relativity ==

Einstein discerned two fundamental propositions that seemed to be the most assured, regardless of the exact validity of the (then) known laws of either mechanics or electrodynamics. These propositions were the constancy of the speed of light in vacuum and the independence of physical laws (especially the constancy of the speed of light) from the choice of inertial system. In his initial presentation of special relativity in 1905 he expressed these postulates as:
* The principle of relativity – the laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not affected, whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems in uniform translatory motion relative to each other.
* The principle of invariant light speed – &quot;... light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity [speed] &quot;c&quot; which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body&quot; (from the preface). That is, light in vacuum propagates with the speed &quot;c&quot; (a fixed constant, independent of direction) in at least one system of inertial coordinates (the &quot;stationary system&quot;), regardless of the state of motion of the light source.

The constancy of the speed of light was motivated by Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism and the lack of evidence for the luminiferous ether. There is conflicting evidence on the extent to which Einstein was influenced by the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment. In any case, the null result of the Michelson–Morley experiment helped the notion of the constancy of the speed of light gain widespread and rapid acceptance.

The derivation of special relativity depends not only on these two explicit postulates, but also on several tacit assumptions (made in almost all theories of physics), including the isotropy and homogeneity of space and the independence of measuring rods and clocks from their past history.

Following Einstein&#x27;s original presentation of special relativity in 1905, many different sets of postulates have been proposed in various alternative derivations. But the most common set of postulates remains those employed by Einstein in his original paper. A more mathematical statement of the principle of relativity made later by Einstein, which introduces the concept of simplicity not mentioned above is:
Henri Poincaré provided the mathematical framework for relativity theory by proving that Lorentz transformations are a subset of his Poincaré group of symmetry transformations. Einstein later derived these transformations from his axioms.

Many of Einstein&#x27;s papers present derivations of the Lorentz transformation based upon these two principles.

== Principle of relativity ==
=== Reference frames and relative motion ===

Reference frames play a crucial role in relativity theory. The term reference frame as used here is an observational perspective in space that is not undergoing any change in motion (acceleration), from which a position can be measured along 3 spatial axes (so, at rest or constant velocity). In addition, a reference frame has the ability to determine measurements of the time of events using a &quot;clock&quot; (any reference device with uniform periodicity).

An event is an occurrence that can be assigned a single unique moment and location in space relative to a reference frame: it is a &quot;point&quot; in spacetime. Since the speed of light is constant in relativity irrespective of the reference frame, pulses of light can be used to unambiguously measure distances and refer back to the times that events occurred to the clock, even though light takes time to reach the clock after the event has transpired.

For example, the explosion of a firecracker may be considered to be an &quot;event&quot;. We can completely specify an event by its four spacetime coordinates: The time of occurrence and its 3-dimensional spatial location define a reference point. Let&#x27;s call this reference frame &quot;S&quot;.

In relativity theory, we often want to calculate the coordinates of an event from differing reference frames. The equations that relate measurements made in different frames are called &quot;transformation equations&quot;.

=== Standard configuration ===
To gain insight into how the spacetime coordinates measured by observers in different reference frames compare with each other, it is useful to work with a simplified setup with frames in a &quot;standard configuration&quot;. With care, this allows simplification of the math with no loss of generality in the conclusions that are reached. In Fig. 2-1, two Galilean reference frames (i.e., conventional 3-space frames) are displayed in relative motion. Frame S belongs to a first observer &quot;O&quot;, and frame (pronounced &quot;S prime&quot; or &quot;S dash&quot;) belongs to a second observer .
* The &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; axes of frame S are oriented parallel to the respective primed axes of frame .
* Frame moves, for simplicity, in a single direction: the &quot;x&quot;-direction of frame S with a constant velocity &quot;v&quot; as measured in frame &quot;S&quot;.
* The origins of frames S and are coincident when time for frame S and for frame .

Since there is no absolute reference frame in relativity theory, a concept of &quot;moving&quot; does not strictly exist, as everything may be moving with respect to some other reference frame. Instead, any two frames that move at the same speed in the same direction are said to be &quot;comoving&quot;. Therefore, &quot;S&quot; and are not &quot;comoving&quot;.

=== Lack of an absolute reference frame ===
The principle of relativity, which states that physical laws have the same form in each inertial reference frame, dates back to Galileo, and was incorporated into Newtonian physics. But in the late 19th century the existence of electromagnetic waves led some physicists to suggest that the universe was filled with a substance they called &quot;aether&quot;, which, they postulated, would act as the medium through which these waves, or vibrations, propagated (in many respects similar to the way sound propagates through air). The aether was thought to be an absolute reference frame against which all speeds could be measured, and could be considered fixed and motionless relative to Earth or some other fixed reference point. The aether was supposed to be sufficiently elastic to support electromagnetic waves, while those waves could interact with matter, yet offering no resistance to bodies passing through it (its one property was that it allowed electromagnetic waves to propagate). The results of various experiments, including the Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887 (subsequently verified with more accurate and innovative experiments), led to the theory of special relativity, by showing that the aether did not exist. Einstein&#x27;s solution was to discard the notion of an aether and the absolute state of rest. In relativity, any reference frame moving with uniform motion will observe the same laws of physics. In particular, the speed of light in vacuum is always measured to be &quot;c&quot;, even when measured by multiple systems that are moving at different (but constant) velocities.

=== Relativity without the second postulate ===
From the principle of relativity alone without assuming the constancy of the speed of light (i.e., using the isotropy of space and the symmetry implied by the principle of special relativity) it can be shown that the spacetime transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean, Galilean, or Lorentzian. In the Lorentzian case, one can then obtain relativistic interval conservation and a certain finite limiting speed. Experiments suggest that this speed is the speed of light in vacuum.

== Lorentz invariance as the essential core of special relativity ==
=== Alternative approaches to special relativity ===
Einstein consistently based the derivation of Lorentz invariance (the essential core of special relativity) on just the two basic principles of: relativity and invariance of the speed of light. He wrote:
Thus many modern treatments of special relativity base it on the single postulate of universal Lorentz covariance, or, equivalently, on the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime.

Rather than considering universal Lorentz covariance to be a derived principle, this article considers it to be the fundamental postulate of special relativity. The traditional two-postulate approach to special relativity is presented in innumerable college textbooks and popular presentations. Textbooks starting with the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime include those by Taylor and Wheeler and by Callahan. This is also the approach followed by the Wikipedia articles Spacetime and Minkowski diagram.

=== Lorentz transformation and its inverse ===

Define an event to have spacetime coordinates in system &quot;S&quot; and in a reference frame moving at a velocity &quot;v&quot; on the &quot;x&quot;-axis with respect to that frame, . Then the Lorentz transformation specifies that these coordinates are related in the following way:
formula_2
where formula_3 is the Lorentz factor and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum, and the velocity &quot;v&quot; of , relative to &quot;S&quot;, is parallel to the &quot;x&quot;-axis. For simplicity, the &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; coordinates are unaffected; only the &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot; coordinates are transformed. These Lorentz transformations form a one-parameter group of linear mappings, that parameter being called rapidity.

Solving the four transformation equations above for the unprimed coordinates yields the inverse Lorentz transformation:
formula_4

This shows that the unprimed frame is moving with the velocity −&quot;v&quot;, as measured in the primed frame.

There is nothing special about the &quot;x&quot;-axis. The transformation can apply to the &quot;y&quot;- or &quot;z&quot;-axis, or indeed in any direction parallel to the motion (which are warped by the &quot;γ&quot; factor) and perpendicular; see the article Lorentz transformation for details.

A quantity that is invariant under Lorentz transformations is known as a Lorentz scalar.

Writing the Lorentz transformation and its inverse in terms of coordinate differences, where one event has coordinates and , another event has coordinates and , and the differences are defined as
*    formula_5
*    formula_6
we get
*    formula_7 formula_8
*    formula_9 formula_10

If we take differentials instead of taking differences, we get
*    formula_11 formula_12
*    formula_13 formula_14

=== Graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation ===
Spacetime diagrams (Minkowski diagrams) are an extremely useful aid to visualizing how coordinates transform between different reference frames. Although it is not as easy to perform exact computations using them as directly invoking the Lorentz transformations, their main power is their ability to provide an intuitive grasp of the results of a relativistic scenario.

To draw a spacetime diagram, begin by considering two Galilean reference frames, S and S′, in standard configuration, as shown in Fig. 2-1.

Fig. 3-1a. Draw the formula_15 and formula_16 axes of frame S. The formula_15 axis is horizontal and the formula_16 (actually formula_19) axis is vertical, which is the opposite of the usual convention in kinematics. The formula_19 axis is scaled by a factor of formula_1 so that both axes have common units of length. In the diagram shown, the gridlines are spaced one unit distance apart. The 45° diagonal lines represent the &quot;worldlines&quot; of two photons passing through the origin at time formula_22 The slope of these worldlines is 1 because the photons advance one unit in space per unit of time. Two events, formula_23 and formula_24 have been plotted on this graph so that their coordinates may be compared in the S and S&#x27; frames.

Fig. 3-1b. Draw the formula_25 and formula_26 axes of frame S&#x27;. The formula_26 axis represents the worldline of the origin of the S&#x27; coordinate system as measured in frame S. In this figure, formula_28 Both the formula_26 and formula_25 axes are tilted from the unprimed axes by an angle formula_31 where formula_32 The primed and unprimed axes share a common origin because frames S and S&#x27; had been set up in standard configuration, so that formula_33 when formula_34

Fig. 3-1c. Units in the primed axes have a different scale from units in the unprimed axes. From the Lorentz transformations, we observe that formula_35 coordinates of formula_36 in the primed coordinate system transform to formula_37 in the unprimed coordinate system. Likewise, formula_35 coordinates of formula_39 in the primed coordinate system transform to formula_40 in the unprimed system. Draw gridlines parallel with the formula_26 axis through points formula_42 as measured in the unprimed frame, where formula_43 is an integer. Likewise, draw gridlines parallel with the formula_25 axis through formula_45 as measured in the unprimed frame. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we observe that the spacing between formula_26 units equals formula_47 times the spacing between formula_19 units, as measured in frame S. This ratio is always greater than 1, and ultimately it approaches infinity as formula_49

Fig. 3-1d. Since the speed of light is an invariant, the &quot;worldlines&quot; of two photons passing through the origin at time formula_50 still plot as 45° diagonal lines. The primed coordinates of formula_23 and formula_52 are related to the unprimed coordinates through the Lorentz transformations and &quot;could&quot; be approximately measured from the graph (assuming that it has been plotted accurately enough), but the real merit of a Minkowski diagram is its granting us a geometric view of the scenario. For example, in this figure, we observe that the two timelike-separated events that had different x-coordinates in the unprimed frame are now at the same position in space.

While the unprimed frame is drawn with space and time axes that meet at right angles, the primed frame is drawn with axes that meet at acute or obtuse angles. This asymmetry is due to unavoidable distortions in how spacetime coordinates map onto a Cartesian plane, but the frames are actually equivalent.

== Consequences derived from the Lorentz transformation ==
The consequences of special relativity can be derived from the Lorentz transformation equations. These transformations, and hence special relativity, lead to different physical predictions than those of Newtonian mechanics at all relative velocities, and most pronounced when relative velocities become comparable to the speed of light. The speed of light is so much larger than anything most humans encounter that some of the effects predicted by relativity are initially counterintuitive.

=== Invariant interval ===
In Galilean relativity, the spatial separation, (), and the temporal separation, (), between two events are independent invariants, the values of which do not change when observed from different frames of reference.
In special relativity, however, the interweaving of spatial and temporal coordinates generates the concept of an invariant interval, denoted as :
formula_53
In considering the physical significance of , there are three cases to note:
* Δs2 &gt; 0: In this case, the two events are separated by more time than space, and they are hence said to be &quot;timelike&quot; separated. This implies that , and given the Lorentz transformation , it is evident that there exists a formula_54 less than formula_1 for which formula_56 (in particular, ). In other words, given two events that are timelike separated, it is possible to find a frame in which the two events happen at the same place. In this frame, the separation in time, , is called the &quot;proper time&quot;.
* Δs2 &lt; 0: In this case, the two events are separated by more space than time, and they are hence said to be &quot;spacelike&quot; separated. This implies that , and given the Lorentz transformation , there exists a formula_54 less than formula_1 for which formula_59 (in particular, ). In other words, given two events that are spacelike separated, it is possible to find a frame in which the two events happen at the same time. In this frame, the separation in space, , is called the &quot;proper distance&quot;, or &quot;proper length&quot;. For values of formula_54 greater than and less than , the sign of formula_61 changes, meaning that the temporal order of spacelike-separated events changes depending on the frame in which the events are viewed. But the temporal order of timelike-separated events is absolute, since the only way that formula_54 could be greater than formula_63 would be if .
* Δs2 = 0: In this case, the two events are said to be &quot;lightlike&quot; separated. This implies that , and this relationship is frame independent due to the invariance of . From this, we observe that the speed of light is formula_1 in every inertial frame. In other words, starting from the assumption of universal Lorentz covariance, the constant speed of light is a derived result, rather than a postulate as in the two-postulates formulation of the special theory.

The interweaving of space and time revokes the implicitly assumed concepts of absolute simultaneity and synchronization across non-comoving frames.

The form of , being the &quot;difference&quot; of the squared time lapse and the squared spatial distance, demonstrates a fundamental discrepancy between Euclidean and spacetime distances. The invariance of this interval is a property of the &quot;general&quot; Lorentz transform (also called the Poincaré transformation), making it an isometry of spacetime. The general Lorentz transform extends the standard Lorentz transform (which deals with translations without rotation, that is, Lorentz boosts, in the x-direction) with all other translations, reflections, and rotations between any Cartesian inertial frame.

In the analysis of simplified scenarios, such as spacetime diagrams, a reduced-dimensionality form of the invariant interval is often employed:
formula_65

Demonstrating that the interval is invariant is straightforward for the reduced-dimensionality case and with frames in standard configuration:
formula_66

The value of formula_67 is hence independent of the frame in which it is measured.

=== Relativity of simultaneity ===

Consider two events happening in two different locations that occur simultaneously in the reference frame of one inertial observer. They may occur non-simultaneously in the reference frame of another inertial observer (lack of absolute simultaneity).

From (the forward Lorentz transformation in terms of coordinate differences)
formula_68

It is clear that the two events that are simultaneous in frame &quot;S&quot; (satisfying ), are not necessarily simultaneous in another inertial frame (satisfying ). Only if these events are additionally co-local in frame &quot;S&quot; (satisfying ), will they be simultaneous in another frame .

The Sagnac effect can be considered a manifestation of the relativity of simultaneity. Since relativity of simultaneity is a first order effect in , instruments based on the Sagnac effect for their operation, such as ring laser gyroscopes and fiber optic gyroscopes, are capable of extreme levels of sensitivity.

=== Time dilation ===

The time lapse between two events is not invariant from one observer to another, but is dependent on the relative speeds of the observers&#x27; reference frames.

Suppose a clock is at rest in the unprimed system &quot;S&quot;. The location of the clock on two different ticks is then characterized by . To find the relation between the times between these ticks as measured in both systems, can be used to find:
: formula_69for events satisfyingformula_70

This shows that the time (Δ) between the two ticks as seen in the frame in which the clock is moving (), is &quot;longer&quot; than the time (Δ&quot;t&quot;) between these ticks as measured in the rest frame of the clock (&quot;S&quot;). Time dilation explains a number of physical phenomena; for example, the lifetime of high speed muons created by the collision of cosmic rays with particles in the Earth&#x27;s outer atmosphere and moving towards the surface is greater than the lifetime of slowly moving muons, created and decaying in a laboratory.
Whenever one hears a statement to the effect that &quot;moving clocks run slow&quot;, one should envision an inertial reference frame thickly populated with identical, synchronized clocks. As a moving clock travels through this array, its reading at any particular point is compared with a stationary clock at the same point.

The measurements that we would get if we actually &quot;looked&quot; at a moving clock would, in general, not at all be the same thing, because the time that we would see would be delayed by the finite speed of light, i.e. the times that we see would be distorted by the Doppler effect. Measurements of relativistic effects must always be understood as having been made after finite speed-of-light effects have been factored out.

==== Langevin&#x27;s light-clock ====
Paul Langevin, an early proponent of the theory of relativity, did much to popularize the theory in the face of resistance by many physicists to Einstein&#x27;s revolutionary concepts. Among his numerous contributions to the foundations of special relativity were independent work on the mass–energy relationship, a thorough examination of the twin paradox, and investigations into rotating coordinate systems. His name is frequently attached to a hypothetical construct called a &quot;light-clock&quot; (originally developed by Lewis and Tolman in 1909), which he used to perform a novel derivation of the Lorentz transformation.

A light-clock is imagined to be a box of perfectly reflecting walls wherein a light signal reflects back and forth from opposite faces. The concept of time dilation is frequently taught using a light-clock that is traveling in uniform inertial motion perpendicular to a line connecting the two mirrors. (Langevin himself made use of a light-clock oriented parallel to its line of motion.)

Consider the scenario illustrated in Observer A holds a light-clock of length formula_71 as well as an electronic timer with which she measures how long it takes a pulse to make a round trip up and down along the light-clock. Although observer A is traveling rapidly along a train, from her point of view the emission and receipt of the pulse occur at the same place, and she measures the interval using a single clock located at the precise position of these two events. For the interval between these two events, observer A finds . A time interval measured using a single clock that is motionless in a particular reference frame is called a &quot;proper time interval&quot;.

Fig. 4-3B illustrates these same two events from the standpoint of observer B, who is parked by the tracks as the train goes by at a speed of . Instead of making straight up-and-down motions, observer B sees the pulses moving along a zig-zag line. However, because of the postulate of the constancy of the speed of light, the speed of the pulses along these diagonal lines is the same formula_1 that observer A saw for her up-and-down pulses. B measures the speed of the vertical component of these pulses as formula_73 so that the total round-trip time of the pulses is formula_74. Note that for observer B, the emission and receipt of the light pulse occurred at different places, and he measured the interval using two stationary and synchronized clocks located at two different positions in his reference frame. The interval that B measured was therefore &quot;not&quot; a proper time interval because he did not measure it with a single resting clock.

==== Reciprocal time dilation ====
In the above description of the Langevin light-clock, the labeling of one observer as stationary and the other as in motion was completely arbitrary. One could just as well have observer B carrying the light-clock and moving at a speed of formula_54 to the left, in which case observer A would perceive B&#x27;s clock as running slower than her local clock.

There is no paradox here, because there is no independent observer C who will agree with both A and B. Observer C necessarily makes his measurements from his own reference frame. If that reference frame coincides with A&#x27;s reference frame, then C will agree with A&#x27;s measurement of time. If C&#x27;s reference frame coincides with B&#x27;s reference frame, then C will agree with B&#x27;s measurement of time. If C&#x27;s reference frame coincides with neither A&#x27;s frame nor B&#x27;s frame, then C&#x27;s measurement of time will disagree with &quot;both&quot; A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s measurement of time.

=== Twin paradox ===

The reciprocity of time dilation between two observers in separate inertial frames leads to the so-called twin paradox, articulated in its present form by Langevin in 1911. Langevin imagined an adventurer wishing to explore the future of the Earth. This traveler boards a projectile capable of traveling at 99.995% of the speed of light. After making a round-trip journey to and from a nearby star lasting only two years of his own life, he returns to an Earth that is two hundred years older.

This result appears puzzling because both the traveler and an Earthbound observer would see the other as moving, and so, because of the reciprocity of time dilation, one might initially expect that each should have found the other to have aged less. In reality, there is no paradox at all, because in order for the two observers to perform side-by-side comparisons of their elapsed proper times, the symmetry of the situation must be broken: At least one of the two observers must change their state of motion to match that of the other.
Knowing the general resolution of the paradox, however, does not immediately yield the ability to calculate correct quantitative results. Many solutions to this puzzle have been provided in the literature and have been reviewed in the Twin paradox article. We will examine in the following one such solution to the paradox.

Our basic aim will be to demonstrate that, after the trip, both twins are in perfect agreement about who aged by how much, regardless of their different experiences. illustrates a scenario where the traveling twin flies at to and from a star distant. During the trip, each twin sends yearly time signals (measured in their own proper times) to the other. After the trip, the cumulative counts are compared. On the outward phase of the trip, each twin receives the other&#x27;s signals at the lowered rate of . Initially, the situation is perfectly symmetric: note that each twin receives the other&#x27;s one-year signal at two years measured on their own clock. The symmetry is broken when the traveling twin turns around at the four-year mark as measured by her clock. During the remaining four years of her trip, she receives signals at the enhanced rate of . The situation is quite different with the stationary twin. Because of light-speed delay, he does not see his sister turn around until eight years have passed on his own clock. Thus, he receives enhanced-rate signals from his sister for only a relatively brief period. Although the twins disagree in their respective measures of total time, we see in the following table, as well as by simple observation of the Minkowski diagram, that each twin is in total agreement with the other as to the total number of signals sent from one to the other. There is hence no paradox.

=== Length contraction ===

The dimensions (e.g., length) of an object as measured by one observer may be smaller than the results of measurements of the same object made by another observer (e.g., the ladder paradox involves a long ladder traveling near the speed of light and being contained within a smaller garage).

Similarly, suppose a measuring rod is at rest and aligned along the &quot;x&quot;-axis in the unprimed system &quot;S&quot;. In this system, the length of this rod is written as Δ&quot;x&quot;. To measure the length of this rod in the system , in which the rod is moving, the distances &quot;&quot; to the end points of the rod must be measured simultaneously in that system . In other words, the measurement is characterized by , which can be combined with to find the relation between the lengths Δ&quot;x&quot; and Δ:
: formula_76for events satisfyingformula_77
This shows that the length (Δ) of the rod as measured in the frame in which it is moving (), is &quot;shorter&quot; than its length (Δ&quot;x&quot;) in its own rest frame (&quot;S&quot;).

Time dilation and length contraction are not merely appearances. Time dilation is explicitly related to our way of measuring &quot;time intervals&quot; between events that occur at the same place in a given coordinate system (called &quot;co-local&quot; events). These time intervals (which can be, and are, actually measured experimentally by relevant observers) are &quot;different&quot; in another coordinate system moving with respect to the first, unless the events, in addition to being co-local, are also simultaneous. Similarly, length contraction relates to our measured distances between separated but simultaneous events in a given coordinate system of choice. If these events are not co-local, but are separated by distance (space), they will &quot;not&quot; occur at the same &quot;spatial distance&quot; from each other when seen from another moving coordinate system.

=== Lorentz transformation of velocities ===
Consider two frames &quot;S&quot; and in standard configuration. A particle in &quot;S&quot; moves in the x direction with velocity vector . What is its velocity formula_78 in frame ?

We can write

Substituting expressions for formula_79 and formula_80 from into , followed by straightforward mathematical manipulations and back-substitution from yields the Lorentz transformation of the speed formula_81 to :
. &lt;/math&gt;|9}}

The inverse relation is obtained by interchanging the primed and unprimed symbols and replacing formula_82 with .
For formula_83 not aligned along the x-axis, we write:

The forward and inverse transformations for this case are:

 and can be interpreted as giving the &quot;resultant&quot; formula_84 of the two velocities formula_85 and , and they replace the formula . which is valid in Galilean relativity. Interpreted in such a fashion, they are commonly referred to as the &quot;relativistic velocity addition (or composition) formulas&quot;, valid for the three axes of &quot;S&quot; and being aligned with each other (although not necessarily in standard configuration).

We note the following points:
* If an object (e.g., a photon) were moving at the speed of light in one frame , then it would also be moving at the speed of light in any other frame, moving at .
* The resultant speed of two velocities with magnitude less than &quot;c&quot; is always a velocity with magnitude less than &quot;c&quot;.
* If both and (and then also and ) are small with respect to the speed of light (that is, e.g., , then the intuitive Galilean transformations are recovered from the transformation equations for special relativity
* Attaching a frame to a photon (&quot;riding a light beam&quot; like Einstein considers) requires special treatment of the transformations.

There is nothing special about the &quot;x&quot; direction in the standard configuration. The above formalism applies to any direction; and three orthogonal directions allow dealing with all directions in space by decomposing the velocity vectors to their components in these directions. See &quot;Velocity-addition formula&quot; for details.

=== Thomas rotation ===

The composition of two non-collinear Lorentz boosts (i.e., two non-collinear Lorentz transformations, neither of which involve rotation) results in a Lorentz transformation that is not a pure boost but is the composition of a boost and a rotation.

Thomas rotation results from the relativity of simultaneity. In Fig. 4-5a, a rod of length formula_71 in its rest frame (i.e., having a proper length of ) rises vertically along the y-axis in the ground frame.

In Fig. 4-5b, the same rod is observed from the frame of a rocket moving at speed formula_54 to the right. If we imagine two clocks situated at the left and right ends of the rod that are synchronized &quot;in the frame of the rod&quot;, relativity of simultaneity causes the observer in the rocket frame to observe (not &quot;see&quot;) the clock at the right end of the rod as being advanced in time by , and the rod is correspondingly observed as tilted.

Unlike second-order relativistic effects such as length contraction or time dilation, this effect becomes quite significant even at fairly low velocities. For example, this can be seen in the spin of moving particles, where Thomas precession is a relativistic correction that applies to the spin of an elementary particle or the rotation of a macroscopic gyroscope, relating the angular velocity of the spin of a particle following a curvilinear orbit to the angular velocity of the orbital motion.

Thomas rotation provides the resolution to the well-known &quot;meter stick and hole paradox&quot;.

=== Causality and prohibition of motion faster than light ===
In Fig. 4-6, the time interval between the events A (the &quot;cause&quot;) and B (the &quot;effect&quot;) is &#x27;timelike&#x27;; that is, there is a frame of reference in which events A and B occur at the &quot;same location in space&quot;, separated only by occurring at different times. If A precedes B in that frame, then A precedes B in all frames accessible by a Lorentz transformation. It is possible for matter (or information) to travel (below light speed) from the location of A, starting at the time of A, to the location of B, arriving at the time of B, so there can be a causal relationship (with A the cause and B the effect).

The interval AC in the diagram is &#x27;spacelike&#x27;; that is, there is a frame of reference in which events A and C occur simultaneously, separated only in space. There are also frames in which A precedes C (as shown) and frames in which C precedes A. But no frames are accessible by a Lorentz transformation, in which events A and C occur at the same location. If it were possible for a cause-and-effect relationship to exist between events A and C, paradoxes of causality would result.

For example, if signals could be sent faster than light, then signals could be sent into the sender&#x27;s past (observer B in the diagrams). A variety of causal paradoxes could then be constructed.
Consider the spacetime diagrams in Fig. 4-7. A and B stand alongside a railroad track, when a high-speed train passes by, with C riding in the last car of the train and D riding in the leading car. The world lines of A and B are vertical (&quot;ct&quot;), distinguishing the stationary position of these observers on the ground, while the world lines of C and D are tilted forwards (&quot;&quot;), reflecting the rapid motion of the observers C and D stationary in their train, as observed from the ground.
# Fig. 4-7a. The event of &quot;B passing a message to D&quot;, as the leading car passes by, is at the origin of D&#x27;s frame. D sends the message along the train to C in the rear car, using a fictitious &quot;instantaneous communicator&quot;. The worldline of this message is the fat red arrow along the formula_88 axis, which is a line of simultaneity in the primed frames of C and D. In the (unprimed) ground frame the signal arrives &quot;earlier&quot; than it was sent.
# Fig. 4-7b. The event of &quot;C passing the message to A&quot;, who is standing by the railroad tracks, is at the origin of their frames. Now A sends the message along the tracks to B via an &quot;instantaneous communicator&quot;. The worldline of this message is the blue fat arrow, along the formula_89 axis, which is a line of simultaneity for the frames of A and B. As seen from the spacetime diagram, in the primed frames of C and D, B will receive the message before it was sent out, a violation of causality.

It is not necessary for signals to be instantaneous to violate causality. Even if the signal from D to C were slightly shallower than the formula_25 axis (and the signal from A to B slightly steeper than the formula_15 axis), it would still be possible for B to receive his message before he had sent it. By increasing the speed of the train to near light speeds, the formula_26 and formula_25 axes can be squeezed very close to the dashed line representing the speed of light. With this modified setup, it can be demonstrated that even signals only &quot;slightly&quot; faster than the speed of light will result in causality violation.

Therefore, if causality is to be preserved, one of the consequences of special relativity is that no information signal or material object can travel faster than light in vacuum.

This is not to say that &quot;all&quot; faster than light speeds are impossible. Various trivial situations can be described where some &quot;things&quot; (not actual matter or energy) move faster than light. For example, the location where the beam of a search light hits the bottom of a cloud can move faster than light when the search light is turned rapidly (although this does not violate causality or any other relativistic phenomenon).

== Optical effects ==
=== Dragging effects ===
In 1850, Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault independently established that light travels more slowly in water than in air, thus validating a prediction of Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory of light and invalidating the corresponding prediction of Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory. The speed of light was measured in still water. What would be the speed of light in flowing water?

In 1851, Fizeau conducted an experiment to answer this question, a simplified representation of which is illustrated in Fig. 5-1. A beam of light is divided by a beam splitter, and the split beams are passed in opposite directions through a tube of flowing water. They are recombined to form interference fringes, indicating a difference in optical path length, that an observer can view. The experiment demonstrated that dragging of the light by the flowing water caused a displacement of the fringes, showing that the motion of the water had affected the speed of the light.

According to the theories prevailing at the time, light traveling through a moving medium would be a simple sum of its speed &quot;through&quot; the medium plus the speed &quot;of&quot; the medium. Contrary to expectation, Fizeau found that although light appeared to be dragged by the water, the magnitude of the dragging was much lower than expected. If formula_94 is the speed of light in still water, and formula_54 is the speed of the water, and formula_96 is the water-borne speed of light in the lab frame with the flow of water adding to or subtracting from the speed of light, then
formula_97

Fizeau&#x27;s results, although consistent with Fresnel&#x27;s earlier hypothesis of partial aether dragging, were extremely disconcerting to physicists of the time. Among other things, the presence of an index of refraction term meant that, since formula_98 depends on wavelength, &quot;the aether must be capable of sustaining different motions at the same time&quot;. A variety of theoretical explanations were proposed to explain Fresnel&#x27;s dragging coefficient, that were completely at odds with each other. Even before the Michelson–Morley experiment, Fizeau&#x27;s experimental results were among a number of observations that created a critical situation in explaining the optics of moving bodies.

From the point of view of special relativity, Fizeau&#x27;s result is nothing but an approximation to , the relativistic formula for composition of velocities.

=== Relativistic aberration of light ===

Because of the finite speed of light, if the relative motions of a source and receiver include a transverse component, then the direction from which light arrives at the receiver will be displaced from the geometric position in space of the source relative to the receiver. The classical calculation of the displacement takes two forms and makes different predictions depending on whether the receiver, the source, or both are in motion with respect to the medium. (1) If the receiver is in motion, the displacement would be the consequence of the aberration of light. The incident angle of the beam relative to the receiver would be calculable from the vector sum of the receiver&#x27;s motions and the velocity of the incident light. (2) If the source is in motion, the displacement would be the consequence of light-time correction. The displacement of the apparent position of the source from its geometric position would be the result of the source&#x27;s motion during the time that its light takes to reach the receiver.

The classical explanation failed experimental test. Since the aberration angle depends on the relationship between the velocity of the receiver and the speed of the incident light, passage of the incident light through a refractive medium should change the aberration angle. In 1810, Arago used this expected phenomenon in a failed attempt to measure the speed of light, and in 1870, George Airy tested the hypothesis using a water-filled telescope, finding that, against expectation, the measured aberration was identical to the aberration measured with an air-filled telescope. A &quot;cumbrous&quot; attempt to explain these results used the hypothesis of partial aether-drag, but was incompatible with the results of the Michelson–Morley experiment, which apparently demanded &quot;complete&quot; aether-drag.

Assuming inertial frames, the relativistic expression for the aberration of light is applicable to both the receiver moving and source moving cases. A variety of trigonometrically equivalent formulas have been published. Expressed in terms of the variables in Fig. 5-2, these include
: formula_103   OR   formula_104   OR   formula_105

=== Relativistic Doppler effect ===
==== Relativistic longitudinal Doppler effect====
The classical Doppler effect depends on whether the source, receiver, or both are in motion with respect to the medium. The relativistic Doppler effect is independent of any medium. Nevertheless, relativistic Doppler shift for the longitudinal case, with source and receiver moving directly towards or away from each other, can be derived as if it were the classical phenomenon, but modified by the addition of a time dilation term, and that is the treatment described here.

Assume the receiver and the source are moving &quot;away&quot; from each other with a relative speed formula_54 as measured by an observer on the receiver or the source (The sign convention adopted here is that formula_54 is &quot;negative&quot; if the receiver and the source are moving &quot;towards&quot; each other). Assume that the source is stationary in the medium. Then
formula_108
where formula_109 is the speed of sound.

For light, and with the receiver moving at relativistic speeds, clocks on the receiver are time dilated relative to clocks at the source. The receiver will measure the received frequency to be
formula_110
where
* formula_111  and
* formula_112 is the Lorentz factor.

An identical expression for relativistic Doppler shift is obtained when performing the analysis in the reference frame of the &quot;receiver&quot; with a moving source.

==== Transverse Doppler effect ====
The transverse Doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the special theory of relativity.

Classically, one might expect that if source and receiver are moving transversely with respect to each other with no longitudinal component to their relative motions, that there should be no Doppler shift in the light arriving at the receiver.

Special relativity predicts otherwise. Fig. 5-3 illustrates two common variants of this scenario. Both variants can be analyzed using simple time dilation arguments. In Fig. 5-3a, the receiver observes light from the source as being blueshifted by a factor of . In Fig. 5-3b, the light is redshifted by the same factor.

=== Measurement versus visual appearance ===
Time dilation and length contraction are not optical illusions, but genuine effects. Measurements of these effects are not an artifact of Doppler shift, nor are they the result of neglecting to take into account the time it takes light to travel from an event to an observer.

Scientists make a fundamental distinction between &quot;measurement&quot; or &quot;observation&quot; on the one hand, versus &quot;visual appearance&quot;, or what one &quot;sees&quot;. The measured shape of an object is a hypothetical snapshot of all of the object&#x27;s points as they exist at a single moment in time. But the visual appearance of an object is affected by the varying lengths of time that light takes to travel from different points on the object to one&#x27;s eye.
For many years, the distinction between the two had not been generally appreciated, and it had generally been thought that a length contracted object passing by an observer would in fact actually be &quot;seen&quot; as length contracted. In 1959, James Terrell and Roger Penrose independently pointed out that differential time lag effects in signals reaching the observer from the different parts of a moving object result in a fast moving object&#x27;s visual appearance being quite different from its measured shape. For example, a receding object would &quot;appear&quot; contracted, an approaching object would &quot;appear&quot; elongated, and a passing object would have a skew appearance that has been likened to a rotation. A sphere in motion retains the circular outline for all speeds, for any distance, and for all view angles, although
the surface of the sphere and the images on it will appear distorted.
Both Fig. 5-4 and Fig. 5-5 illustrate objects moving transversely to the line of sight. In Fig. 5-4, a cube is viewed from a distance of four times the length of its sides. At high speeds, the sides of the cube that are perpendicular to the direction of motion appear hyperbolic in shape. The cube is actually not rotated. Rather, light from the rear of the cube takes longer to reach one&#x27;s eyes compared with light from the front, during which time the cube has moved to the right. At high speeds, the sphere in Fig. 5-5 takes on the appearance of a flattened disk tilted up to 45° from the line of sight. If the objects&#x27; motions are not strictly transverse but instead include a longitudinal component, exaggerated distortions in perspective may be seen. This illusion has come to be known as &quot;Terrell rotation&quot; or the &quot;Terrell–Penrose effect&quot;.

Another example where visual appearance is at odds with measurement comes from the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles with respect to the viewer. An apparent optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel. In Fig. 5-6, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us, but Penrose–Terrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig. 5-4 has been stretched out.

== Dynamics ==
Section &quot;&quot; dealt strictly with kinematics, the study of the motion of points, bodies, and systems of bodies without considering the forces that caused the motion. This section discusses masses, forces, energy and so forth, and as such requires consideration of physical effects beyond those encompassed by the Lorentz transformation itself.

=== Equivalence of mass and energy ===
As an object&#x27;s speed approaches the speed of light from an observer&#x27;s point of view, its relativistic mass increases thereby making it more and more difficult to accelerate it from within the observer&#x27;s frame of reference.

The energy content of an object at rest with mass &quot;m&quot; equals &quot;mc&quot;2. Conservation of energy implies that, in any reaction, a decrease of the sum of the masses of particles must be accompanied by an increase in kinetic energies of the particles after the reaction. Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased by taking in kinetic energies.

In addition to the papers referenced above – which give derivations of the Lorentz transformation and describe the foundations of special relativity—Einstein also wrote at least four papers giving heuristic arguments for the equivalence (and transmutability) of mass and energy, for .

Mass–energy equivalence is a consequence of special relativity. The energy and momentum, which are separate in Newtonian mechanics, form a four-vector in relativity, and this relates the time component (the energy) to the space components (the momentum) in a non-trivial way. For an object at rest, the energy–momentum four-vector is : it has a time component, which is the energy, and three space components, which are zero. By changing frames with a Lorentz transformation in the x direction with a small value of the velocity v, the energy momentum four-vector becomes . The momentum is equal to the energy multiplied by the velocity divided by &quot;c&quot;2. As such, the Newtonian mass of an object, which is the ratio of the momentum to the velocity for slow velocities, is equal to &quot;E&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2.

The energy and momentum are properties of matter and radiation, and it is impossible to deduce that they form a four-vector just from the two basic postulates of special relativity by themselves, because these do not talk about matter or radiation, they only talk about space and time. The derivation therefore requires some additional physical reasoning. In his 1905 paper, Einstein used the additional principles that Newtonian mechanics should hold for slow velocities, so that there is one energy scalar and one three-vector momentum at slow velocities, and that the conservation law for energy and momentum is exactly true in relativity. Furthermore, he assumed that the energy of light is transformed by the same Doppler-shift factor as its frequency, which he had previously shown to be true based on Maxwell&#x27;s equations. The first of Einstein&#x27;s papers on this subject was &quot;Does the Inertia of a Body Depend upon its Energy Content?&quot; in 1905. Although Einstein&#x27;s argument in this paper is nearly universally accepted by physicists as correct, even self-evident, many authors over the years have suggested that it is wrong. Other authors suggest that the argument was merely inconclusive because it relied on some implicit assumptions.

Einstein acknowledged the controversy over his derivation in his 1907 survey paper on special relativity. There he notes that it is problematic to rely on Maxwell&#x27;s equations for the heuristic mass–energy argument. The argument in his 1905 paper can be carried out with the emission of any massless particles, but the Maxwell equations are implicitly used to make it obvious that the emission of light in particular can be achieved only by doing work. To emit electromagnetic waves, all you have to do is shake a charged particle, and this is clearly doing work, so that the emission is of energy.

=== Einstein&#x27;s 1905 demonstration of &quot;E&quot; = &quot;mc&quot;2 ===
In his fourth of his 1905 Annus mirabilis papers, Einstein presented a heuristic argument for the equivalence of mass and energy. Although, as discussed above, subsequent scholarship has established that his arguments fell short of a broadly definitive proof, the conclusions that he reached in this paper have stood the test of time.

Einstein took as starting assumptions his recently discovered formula for relativistic Doppler shift, the laws of conservation of energy and conservation of momentum, and the relationship between the frequency of light and its energy as implied by Maxwell&#x27;s equations.
Fig. 6-1 (top). Consider a system of plane waves of light having frequency formula_113 traveling in direction formula_114 relative to the x-axis of reference frame &quot;S&quot;. The frequency (and hence energy) of the waves as measured in frame that is moving along the x-axis at velocity formula_54 is given by the relativistic Doppler shift formula that Einstein had developed in his 1905 paper on special relativity:
: formula_116

Fig. 6-1 (bottom). Consider an arbitrary body that is stationary in reference frame &quot;S&quot;. Let this body emit a pair of equal-energy light-pulses in opposite directions at angle formula_114 with respect to the x-axis. Each pulse has energy . Because of conservation of momentum, the body remains stationary in &quot;S&quot; after emission of the two pulses. Let formula_118 be the energy of the body before emission of the two pulses and formula_119 after their emission.

Next, consider the same system observed from frame that is moving along the x-axis at speed formula_54 relative to frame &quot;S&quot;. In this frame, light from the forwards and reverse pulses will be relativistically Doppler-shifted. Let formula_121 be the energy of the body measured in reference frame before emission of the two pulses and formula_122 after their emission. We obtain the following relationships:
: formula_123

From the above equations, we obtain the following:
 - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt; |6-1}}

The two differences of form formula_124 seen in the above equation have a straightforward physical interpretation. Since formula_125 and formula_126 are the energies of the arbitrary body in the moving and stationary frames, formula_127 and formula_128 represents the kinetic energies of the bodies before and after the emission of light (except for an additive constant that fixes the zero point of energy and is conventionally set to zero). Hence,
 - 1 \right) &lt;/math&gt; |6-2}}

Taking a Taylor series expansion and neglecting higher order terms, he obtained
Comparing the above expression with the classical expression for kinetic energy, &quot;K.E.&quot; = &quot;mv&quot;2, Einstein then noted: &quot;If a body gives off the energy &quot;L&quot; in the form of radiation, its mass diminishes by &quot;L&quot;/&quot;c&quot;2.&quot;

Rindler has observed that Einstein&#x27;s heuristic argument suggested merely that energy &quot;contributes&quot; to mass. In 1905, Einstein&#x27;s cautious expression of the mass–energy relationship allowed for the possibility that &quot;dormant&quot; mass might exist that would remain behind after all the energy of a body was removed. By 1907, however, Einstein was ready to assert that &quot;all&quot; inertial mass represented a reserve of energy. &quot;To equate &quot;all&quot; mass with energy required an act of aesthetic faith, very characteristic of Einstein.&quot; Einstein&#x27;s bold hypothesis has been amply confirmed in the years subsequent to his original proposal.

For a variety of reasons, Einstein&#x27;s original derivation is currently seldom taught. Besides the vigorous debate that continues until this day as to the formal correctness of his original derivation, the recognition of special relativity as being what Einstein called a &quot;principle theory&quot; has led to a shift away from reliance on electromagnetic phenomena to purely dynamic methods of proof.

=== How far can you travel from the Earth? ===

Since nothing can travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel farther from Earth than ~ 100 light years. You would easily think that a traveler would never be able to reach more than the few solar systems that exist within the limit of 100 light years from Earth. However, because of time dilation, a hypothetical spaceship can travel thousands of light years during a passenger&#x27;s lifetime. If a spaceship could be built that accelerates at a constant 1&quot;g&quot;, it will, after one year, be travelling at almost the speed of light as seen from Earth. This is described by:
formula_129
where &quot;v&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the velocity at a time &quot;t&quot;, &quot;a&quot; is the acceleration of the spaceship and &quot;t&quot; is the coordinate time as measured by people on Earth. Therefore, after one year of accelerating at 9.81 m/s2, the spaceship will be travelling at and after three years, relative to Earth. After three years of this acceleration, with the spaceship achieving a velocity of 94.6% of the speed of light relative to Earth, time dilation will result in each second experienced on the spaceship corresponding to 3.1 seconds back on Earth. During their journey, people on Earth will experience more time than they do – since their clocks (all physical phenomena) would really be ticking 3.1 times faster than those of the spaceship. A 5-year round trip for the traveller will take 6.5 Earth years and cover a distance of over 6 light-years. A 20-year round trip for them (5 years accelerating, 5 decelerating, twice each) will land them back on Earth having travelled for 335 Earth years and a distance of 331 light years. A full 40-year trip at 1&quot;g&quot; will appear on Earth to last 58,000 years and cover a distance of 55,000 light years. A 40-year trip at will take years and cover about light years. A one-way 28 year (14 years accelerating, 14 decelerating as measured with the astronaut&#x27;s clock) trip at 1&quot;g&quot; acceleration could reach 2,000,000 light-years to the Andromeda Galaxy. This same time dilation is why a muon travelling close to &quot;c&quot; is observed to travel much farther than &quot;c&quot; times its half-life (when at rest).

=== Elastic collisions ===
Examination of the collision products generated by particle accelerators around the world provides scientists evidence of the structure of the subatomic world and the natural laws governing it. Analysis of the collision products, the sum of whose masses may vastly exceed the masses of the incident particles, requires special relativity.

In Newtonian mechanics, analysis of collisions involves use of the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy. In relativistic mechanics, mass is not independently conserved, because it has been subsumed into the total relativistic energy. We illustrate the differences that arise between the Newtonian and relativistic treatments of particle collisions by examining the simple case of two perfectly elastic colliding particles of equal mass. (&quot;Inelastic&quot; collisions are discussed in Spacetime#Conservation laws. Radioactive decay may be considered a sort of time-reversed inelastic collision.)

Elastic scattering of charged elementary particles deviates from ideality due to the production of Bremsstrahlung radiation.

==== Newtonian analysis ====

Fig. 6-2 provides a demonstration of the result, familiar to billiard players, that if a stationary ball is struck elastically by another one of the same mass (assuming no sidespin, or &quot;English&quot;), then after collision, the diverging paths of the two balls will subtend a right angle. (a) In the stationary frame, an incident sphere traveling at 2v strikes a stationary sphere. (b) In the center of momentum frame, the two spheres approach each other symmetrically at ±v. After elastic collision, the two spheres rebound from each other with equal and opposite velocities ±u. Energy conservation requires that = . (c) Reverting to the stationary frame, the rebound velocities are . The dot product , indicating that the vectors are orthogonal.

==== Relativistic analysis ====

Consider the elastic collision scenario in Fig. 6-3 between a moving particle colliding with an equal mass stationary particle. Unlike the Newtonian case, the angle between the two particles after collision is less than 90°, is dependent on the angle of scattering, and becomes smaller and smaller as the velocity of the incident particle approaches the speed of light:

The relativistic momentum and total relativistic energy of a particle are given by
Conservation of momentum dictates that the sum of the momenta of the incoming particle and the stationary particle (which initially has momentum = 0) equals the sum of the momenta of the emergent particles:
Likewise, the sum of the total relativistic energies of the incoming particle and the stationary particle (which initially has total energy mc2) equals the sum of the total energies of the emergent particles:
Breaking down () into its components, replacing formula_54 with the dimensionless , and factoring out common terms from () and () yields the following:


From these we obtain the following relationships:
{ \{ \beta_1^2 \sin^2{\phi} + \sin^2(\phi + \theta )/\gamma_1^2 \}^{1/2} } &lt;/math&gt; |6-10}}
{ \{ \beta_1^2 \sin^2{\theta} + \sin^2(\phi + \theta )/\gamma_1^2 \}^{1/2} } &lt;/math&gt; |6-11}}

For the symmetrical case in which formula_131 and , () takes on the simpler form:
== Beyond the basics ==
=== Rapidity ===

Lorentz transformations relate coordinates of events in one reference frame to those of another frame. Relativistic composition of velocities is used to add two velocities together. The formulas to perform the latter computations are nonlinear, making them more complex than the corresponding Galilean formulas.

This nonlinearity is an artifact of our choice of parameters. We have previously noted that in an spacetime diagram, the points at some constant spacetime interval from the origin form an invariant hyperbola. We have also noted that the coordinate systems of two spacetime reference frames in standard configuration are hyperbolically rotated with respect to each other.

The natural functions for expressing these relationships are the hyperbolic analogs of the trigonometric functions. Fig. 7-1a shows a unit circle with sin(&quot;a&quot;) and cos(&quot;a&quot;), the only difference between this diagram and the familiar unit circle of elementary trigonometry being that &quot;a&quot; is interpreted, not as the angle between the ray and the , but as twice the area of the sector swept out by the ray from the . Numerically, the angle and measures for the unit circle are identical. Fig. 7-1b shows a unit hyperbola with sinh(&quot;a&quot;) and cosh(&quot;a&quot;), where &quot;a&quot; is likewise interpreted as twice the tinted area. Fig. 7-2 presents plots of the sinh, cosh, and tanh functions.

For the unit circle, the slope of the ray is given by
: formula_132

In the Cartesian plane, rotation of point into point by angle &quot;θ&quot; is given by
: formula_133

In a spacetime diagram, the velocity parameter formula_134 is the analog of slope. The &quot;rapidity&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;, is defined by
: formula_135
where
: formula_136

The rapidity defined above is very useful in special relativity because many expressions take on a considerably simpler form when expressed in terms of it. For example, rapidity is simply additive in the collinear velocity-addition formula;
: formula_137 formula_138 formula_139
or in other words, .

The Lorentz transformations take a simple form when expressed in terms of rapidity. The &quot;γ&quot; factor can be written as
: formula_140 formula_141
: formula_142 formula_143

Transformations describing relative motion with uniform velocity and without rotation of the space coordinate axes are called &quot;boosts&quot;.

Substituting &quot;γ&quot; and &quot;γβ&quot; into the transformations as previously presented and rewriting in matrix form, the Lorentz boost in the may be written as
: formula_144
and the inverse Lorentz boost in the may be written as
: formula_145

In other words, Lorentz boosts represent hyperbolic rotations in Minkowski spacetime.

The advantages of using hyperbolic functions are such that some textbooks such as the classic ones by Taylor and Wheeler introduce their use at a very early stage.
=== 4‑vectors ===

Four‑vectors have been mentioned above in context of the energy–momentum , but without any great emphasis. Indeed, none of the elementary derivations of special relativity require them. But once understood, , and more generally tensors, greatly simplify the mathematics and conceptual understanding of special relativity. Working exclusively with such objects leads to formulas that are &quot;manifestly&quot; relativistically invariant, which is a considerable advantage in non-trivial contexts. For instance, demonstrating relativistic invariance of Maxwell&#x27;s equations in their usual form is not trivial, while it is merely a routine calculation, really no more than an observation, using the field strength tensor formulation.

On the other hand, general relativity, from the outset, relies heavily on , and more generally tensors, representing physically relevant entities. Relating these via equations that do not rely on specific coordinates requires tensors, capable of connecting such even within a &quot;curved&quot; spacetime, and not just within a &quot;flat&quot; one as in special relativity. The study of tensors is outside the scope of this article, which provides only a basic discussion of spacetime.

==== Definition of 4-vectors ====
A 4-tuple, is a &quot;4-vector&quot; if its component &quot;Ai&quot; transform between frames according to the Lorentz transformation.

If using coordinates, &quot;A&quot; is a if it transforms (in the ) according to
: formula_146
which comes from simply replacing &quot;ct&quot; with &quot;A&quot;0 and &quot;x&quot; with &quot;A&quot;1 in the earlier presentation of the Lorentz transformation.

As usual, when we write &quot;x&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, etc. we generally mean Δ&quot;x&quot;, Δ&quot;t&quot; etc.

The last three components of a must be a standard vector in three-dimensional space. Therefore, a must transform like under Lorentz transformations as well as rotations.

==== Properties of 4-vectors ====
* Closure under linear combination: If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are , then is also a .
* Inner-product invariance: If &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are , then their inner product (scalar product) is invariant, i.e. their inner product is independent of the frame in which it is calculated. Note how the calculation of inner product differs from the calculation of the inner product of a . In the following, formula_147 and formula_148 are :
*: formula_149 formula_150 formula_151
: In addition to being invariant under Lorentz transformation, the above inner product is also invariant under rotation in .
: Two vectors are said to be &quot;orthogonal&quot; if . Unlike the case with , orthogonal are not necessarily at right angles to each other. The rule is that two are orthogonal if they are offset by equal and opposite angles from the 45° line, which is the world line of a light ray. This implies that a lightlike is orthogonal to &quot;itself&quot;.
* Invariance of the magnitude of a vector: The magnitude of a vector is the inner product of a with itself, and is a frame-independent property. As with intervals, the magnitude may be positive, negative or zero, so that the vectors are referred to as timelike, spacelike or null (lightlike). Note that a null vector is not the same as a zero vector. A null vector is one for which , while a zero vector is one whose components are all zero. Special cases illustrating the invariance of the norm include the invariant interval formula_152 and the invariant length of the relativistic momentum vector .

==== Examples of 4-vectors ====
* Displacement 4-vector: Otherwise known as the &quot;spacetime separation&quot;, this is or for infinitesimal separations, .
*: formula_153
* Velocity 4-vector: This results when the displacement is divided by formula_154, where formula_154 is the proper time between the two events that yield &quot;dt&quot;, &quot;dx&quot;, &quot;dy&quot;, and &quot;dz&quot;.
*: formula_156 formula_157 formula_158

: The is tangent to the world line of a particle, and has a length equal to one unit of time in the frame of the particle.
: An accelerated particle does not have an inertial frame in which it is always at rest. However, an inertial frame can always be found that is momentarily comoving with the particle. This frame, the &quot;momentarily comoving reference frame&quot; (MCRF), enables application of special relativity to the analysis of accelerated particles.
: Since photons move on null lines, formula_159 for a photon, and a cannot be defined. There is no frame in which a photon is at rest, and no MCRF can be established along a photon&#x27;s path.
* Energy–momentum 4-vector:
*: formula_160
: As indicated before, there are varying treatments for the energy–momentum so that one may also see it expressed as formula_161 or . The first component is the total energy (including mass) of the particle (or system of particles) in a given frame, while the remaining components are its spatial momentum. The energy–momentum is a conserved quantity.
* Acceleration 4-vector: This results from taking the derivative of the velocity with respect to .
*: formula_162 formula_163 formula_164
* Force 4-vector: This is the derivative of the momentum with respect to formula_165
*: formula_166 formula_167 formula_168

As expected, the final components of the above are all standard corresponding to spatial , etc.

==== 4-vectors and physical law ====
The first postulate of special relativity declares the equivalency of all inertial frames. A physical law holding in one frame must apply in all frames, since otherwise it would be possible to differentiate between frames. Newtonian momenta fail to behave properly under Lorentzian transformation, and Einstein preferred to change the definition of momentum to one involving rather than give up on conservation of momentum.

Physical laws must be based on constructs that are frame independent. This means that physical laws may take the form of equations connecting scalars, which are always frame independent. However, equations involving require the use of tensors with appropriate rank, which themselves can be thought of as being built up from .
=== Acceleration ===
It is a common misconception that special relativity is applicable only to inertial frames, and that it is unable to handle accelerating objects or accelerating reference frames. Actually, accelerating objects can generally be analyzed without needing to deal with accelerating frames at all. It is only when gravitation is significant that general relativity is required.

Properly handling accelerating frames does require some care, however. The difference between special and general relativity is that (1) In special relativity, all velocities are relative, but acceleration is absolute. (2) In general relativity, all motion is relative, whether inertial, accelerating, or rotating. To accommodate this difference, general relativity uses curved spacetime.

In this section, we analyze several scenarios involving accelerated reference frames.

==== Dewan–Beran–Bell spaceship paradox ====
The Dewan–Beran–Bell spaceship paradox (Bell&#x27;s spaceship paradox) is a good example of a problem where intuitive reasoning unassisted by the geometric insight of the spacetime approach can lead to issues.
In Fig. 7-4, two identical spaceships float in space and are at rest relative to each other. They are connected by a string that is capable of only a limited amount of stretching before breaking. At a given instant in our frame, the observer frame, both spaceships accelerate in the same direction along the line between them with the same constant proper acceleration. Will the string break?

When the paradox was new and relatively unknown, even professional physicists had difficulty working out the solution. Two lines of reasoning lead to opposite conclusions. Both arguments, which are presented below, are flawed even though one of them yields the correct answer.
# To observers in the rest frame, the spaceships start a distance &quot;L&quot; apart and remain the same distance apart during acceleration. During acceleration, &quot;L&quot; is a length contracted distance of the distance in the frame of the accelerating spaceships. After a sufficiently long time, &quot;γ&quot; will increase to a sufficiently large factor that the string must break.
# Let &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; be the rear and front spaceships. In the frame of the spaceships, each spaceship sees the other spaceship doing the same thing that it is doing. &quot;A&quot; says that &quot;B&quot; has the same acceleration that he has, and &quot;B&quot; sees that &quot;A&quot; matches her every move. So the spaceships stay the same distance apart, and the string does not break.

The problem with the first argument is that there is no &quot;frame of the spaceships.&quot; There cannot be, because the two spaceships measure a growing distance between the two. Because there is no common frame of the spaceships, the length of the string is ill-defined. Nevertheless, the conclusion is correct, and the argument is mostly right. The second argument, however, completely ignores the relativity of simultaneity.
A spacetime diagram (Fig. 7-5) makes the correct solution to this paradox almost immediately evident. Two observers in Minkowski spacetime accelerate with constant magnitude formula_169 acceleration for proper time formula_170 (acceleration and elapsed time measured by the observers themselves, not some inertial observer). They are comoving and inertial before and after this phase. In Minkowski geometry, the length along the line of simultaneity formula_171 turns out to be greater than the length along the line of simultaneity .

The length increase can be calculated with the help of the Lorentz transformation. If, as illustrated in Fig. 7-5, the acceleration is finished, the ships will remain at a constant offset in some frame . If formula_172 and formula_173 are the ships&#x27; positions in , the positions in frame formula_174 are:
: formula_175

The &quot;paradox&quot;, as it were, comes from the way that Bell constructed his example. In the usual discussion of Lorentz contraction, the rest length is fixed and the moving length shortens as measured in frame . As shown in Fig. 7-5, Bell&#x27;s example asserts the moving lengths formula_176 and formula_177 measured in frame formula_178 to be fixed, thereby forcing the rest frame length formula_171 in frame formula_174 to increase.

==== Accelerated observer with horizon ====
Certain special relativity problem setups can lead to insight about phenomena normally associated with general relativity, such as event horizons. In the text accompanying Section &quot;Invariant hyperbola&quot; of the article Spacetime, the magenta hyperbolae represented actual paths that are tracked by a constantly accelerating traveler in spacetime. During periods of positive acceleration, the traveler&#x27;s velocity just &quot;approaches&quot; the speed of light, while, measured in our frame, the traveler&#x27;s acceleration constantly decreases.
Fig. 7-6 details various features of the traveler&#x27;s motions with more specificity. At any given moment, her space axis is formed by a line passing through the origin and her current position on the hyperbola, while her time axis is the tangent to the hyperbola at her position. The velocity parameter formula_134 approaches a limit of one as formula_19 increases. Likewise, formula_183 approaches infinity.

The shape of the invariant hyperbola corresponds to a path of constant proper acceleration. This is demonstrable as follows:
# We remember that .
# Since , we conclude that .
# formula_184 formula_185
# From the relativistic force law, formula_186.
# Substituting formula_187 from step 2 and the expression for formula_183 from step 3 yields , which is a constant expression.

Fig. 7-6 illustrates a specific calculated scenario. Terence (A) and Stella (B) initially stand together 100 light hours from the origin. Stella lifts off at time 0, her spacecraft accelerating at 0.01 &quot;c&quot; per hour. Every twenty hours, Terence radios updates to Stella about the situation at home (solid green lines). Stella receives these regular transmissions, but the increasing distance (offset in part by time dilation) causes her to receive Terence&#x27;s communications later and later as measured on her clock, and she &quot;never&quot; receives any communications from Terence after 100 hours on his clock (dashed green lines).

After 100 hours according to Terence&#x27;s clock, Stella enters a dark region. She has traveled outside Terence&#x27;s timelike future. On the other hand, Terence can continue to receive Stella&#x27;s messages to him indefinitely. He just has to wait long enough. Spacetime has been divided into distinct regions separated by an &quot;apparent&quot; event horizon. So long as Stella continues to accelerate, she can never know what takes place behind this horizon.

== Relativity and unifying electromagnetism ==

Theoretical investigation in classical electromagnetism led to the discovery of wave propagation. Equations generalizing the electromagnetic effects found that finite propagation speed of the E and B fields required certain behaviors on charged particles. The general study of moving charges forms the Liénard–Wiechert potential, which is a step towards special relativity.

The Lorentz transformation of the electric field of a moving charge into a non-moving observer&#x27;s reference frame results in the appearance of a mathematical term commonly called the magnetic field. Conversely, the &quot;magnetic&quot; field generated by a moving charge disappears and becomes a purely &quot;electrostatic&quot; field in a comoving frame of reference. Maxwell&#x27;s equations are thus simply an empirical fit to special relativistic effects in a classical model of the Universe. As electric and magnetic fields are reference frame dependent and thus intertwined, one speaks of &quot;electromagnetic&quot; fields. Special relativity provides the transformation rules for how an electromagnetic field in one inertial frame appears in another inertial frame.

Maxwell&#x27;s equations in the 3D form are already consistent with the physical content of special relativity, although they are easier to manipulate in a manifestly covariant form, that is, in the language of tensor calculus.

== Theories of relativity and quantum mechanics ==
&quot;Special&quot; relativity can be combined with quantum mechanics to form relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. How &quot;general&quot; relativity and quantum mechanics can be unified is one of the unsolved problems in physics; quantum gravity and a &quot;theory of everything&quot;, which require a unification including general relativity too, are active and ongoing areas in theoretical research.

The early Bohr–Sommerfeld atomic model explained the fine structure of alkali metal atoms using both special relativity and the preliminary knowledge on quantum mechanics of the time.

In 1928, Paul Dirac constructed an influential relativistic wave equation, now known as the Dirac equation in his honour, that is fully compatible both with special relativity and with the final version of quantum theory existing after 1926. This equation not only described the intrinsic angular momentum of the electrons called &quot;spin&quot;, it also led to the prediction of the antiparticle of the electron (the positron), and fine structure could only be fully explained with special relativity. It was the first foundation of &quot;relativistic quantum mechanics&quot;.

On the other hand, the existence of antiparticles leads to the conclusion that relativistic quantum mechanics is not enough for a more accurate and complete theory of particle interactions. Instead, a theory of particles interpreted as quantized fields, called &quot;quantum field theory&quot;, becomes necessary; in which particles can be created and destroyed throughout space and time.

== Status ==
Special relativity in its Minkowski spacetime is accurate only when the absolute value of the gravitational potential is much less than &quot;c&quot;2 in the region of interest. In a strong gravitational field, one must use general relativity. General relativity becomes special relativity at the limit of a weak field. At very small scales, such as at the Planck length and below, quantum effects must be taken into consideration resulting in quantum gravity. But at macroscopic scales and in the absence of strong gravitational fields, special relativity is experimentally tested to extremely high degree of accuracy (10−20)
and thus accepted by the physics community. Experimental results that appear to contradict it are not reproducible and are thus widely believed to be due to experimental errors.

Special relativity is mathematically self-consistent, and it is an organic part of all modern physical theories, most notably quantum field theory, string theory, and general relativity (in the limiting case of negligible gravitational fields).

Newtonian mechanics mathematically follows from special relativity at small velocities (compared to the speed of light) – thus Newtonian mechanics can be considered as a special relativity of slow moving bodies. See &quot;Classical mechanics&quot; for a more detailed discussion.

Several experiments predating Einstein&#x27;s 1905 paper are now interpreted as evidence for relativity. Of these it is known Einstein was aware of the Fizeau experiment before 1905, and historians have concluded that Einstein was at least aware of the Michelson–Morley experiment as early as 1899 despite claims he made in his later years that it played no role in his development of the theory.
* The Fizeau experiment (1851, repeated by Michelson and Morley in 1886) measured the speed of light in moving media, with results that are consistent with relativistic addition of colinear velocities.
* The famous Michelson–Morley experiment (1881, 1887) gave further support to the postulate that detecting an absolute reference velocity was not achievable. It should be stated here that, contrary to many alternative claims, it said little about the invariance of the speed of light with respect to the source and observer&#x27;s velocity, as both source and observer were travelling together at the same velocity at all times.
* The Trouton–Noble experiment (1903) showed that the torque on a capacitor is independent of position and inertial reference frame.
* The Experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902, 1904) showed that length contraction does not lead to birefringence for a co-moving observer, in accordance with the relativity principle.

Particle accelerators accelerate and measure the properties of particles moving at near the speed of light, where their behavior is consistent with relativity theory and inconsistent with the earlier Newtonian mechanics. These machines would simply not work if they were not engineered according to relativistic principles. In addition, a considerable number of modern experiments have been conducted to test special relativity. Some examples:
* Tests of relativistic energy and momentum – testing the limiting speed of particles
* Ives–Stilwell experiment – testing relativistic Doppler effect and time dilation
* Experimental testing of time dilation – relativistic effects on a fast-moving particle&#x27;s half-life
* Kennedy–Thorndike experiment – time dilation in accordance with Lorentz transformations
* Hughes–Drever experiment – testing isotropy of space and mass
* Modern searches for Lorentz violation – various modern tests
* Experiments to test emission theory demonstrated that the speed of light is independent of the speed of the emitter.
* Experiments to test the aether drag hypothesis – no &quot;aether flow obstruction&quot;.

== Technical discussion of spacetime ==
=== Geometry of spacetime ===
==== Comparison between flat Euclidean space and Minkowski space ====

Special relativity uses a &quot;flat&quot; 4-dimensional Minkowski space – an example of a spacetime. Minkowski spacetime appears to be very similar to the standard 3-dimensional Euclidean space, but there is a crucial difference with respect to time.

In 3D space, the differential of distance (line element) &quot;ds&quot; is defined by
formula_189
where are the differentials of the three spatial dimensions. In Minkowski geometry, there is an extra dimension with coordinate &quot;X&quot;0 derived from time, such that the distance differential fulfills
formula_190
where are the differentials of the four spacetime dimensions. This suggests a deep theoretical insight: special relativity is simply a rotational symmetry of our spacetime, analogous to the rotational symmetry of Euclidean space (see Fig. 10-1). Just as Euclidean space uses a Euclidean metric, so spacetime uses a Minkowski metric. Basically, special relativity can be stated as the &quot;invariance of any spacetime interval&quot; (that is the 4D distance between any two events) when viewed from &quot;any inertial reference frame&quot;. All equations and effects of special relativity can be derived from this rotational symmetry (the Poincaré group) of Minkowski spacetime.

The actual form of &quot;ds&quot; above depends on the metric and on the choices for the &quot;X&quot;0 coordinate.
To make the time coordinate look like the space coordinates, it can be treated as imaginary: (this is called a Wick rotation).
According to Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1971, §2.3), ultimately the deeper understanding of both special and general relativity will come from the study of the Minkowski metric (described below) and to take , rather than a &quot;disguised&quot; Euclidean metric using &quot;ict&quot; as the time coordinate.

Some authors use , with factors of &quot;c&quot; elsewhere to compensate; for instance, spatial coordinates are divided by &quot;c&quot; or factors of &quot;c&quot;±2 are included in the metric tensor.
These numerous conventions can be superseded by using natural units where . Then space and time have equivalent units, and no factors of &quot;c&quot; appear anywhere.

==== 3D spacetime ====
If we reduce the spatial dimensions to 2, so that we can represent the physics in a 3D space
formula_191
we see that the null geodesics lie along a dual-cone (see Fig. 10-2) defined by the equation;
formula_192
or simply
formula_193
which is the equation of a circle of radius &quot;c dt&quot;.

==== 4D spacetime ====

If we extend this to three spatial dimensions, the null geodesics are the 4-dimensional cone:
formula_194
so
formula_195
As illustrated in Fig. 10-3, the null geodesics can be visualized as a set of continuous concentric spheres with radii = &quot;c dt&quot;.

This null dual-cone represents the &quot;line of sight&quot; of a point in space. That is, when we look at the stars and say &quot;The light from that star that I am receiving is &quot;X&quot; years old&quot;, we are looking down this line of sight: a null geodesic. We are looking at an event a distance formula_196 away and a time &quot;d&quot;/&quot;c&quot; in the past. For this reason the null dual cone is also known as the &quot;light cone&quot;. (The point in the lower left of the Fig. 10-2 represents the star, the origin represents the observer, and the line represents the null geodesic &quot;line of sight&quot;.)

The cone in the −&quot;t&quot; region is the information that the point is &quot;receiving&quot;, while the cone in the +&quot;t&quot; section is the information that the point is &quot;sending&quot;.

The geometry of Minkowski space can be depicted using Minkowski diagrams, which are useful also in understanding many of the thought experiments in special relativity.

=== Physics in spacetime ===

==== Transformations of physical quantities between reference frames ====

Above, the Lorentz transformation for the time coordinate and three space coordinates illustrates that they are intertwined. This is true more generally: certain pairs of &quot;timelike&quot; and &quot;spacelike&quot; quantities naturally combine on equal footing under the same Lorentz transformation.

The Lorentz transformation in standard configuration above, that is, for a boost in the &quot;x&quot;-direction, can be recast into matrix form as follows:
formula_197

In Newtonian mechanics, quantities that have magnitude and direction are mathematically described as 3d vectors in Euclidean space, and in general they are parametrized by time. In special relativity, this notion is extended by adding the appropriate timelike quantity to a spacelike vector quantity, and we have 4d vectors, or &quot;four-vectors&quot;, in Minkowski spacetime. The components of vectors are written using tensor index notation, as this has numerous advantages. The notation makes it clear the equations are manifestly covariant under the Poincaré group, thus bypassing the tedious calculations to check this fact. In constructing such equations, we often find that equations previously thought to be unrelated are, in fact, closely connected being part of the same tensor equation. Recognizing other physical quantities as tensors simplifies their transformation laws. Throughout, upper indices (superscripts) are contravariant indices rather than exponents except when they indicate a square (this should be clear from the context), and lower indices (subscripts) are covariant indices. For simplicity and consistency with the earlier equations, Cartesian coordinates will be used.

The simplest example of a four-vector is the position of an event in spacetime, which constitutes a timelike component &quot;ct&quot; and spacelike component , in a contravariant position four-vector with components:
formula_198
where we define so that the time coordinate has the same dimension of distance as the other spatial dimensions; so that space and time are treated equally. Now the transformation of the contravariant components of the position 4-vector can be compactly written as:
formula_199
where there is an implied summation on formula_200 from 0 to 3, and formula_201 is a matrix.

More generally, all contravariant components of a four-vector formula_202 transform from one frame to another frame by a Lorentz transformation:
formula_203

Examples of other 4-vectors include the four-velocity , defined as the derivative of the position 4-vector with respect to proper time:
formula_204
where the Lorentz factor is:
formula_205

The relativistic energy formula_206 and relativistic momentum formula_207 of an object are respectively the timelike and spacelike components of a contravariant four-momentum vector:
formula_208
where &quot;m&quot; is the invariant mass.

The four-acceleration is the proper time derivative of 4-velocity:
formula_209

The transformation rules for &quot;three&quot;-dimensional velocities and accelerations are very awkward; even above in standard configuration the velocity equations are quite complicated owing to their non-linearity. On the other hand, the transformation of &quot;four&quot;-velocity and &quot;four&quot;-acceleration are simpler by means of the Lorentz transformation matrix.

The four-gradient of a scalar field φ transforms covariantly rather than contravariantly:
formula_210
which is the transpose of:
formula_211
only in Cartesian coordinates. It is the covariant derivative that transforms in manifest covariance, in Cartesian coordinates this happens to reduce to the partial derivatives, but not in other coordinates.

More generally, the &quot;co&quot;variant components of a 4-vector transform according to the &quot;inverse&quot; Lorentz transformation:
formula_212
where formula_213 is the reciprocal matrix of .

The postulates of special relativity constrain the exact form the Lorentz transformation matrices take.

More generally, most physical quantities are best described as (components of) tensors. So to transform from one frame to another, we use the well-known tensor transformation law
formula_214
where formula_215 is the reciprocal matrix of . All tensors transform by this rule.

An example of a four-dimensional second order antisymmetric tensor is the relativistic angular momentum, which has six components: three are the classical angular momentum, and the other three are related to the boost of the center of mass of the system. The derivative of the relativistic angular momentum with respect to proper time is the relativistic torque, also second order antisymmetric tensor.

The electromagnetic field tensor is another second order antisymmetric tensor field, with six components: three for the electric field and another three for the magnetic field. There is also the stress–energy tensor for the electromagnetic field, namely the electromagnetic stress–energy tensor.

==== Metric ====

The metric tensor allows one to define the inner product of two vectors, which in turn allows one to assign a magnitude to the vector. Given the four-dimensional nature of spacetime the Minkowski metric &quot;η&quot; has components (valid with suitably chosen coordinates), which can be arranged in a matrix:
formula_216
which is equal to its reciprocal, , in those frames. Throughout we use the signs as above, different authors use different conventions – see Minkowski metric alternative signs.

The Poincaré group is the most general group of transformations that preserves the Minkowski metric:
formula_217
and this is the physical symmetry underlying special relativity.

The metric can be used for raising and lowering indices on vectors and tensors. Invariants can be constructed using the metric, the inner product of a 4-vector &quot;T&quot; with another 4-vector &quot;S&quot; is:
formula_218

Invariant means that it takes the same value in all inertial frames, because it is a scalar (0 rank tensor), and so no appears in its trivial transformation. The magnitude of the 4-vector &quot;T&quot; is the positive square root of the inner product with itself:
formula_219

One can extend this idea to tensors of higher order, for a second order tensor we can form the invariants:
formula_220
similarly for higher order tensors. Invariant expressions, particularly inner products of 4-vectors with themselves, provide equations that are useful for calculations, because one does not need to perform Lorentz transformations to determine the invariants.

==== Relativistic kinematics and invariance ====

The coordinate differentials transform also contravariantly:
formula_221
so the squared length of the differential of the position four-vector &quot;dXμ&quot; constructed using
formula_222
is an invariant. Notice that when the line element &quot;dX2 is negative that is the differential of proper time, while when &quot;dX2 is positive, is differential of the proper distance.

The 4-velocity &quot;U&quot;μ has an invariant form:
formula_223
which means all velocity four-vectors have a magnitude of &quot;c&quot;. This is an expression of the fact that there is no such thing as being at coordinate rest in relativity: at the least, you are always moving forward through time. Differentiating the above equation by &quot;τ&quot; produces:
formula_224
So in special relativity, the acceleration four-vector and the velocity four-vector are orthogonal.

==== Relativistic dynamics and invariance ====

The invariant magnitude of the momentum 4-vector generates the energy–momentum relation:
formula_225

We can work out what this invariant is by first arguing that, since it is a scalar, it does not matter in which reference frame we calculate it, and then by transforming to a frame where the total momentum is zero.
formula_226

We see that the rest energy is an independent invariant. A rest energy can be calculated even for particles and systems in motion, by translating to a frame in which momentum is zero.

The rest energy is related to the mass according to the celebrated equation discussed above:
formula_227

The mass of systems measured in their center of momentum frame (where total momentum is zero) is given by the total energy of the system in this frame. It may not be equal to the sum of individual system masses measured in other frames.

To use Newton&#x27;s third law of motion, both forces must be defined as the rate of change of momentum with respect to the same time coordinate. That is, it requires the 3D force defined above. Unfortunately, there is no tensor in 4D that contains the components of the 3D force vector among its components.

If a particle is not traveling at &quot;c&quot;, one can transform the 3D force from the particle&#x27;s co-moving reference frame into the observer&#x27;s reference frame. This yields a 4-vector called the four-force. It is the rate of change of the above energy momentum four-vector with respect to proper time. The covariant version of the four-force is:
formula_228

In the rest frame of the object, the time component of the four-force is zero unless the &quot;invariant mass&quot; of the object is changing (this requires a non-closed system in which energy/mass is being directly added or removed from the object) in which case it is the negative of that rate of change of mass, times &quot;c&quot;. In general, though, the components of the four-force are not equal to the components of the three-force, because the three force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to coordinate time, that is, &quot;dp&quot;/&quot;dt&quot; while the four-force is defined by the rate of change of momentum with respect to proper time, that is, &quot;dp&quot;/&quot;dτ&quot;.

In a continuous medium, the 3D &quot;density of force&quot; combines with the &quot;density of power&quot; to form a covariant 4-vector. The spatial part is the result of dividing the force on a small cell (in 3-space) by the volume of that cell. The time component is −1/&quot;c&quot; times the power transferred to that cell divided by the volume of the cell. This will be used below in the section on electromagnetism.

<doc id="26968" wikidata="Q219501" url="?curid=26968" title="Saab AB">
<text>Saab AB (originally , , acronym SAAB), with subsidiaries collectively known as the Saab Group (), is a Swedish aerospace and defence company primarily operating from Sweden. The company is headquartered in Stockholm, but its development and manufacturing operations are undertaken in Linköping.

The company was formally founded by AB Bofors in 1937, by reforming the aero engine division of company NOHAB (founded in 1930), located in Trollhättan, into a proper aircraft manufacturer. It would soon merge with aircraft manufacturer ASJA (founded in 1931), located in Linköping, in 1940, which had it own design bureau and is considered the spiritual predecessor to today&#x27;s Saab AB. This formed the SAAB-concern, with the factory in Trollhättan becoming &quot;SAAB/T&quot; and the factory in Linköping (previously ASJA) becoming &quot;SAAB/L&quot; and design headquarters.

From 1947, Saab started producing automobiles, the automobile division being spun off as Saab Automobile in 1990, a joint venture with General Motors. The joint venture ended in 2000 when GM took complete ownership. From 1968 onwards the company was in a merger with commercial vehicle manufacturer Scania-Vabis, known as Saab-Scania. The two were de-merged in 1995 by the new owners, Investor AB. Despite the demerger, both Saab and Scania share the right to use the griffin logo, which originates from the coat of arms of the Swedish region of Scania.

== History ==
=== Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (SAAB) ===

Saab was founded by AB Bofors in 1937 as &quot;Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget&quot; (acronym &quot;SAAB&quot;; ), located in Trollhättan, by reforming the aircraft engine division of engineering company NOHAB (&quot;Nohab Flygmotorfabrik AB&quot;, ), which had been acquired by Bofors in 1935. Bofors had in recent years been in development with the Swedish Air Force (SAF) to create aircraft weaponry and ordnance and wanted to create an aircraft manufacturing subortinate which could take a monopoly over the SAF&#x27;s future aircraft orders, a premise supported by the SAF. At the time, however, there already was a competing company formed with this premise in 1931, by the name of ASJA (&quot;AB Svenska Järnvägsverkstädernas Aeroplanavdelning&quot;, ), located in Linköping, which was a successor to Svenska Aero (&quot;SA&quot;) under Sven Blomberg, head designer of the Svenska Aero Jaktfalken fighter plane. ASJA had solicit Blomberg from Svenska Aero in 1930 and later purchased the company in 1932 along with their portfolio of designs, quickly making them the leading aeroplane manufacturer in Sweden at the time.

Bofors started negotiating with ASJA in 1936 to see if they could enter into a sort of stock sharing consortium lead under a parent company. Such a deal was struck in 1937, with support from the SAF, the parent company being named &quot;AB Förenade Flygverkstäder&quot; (&quot;AFF&quot;). To ease future competition, Bofors bought out small competitor E. Sparmanns aircraft workshop, which at the time was developing a modern fighter for the SAF, under the name of .

Despite the consortium, SAAB in Trollhättan (previously Nohab Flygmotorfabrik AB) still had to compete with ASJA over contracts and the cooperation never came to fruition. While SAAB in Trollhättan got a few contracts, such as license producing the Junkers Ju 86 bomber for the Swedish Air Force (SAF designation &quot;B 3&quot;) in 1938, ASJA won most of the contracts from the SAF, such as license production of the Hawker Hart (&quot;B 4&quot;) and Northrop Model 8 (&quot;B 5&quot;). After ASJA&#x27;s design bureau produced the winning designs for what eventually became the Saab 17 (ASJA L-10) and Saab 18 (ASJA L-11), beating out AFF/SAAB&#x27;s competing F.1 and G.1 designs, it was decided in March 1939 to scrap AFF and formally reform ASJA into the SAAB-concern, the Trollhättan factory (previously Nohab) becoming &quot;SAAB/T&quot; and the Linköping factory (previous ASJA) becoming &quot;SAAB/L&quot;, the latter becoming headquarters.
The basic initial development was the problems for the Swedish government to get quality military aircraft delivered at the beginning of the Second World War. The final trigger was the inability to get a large number of Seversky P-35 delivered from the United States. From then on the Swedish government focused on establishing domestic production and development of military aircraft which Saab became involved in, a policy that has continued to this day. The first SAAB-developed aircraft was the SAAB 17 light dive bomber (first flight: 1940-05-18), soon followed by the SAAB 18 schnellbomber (first flight: 1942-06-19) and SAAB 21 single-seat fighter (first flight: 1943-07-30), among other developments, the latter being the first aircraft to see service with a modern style ejection seat, using gunpowder to eject instead of compressed air like the contemporary German counterparts.
Originally manufacturing aircraft, the company sought ways in which to diversify its business. Before the Second World War, a majority of cars in Sweden were imported from the United States. The US car manufacturers were producing tanks during the war, and the US domestic market took all the US car production in the late 1940s. Hence there was a large supply shortage of private cars in Europe and Sweden, and buyers were facing waiting lists for years for new cars. In the late 1940s, Saab began manufacturing cars at its Saab Automobile division, based in Trollhättan. The first car was the Saab 92; full-scale production started 12 December 1949, based on the prototype Ursaab. Around 1950 the style &quot;Saab&quot; started being used instead of the all caps &quot;SAAB&quot;.

In the late 1950s Saab ventured into the computer market with Datasaab. The company was a result partly of the need to make a computer that would be small enough to mount in an aeroplane as navigational equipment. During the 1960s several computers were developed and sold to European countries, for uses such as banking. The aircraft computer (CK 37) was used in 1971 in the Viggen. The company was sold in 1975 to Sperry UNIVAC, while Saab retained its flight computer development.

=== Saab AB ===
In May 1965, the company name was changed to Saab AB to reflect its broad range of activities.

In 1968 Saab AB merged with the Swedish lorry, bus and heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturer Scania-Vabis, and became Saab-Scania AB.

In 1990 General Motors bought 51% of the car division Saab Automobile, and acquired the rest a decade later.

In 1991 Investor AB completed a leveraged buyout of Saab-Scania AB. Investor AB acquired all the outstanding shares in Saab-Scania for approximately SEK 21 billion. Saab-Scania became a wholly owned subsidiary of Investor AB and the company was de-listed.

In 1995 Saab-Scania was divided by Investor AB into two independent companies, de-merging into Scania AB and Saab AB. The intention by Investor AB was to broaden ownership in the two companies later. Following the sale of 50% of the car division Saab Automobile AB to General Motors, the main reason behind the merger with lorry manufacturer Scania-Vabis in 1968 had disappeared.

Also in 1995 Saab Military Aircraft and British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) formed the joint venture company Saab-BAe Gripen AB, to manufacture, market and support Gripen internationally. This co-operation was extended in 2001 with the formation of Gripen International for the same purpose. From 1998 until 2005, British Aerospace/BAE was the largest shareholder in Saab following its acquisition of a 35% stake from Investor AB. In January 2005, BAE Systems reduced its shareholding to 20%. Investor AB maintained a 20% share.

On 16 November 1999, Saab announced its intention is to purchase Celsius AB and the acquisition was concluded by early March 2000.

In September 2000 United Defense Industries (UDI) purchased Bofors Weapon Systems from Saab (the autocannon and tube artillery interests), while Saab retained the missile interests.

In December 2005 Saab joined the Dassault nEUROn project as a major partner.

In October 2008 the company announced its intention to merge its operations with that of Simrad Optronics. The new unit will develop high-tech optronics products and will be headquartered in Norway, although other details of the new arrangement have not been finalized.

In 2010 the company restructured from fifteen business units into five business areas; Aeronautics, Dynamics, Electronic Defence Systems, Security and Defence Solutions, and Support and Services. According to Saab the restructuring was undertaken to become more market and customer oriented.

In March 2010, BAE Systems sold half of its 20% stake in the company to Investor AB, which then became the major shareholder. In June 2011, the British company sold its remaining stake bringing its 16-year involvement in Saab to an end.

As of August 2020, Investor AB owns a 30.16% stake in the company (39.69% of the voting rights) and is the top owner.

In August 2023, it was announced Saab had acquired the Bedford, UK–based manufacturer of AI-enabled autonomous swarm systems, Blue Bear Research Systems.

In September 2023, it was announced Saab had acquired the San Francisco–headquartered artificial intelligence / machine learning development company CrowdAI.

=== Aircraft production ===
The main focus of aircraft production is fighter aircraft. Saab has been making aircraft since the 1930s, and the jet predecessors of the JAS 39 Gripen were the Tunnan, the Lansen, the Draken and the Viggen. The last civilian models made by Saab were the Saab 340 and Saab 2000. Both were mid-range turboprop-powered airliners. The development and the manufacturing of these aircraft is undertaken in Linköping.

In May 2019, Saab announced plans to locate a new U.S. manufacturing operation in Discovery Park District Aerospace on the west side of the Purdue University campus. The facility will do the final assembly of the T-X advanced jet trainer, which is a plane developed by Boeing and Saab for the United States Air Force.

== Organization ==
=== Aeronautics ===

Aeronautics offers airborne systems, related subsystems, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and aerostructures. The business area Aeronautics is responsible for airframe structures for JAS 39 Gripen, and whole sections for Airbus, Boeing and NH90; &amp; system development of the JAS 39 Gripen and the Skeldar VTOL UAV. Aeronautics is also partner in the European joint UAV-project Dassault nEUROn, where Saab develop avionics and is responsible for the overall architecture and design. Marketing and support of the JAS 39 Gripen fighter jet is also included in the Aeronautics business area.

===Dynamics===
Dynamics offers ground combat weapons, missile systems, torpedoes, sensor systems, unmanned underwater vehicles such as &quot;Sabertooth&quot; and signature management systems, remotely operated vehicles for armed forces as well as civil security applications.

Short range weapons offered include the Carl Gustaf, AT4/AT4 CS, STRIX and NLAW. Missile systems offered are the RBS 70, RBS 23 and RBS 15.

===Surveillance===
Surveillance offers airborne surveillance (including GlobalEye, Saab 2000 Erieye) AEW&amp;C and fighter radar, ground-based and naval radar (including the Giraffe radar range), electronic warfare (including IDAS and ESTL) and combat systems and C4I.

===Industrial Products and Services===
Industrial Products and Services was established on 1 January 2015 and comprises the business units Combitech, Avionics Systems, Aerostructures, Traffic Management, Vricon as well as the development of product ideas that fall outside of Saab&#x27;s core business.
The business units within Industrial Products and Services differ from Saab&#x27;s other operations by their focus on business-to-business (B2B) customers or because they are not dependent on Saab&#x27;s principal end-customers. Other business areas within Saab have a customer base largely consisting of public authorities. With different customer groups come different management strategies and priorities. Opportunities to strengthen these operations in the long term are greater in the new organisation. Industrial Products and Services will work with individual growth strategies for each business unit.

===Support and Services===
Support and Services offer maintenance, integrated support, field facilities, logistics and regional aircraft maintenance.

Saab Aircraft Leasing leases and resells Saab aircraft to airlines. It completed 30 transactions in 2010.

===Saab Barracuda LLC===
The Saab Barracuda LLC facility in Lillington, North Carolina, manufactures signature management products and provides customized services. Foremost among the camouflage, concealment and deception products is the Ultra Lightweight Camouflage Net System (ULCANS) which provides multi-spectral protection against visual, near infrared, thermal infrared and broadband radar detection. ULCANS is fielded with the U.S. Army and other Department of Defense organizations and is available in both woodland and desert versions. Saab Barracuda is one of only two qualified suppliers of ULCANS in North America, and currently has a competed US$1.76 billion contract, along with GMA Cover Corp.

===Saab Kockums===
The Kockums shipyard is the base for the company&#x27;s submarine division.

<text>Škoda Auto [[Akciová společnost|a.s.]] (), often shortened to Škoda, is a Czech automobile manufacturer established in 1925 as the successor to Laurin &amp; Klement and headquartered in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic. Škoda Works became state owned in 1948. After 1991, it was gradually privatized becoming the German multinational conglomerate Volkswagen Group. The Volkswagen Group became a partial subsidiary in 1994 and a wholly owned subsidiary in 2000.

Škoda automobiles are sold in over 100 countries, and in 2018, total global sales reached 1.25 million units, an increase of 4.4% from the previous year. The operating profit was €1.6 billion in 2017, an increase of 34.6% over the previous year. As of 2017, Škoda&#x27;s profit margin was the second-highest of all Volkswagen AG brands after Porsche.

==History==
The Škoda Works was founded by Czech engineer Emil von Škoda in 1859 in Plzeň, then in the Kingdom of Bohemia in the Austrian Empire, and was originally an arms manufacturer. It was one of the largest European industrial conglomerates in the 20th century, and is the predecessor of today&#x27;s Škoda Auto, Doosan Škoda Power, and Škoda Transportation companies. Although Škoda is named after its founder, the word &quot;škoda&quot; also means &quot;pity&quot; or &quot;shame&quot; in Czech.

===Laurin &amp; Klement===


As with many long-established car manufacturers, the company that became Škoda Auto started by manufacturing bicycles. Škoda (then Laurin &amp; Klement) was founded in 1896 as a velocipede manufacturer.

In , 26-year-old Václav Klement (1868–1938), who was a bookseller in Mladá Boleslav, Kingdom of Bohemia (today&#x27;s Czech Republic, then part of Austria-Hungary), was unable to obtain spare parts to repair his German bicycle. Klement returned his bicycle to the manufacturers, Seidel and Naumann, with a letter, in Czech, asking them to carry out repairs, only to receive a reply, in German: &quot;If you want us to answer you, we insist that you convey your message in a language we understand.&quot; Not satisfied with the reply and realizing the business potential, Klement, despite having no technical experience, decided to start a bicycle repair shop, which he and Václav Laurin opened in 1896 in Mladá Boleslav. Before going into partnership with Klement, Laurin had been an established bicycle manufacturer in the nearby town of Turnov.

In 1898, after moving to their newly built factory, the pair bought a Werner &quot;Motocyclette&quot;. Laurin &amp; Klement&#x27;s first motorcyclette, powered by an engine mounted on the handlebars driving the front wheels, proved dangerous and unreliable – an early accident on it cost Laurin a front tooth. To design a safer machine with its structure around the engine, the pair wrote to German ignition specialist Robert Bosch for advice on a different electromagnetic system. Their new Slavia motorcycle made its debut in 1899, and the company became the first motorcycle factory in Central Europe. In 1900, with a company workforce of 32, Slavia exports began and 150 machines were shipped to London for the Hewtson firm. Shortly afterwards, the press credited them as makers of the first motorcycle.

By 1905, the firm was manufacturing automobiles, making it the second-oldest car manufacturer in the Czech lands after Tatra. The company, with an area of , had a workforce of 320 and used 170 special machine tools, power-driven by of steam power. The first model, Voiturette A, was a success, and the company was established both within Austria-Hungary and internationally.

===Škoda===

After World War I, the Laurin &amp; Klement company began producing trucks, but in 1924, after running into problems and being affected by a fire on their premises, the company sought a new partner.

Meanwhile, &quot;Akciová společnost, dříve Škodovy závody&quot; (Limited Company, formerly the Škoda Works), an arms manufacturer and multisector concern in Plzeň, which had become one of the largest industrial enterprises in Europe and the largest in Czechoslovakia, sought to enlarge its nonarms-manufacturing base, so acquired Laurin &amp; Klement in 1925. It also started manufacturing cars in cooperation with Hispano-Suiza. Most of the later production took place under Škoda&#x27;s name.
An assembly line was used for production from 1930 onwards. Also in 1930, a formal spin-off of the car became a new company, &quot;Akciová společnost pro automobilový průmysl&quot; or abbreviated &quot;ASAP&quot;, happened. ASAP remained a wholly owned subsidiary of the Škoda Works, and continued to sell cars under the Škoda marque. Apart from the factory in Mladá Boleslav, it included also the firm&#x27;s representation, sales offices, and services, as well as a central workshop in Prague. At the time, the car factory in Mladá Boleslav covered an area of 215,000 m2 and employed 3,750 blue-collar and 500 white-collar workers.

In 1932 ASAP-Škoda in Mladá Boleslav Bohemia produced a type Škoda 932 prototype of a streamlined 4-seater two-door car with a rear air-cooled flat-four engine designed by Karel Hrdlička and Vsevold Korolkov. This car&#x27;s bodywork closely resembled the small car designs yet to come.

After a decline caused by the economic depression, Škoda introduced a new line of cars in the 1930s, which significantly differed from its previous products. A new design of chassis with backbone tube and all-around independent suspension was developed under the leadership of chief engineer Vladimír Matouš and modelled on the one first introduced by Hans Ledwinka in Tatra. First used on model Škoda 420 Standard in 1933, it aimed at solving insufficient torsional stiffness of the ladder frame.

The new design of chassis became the basis for models Popular (845–1,089 cc), Rapid (1,165–1,766 cc), Favorit (1,802–2,091 cc), and Superb (2,492–3,991 cc). While in 1933 Škoda had a 14% share of the Czechoslovak car market and occupied third place behind Praga and Tatra, the new line made it a market leader by 1936, with a 39% share in 1938.

===World War II===
During the occupation of Czechoslovakia in World War II, the Škoda Works were turned into part of the &quot;Reichswerke Hermann Göring&quot; serving the Nazi German war effort by producing components for military terrain vehicles, military planes, other weapons components and cartridge cases. Vehicle output decreased from 7,052 in 1939 to 683 in 1944, of which only 35 were passenger cars. Between January and May 1945, 316 trucks were produced. The UK and US air forces bombed the Škoda works repeatedly between 1940 and 1945. The final massive air raid took place on 25 April 1945, and resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Škoda armament works and about 1,000 dead or injured.

===Post World War II===

When, by July 1945, the Mladá Boleslav factory had been reconstructed, production of Škoda&#x27;s first post-World War II car, the 1101 series, began. It was essentially an updated version of the pre-World War II Škoda Popular. In the autumn of 1948, Škoda (along with all other large manufacturers) became part of the communist planned economy, which meant it was separated from the parent company, Škoda Works. In spite of unfavourable political conditions and losing contact with technical development in noncommunist countries, Škoda retained a good reputation until the 1960s, producing models such as the Škoda 440 Spartak, 445 Octavia, Felicia, and Škoda 1000 MB.
Starting in 1957, the Škoda Octavia, and later the Felicia, were imported to the United States amid a wave of new imports as some American consumers sought out cars smaller than typical Detroit offerings. Škoda’s American dealerships, concentrated on the West Coast and in the Northeast, quickly encountered buyer resistance due to the Cold War political climate in ways that comparable Western European cars did not. The cars were also not well supported after sale, making even minor repairs a hassle. U.S. sales peaked in 1959 but fell sharply after 1960, and many were sold at steep discounts. A few later cars, including 1000MB models, were sold in the U.S. as late as 1966-67, but in very small numbers. Škoda has not sold vehicles in the U.S. since then but did sell cars in Canada from 1984 to 1990.
In the late 1980s, Škoda (then named &quot;Automobilové závody, národní podnik&quot; or abbreviated &quot;AZNP&quot;) was still manufacturing cars that conceptually dated back to the 1960s, and in Western Europe at least - were aimed squarely at the budget end of the market. Rear-engined models such as the Škoda 105/120 (Estelle) and Rapid sold steadily and performed well against more modern makes in races such as the RAC Rally in the 1970s and 1980s. They won their class in the RAC rally for 17 years running. They were powered by a , engine. In spite of its dated image and becoming the subject of negative jokes – What do you call a Škoda with a sunroof? A skip!–Škodas remained a common sight on the roads of the United Kingdom and Western Europe throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Sport versions of the Estelle and earlier models were produced, using the name &quot;Rapid&quot; (originally sold as the Garde in some markets). Soft-top versions were also available. The Rapid was once described as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s Porsche&quot;, and had significant sales success in the UK during the 1980s.

In 1987, the Favorit was introduced, and was one of a trio of compact front-wheel drive hatchbacks from the three main Eastern Bloc manufacturers around that time, the others being VAZ&#x27;s Lada Samara and Zastava&#x27;s Yugo Sana. The Favorit&#x27;s appearance was the work of Italian design company Bertone. With some motor technology licensed from western Europe, but still using the Škoda-designed 1289 cc engine, Škoda engineers designed a car comparable to western production. The technological gap still existed, but began closing rapidly. The Favorit was very popular in Czechoslovakia and other Eastern Bloc countries. It also sold well in Western Europe, especially in the UK and Denmark due to its low price, and was regarded as solid and reliable. However, it was perceived as having poor value compared with contemporary Western European designs. The Favorit&#x27;s trim levels were improved, and it continued to be sold until the introduction of the Felicia in 1994.

===Volkswagen Group subsidiary===

Until 1990, Škoda was still making its outdated range of rear-engined small family cars, although it had started production of the Favorit front-wheel drive hatchback in 1987 as an eventual replacement.

The fall of communism with the Velvet Revolution brought great changes to Czechoslovakia, and most industries were subject to privatization. In the case of Škoda Automobile, the state authorities brought in a strong foreign partner. The tender for privatization was announced in 1990; 24 different companies were registered for the tender, while only eight of them expressed a serious interest – BMW, GM, Renault, Volvo, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat, and Mercedes-Benz. In August 1990, VW and Renault were on the shortlist. Renault first offered to terminate Favorit production and replace it with the outdated Renault 18 derivative and new Renault Twingo, which would have eliminated the Škoda brand. This offer was declined and Renault prepared a new one. They offered a 60:40 joint venture (40% share of Renault), while Škoda Favorit production was to be retained and produced side by side with the Renault 19, and producing engine units, gearboxes, and other components for Renault. Total investment would have been US$2.6 billion (US$ billion in 2019).

Volkswagen offered to continue Favorit production and preserve the Škoda brand, including retention of research and development. Volkswagen offered a purchase of 30% Škoda share, gradually increasing to 70%. Volkswagen&#x27;s total investment would have been US$6.6 billion (US$ billion in 2019) by 2000. The government inclined on the Renault side, while the Škoda trade union preferred VW, because it offered significantly larger potential for development of the company.

Volkswagen was chosen by the Czech government on 9 December 1990, and as a result, on 28 March 1991 a joint-venture partnership agreement with Volkswagen took place, marked by the transfer of a 30% share to the Volkswagen Group on 16 April 1991, raised later on 19 December 1994 to 60.3% and the year after, on 11 December 1995, to 70% of its shares, with the aim of making VW the largest and controlling shareholder of Škoda. On 30 May 2000, Volkswagen AG bought the remaining 30% of the company, thus making Škoda Auto a wholly owned subsidiary of the group. Backed by Volkswagen Group expertise and investments, the design–both style and engineering–has improved greatly. The 1994 model Felicia was effectively a reskin of the Favorit, but quality and equipment improvements helped, and in the Czech Republic, the car was perceived as good value for money and became popular. Sales improved across Europe, including the United Kingdom, where the Felicia was one of the highest-ranking cars in customer satisfaction surveys.
Volkswagen AG chairman Ferdinand Piëch personally chose Dirk van Braeckel as head of design, and the subsequent Octavia and Fabia models made their way to the demanding European Union markets. They are built on common Volkswagen Group floorpans. The Fabia, launched at the end of 1999, formed the basis for later versions of the Volkswagen Polo and SEAT Ibiza, while the Octavia, launched in 1996, has shared its floorpan with a host of cars, the most popular of which is the Volkswagen Golf Mk4.

The perception of Škoda in Western Europe has completely changed since the takeover by VW, in stark comparison with the reputation of the cars throughout the 1980s described by some as &quot;the laughing stock&quot; of the automotive world. As technical development progressed and attractive new models were marketed, Škoda&#x27;s image was initially slow to improve. In the UK, a major change was achieved with the ironic &quot;It is a Škoda, honest&quot; campaign, which began in 2000 when the Fabia launched. In a 2003 advertisement on British television, a new employee on the production line is fitting Škoda badges on the car bonnets. When some attractive-looking cars come along, he stands back, not fitting the badge, since they look so good they &quot;cannot be Škodas&quot;. This market campaign worked by confronting Škoda&#x27;s image problem head-on – a tactic which marketing professionals regarded as high risk. By 2005, Škoda was selling over 30,000 cars a year in the UK, a market share over 1%. For the first time in its UK history, a waiting list developed for deliveries from Škoda. UK owners have consistently ranked the brand at or near the top of customer-satisfaction surveys since the late 1990s.

In 1991, Škoda built 172,000 units, exporting 26% of its production to 30 countries, while in 2000, it built 435,000 units, exporting 82% of its production to 72 countries.

===Growth strategy===

One of the most important years for Škoda Auto was 2010, in terms of both products and management. On 1 September 2010, Prof. Dr. H.C. Winfried Vahland assumed responsibility for the management of the company, becoming the CEO of Škoda Auto. In the same year, Škoda set forth plans to double the company&#x27;s annual sales to at least 1.5 million by 2018 (later known as the &#x27;Growth Strategy&#x27;, ).

At the 2010 Paris Motor Show in September 2010, the company unveiled the Octavia Green E Line. This e-car concept was the forerunner to the e-car test fleet that Škoda released in 2012. The final first-generation Octavia (Tour) was produced at the Mladá Boleslav plant in November 2010. The worldwide production of this model exceeded 1.4 million units since its release in 1996. In 2010 for the first time in history, China overtook German sales to become Škoda&#x27;s largest individual market. In 2011, Škoda Auto celebrated its 20-year partnership with the Volkswagen Group. More than 75,000 visitors attended an open-house event held in Mladá Boleslav in the April. Earlier that year, the company provided details on its 2018 Growth Strategy: for at least one new or completely revised model to be released every six months. With this in mind, the company redesigned its logo and CI, which was presented at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show. Škoda&#x27;s main attraction at the event was the Vision&quot;D&quot; design concept, a forerunner to the future third-generation Octavia. Škoda presented the Mission&quot;L&quot; design study at the IAA in Frankfurt am Main in September, which was to become the basis of the company&#x27;s forthcoming compact model the European Rapid.
In the same year, the company started production of the new Rapid model in Pune, India (October 2011), and launched the Škoda Citigo at Volkswagen&#x27;s Bratislava plant (November 2011). In 2012, Škoda introduced two new mass production models. The European version of the Rapid premiered at the Paris Motor Show. This car was a successor to the first-generation Octavia in terms of its price bracket. The second model was the third-generation Octavia, which premiered in December 2012. In the same month, local production of the Yeti was launched at the Nizhny Novgorod GAZ factory.

In 2012, Škoda, introduced an emission-free (on the street) fleet of Octavia Green E Line e-cars on Czech roads to be used by external partners. Since internal tests on the fleet in late 2011, the e-fleet had driven more than 250,000 km. During the same year, Škoda celebrated several milestones, including 14 million Škoda cars being produced since 1905 (January), three million Fabias (May), 500,000 Superbs at the Kvasiny plant (June), and 5 years of Škoda operations in China.

Massive rejuvenation of the model range was a major tune for 2013 at Škoda: The Czech car maker launched the third-generation Octavia Combi and Octavia RS (both liftback and estate), as well as facelifted Superb and Superb Combi. They were accompanied by brand new members of the Rapid family as the Rapid Spaceback, the first Škoda hatchback car in the compact segment, and the Chinese version of the Rapid. The Yeti also faced significant changes. With the facelift, two design variants of Škoda&#x27;s compact SUV are now available, the city-likeoriented Yeti and rugged Yeti Outdoor. Chinese customers were also given a Yeti with an extended wheelbase.
In 2015, Volkswagen admitted that it had installed pollution-cheating software in many of its cars to fool regulators that its cars met emissions standards, when in fact they polluted at much higher levels than government standards. About 1.2 million Škoda cars worldwide were fitted with this emissions-cheating device. Škoda said that Volkswagen would recall and cover refitting costs for all of the cars affected by the scandal. In 2015, Škoda was voted the most reliable car brand in the UK. A corporate strategy was launched in 2015 to produce a range of all-electric cars from 2019.

Škoda Auto began manufacturing the large, seven-seat SUV Škoda Kodiaq in 2016, it was introduced at the Paris Motor Show in October 2016, and sales began at early 2017. In the second half of 2017, sales began of the new compact SUV Škoda Karoq, which officially replaced the Škoda Yeti. The automaker introduced in December 2018 a new small family car, the Škoda Scala. In February 2019, the company introduced in Geneva the new subcompact crossover Škoda Kamiq.

==Electrification strategy==

In 2015, new Škoda chairman Bernhard Maier said that the Volkswagen Group &quot;is working on a modular, new electric platform and we are in the team&quot;, and &quot;there is no alternative to electrification.&quot; New Škoda corporate &quot;Strategy 2025&quot;, which replaces the previous &quot;Strategy 2018&quot;, aims to start production of a fully electric vehicle in 2020, and five electric models across different segments by 2025.

At Auto Shanghai in 2017, Škoda displayed its Vision E concept for an all-electric 300-bhp coupé-SUV, with level 3 autonomy capability and range. It is based on the VW MEB platform and Škoda Auto will also manufacture electric-vehicle batteries for the Volkswagen Group in its facility in the Czech Republic. The second development stage, the Škoda Vision iV, was revealed in March 2019.

A plug-in hybrid car, the Škoda Superb iV, was available for sale from early 2020, and a small SUV model Škoda Kamiq with a natural gas-electric hybrid powertrain and a hybrid Fabia from later the same year. By March 2018, the electrification plan was expanded to 10 electrified models for 2025 - six fully electric cars and four plugin-hybrids. Out of these, five models are to be available by 2020. In 2018, the brand launched its largest-ever investment plan of €2 billion over five years into its electrification.

The brand&#x27;s first fully electric car, a city car Škoda Citigo-e iV, was sold from 2019 to 2020. The all-electric Škoda Enyaq iV is available for sale since September 2020. Škoda Enyaq Coupé is sold from May 2023.

==Sales and markets==
Škoda has maintained sound financial stability over recent years. In 2013, the brand achieved sales revenues totalling €10.3 billion (2012: €10.4 billion). Due to the weak economic situation in many European countries and the expansion of the model range, operating profit reached a modest €522 million (2012: €712 million). Škoda achieved a successful start to 2014. As well as recording the highest number of deliveries to customers in a first quarter ever (247,200; up 12.1%), it recorded a significant increase in sales revenue (23.7%) to almost €3 billion. Operating profit increased 65.2% to €185 million over the previous year.

A smaller number of Škoda models are additionally manufactured in Solomonovo, Ukraine through local partner. Until 2020 there was manufacturing in Öskemen, Kazazhstan. Cars were also built in two locations in Russia, however this ended following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This table lists the factories and their production models in 2019.
==Motorsport==

The Škoda brand has been engaged in motor sport since 1901, and has gained a number of titles with various vehicles around the world. The team had competed as a manufacturer in the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (before it merged with ERC in 2013) and World Rally Championship between 1999 and 2005. Now it competes in the European Rally Championship and WRC-2.

Until the final season of IRC in 2012, Škoda Motorsport was the most successful manufacturer with a total of 27 points, winning the rallying series in 2010–2012. Since 2013, When the two competing series were merged, it continued to compete in the European Rally Championship.

Škoda Motorsport drivers won with the Škoda Fabia S2000 the European Rally Championships in 2012–2014.

===World Rally Championship===

After a long history of class victories in lower levels of motorsport, Škoda became a participant in the FIA World Rally Championship in the 1999 season, with World Rally Car models of the Škoda Octavia. Škoda&#x27;s best result with the Octavia WRC was Armin Schwarz&#x27;s third place at the 2001 Safari Rally. From mid 2003, the Octavia was replaced by the smaller Škoda Fabia. Škoda used the 2004 season to develop the car further, but did not achieve much success the following season. However, at the season-ending Rally Australia, 1995 world champion Colin McRae was running second before retiring. Škoda then withdrew from the series, and the 2006 season saw Škoda represented by the semi-privateer Red Bull Škoda Team. Jan Kopecký drove the Fabia WRC to fifth place at the Rally Catalunya, and as late as the 2007 Rallye Deutschland the Fabia still achieved a fifth-place result, again in the hands of Kopecký. Former works Ford and Citroen driver François Duval also drove a Fabia WRC in 2006 for the privateer First Motorsport team, achieving a sixth-place finish in Catalunya.

===WRC2===

In 2009, Škoda entered the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) for the first time, using the Fabia S2000, winning three rallies and finishing second in both the drivers and manufacturers championship. In 2010, Škoda won a total of seven IRC events winning both the manufacturers and driver championship for Juho Hänninen. These achievements were repeated in the following two seasons, with Andreas Mikkelsen as the drivers&#x27; champion. In 2013, the Intercontinental Rally Challenge was merged with the European Rally Championship (ERC) and the team gained the drivers&#x27; championship title once again for Jan Kopecký. The car was also raced by privateers in several championships, including Red Bull, Barwa, Rene Georges and Rufa in the 2010 Super 2000 World Rally Championship.

Škoda Motorsport won the 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 WRC-2 championships with Škoda Fabia R5.

===Bonneville Speedway===
In August 2011, a special Škoda Octavia vRS set a world record at the Bonneville Speedway and became the fastest production car in the world with an engine up to two litres, when it hit . The current fastest production Škoda car is the Škoda Superb III, with a top speed of and an acceleration from in 5.8 seconds.

==Logo==
In 1923, two different trademarks were registered at the Office for Innovation and Model Registration in Plzeň. The first depicted a winged arrow pointing to the right with five feathers in a circle and the second was a winged arrow with three feathers. The famous winged arrow with three feathers still forms the Škoda logo today. The &quot;ŠKODA&quot; text was added to the logo in 1936. The arrow represents speed, the wings progress and freedom, the eye precision and the circle unity, completeness, world and harmony. The story goes that, on his travels through the US, Emil Škoda had once been so taken with a Native American&#x27;s feathered headdress that he had returned to Plzeň with a relief image which inspired the logo.

<doc id="26972" wikidata="Q73169" url="?curid=26972" title="Scandinavian Peninsula">
<text>The Scandinavian Peninsula is located in Northern Europe, and roughly comprises the mainlands of Sweden, Norway and the northwestern area of Finland.

The name of the peninsula is derived from the term Scandinavia, the cultural region of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. That cultural name is in turn derived from the name of Scania, the region at the southern extremity of the peninsula which was for centuries a part of Denmark, which was the ancestral home of the Danes, and is now part of Sweden.

The Scandinavian Peninsula is the largest of the peninsulas of Europe, with a greater area than the Balkan, Iberian and Italian peninsulas. During the Ice Ages, the sea level of the Atlantic Ocean dropped so much that the Baltic Sea, the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland disappeared, and the countries now surrounding them, including Germany, Poland, the other Baltic countries and Scandinavia, were directly joined by land.

==Geography==

The largest peninsula in Europe, the Scandinavian Peninsula is approximately long with a width varying approximately from . The Scandinavian mountain range generally defines the border between Norway and Sweden.

Its highest elevation was Glittertinden in Norway at above sea level, but since the glacier at its summit partially melted, the highest elevation is at at Galdhøpiggen, also in Norway. These mountains also have the largest glacier on the mainland of Europe, Jostedalsbreen.

About one quarter of the Scandinavian Peninsula lies north of the Arctic Circle, its northernmost point being at Cape Nordkyn, Norway.

The climate across Scandinavia varies from tundra (Köppen: ET) and subarctic (Dfc) in the north, with cool marine west coast climate (Cfc) in northwestern coastal areas reaching just north of Lofoten, to humid continental (Dfb) in the central portion and marine west coast (Cfb) in the south and southwest.
The region is rich in timber, iron and copper with the best farmland in southern Sweden. Large petroleum and natural-gas deposits have been found off Norway&#x27;s coast in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.

Much of the population of the Scandinavian Peninsula is naturally concentrated in its southern part, which is also its agricultural region. The largest cities of the peninsula are Stockholm, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Gothenburg, Sweden; Malmö, Sweden and Bergen, Norway, in that order.

==Geology==
The Scandinavian Peninsula occupies part of the Baltic Shield, a stable and large crust segment formed of very old, crystalline metamorphic rocks. Most of the soil covering this substrate was scraped by glaciers during the Ice Ages of antiquity, As a consequence of this scouring, the elevation of the land, and the cool-to-cold climate, a relatively small percentage of its land is arable.

The glaciation during the Ice Ages also deepened many of the river valleys, which were invaded by the sea when the ice melted, creating the noteworthy fjords of Norway. In the southern part of the peninsula, the glaciers deposited vast numbers of terminal moraines, configuring a very chaotic landscape. These terminal moraines covered all of what is now Denmark.

Although the Baltic Shield is mostly geologically stable and hence resistant to the influences of other neighbouring tectonic formations, the weight of nearly four kilometres of ice during the Ice Ages caused all of the Scandinavian terrain to sink. When the ice sheet disappeared, the shield rose again, a tendency that continues to this day at a rate of about one metre per century. Conversely, the southern part has tended to sink to compensate, causing flooding of the Low Countries and Denmark.

The crystalline substrate of the land and absence of soil in many places have exposed mineral deposits of metal ores, such as those of iron, copper, nickel, zinc, silver and gold. The very most valuable of these have been the deposits of iron ore in northwestern Sweden. In the 19th century these deposits prompted the building of a railway from northwestern Sweden to the Norwegian seaport of Narvik so that the iron ore could be exported by ship to places like southern Sweden, Germany, Great Britain and Belgium for smelting into iron and steel. This railway is in a region of Norway and Sweden that otherwise does not have any railways because of the very rugged terrain, mountains and fjords of that part of Scandinavia.

==People==
The first recorded human presence in the southern area of the peninsula and Denmark dates from 12,000 years ago. As the ice sheets from the glaciation retreated, the climate allowed a tundra biome that attracted reindeer hunters. The climate warmed up gradually, favouring the growth of evergreen trees first and then deciduous forest which brought animals like aurochs. Groups of hunter-fisher-gatherers started to inhabit the area from the Mesolithic (8200 BC), up to the advent of agriculture in the Neolithic (3200 BC).

The northern and central part of the peninsula is partially inhabited by the Sami, who began to arrive several thousand years after the Scandinavian Peninsula had already been inhabited in the south. In the earliest recorded periods they occupied the arctic and subarctic regions as well as the central part of the peninsula as far south as Dalarna, Sweden. They speak the Sami language, a non-Indo-European language of the Uralic family which is related to Finnish and Estonian. The first inhabitants of the peninsula were the Norwegians on the west coast of Norway, the Danes in what is now southern and western Sweden and southeastern Norway, the Svear in the region around Mälaren as well as a large portion of the present day eastern seacoast of Sweden and the Geats in Västergötland and Östergötland. These peoples spoke closely related dialects of an Indo-European language, Old Norse. Although political boundaries have shifted, descendants of these peoples still are the dominant populations in the peninsula in the early 21st century.

==Political development==
Although the Nordic countries look back on more than 1,000 years of history as distinct political entities, the international boundaries came late and emerged gradually. It was not until the middle of the 17th century that Sweden had a secure outlet on the Kattegat and control of the south Baltic coast. The Swedish and Norwegian boundaries were finally agreed and marked out in 1751. The Finnish-Norwegian border on the peninsula was established after extensive negotiation in 1809, and the common Norwegian-Russian districts were not partitioned until 1826. Even then the borders were still fluid, with Finland gaining access to the Barents Sea in 1920, but ceding this territory to the Soviet Union in 1944.

Denmark, Sweden and the Russian Empire dominated the political relationships on the Scandinavian Peninsula for centuries, with Iceland, Finland and Norway only gaining their full independence during the 20th century. The Kingdom of Norway long held in personal union by Denmark fell to Sweden after the Napoleonic Wars and only attained full independence in 1905. Having been an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire since 1809, Finland declared independence during the Soviet revolution of Russia in 1917. Iceland declared its independence from Denmark in 1944, while Denmark was under the occupation of Nazi Germany. Iceland was encouraged to do this by the British and American armed forces that were defending Iceland from Nazi invasion.

The Wehrmacht invaded Norway in 1940 and the German Army occupied all of Norway until May 1945. With the acquiescence of the Kingdom of Sweden, German troops moved from northern Norway, across northern Sweden, into Finland, which had become an ally of Nazi Germany. Then, in the spring of 1941, the German Army and the Finnish Army invaded the Soviet Union together. The Republic of Finland had a grievance against the Soviet Union because the Red Army had invaded southeastern Finland in the Winter War (1939–40) and had taken a large area of territory away from Finland.

Sweden remained a neutral country during the First World War, the Korean War and the Cold War.

In 1945, Norway, Denmark and Iceland were founding members of the United Nations. Sweden joined the U.N. soon after. Finland joined during the 1950s. The first Secretary General of the United Nations, Trygve Lie, was a Norwegian citizen. The second Secretary General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskjöld, was a Swedish citizen. Thus the people of the Scandinavian Peninsula had a strong influence in international affairs during the 20th century.

In 1949, Norway, Denmark and Iceland became founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation for their defence against East Germany, the Soviet Union and all other potential invaders. Finland later joined NATO in 2023, and Sweden in 2024, in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Sweden and Finland joined the European Union in 1995. Norway, however, remains outside the Union.

<text>San Francisco Bay is a large tidal estuary in the U.S. state of California, and gives its name to the San Francisco Bay Area. It is dominated by the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland.

San Francisco Bay drains water from approximately 40 percent of California. Water from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, and from the Sierra Nevada mountains, flow into Suisun Bay, which then travels through the Carquinez Strait to meet with the Napa River at the entrance to San Pablo Bay, which connects at its south end to San Francisco Bay. It then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Golden Gate strait. However, this entire group of interconnected bays is often called the &quot;San Francisco Bay&quot;. The bay was designated a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance on February 2, 2013, and the Port of Oakland on the bay is one of the busiest cargo ports on the west coast.

==Size==
The bay covers somewhere between , depending on which sub-bays (such as San Pablo Bay), estuaries, wetlands, and so on are included in the measurement. The main part of the bay measures wide east-to-west and somewhere between 1 and 2 north-to-south.

San Francisco Bay is the second-largest estuary on the Pacific coast of the Americas, following the Salish Sea in Washington State and British Columbia, Canada.

The bay was navigable as far south as San Jose until the 1850s, when hydraulic mining released massive amounts of sediment from the rivers that settled in those parts of the bay that had little or no current. Later, wetlands and inlets were deliberately filled in, reducing the bay&#x27;s size since the mid-19th century by as much as one third. Recently, large areas of wetlands have been restored, further confusing the issue of the bay&#x27;s size. Despite its value as a waterway and harbor, many thousands of acres of marshy wetlands at the edges of the bay were, for many years, considered wasted space. As a result, soil excavated for building projects or dredged from channels was often dumped onto the wetlands and other parts of the bay as landfill.

From the mid-19th century through the late 20th century, more than a third of the original bay was filled and often built on. The deep, damp soil in these areas is subject to soil liquefaction during earthquakes, and most of the major damage close to the bay in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 occurred to structures on these areas.

The Marina District of San Francisco, hard hit by the 1989 earthquake, was built on fill that had been placed there for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition, although liquefaction did not occur on a large scale. In the 1990s, San Francisco International Airport proposed filling in hundreds more acres to extend its overcrowded international runways in exchange for purchasing other parts of the bay and converting them back to wetlands. The idea was, and remains, controversial. (&quot;For further details, see the &quot;Bay fill and depth profile&quot; section.&quot;)

There are five large islands in San Francisco Bay. Alameda, the largest island, was created when a shipping lane was cut to form the Port of Oakland in 1901. It is now a suburban community. Angel Island was known as &quot;Ellis Island West&quot; because it served as the entry point for immigrants from East Asia. It is now a state park accessible by ferry. Mountainous Yerba Buena Island is pierced by a tunnel linking the east and west spans of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. Attached to the north is the artificial and flat Treasure Island, site of the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. From the Second World War until the 1990s, both islands served as military bases and are now being redeveloped. Isolated in the center of the bay is Alcatraz, the site of the famous federal penitentiary. The federal prison on Alcatraz Island no longer functions, but the complex is a popular tourist site. Despite its name, Mare Island in the northern part of the bay is a peninsula rather than an island.

==Geology==

San Francisco Bay is thought to represent a down-warping of the Earth&#x27;s crust between the San Andreas Fault to the west and the Hayward Fault to the east, though the precise nature of this remains under study. About 560,000 years ago, a tectonic shift caused the large inland Lake Corcoran to spill out the central valley and through the Carquinez Strait, carving out sediment and forming canyons in what is now the northern part of the San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate strait.

San Francisco Bay has been filled and emptied of sea water many times during the Pleistocene in accordance with sea level changes caused by glacial advances and retreats. During the Wisconsin Glaciation, between 15,000 and about 10,000 years ago, the basin which is now filled by the San Francisco Bay was a large river valley with small hills, channeling the Sacramento River through the Golden Gate Strait into the ocean. When the great ice sheets began to melt, around 11,000 years ago, the sea level started to rise rapidly, by about 1 inch per year. Melting glaciers in the Sierra Nevada washed huge amounts of sediment down the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, which accumulated on the shores of the bay, forming huge mudflats and marshes that supported local wildlife. By 5000 BC the sea level rose , filling the valley with water from the Pacific. The Farallon Islands are what used to be hills along the old coastline, and Potato Patch Shoal is an area of sand dunes now covered by the ocean.

==History==


The indigenous inhabitants of the San Francisco Bay are Ohlone. The first European to see San Francisco Bay is likely N. de Morena who was left at New Albion at Drakes Bay in Marin County, California, by Sir Francis Drake in 1579 and then walked to Mexico.

The first recorded European discovery of San Francisco Bay was on November 4, 1769, when Spanish explorer Gaspar de Portolá, unable to find the Port of Monterey, continued north close to what is now Pacifica and reached the summit of the Sweeney Ridge, now marked as the place where he first sighted San Francisco Bay. Portolá and his party did not realize what they had discovered, thinking they had arrived at a large arm of what is now called Drakes Bay. At the time, Drakes Bay went by the name &quot;Bahia de San Francisco&quot; and thus both bodies of water became associated with the name. Eventually, the larger, more important body of water fully appropriated the name &quot;San Francisco Bay&quot;.

The first European to enter the bay is believed to have been the Spanish explorer Juan de Ayala, who passed through the Golden Gate on August 5, 1775, in his ship the &quot;San Carlos&quot; and moored in a bay of Angel Island now known as Ayala Cove. Ayala continued to explore the San Francisco Bay Area and the expedition&#x27;s cartographer, José de Cañizares, gathered the information necessary to produce the first map of the area. A number of place names survive (anglicized) from that first map, including Point Reyes, Angel Island, Farallon Islands, and Alcatraz Island.

Alaskan Native sea otter hunters using Aleutian kayaks and working for the Russian–American Company entered San Francisco Bay in 1807 and again over 1810–1811. Led by the Russian Timofei Nikitich Tarakanov, these hunting raids probably wiped out sea otters in the bay. Thousands of sea otter skins were taken to Sitka, then Guangzhou (Canton), China, where they commanded a high price.

The United States seized the region from Mexico during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). On February 2, 1848, the Mexican province of Alta California was annexed to the United States with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. A year and a half later, California requested to join the United States on December 3, 1849, and was accepted as the 31st State of the Union on September 9, 1850.
In 1921, a tablet was dedicated by a group of men in downtown San Francisco, marking the site of the original shoreline. The tablet reads: &quot;This tablet marks the shore line of San Francisco Bay at the time of the discovery of gold in California, January 24, 1848. Map reproduced above delineates old shore line. Placed by the Historic Landmarks committee, Native Sons of the Golden West, 1921.&quot;

The bay became the center of American settlement and commerce in the Far West through most of the remainder of the 19th century. During the California Gold Rush (1848–1855), San Francisco Bay suddenly became one of the world&#x27;s great seaports, dominating shipping in the American West until the last years of the 19th century. The bay&#x27;s regional importance increased further when the first transcontinental railroad was connected to its western terminus at Alameda on September 6, 1869. The terminus was switched to the Oakland Long Wharf two months later on November 8, 1869.
In 1910, the Southern Pacific railroad company built the Dumbarton Rail Bridge, the first bridge crossing San Francisco Bay. The first automobile crossing was the Dumbarton Bridge, completed in January 1927. More crossings were later constructed – the Carquinez Bridge in May 1927, the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge in 1936, the Golden Gate Bridge in 1937, the Richmond–San Rafael Bridge in 1956, and the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge in 1967.


During the 20th century, the bay was subject to the 1940s Reber Plan, which would have filled in parts of the bay in order to increase industrial activity along the waterfront. In 1959, the United States Army Corps of Engineers released a report stating that if current infill trends continued, the bay would be as big as a shipping channel by 2020. This news led to the creation of the Save the Bay movement in 1960,&lt;ref name=&quot;digicoll.lib.berkeley.edu/218492&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which mobilized to stop the infill of wetlands as well as the bay itself, which had shrunk to two-thirds of its size in the century before 1961. 

On September 17, 1965, the California State Legislature enacted the McAteer-Petris Act, which created the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission. Since then, the Commission has strictly regulated bay fill. Foster City, Redwood Shores, Paradise Cay, and Emeryville&#x27;s western expansion were among the last developments along the bay shoreline before McAteer-Petris limited additional filling of the bay. 

The San Francisco Bay continues to support some of the densest industrial production and urban settlement in the United States. The San Francisco Bay Area is the American West&#x27;s second-largest urban area, with approximately seven million residents.

==Ecology==

Despite its urban and industrial character, San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta remain perhaps California&#x27;s most important ecological habitats. California&#x27;s Dungeness crab, California halibut, and Pacific salmon fisheries rely on the bay as a nursery. The few remaining salt marshes now represent most of California&#x27;s remaining salt marsh, supporting a number of endangered species and providing key ecosystem services such as filtering pollutants and sediments from the rivers. San Francisco Bay is recognized for protection by the California Bays and Estuaries Policy, with oversight provided by the San Francisco Estuary Partnership.

Most famously, the bay is a key link in the Pacific Flyway. Millions of waterfowl annually use the bay shallows as a refuge. Two endangered species of birds are found here: the California least tern and the Ridgway&#x27;s Rail. Exposed bay muds provide important feeding areas for shorebirds, but underlying layers of bay mud pose geological hazards for structures near many parts of the bay perimeter. San Francisco Bay provided the nation&#x27;s first wildlife refuge, Oakland&#x27;s artificial Lake Merritt, constructed in the 1860s, and America&#x27;s first urban National Wildlife Refuge, the Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge (SFBNWR) in 1972. The bay is also plagued by non-native species.

Salt produced from San Francisco Bay is produced in salt evaporation ponds and is shipped throughout the Western United States to bakeries, canneries, fisheries, cheese makers and other food industries and used to de-ice winter highways, clean kidney dialysis machines, for animal nutrition, and in many industries. Many companies have produced salt in the bay, with the Leslie Salt Company the largest private land owner in the Bay Area in the 1940s.

Low-salinity salt ponds mirror the ecosystem of the bay, with fish and fish-eating birds in abundance. Mid-salinity ponds support dense populations of brine shrimp, which provide a rich food source for millions of shorebirds. Only salt-tolerant micro-algae survive in the high salinity ponds, and impart a deep red color to these ponds from the pigment within the algae protoplasm. The salt marsh harvest mouse is an endangered species endemic to the wetlands of the San Francisco Bay with a high salt tolerance. It needs native pickleweed, which is often displaced by invasive cordgrass, for its habitat.

The seasonal range of water temperature in the bay is from January&#x27;s to September&#x27;s when measured at Fort Point, which is near the southern end of the Golden Gate Bridge and at the entrance to San Francisco Bay.

For the first time in 65 years, Pacific Harbor Porpoise (&quot;Phocoena phocoena&quot;) returned to the bay in 2009. Golden Gate Cetacean Research, a non-profit organization focused on research on cetaceans, has developed a photo-identification database enabling the scientists to identify specific porpoise individuals and is trying to ascertain whether a healthier bay has brought their return. Pacific harbor porpoise range from Point Conception, California, to Alaska and across to the Kamchatka Peninsula and Japan. Recent genetic studies show that there is a local stock from San Francisco to the Russian River and that eastern Pacific coastal populations rarely migrate far, unlike western Atlantic Harbor porpoise.

The common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;) has been extending its current range northwards from the Southern California Bight. The first coastal bottlenose dolphin in the Bay Area in recent times was spotted in 1983 off the San Mateo County coast in 1983. In 2001, bottlenose dolphins were first spotted east of the Golden Gate Bridge and confirmed by photographic evidence in 2007. Zooarcheological remains of bottlenose dolphins indicated that bottlenose dolphins inhabited San Francisco Bay in prehistoric times until at least 700 years before present, and dolphin skulls dredged from the bay suggest occasional visitors in historic times.

==Pollution==

San Francisco Bay faces many of the same water quality issues as other urban waterways in industrialized countries, or downstream of intensive agriculture. According to state water quality regulators, San Francisco Bay waters do not meet water quality standards for the following pollutants:

* DDT
* Mercury 
* Selenium
* PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls)
* Dioxin compounds
* Furan Compounds 
* Trash
* Diazinon
* Chlordane
* Dieldrin

===Mercury===
Industrial, mining, and other uses of mercury have resulted in a widespread distribution in the bay, with uptake in the bay&#x27;s phytoplankton and contamination of its sportfish.

===Oil spills===
In January 1971, two Standard Oil tankers collided in the bay, creating an oil spill disaster, which spurred environmental protection of the bay. In November 2007, a ship named &quot;COSCO Busan&quot; collided with the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge and spilled over of bunker fuel, creating the largest oil spill in the region since 1996.

The bay also has some of the highest levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen known from any coastal water body, mostly originating from treated wastewater from Publicly owned treatment works. In other bays, such nutrient levels would likely lead to eutrophication, but historically, the bay has had less harmful algal blooms than other water bodies with similar nutrient concentrations. Potential explanations have included the presence of intensive &quot;top-down control&quot; from grazing clams like &quot;Potamocorbula&quot;, high sediment supply limiting light availability for the algae, and intensive tidal mixing. The occurrence of an unprecedented harmful algal bloom of &quot;Heterosigma akashiwo&quot; in 2022, resulting in mass fish deaths and anoxia, suggests that the mechanisms of control on algal growth may be eroding.

===PBDEs===
The bay was once considered a hotspot for polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants used to make upholstered furniture and infant care items less flammable. PBDEs have been largely phased out and replaced with alternative phosphate flame retardants. A 2019 San Francisco Estuary Institute (SFEI) study assayed a wide range of these newer flame retardant chemicals in Bay waters, bivalve California mussels (&quot;Mytilus californianus&quot;), and harbor seals (&quot;Phoca vitulina&quot;) which haul out in Corkscrew Slough on Bair Island in San Mateo County, with phosphate flame retardant contaminants such as tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) found at levels comparable to thresholds for aquatic toxicity.

===Emerging contaminants===

Thousands of man-made chemicals are found in Bay water, sediment, and organisms. For many of these, there is little or no data on their impacts on the environment or human health, and they are not regulated by state or federal law. These are often referred to as &quot;contaminants of emerging concern.&quot; The San Francisco Estuary Institute has studied these chemicals in the Bay since 2001. Scientists have identified the following most likely to have a negative impact on Bay wildlife:

* PFOS
* fipronil
* nonylphenols
* nonylphenol ethoxylates

==Bay fill and depth profile==
San Francisco Bay&#x27;s profile changed dramatically in the late 19th century and again with the initiation of dredging by the US Army Corps of Engineers in the 20th century. Before about 1860, most bay shores (with the exception of rocky shores, such as those in Carquinez Strait; along Marin shoreline; Point Richmond; Golden Gate area) contained extensive wetlands that graded nearly invisibly from freshwater wetlands to salt marsh and then tidal mudflat. A deep channel ran through the center of the bay, following the ancient drowned river valley.

In the 1860s and continuing into the early 20th century, miners dumped staggering quantities of mud and gravel from hydraulic mining operations into the upper Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. GK Gilbert&#x27;s estimates of debris total more than eight times the amount of rock and dirt moved during construction of the Panama Canal. This material flowed down the rivers, progressively eroding into finer and finer sediment, until it reached the bay system. Here some of it settled, eventually filling in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and San Francisco Bay, in decreasing order of severity.

By the end of the 19th century, these &quot;slickens&quot; had filled in much of the shallow bay flats, raising the entire bay profile. New marshes were created in some areas.

In the decades surrounding 1900, at the behest of local political officials and following Congressional orders, the U.S. Army Corps began dredging the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and the deep channels of San Francisco Bay. This work has continued without interruption ever since. Some of the dredge spoils were initially dumped in the bay shallows (including helping to create Treasure Island on the former shoals to the north of Yerba Buena Island) and used to raise islands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The net effect of dredging has been to maintain a narrow deep channel—deeper perhaps than the original bay channel—through a much shallower bay. At the same time, most of the marsh areas have been filled or blocked off from the bay by dikes.

Large ships transiting the bay must follow deep underwater channels that are maintained by frequent dredging as the average depth of the bay is only as deep as a swimming pool—approximately . Between Hayward and San Mateo to San Jose it is . The deepest part of the bay is under and out of the Golden Gate Bridge, at .

In the late 1990s, a 12-year harbor-deepening project for the Port of Oakland began; it was largely completed by September 2009. Previously, the bay waters and harbor facilities only allowed for ships with a draft of , but dredging activities undertaken by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with the Port of Oakland succeeded in providing access for vessels with a draft. Four dredging companies were employed in the US$432 million project, with $244 million paid for with federal funds and $188 million supplied by the Port of Oakland. Some of mud from the dredging was deposited at the western edge of Middle Harbor Shoreline Park to become a shallow-water wetlands habitat for marine and shore life. Further dredging followed in 2011, to maintain the navigation channel. This dredging enabled the arrival of the largest container ship ever to enter the San Francisco Bay, the &quot;MSC Fabiola&quot;. Bay pilots trained for the visit on a simulator at the California Maritime Academy for over a year. The ship arrived drawing less than its full draft of because it held only three-quarters of a load after its stop in Long Beach.

==Transportation==

San Francisco Bay was traversed by watercraft before the arrival of Europeans. Indigenous peoples used canoes to fish and clam along the shoreline. Sailing ships enabled transportation between the bay and other parts of the world—and served as ferries and freighters within the bay and between the bay and inland ports, such as Sacramento and Stockton. These were gradually replaced by steam-powered vessels starting in the late 19th century. Several shipyards were established around the bay, augmented during wartime (e.g., the Kaiser Shipyards, Richmond Shipyards) near Richmond in 1940 for World War II for construction of mass-produced, assembly line Liberty and Victory cargo ships.

San Francisco Bay is spanned by nine bridges, eight of which carry cars.
* The Richmond–San Rafael Bridge on Interstate 580 (I-580) connects Marin and Contra Costa counties.
* The Golden Gate Bridge on U.S. Route 101/State Route 1 (US 101/SR 1) was the largest single span suspension bridge ever built at the time of its 1937 construction. It spans the Golden Gate, the strait between San Francisco and Marin County, and is the only bridge in the area not owned by the State of California.
* The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge on I-80 connects Alameda and San Francisco counties.
* The San Mateo–Hayward Bridge on SR 92 connects Alameda and San Mateo counties.
* The Dumbarton Bridge on SR 84 connects Alameda and San Mateo counties.
* The Carquinez Bridge (including the Alfred Zampa Memorial Bridge) on I-80 connects Contra Costa and Solano counties.
* The Benicia Bridge on I-680 also connects Contra Costa and Solano counties.
* The Antioch Bridge on SR 160 connects Contra Costa and Sacramento counties.
* The Dumbarton Rail Bridge is an abandoned bridge that used to carry rail traffic.
The Transbay Tube, an underwater rail tunnel, carries BART services between Oakland and San Francisco.

Prior to the bridges and, later, the Transbay Tube, transbay transportation was dominated by fleets of ferryboats operated by the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Key System transit company. However, in recent decades, ferries have returned, primarily serving commuters from Marin County, relieving the traffic bottleneck of the Golden Gate Bridge (see Ferries of San Francisco Bay).

The bay also continues to serve as a major seaport. The Port of Oakland is one of the largest cargo ports in the United States, while the Port of Richmond and the Port of San Francisco provide smaller services.

An additional crossing south of the Bay Bridge has long been proposed.

==Recreation==
San Francisco Bay is popular for sailors (boats, as well as windsurfing and kitesurfing), due to consistent strong westerly/northwesterly thermally-generated winds – Beaufort force 6 () is common on summer afternoons – and protection from large open ocean swells. Yachting and yacht racing are popular pastimes and the San Francisco Bay Area is home to many of the world&#x27;s top sailors. A shoreline bicycle and pedestrian trail known as the San Francisco Bay Trail encircles the edge of the bay. The San Francisco Bay Area Water Trail, a growing network of launching and landing sites around the bay for non-motorized small boat users (such as kayakers) is being developed. Parks and protected areas around the bay include Eden Landing Ecological Reserve, Hayward Regional Shoreline, Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, Hayward Shoreline Interpretive Center, Crown Memorial State Beach, Eastshore State Park, Point Isabel Regional Shoreline, Brooks Island Regional Preserve, and César Chávez Park.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the San Francisco Bay based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in local species.

The San Francisco Bay Area Water Trail is a planned system of designated trailheads designed to improve non-motorized small boat access to the bay. The California Coastal Conservancy approved funding in March 2011 to begin implementation of the water trail.

<text>The San Francisco Peninsula is a peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area that separates San Francisco Bay from the Pacific Ocean. On its northern tip is the City and County of San Francisco. Its southern base is Los Altos and Mountain View, in Santa Clara County, south of Palo Alto and north of Sunnyvale. Most of the Peninsula is occupied by San Mateo County, between San Francisco and Santa Clara counties, and including the cities and towns of Atherton, Belmont, Brisbane, Burlingame, Colma, Daly City, East Palo Alto, El Granada, Foster City, Half Moon Bay, Hillsborough, La Honda, Loma Mar, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Menlo Park, Millbrae, Mountain View, Pacifica, Palo Alto, Pescadero, Portola Valley, Redwood City, Redwood Shores, San Bruno, San Carlos, San Mateo, South San Francisco, West Menlo Park and Woodside.

Whereas the term &quot;peninsula&quot; in a geographical sense technically refers to the entire San Francisco Peninsula, in local jargon, &quot;The Peninsula&quot; does not include the city of San Francisco.

==History==
In 1795, Governor Diego de Borica gave José Darío Argüello a Spanish land grant known as Rancho de las Pulgas. This rancho was the largest grant on the peninsula consisting of .

As a local geographic term, the area referred to as &quot;the Peninsula&quot; is distinct from that denoted by &quot;the City&quot;, and refers to the portion south of San Francisco. The appellation may date to the period prior to 1856, when the City of San Francisco and the County of San Francisco were separate entities, the latter then coextensive with contemporary San Mateo County and San Francisco City-County. The City-County owns several disjunct properties along the whole of the Peninsula (mostly water pumping stations connected to the Hetch Hetchy Valley on which San Francisco has a permanent leasehold) – thus, most of the larger communities in San Mateo County are &quot;de facto&quot; suburbs of San Francisco, with the neighboring communities of Pacifica, Daly City, Broadmoor, Colma, South San Francisco, Half Moon Bay, San Bruno, and Brisbane being immediate suburbs. The remaining suburban area of the Peninsula is on the east side of the Santa Cruz Mountains, along San Francisco Bay; the west and south-central portions of the Peninsula are mostly rural, unincorporated, and unorganized areas.

A substantial portion of Silicon Valley is located on the peninsula. In Silicon Valley are the headquarters of some of the largest tech companies in the world, such as Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Apple. Since 2010, droughts and wildfires have increased in frequency and become less seasonal and more year-round, further straining the region&#x27;s water security.

==Geography and transportation==

Along the center line of the Peninsula is the northern half of the Santa Cruz Mountains, formed by the action of plate tectonics along the San Andreas Fault. In the middle of the Peninsula along the fault is the Crystal Springs Reservoir. Just north of the Crystal Springs reservoir is San Andreas Lake, after which the geologic fault was originally named.

The east side of the peninsula is a densely populated and largely urban and suburban area that includes portions of Silicon Valley. It forms a commuter area between San Francisco to the north and San Jose to the south.

===Roads===
* Interstate 80
* Interstate 280
* Interstate 380
* U.S. Route 101
* State Route 1
* State Route 9
* State Route 35
* State Route 82
* State Route 84
* State Route 85
* State Route 92
* State Route 109
* State Route 114
* State Route 237
The bridges in the Peninsula include the Dumbarton Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge, the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge, and the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge.

A number of major thoroughfares run north-south: El Camino Real (SR 82) and US 101 on the east side along the bay, Interstate 280 down the center, Skyline Boulevard (SR 35) along the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains, and SR 1 on the west along the Pacific, and SR 85 which forms the southern end of the Peninsula.

=== Transit ===
Caltrain is the primary passenger rail transit in the peninsula, serving much of the eastern urbanized areas of the peninsula between Mountain View (which also connects to VTA light rail) and San Francisco&#x27;s 4th and King Street station. In addition, the peninsula has access to Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) northward of Millbrae, connecting San Mateo County and San Francisco to the East Bay through a route over and under Daly City, Glen Park, San Francisco&#x27;s Mission district, and through part of Market Street subway.

Bus service is predominantly provided by SamTrans and the SFMTA&#x27;s Muni buses, which primarily run in San Mateo and San Francisco counties respectively. In addition, southward of Palo Alto, the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority operates buses to other parts of Santa Clara County. Most of the peninsula&#x27;s bus transit to the East Bay and North Bay flowing through San Francisco, as neither AC Transit nor Golden Gate Transit, the primary transit operators for the East and North Bay respectively, serve the peninsula south of San Francisco.

=== Airports ===
The peninsula&#x27;s largest commercial airport is San Francisco International Airport, itself connected to US 101 and BART and accessible to Caltrain (via a BART connection at Milbrae station). 

San Jose International Airport, is the next largest airport in the region serving and might be a more viable option for the southern peninsula. The airport is connected to US 101 and there is a single connector bus, VTA Line 60, that links to Caltrain (at Santa Clara Transit Center) and to eastern lines of BART (Milpitas). 

Oakland International Airport, located in the East Bay, is the smallest of the three and is also accessible directly via BART.

==Environmental features==
The San Francisco Peninsula contains a variety of habitats including estuarine, marine, oak woodland, redwood forest, coastal scrub and oak savanna. There are numerous species of wildlife present, especially along the San Francisco Bay estuarine shoreline, San Bruno Mountain, Fitzgerald Marine Reserve and the forests on the Montara Mountain block.

The area is home to several endangered species including the San Francisco garter snake, the Mission blue butterfly and the San Bruno elfin butterfly, all of which are endemic to San Mateo County. The endangered California clapper rail is also found on the shores of San Francisco Bay, in the cities of Belmont and San Mateo.

Although tule elk, an elk subspecies found only in California, were historically native to the San Francisco Peninsula, they were hunted to extinction by 1850. Expansion of Diablo Range elk to western Santa Clara County, and San Mateo and Santa Cruz Counties has been blocked by U.S. Highway 101 in Coyote Valley south of San Jose, California.

A number of noteworthy parks and nature preserves are found on the San Francisco Peninsula, including:

* Edgewood Park, San Mateo County
* Golden Gate National Recreation Area—several units are located on the Peninsula
* Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District—several preserves
* Shoreline Park, Mountain View, Santa Clara County

==Notable structures==
There are a number of well-known structures and complexes on the San Francisco Peninsula:

* Bay Meadows Racecourse, San Mateo (demolished in 2008)
* Carolands Mansion, Hillsborough
* Cow Palace, Daly City
* Crocker Mansion, Hillsborough
* Crystal Springs Reservoir, west of Interstate 280
* CuriOdyssey museum, San Mateo

* Meta Platforms, world headquarters, Menlo Park
* Filoli mansion and gardens, Woodside
* Frenchman&#x27;s Tower, Palo Alto
* Google Inc., World Headquarters, Mountain View
* &quot;The Flintstone House&quot;, east side of Interstate 280
* Notre Dame de Namur University, Belmont, with Ralston Hall
* Oracle World Headquarters, Redwood Shores (aka the &quot;Emerald City&quot;)
* Pulgas Water Temple, Woodside

<doc id="26976" wikidata="Q163820" url="?curid=26976" title="Silicon Valley">
<text>Silicon Valley is a region in Northern California that is a global center for high technology and innovation. Located in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, it corresponds roughly to the geographical area of the Santa Clara Valley. The term &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; refers to the area in which high-tech business has proliferated in Northern California, and it also serves as a general metonym for California&#x27;s high-tech business sector.

The cities of Sunnyvale, Mountain View, Palo Alto and Menlo Park are frequently cited as the birthplace of Silicon Valley. San Jose is Silicon Valley&#x27;s largest city, the third-largest in California, and the 13th-most populous in the United States. Other major Silicon Valley cities include Santa Clara, Redwood City and Cupertino. The San Jose Metropolitan Area has the third-highest GDP per capita in the world (after Zürich, Switzerland, and Oslo, Norway), according to the Brookings Institution. As of June 2021, it also had the highest percentage of homes valued at $1 million or more in the United States.

Silicon Valley is home to many of the world&#x27;s largest high-tech corporations, including the headquarters of more than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000, and thousands of startup companies. Silicon Valley also accounts for one-third of all of the venture capital investment in the United States, which has helped it to become a leading hub and startup ecosystem for high-tech innovation, although the tech ecosystem has recently become more geographically dispersed. It was in Silicon Valley that the silicon-based integrated circuit, the microprocessor, and the microcomputer, among other technologies, were developed. , the region employed about a half million information technology workers.

As more high-tech companies were established across San Jose and the Santa Clara Valley, and then north towards the Bay Area&#x27;s two other major cities, San Francisco and Oakland, the term &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; came to have two definitions: a narrower geographic one, referring to Santa Clara County and southeastern San Mateo County, and a metonymical definition referring to high-tech businesses in the entire Bay Area. The term Silicon Valley is often used as a synecdoche for the American high-technology economic sector. The name also became a global synonym for leading high-tech research and enterprises, and thus inspired similarly named locations, as well as research parks and technology centers with comparable structures all around the world. Many headquarters of tech companies in Silicon Valley have become hotspots for tourism.
==Etymology==
&quot;Silicon&quot; refers to the chemical element used in silicon-based transistors and integrated circuit chips, which is the focus of a large number of computer hardware and software innovators and manufacturers in the region.

The popularization of the name is often credited to Don Hoefler, the first journalist to use the term in a news story. His article &quot;Silicon Valley U.S.A.&quot; was published in the January 11, 1971, issue of the weekly trade newspaper &quot;Electronic News&quot;. In preparation for this report, during a lunch meeting with marketing people who were visiting the area, he heard them use the term. Earlier uses outside journalism exist; for example, a May 1970 advertisement in the &quot;Peninsula Times Tribune&quot; described a Palo Alto company that &quot;helps production people in Silicon Valley.&quot;However, the term did not gain widespread use until the early 1980s, at the time of the introduction of the IBM PC and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market.

The urbanized area is built upon an alluvial plain within a longitudinal valley formed by roughly parallel earthquake faults. The area between the faults subsided into a graben or dropped valley. Hoefler defined Silicon Valley as the urbanized parts of &quot;the San Francisco Peninsula and Santa Clara Valley&quot;. Before the expansive growth of the tech industry, the region had been the largest fruit-producing and packing region in the world up through the 1960s, with 39 fruit canneries. The nickname it had been known as during that period was &quot;the Valley of Heart’s Delight&quot;.

==History==
Silicon Valley was born through the intersection of several contributing factors, including a skilled science research base housed in area universities, plentiful venture capital, permissive government regulation, and steady U.S. Department of Defense spending. Stanford University’s leadership was especially important in the valley&#x27;s early development. Together these elements formed the basis of its growth and success. The United States was more friendly than other countries to business investment, charging much lower taxes on capital gains since the Revenue Act of 1921, and featuring particularly loose free market controls over new business. In 1953, the Small Business Administration was created to foster startups, giving a boost to entrepreneurs. Northern California was even more welcoming, with a group of venture capitalists actively seeking high-tech business ideas, clustered on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park and Palo Alto. California&#x27;s civil code undermined the usual non-compete clauses that effectively tied employees to their companies in other states, allowing California workers to freely apply the knowledge they gained from their previous employer. This gave Silicon Valley an advantage over other American tech hubs such as Massachusetts Route 128 curving around Boston.

===Early military origins===

The San Francisco Bay Area had long been a major site of United States Navy research and technology. In 1909, Charles Herrold started the first radio station in the United States with regularly scheduled programming in San Jose. Later that year, Stanford University graduate Cyril Elwell purchased the U.S. patents for Poulsen arc radio transmission technology and founded the Federal Telegraph Corporation (FTC) in Palo Alto. Over the next decade, the FTC created the world&#x27;s first global radio communication system, and signed a contract with the Navy in 1912.

In 1933, Air Base Sunnyvale, California, was commissioned by the United States Government for use as a Naval Air Station (NAS) to house the airship &quot;USS Macon&quot; in Hangar One. The station was renamed NAS Moffett Field, and between 1933 and 1947, U.S. Navy blimps were based there. A number of technology firms had set up shop in the area around Moffett Field to serve the Navy. When the Navy gave up its airship ambitions and moved most of its west coast operations to San Diego, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, forerunner of NASA) took over portions of Moffett Field for aeronautics research. Many of the original companies stayed, while new ones moved in. The immediate area was soon filled with aerospace firms, such as Lockheed, which was the area&#x27;s largest employer from the 1950s into 1980s.

Stanford University, its affiliates, and graduates have played a major role in the development of the culture of collaboration among high-tech companies. A powerful sense of regional solidarity shaped the outlook of inventors and engineers in California; contrasting markedly from the insular and competitive environment of engineering firms on the East Coast of the United States. From the 1890s, Stanford University&#x27;s leaders saw its mission as service to the (American) West and shaped the school accordingly. At the same time, the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient local industry. Thus regionalism helped align Stanford&#x27;s interests with those of the area&#x27;s high-tech firms.

Frederick Terman, as Stanford University&#x27;s dean of the school of engineering from 1946, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companies. In 1951 Terman spearheaded the formation of Stanford Industrial Park (now Stanford Research Park, an area surrounding Page Mill Road, south west of El Camino Real and extending beyond Foothill Expressway to Arastradero Road), where the university leased portions of its land to high-tech firms. Terman nurtured companies like Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates, Eastman Kodak, General Electric, Lockheed Corporation, and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford University campus.

In 1951, to address the financial demands of Stanford&#x27;s growth requirements, and to provide local employment-opportunities for graduating students, Frederick Terman proposed leasing Stanford&#x27;s lands for use as an office park named the Stanford Industrial Park (later Stanford Research Park). Terman invited only high-technology companies. The first tenant was Varian Associates, founded by Stanford alumni in the 1930s to build military-radar components. Terman also found venture capital for civilian-technology start-ups. Hewlett-Packard became one of the major success-stories. Founded in 1939 in Packard&#x27;s garage by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and David Packard, Hewlett-Packard moved its offices into the Stanford Research Park shortly after 1953. In 1954 Stanford originated the Honors Cooperative Program to allow full-time employees of the companies to pursue graduate degrees from the university on a part-time basis. The initial companies signed five-year agreements in which they would pay double the tuition for each student in order to cover the costs. Hewlett-Packard has become the largest personal-computer manufacturer in the world, and transformed the home-printing market when it released the first thermal drop-on-demand ink-jet printer in 1984. Other early tenants included Eastman Kodak, General Electric, and Lockheed.

===Rise of Silicon===

In 1956, William Shockley, the co-inventor of the first working transistor (with John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain), moved from New Jersey to Mountain View, California, to start Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory to live closer to his ailing mother in Palo Alto. Shockley&#x27;s work served as the basis for many electronic developments for decades. Both Frederick Terman and William Shockley are often called &quot;the father of Silicon Valley&quot;. Unlike many other researchers who used germanium as the semiconductor material, Shockley believed that silicon was the better material for making transistors. Shockley intended to replace the current transistor with a new three-element design (today known as the Shockley diode), but the design was considerably more difficult to build than the &quot;simple&quot; transistor. In 1957, Shockley decided to end research on the silicon transistor. As a result of Shockley&#x27;s abusive management style, eight engineers left the company to form Fairchild Semiconductor; Shockley referred to them as the &quot;traitorous eight&quot;. Two of the original employees of Fairchild Semiconductor, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, would go on to found Intel.
Following the 1959 inventions of the monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip by Robert Noyce at Fairchild, the first commercial MOS IC was introduced by General Microelectronics in 1964. The first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed and realized by Federico Faggin along with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel in 1971. In April 1974, Intel released the Intel 8080, the second 8-bit microprocessor designed and manufactured by Intel.

===Origins of the Internet===
On April 23, 1963, J. C. R. Licklider, the first director of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) at The Pentagon&#x27;s ARPA issued an office memorandum addressed to Members and Affiliates of the Intergalactic Computer Network. It rescheduled a meeting in Palo Alto regarding his vision of a computer network, which he imagined as an electronic commons open to all, the main and essential medium of informational interaction for governments, institutions, corporations, and individuals. As head of IPTO from 1962 to 1964, &quot;Licklider initiated three of the most important developments in information technology: the creation of computer science departments at several major universities, time-sharing, and networking.&quot; In 1969, the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), operated one of the four original nodes that comprised ARPANET, predecessor to the Internet.

===Emergence of venture capital===

By the early 1970s, there were many semiconductor companies in the area, computer firms using their devices, and programming and service companies serving both. Industrial space was plentiful and housing was still inexpensive. Growth during this era was fueled by the emergence of venture capital on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital in 1972; the availability of venture capital exploded after the successful $1.3 billion IPO of Apple Computer in December 1980. Since the 1980s, Silicon Valley has been home to the largest concentration of venture capital firms in the world.

In 1971, Don Hoefler traced the origins of Silicon Valley firms, including via investments from Fairchild&#x27;s eight co-founders. The key investors in Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital were from the same group, directly leading to &quot;Tech Crunch&quot; 2014 estimate of 92 public firms of 130 related listed firms then worth over US$2.1 trillion with over 2,000 firms traced back to them.

===Banking===

Another important pillar of the Valley&#x27;s success was Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), founded in 1983 by a group of former Bank of America executives. Before its 2023 collapse, SVB specialized in providing banking services to Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and their startup firms. SVB&#x27;s original primary commercial lending product was a working capital line of credit, secured by a startup&#x27;s accounts receivable. In contrast to traditional banks, who focused their commercial lending on already-established businesses, SVB specialized in lending money to small startup companies in the &quot;preprofit&quot; stage.

===Lawyers and law firms===
Prior to 1970, most Northern California lawyers were based in San Francisco, especially the experienced patent attorneys whom the high-tech industry needed to protect its intellectual property. During the 1970s, lawyers began to follow venture capitalists down the Peninsula to serve the booming high-tech industry in Silicon Valley. As of 1999, there were 2,400 lawyers practicing law in Palo Alto, a city of only 50,000 people, &quot;the densest concentration of lawyers&quot; in the United States outside of Washington, D.C.

By the year 2000, large law firms from all over the world were rushing to establish offices in the mid-Peninsula region on or near Sand Hill Road, and Silicon Valley law firms had become global trendsetters in that they were the first legal services employers to adopt business casual apparel (in imitation of their startup clients). During this era, lawyers evolved from their relatively narrow conventional role as protectors of intellectual property into business advisers, intermediaries, and dealmakers, and thereby acquired great prominence in Silicon Valley. For young entrepreneurs new to the Valley&#x27;s mysterious ways, their lawyer often served as their first coach, mentor, teacher, friend, and cheerleader who helped connect them to the Valley&#x27;s startup ecosystem.

As of 2023, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area had the highest average wage for lawyers in the United States, at $268,570. &quot;Above the Law&quot; occasionally publishes lists of top-performing Silicon Valley law firms, which it calls the &quot;white sandal elite&quot;, a parody of the &quot;white-shoe firm&quot; descriptor traditionally applied to certain East Coast professional services firms.

===Rise of computer culture===
The Homebrew Computer Club was an informal group of electronic enthusiasts and technically minded hobbyists who gathered to trade parts, circuits, and information pertaining to DIY construction of computing devices. It was started by Gordon French and Fred Moore who met at the Community Computer Center in Menlo Park. They both were interested in maintaining a regular, open forum for people to get together to work on making computers more accessible to everyone.

The first meeting was held as of March 1975 at French&#x27;s garage in Menlo Park, San Mateo County, California; which was on occasion of the arrival of the MITS Altair microcomputer, the first unit sent to the area for review by People&#x27;s Computer Company. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs credit that first meeting with inspiring them to design the original Apple I and (successor) Apple II computers. As a result, the first preview of the Apple I was given at the Homebrew Computer Club. Subsequent meetings were held at an auditorium at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.

===Advent of software===
Although semiconductors are still a major component of the area&#x27;s economy, Silicon Valley has been most famous in recent years for innovations in software and Internet services. Silicon Valley has significantly influenced computer operating systems, software, and user interfaces. Using money from NASA, the US Air Force, and ARPA, Douglas Engelbart invented the mouse and hypertext-based collaboration tools in the mid-1960s and 1970s while at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), first publicly demonstrated in 1968 in what is now known as The Mother of All Demos.

Engelbart&#x27;s Augmentation Research Center at SRI was also involved in launching the ARPANET (precursor to the Internet) and starting the Network Information Center (now InterNIC). Xerox hired some of Engelbart&#x27;s best researchers beginning in the early 1970s. In turn, in the 1970s and 1980s, Xerox&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) played a pivotal role in object-oriented programming, graphical user interfaces (GUIs), Ethernet, PostScript, and laser printers.

While Xerox marketed equipment using its technologies, for the most part its technologies flourished elsewhere. The diaspora of Xerox inventions led directly to 3Com and Adobe Systems, and indirectly to Cisco, Apple Computer, and Microsoft. Apple&#x27;s Macintosh GUI was largely a result of Steve Jobs&#x27; visit to PARC and the subsequent hiring of key personnel. Cisco&#x27;s impetus stemmed from the need to route a variety of protocols over Stanford University&#x27;s Ethernet campus network.

=== Internet age ===
Commercial use of the Internet became practical and grew slowly throughout the early 1990s. In 1995, commercial use of the Internet grew substantially and the initial wave of internet startups, Amazon.com, eBay, and the predecessor to Craigslist began operations. Silicon Valley is generally considered to have been the center of the dot-com bubble, which started in the mid-1990s and collapsed after the NASDAQ stock market began to decline dramatically in April 2000. During the bubble era, real estate prices reached unprecedented levels. For a brief time, Sand Hill Road was home to the most expensive commercial real estate in the world, and the booming economy resulted in severe traffic congestion.

The PayPal Mafia is sometimes credited with inspiring the re-emergence of consumer-focused Internet companies after the dot-com bust of 2001. After the dot-com crash, Silicon Valley continues to maintain its status as one of the top research and development centers in the world. A 2006 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; story found that 12 of the 20 most inventive towns in America were in California, and 10 of those were in Silicon Valley. San Jose led the list with 3,867 utility patents filed in 2005, and number two was Sunnyvale, at 1,881 utility patents. Silicon Valley is also home to a significant number of &quot;Unicorn&quot; ventures, referring to startup companies whose valuation has exceeded $1 billion dollars.

==Economy==
A world-renowned technology hub, San Francisco Bay Area has the largest concentration of high-tech companies in the United States, at 387,000 high-tech jobs, of which Silicon Valley accounts for 225,300 high-tech jobs. Silicon Valley has the highest concentration of high-tech workers of any metropolitan area, with 285.9 out of every 1,000 private-sector workers. Silicon Valley has the highest average high-tech salary in the United States at $144,800. Largely a result of the high technology sector, the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area has the most millionaires and the most billionaires in the United States per capita, although the venture capital ecosystem has grown more geographically decentralized over time.

The region is the biggest high-tech manufacturing center in the United States. The unemployment rate of the region was 9.4% in January 2009 and has decreased to a record low of 2.7% as of August 2019. But in April 2020, when unemployment was at its peak, it stood at 13.7% and has since fallen to 5.7% in July 2021. Silicon Valley received 41% of all U.S. venture investment in 2011, and 46% in 2012. During the period from 2019 to 2021, Silicon Valley&#x27;s share of U.S. venture capital investment dropped to 35.9%, but had surged back to 41% as of the first quarter of 2023.

More traditional industries also recognize the potential of high-tech development, and several car manufacturers have opened offices in Silicon Valley to capitalize on its entrepreneurial ecosystem. Manufacture of transistors was for a long time the core industry in Silicon Valley. The workforce was for the most part composed of Asian and Latino immigrants who were paid low wages and worked in hazardous conditions due to the chemicals used in the manufacture of integrated circuits. Technical, engineering, design, and administrative staffs were in large part well compensated.
===Housing===
Silicon Valley has a severe housing shortage, caused by the market imbalance between jobs created and housing units built: from 2010 to 2015, many more jobs have been created than housing units built. (400,000 jobs, 60,000 housing units) This shortage has driven home prices extremely high, far out of the range of production workers. As of 2016 a two-bedroom apartment rented for about $2,500 while the median home price was about $1 million. The &quot;Financial Post&quot; called Silicon Valley the most expensive U.S. housing region. Homelessness is a problem with housing beyond the reach of middle-income residents; there is little shelter space other than in San Jose which, as of 2015, was making an effort to develop shelters by renovating old hotels.

&quot;The Economist&quot; also attributes the high cost of living to the success of the industries in this region. Although, this rift between high and low salaries is driving many residents out who can no longer afford to live there. In the Bay Area, the number of residents planning to leave within the next several years has had an increase of 35% since 2016, from 34% to 46%.

===Wealth===

The wealth inequality in Silicon Valley is more pronounced than in any other region of the United States. A 2023 report found that the aggregate household wealth of Silicon Valley (including ultra-high net worth individuals) was nearly $1.1 trillion, and less than 1% of the Valley&#x27;s population held 36% of the wealth. Conversely, as of 2021, 23% of Silicon Valley residents were living below the poverty line. However, the meaning of the term &quot;poverty&quot; is dependent upon context; in Silicon Valley, it means something different because of the region&#x27;s severe housing shortage and high housing prices. As of 2023, the low-income poverty threshold set by the California Department of Housing and Community Development for single-person households in the counties of San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin was $104,400, followed by $96,000 for the county of Santa Clara. In contrast, the 2023 national low-income poverty threshold set by the U.S. Census Bureau for a single-person household was $14,891.

===Notable companies===



Thousands of high technology companies are headquartered in Silicon Valley. Among those, the following are in the Fortune 1000:

Additional notable companies headquartered in Silicon Valley (some of which are defunct, subsumed, or relocated) include:

==Demographics==
Silicon Valley has a population of 3.1 million as of 2020. A 1999 study by AnnaLee Saxenian for the Public Policy Institute of California reported that a third of Silicon Valley scientists and engineers were immigrants and that nearly a quarter of Silicon Valley&#x27;s high-technology firms since 1980 were run by Chinese (17 percent) or Indian descent CEOs (7 percent). In addition, Saxenian&#x27;s study found that successful immigrant entrepreneurs relied heavily on ethnic resources as they integrated into the Silicon Valley work culture and American society. There is a stratum of well-compensated technical employees and managers, including tens of thousands of &quot;single-digit millionaires&quot;. This income and range of assets will support a middle-class lifestyle in Silicon Valley.

=== Gender ===

In November 2006, the University of California, Davis released a report analyzing business leadership by women within the state. The report showed that although 103 of the 400 largest public companies headquartered in California were located in Santa Clara County (the most of all counties), only 8.8% of Silicon Valley companies had women CEOs. This was the lowest percentage in the state. (San Francisco County had 19.2% and Marin County had 18.5%.)

Silicon Valley tech leadership positions are occupied almost exclusively by men. This is also represented in the number of new companies founded by women as well as the number of women-lead startups that receive venture capital funding. Wadhwa said he believes that a contributing factor is a lack of parental encouragement to study science and engineering. He also cited a lack of women role models and noted that most famous tech leaders—like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg—are men.
As of October 2014, some high-profile Silicon Valley firms were working actively to prepare and recruit women. &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft attended the 20th annual Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing conference to actively recruit and potentially hire female engineers and technology experts. The same month, the second annual Platform Summit was held to discuss increasing racial and gender diversity in tech. As of April 2015 experienced women were engaged in creation of venture capital firms which leveraged women&#x27;s perspectives in funding of startups.

After UC Davis published its &quot;Study of California Women Business Leaders&quot; in November 2006, some &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; readers dismissed the possibility that sexism contributed in making Silicon Valley&#x27;s leadership gender gap the highest in the state. A January 2015 issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine featured an article detailing reports of sexism and misogyny in Silicon Valley. The article&#x27;s author, Nina Burleigh, asked, &quot;Where were all these offended people when women like Heidi Roizen published accounts of having a venture capitalist stick her hand in his pants under a table while a deal was being discussed?&quot; Silicon Valley firms&#x27; board of directors are composed of 15.7% women compared with 20.9% in the S&amp;P 100.

The 2012 lawsuit &quot;Pao v. Kleiner Perkins&quot; was filed in San Francisco County Superior Court by executive Ellen Pao for gender discrimination against her employer, Kleiner Perkins. The case went to trial in February 2015. On March 27, 2015, the jury found in favor of Kleiner Perkins on all counts. Nevertheless, the case, which had wide press coverage, resulted in major advances in consciousness of gender discrimination on the part of venture capital and technology firms and their women employees. Two other cases have been filed against Facebook and Twitter.

=== Race ===
A 2017 study showed that white males made up the majority of higher positions, with 58.7% holding executive positions and 46.5% being managers. The second highest position holders were Asian men, with 16.3% having executive positions and 17.9% being managers. African/Black and Hispanic/Latino people had the lowest percentages in all categories.

&quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; published an article in 2018 discussing diversity and inclusion and gave statistics on black employees along with advice to future black technicians. LeRon L. Barton, a black man who spent over two decades in Tech, gave an insight on his work experiences. He said he saw no one who looked like him in his profession and said he received many comments that he believed disregarded his skill such as being called the diversity hire. He described being isolated from his team, and constantly having to prove he could do the job he was hired for.

=== Statistics ===
In 2014, tech companies Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, Apple, and others, released corporate transparency reports that offered detailed employee breakdowns. In May, Google said 17% of its tech employees worldwide were women, and, in the U.S., 1% of its tech workers were black and 2% were Hispanic/Latino. June 2014 brought reports from Yahoo! and Facebook. Yahoo! said that 15% of its tech jobs were held by women, 2% of its tech employees were black and 4% Hispanic. Facebook reported that 15% of its tech workforce was female, and 3% was Hispanic and 1% was black.

In August 2014, Apple reported that 80% of its global tech staff was male and that, in the U.S., 54% of its tech jobs were staffed by Caucasians and 23% by Asians. Soon after, &quot;USA Today&quot; published an article about Silicon Valley&#x27;s lack of tech-industry diversity, pointing out that it is largely white or Asian, and male. &quot;Blacks and Hispanics are largely absent,&quot; it reported, &quot;and women are underrepresented in Silicon Valley—from giant companies to start-ups to venture capital firms.&quot; Civil rights activist Jesse Jackson said of improving diversity in the tech industry, &quot;This is the next step in the civil rights movement&quot; while T. J. Rodgers has argued against Jackson&#x27;s assertions.

According to a 2019 Lincoln Network survey, 48% of high-tech workers in Silicon Valley identify as Christians, with Roman Catholicism (27%) being its largest branch, followed by Protestantism (19%). The same study found that 16% of high-tech workers identify as nothing in particular, 11% as something else, 8% as Agnostics, and 7% as Atheists. Around 4% of high-tech workers in Silicon Valley identify as Jews or Buddhists, 3% as Hindus, 2% as Muslims and 1% as Satanists.

==Municipalities==
The following Santa Clara County cities are traditionally considered to be in Silicon Valley (in alphabetical order):

The geographical boundaries of Silicon Valley have changed over the years. Historically, the term Silicon Valley was treated as synonymous with Santa Clara Valley, and then its meaning later evolved to refer to Santa Clara County plus adjacent regions in southern San Mateo County and southern Alameda County. However, over the years this geographical area has been expanded to include San Francisco County, Contra Costa County, and the northern parts of Alameda County and San Mateo County, this shift has occurred due to the expansion in the local economy and the development of new technologies.

The United States Department of Labor&#x27;s Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program defined Silicon Valley as the counties of Alameda, Contra Costa, San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz. In 2015, MIT researchers developed a novel method for measuring which towns are home to startups with higher growth potential and this defines Silicon Valley to center on the municipalities of Menlo Park, Mountain View, Palo Alto, and Sunnyvale.

==Education==
=== Colleges and universities ===
Silicon Valley is associated with many colleges and universities in and near the Valley. The most prominent of those institutions are Stanford University, a private university located in the Valley, and the University of California, Berkeley, a public university located north of Silicon Valley. Both are considered to be world-leading institutions. More broadly, colleges and universities in the area include:

=== Secondary Education ===
Funding for public schools in upscale Silicon Valley communities such as Woodside is often supplemented by grants from private foundations set up for that purpose and funded by local residents. Schools in less affluent areas such as East Palo Alto must depend on state funding.

<text>Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, United States. It was founded in 1885 by railroad magnate Leland Stanford, the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California, and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Jr. 

The university admitted its first students in 1891, opening as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. It struggled financially after Leland died in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Following World War II, university provost Frederick Terman inspired an entrepreneurial culture to build a self-sufficient local industry (later Silicon Valley). In 1951, the Stanford Research Park was established in Palo Alto and is the world&#x27;s first university research park. By 2021, the university had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical faculty on staff.

The university is organized around seven schools of study on an campus, one of the largest in the nation. It houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think tank, and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of eight private institutions in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships, and was awarded the NACDA Directors&#x27; Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994. Students and alumni have won 302 Olympic medals (including 153 gold).

The university is associated with 74 living billionaires, 58 Nobel laureates, 33 MacArthur Fellows, 29 Turing Award winners, as well as 7 Wolf Foundation Prize recipients, 2 Supreme Court Justices of the United States, and 4 Pulitzer Prize winners. Additionally, its alumni include many Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.

== History ==

Stanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford as a tribute to the memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr. The university officially opened in 1891 on the Stanfords&#x27; former Palo Alto farm. Modeled after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, Stanford was often referred to as the &quot;Cornell of the West&quot; in its early years. This comparison was largely due to a significant portion of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and its second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and inclusive of women and men. Cornell is recognized as one of the first American universities to embrace this progressive approach to education, and Stanford quickly followed suit, solidifying its commitment to these ideals. 
From an architectural perspective, the Stanfords sought to distinguish their university by emulating the style of English university buildings while also incorporating elements of local California heritage. They specified in the founding grant that the buildings should &quot;be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.&quot; The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.
When Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was put in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis. The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored. During the early-20th century, the university added four professional graduate schools. Stanford University School of Medicine was established in 1908 when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco; it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959. 

The university&#x27;s law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923. The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917. The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products. During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land. Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors. Shockley and Terman are both often described as the &quot;fathers of Silicon Valley&quot;.

In the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so. Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL. Stanford was once considered a school for &quot;the wealthy&quot;, but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical, and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school&#x27;s research funding, and the resignation of President Donald Kennedy in 1992.

In the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, &quot;when it appeared on lists of the &quot;top ten&quot; universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university&#x27;s defense contracts...&quot; Wallace Sterling was the President from 1949 to 1968 and he oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, &quot;the Harvard of the West&quot;. Achievements during Sterling&#x27;s tenure included:
*Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.
*Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university&#x27;s finances. The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university&#x27;s aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.
*Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.
*Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.
*Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.
*Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.
*Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.

== Land ==
Most of Stanford is on an campus, one of the largest in the United States. It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately southeast of San Francisco and approximately northwest of San Jose. Stanford received $4.5 billion in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.

Stanford&#x27;s main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County, although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.

The central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it. Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita to up to 8 feet of depth. Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake, are on more remote sections of the founding grant.
=== Central campus ===
The central campus is adjacent to Palo Alto, bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road, off State Route 82. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.
=== Non-central campus ===
On the founding grant:
*Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. Researchers and students are involved in biological research. Professors can teach the importance of biological research to the biological community. The primary goal is to understand the system of the natural Earth.
*SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, on a area of land.

Off the founding grant:
*Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892. Based on US Pacific Coast, it is one of the oldest marine laboratories. It includes 10 research laboratories and is also used for archaeological exploration purposes. A graduate student of the anthropology department discovered evidence that the location was home to a Chinese American fishing village in the early 1900s.
*Study abroad locations: unlike typical study abroad programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a &quot;mini-Stanford.&quot;
*Redwood City campus for many of the university&#x27;s administrative offices in Redwood City, California, a few miles north of the main campus. In 2005, the university purchased a small, campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by the Great Recession. In 2015, the university announced a development plan, and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.
*The Bass Center in Washington, D.C. provides a base, including housing, for the Stanford in Washington program for undergraduates. It includes a small art gallery open to the public.
*China: Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.


=== Faculty residences ===
Many Stanford faculty members live in the &quot;Faculty Ghetto&quot;, within walking or biking distance of campus. The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold to other Stanford faculty but the land under the houses is leased for 51 years with the possibility of extensions. Houses in the &quot;Ghetto&quot; appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.

=== Other uses ===
Some of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School. El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land. Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course, and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center, used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.

=== Landmarks ===
Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. White Memorial Fountain (also known as &quot;The Claw&quot;) between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of &quot;fountain hopping&quot;; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William White and John White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.
== Administration and organization ==
Stanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38. Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually. A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot. The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children&#x27;s Hospital).

The board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents. Richard Saller became the interim president in September 2023. On April 4, 2024, the board of trustees announced that Jonathan Levin would become the thirteenth president on August 1, 2024. The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report. Jenny Martinez became the fourteenth provost in October 2023. The university is organized into seven academic schools. 

The schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments), Engineering (nine departments), and Sustainability (nine departments) have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law, Medicine, Education, and Business have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators. But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.

The Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body. Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.

=== Endowment, assets, and donations ===

Stanford&#x27;s endowment includes real estate and other investments valued at $36.5 billion as of August 2023, and is one of the four largest academic endowments in the United States. The endowment consists of $29.9 billion in a merged pool of assets and $6.6 billion of real estate near the main campus. Stanford is the largest landowner in the Silicon Valley Payouts from the endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year. 

Since inception, the university has been the beneficiary of large donations. The endowment began in 1885, six years before the opening of the university, when Leland Stanford and his wife Jane conveyed approximately $20 million to the university. The university&#x27;s pioneering of technology intellectual property transfer created both direct investments and enabled a unique pipeline of mega-donors including from alumni-founded companies with Google (Sergey Brin and Larry Page), Nike (Phil Knight), Hewlett-Packard (David Packard and Bill Hewlett), and Sun Microsystems (Vinod Kohsla) as examples. Further, the university&#x27;s global reputation and continued leadership in technology has attracted large donations from prominent figures such as the co-founder of Netscape (Jim Clark), founder of SAP SE (Hasso Plattner), co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz (Marc Andreessen and Laura Arillaga-Andreessen), chairman of Kleiner Perkins (John Doerr and his wife Ann).

== Academics ==

=== Admissions ===
Stanford is considered by &quot;US News&quot; to be &#x27;most selective&#x27; with an acceptance rate of 4%, one of the lowest 
among US universities. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score between 32 and 35, typically with a GPA of 3.94 or higher. Admissions officials consider a student&#x27;s grade point average to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant&#x27;s high school class rank and letters of recommendation. In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as &#x27;very important&#x27; in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as &#x27;considered&#x27;. Of those students accepted to Stanford&#x27;s Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.

Stanford&#x27;s admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents; while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411. In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460. Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid. Stanford has a no-loan policy. For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced. Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants, a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities, as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program. Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.

=== Teaching and learning ===
Stanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June. The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence. Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.

=== Research centers and institutes ===
Stanford is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.&quot; The university&#x27;s research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021/22 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900. By 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes. Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research. Other Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).

Stanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute, which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center. It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses on five points: climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics. Together with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.

=== Libraries and digital resources ===
By 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) had twenty-four libraries in total. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of 20th-century. Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, and thousands of other digital resources. The main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes. Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books. It also has fifteen subject areas.

==== Online encyclopedia ====
The &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; is a leading online encyclopedia and academic resource on the subject of philosophy, published and maintained by the university. The encyclopedia was founded by Stanford senior researcher Edward Zalta in 1995.

=== Arts ===
Stanford is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum established with the help of art collector B. Gerald Cantor. It today consists of twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The university&#x27;s collection of works by Auguste Rodin is among the largest in the world, with as many as 200 sculptures at the Cantor Center alone. These include an original bronze cast of &quot;The Thinker&quot; granted residence at Stanford by Cantor in 1988, with the university expected to attain full ownership sometime in the future. The Stanford &quot;Thinker&quot; has been loaned for viewing around the world and features across the university&#x27;s iconography and culture, including the logo of the &quot;Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&quot;

The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art &amp; Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary and Harry Anderson. There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features wood carvings and &quot;totem poles.&quot;

The Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles, including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram&#x27;s Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors, the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host to ten &quot;a cappella&quot; groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford&#x27;s first), Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast), the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers, Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.

=== Reputation and rankings ===
Stanford is widely considered one of the most prestigious universities in the world by leading sources including &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;, and &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;. As noted in The Wall Street Journal&#x27;s 2024 rankings, &quot;the usual players are almost always going to come out on top: The Princetons, the Stanfords, the Yales, the Harvards. They will jockey for those first few spots on whatever ranking you happen to be looking.&quot;

==== Standings in rankings ====
In 2022, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States. In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters&#x27; list of the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Innovative Universities&quot; for the fifth consecutive year. Stanford Graduate School of Business has consistently been both the most selective business school in the world and consistently ranked 1st in the list of best business schools year-over-year consecutively by various reputed studies including &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; for 2024. Stanford Law School is also consistently been amongst the two most selective law schools in the world and consistently ranked 1st in the list of best law schools year-over-year consecutively for 2024 in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

In a 2022 survey by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten &quot;dream colleges&quot; of America, and was considered to be the ultimate &quot;dream college&quot; of both students and parents. From polls of college applicants done by &quot;The Princeton Review&quot;, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named &quot;dream college&quot; for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate &quot;dream college.&quot; The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)&quot; ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020. &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; recognizes Stanford as one of the world&#x27;s &quot;six super brands&quot; on its &quot;World Reputation Rankings&quot;, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.

== Discoveries and innovation ==
=== Natural sciences ===

*Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg discovered the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work at Stanford. By studying bacteria, Kornberg succeeded in isolating DNA polymerase in 1956–an enzyme that is active in the formation of DNA.
*First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering. Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.
*Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.
*Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of MRI.

=== Computer and applied sciences ===

*ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes. In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn &amp; Vint Cerf&#x27;s research project about Internetworking, later DARPA formulated it to the TCP (Transmission Control Program).
*Internet – Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. Vint Cerf led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn (Bob Kahn) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.
*Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.
*Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, when they were both PhD students at Stanford. They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP) which is started in 1999. The SDLP&#x27;s goal was &quot;to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library&quot;, and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies. Today, Google stands as one of the most valuable brands in the world.
*Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford. Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937. Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.
*RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design. Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC. Another success from this era were IBM&#x27;s efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products. 
*SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation, for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation, which led to Sun Microsystems.
*MIMO - Arogyaswami Paulraj and Thomas Kailath invented multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) radio communications, which involves simultaneously using multiple antennas on receivers and transmitters. Invented in 1992, MIMO is an essential element in many modern wireless technologies today.

=== Businesses and entrepreneurship ===

Stanford is one of the most successful universities worldwide in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered the model for technology transfer. Stanford&#x27;s Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often funded, to launch their own companies. Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s. When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world. 

Some notable companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:

*Hewlett-Packard, 1939: co-founders William R. Hewlett (B.S, PhD) and David Packard (M.S)
*Silicon Graphics, 1981: co-founders James H. Clark (Associate Professor) and several of his graduate students

== Student life ==

=== Student body ===
Stanford enrolled 6,996 undergraduate and 10,253 graduate students in the 2019–2020 school year. Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students. In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master&#x27;s degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year. The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%. The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university&#x27;s coterminal degree (or &quot;coterm&quot;) program, which allows students to earn a master&#x27;s degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program. In 2010, 15% of undergraduates were first-generation students.

=== Dormitories and student housing ===
By 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years. Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities. At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as &quot;temporary&quot; housing from 1969 to 1991, but have become the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015. Most student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but some have single-gender floors.

Several residences are considered &quot;theme&quot; houses; predating the current classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970), and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972). The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts &amp; Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority). Co-ops or &quot;Self-Ops&quot; are another housing option. 

These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house), and Synergy. Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op. By 2015, 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.

=== Athletics ===
In 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports, nineteen club sports, and about 27 intramural sports. The Stanford Tree is the Stanford Band&#x27;s mascot and the unofficial mascot of Stanford University. Stanford&#x27;s team name is the &quot;Cardinal&quot;, referring to the vivid Stanford Cardinal Red color (not the common songbird as at several other schools); the university does not have an official mascot. The Tree has been called one of America&#x27;s most bizarre and controversial college mascots; it regularly appears at the top of Internet &quot;worst mascot&quot; lists, but has also appeared on at least one list of top mascots. The Tree is a member of the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band (LSJUMB) and appears at football games, basketball games, and other events where the band performs.

In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted a new mascot (Indian). The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate. Stanford is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA&#x27;s Division I FBS. The two official colors of the university are Stanford Cardinal Red and Palo Alto Green.

From 1930 until 1972, Stanford&#x27;s sports teams had been known as the Indians and during the period from 1951 to 1972, Prince Lightfoot (portrayed by Timm Williams, a member of the Yurok tribe) was the official mascot. But in 1972, Native American students and staff members successfully lobbied University President Richard Lyman to abolish the &quot;Indian&quot; name along with what they had come to perceive as an offensive and demeaning mascot. Stanford&#x27;s teams reverted unofficially to the name &quot;Cardinal&quot;, the color that had represented the school before 1930.

From 1972 until 1981, Stanford’s official nickname was the Cardinal, but, during this time, there was debate among students and administrators concerning what the mascot and team name should be. A 1972 student referendum on the issue was in favor of restoring the Indian, while a second 1975 referendum was against. The 1975 vote included new suggestions, many alluding to the industry of the school&#x27;s founder, tycoon Leland Stanford: the Robber Barons, the Sequoias, the Trees, the Cardinals, the Railroaders, the Spikes, and the Huns.
Its traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley. The winner of the annual &quot;Big Game&quot; between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe. 

As of May 23, 2024, Stanford has won 136 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 48 consecutive years, from 1976–77 through to 2023–24. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have also won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford&#x27;s total. Stanford have won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors&#x27; Cups, from 1994–1995 through to 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation. 177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics. In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.

=== Traditions ===
*&quot;Hail, Stanford, Hail!&quot; is the Stanford hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various university singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in economics and later became associate professor of sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
*Big Game: The central football rivalry between Stanford and UC Berkeley. First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities&#x27; rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.
*The Stanford Axe: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary. The axe originated in 1899 when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman&#x27;s axe to inspire the team. Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game. In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe. In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game. As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford&#x27;s campus is named &quot;The Axe and Palm&quot; in reference to the Axe.
*Big Game Gaieties: In the week ahead of Big Game, a 90-minute original musical (written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram&#x27;s Head Theatrical Society) is performed in Memorial Auditorium.
*Full Moon on the Quad: An annual event at Main Quad, where students gather to kiss one another starting at midnight. Typically organized by the junior class cabinet, the festivities include live entertainment, such as music and dance performances.
*The Stanford Marriage Pact: An annual matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a questionnaire about their values and are subsequently matched with the best person for them to make a &quot;marriage pact&quot; with.
*Fountain Hopping: At any time of year, students tour Stanford&#x27;s main campus fountains to dip their feet or swim in some of the university&#x27;s 25 fountains.
*Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006. In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented. In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.
*Wacky Walk: At commencement, graduates forgo a more traditional entrance and instead stride into Stanford Stadium in a large procession wearing wacky costumes.
*Steam Tunneling: Stanford has a network of underground brick-lined tunnels that conduct central heating to more than 200 buildings via steam pipes. Students sometimes navigate the corridors, rooms, and locked gates, carrying flashlights and water bottles. &quot;Stanford Magazine&quot; named steam tunneling one of the &quot;101 things you must do&quot; before graduating from the Farm in 2000.
*Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at Main Quad.
*Viennese Ball: A formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed (since 1987) Stanford in Vienna overseas program. It is now open to all students.
*The long-unofficial motto of Stanford, selected by President Jordan, is &quot;Die Luft der Freiheit weht.&quot; Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, &quot;The wind of freedom blows.&quot; The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official. It was made official by way of incorporation into an official seal by the board of trustees in December 2002.
*Degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees, but in 1953 the &quot;degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman&quot; was created by Stanford Associates, part of the Stanford alumni organization, to recognize alumni who give rare and extraordinary service to the university. It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.
*Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.

=== Religious life ===
Students and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life&#x27;s mission is &quot;to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community&quot; by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.
Stanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the &quot;Protestant Ecumenical Christian&quot; tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services. In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and legal weddings.

In addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year. The Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the &quot;Windhover&quot; paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist. Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic and Hillel communities at Stanford.

=== Greek life ===
Fraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition. However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977. Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year. Stanford has thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university). Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.
=== Student groups ===

Stanford has more than 600 student organizations. Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include &quot;special fees,&quot; which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be &quot;broadly open&quot; for all interested students to join.

&quot;The Stanford Daily&quot; is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892. The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station. The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987. &quot;The Fountain Hopper&quot; (&quot;FoHo&quot;) is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campus rag publication, notable for having broken the Brock Turner story. Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club. Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.

Stanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members. Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs. StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups. It is staffed primarily by students. Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry. Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.

Stanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, including Stanford in Government and Stanford Women in Politics. The Stanford Society for Latin American Politics is Stanford&#x27;s first student organization focused on the region&#x27;s political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study of Latin America on campus. Former guest speakers include José Mujica and Gustavo Petro. Other groups include:
*The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group. It has existed since 1982.
*Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) which hosts the annual Stanford Powwow started in 1971. This is the largest student-run event on campus and the largest student-run powwow in the country.
*The Stanford Improvisors (SImps for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community. In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament, and they have since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.
*Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991. It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector. Asha&#x27;s Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India on the university campus.

=== Safety ===
Stanford&#x27;s Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act. Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976. Murder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018. Also infamous was Theodore Streleski&#x27;s murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.

==== Campus sexual misconduct ====
In 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in &quot;total of reports of rape&quot; on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape. In Stanford&#x27;s 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct. According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men. Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: &quot;Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.&quot;

Associated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted. Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.

==== &quot;People v. Turner&quot; ====
On the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the fraternity Kappa Alpha Order, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived. Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation. Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible. The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention. Two years later, the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.

==== Joe Lonsdale ====

In February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale. Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course. By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years. Lonsdale challenged Stanford&#x27;s finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015. Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.

<doc id="26980" wikidata="Q14647" url="?curid=26980" title="Sun Microsystems">
<text>Sun Microsystems, Inc., often known as Sun for short, was an American technology company that existed from 1982 to 2010 which developed and sold computers, computer components, software, and information technology services. Sun contributed significantly to the evolution of several key computing technologies, among them Unix, RISC processors, thin client computing, and virtualized computing. At its height, the Sun headquarters were in Santa Clara, California (part of Silicon Valley), on the former west campus of the Agnews Developmental Center.

Sun products included computer servers and workstations built on its own RISC-based SPARC processor architecture, as well as on x86-based AMD Opteron and Intel Xeon processors. Sun also developed its own storage systems and a suite of software products, including the Unix-based SunOS and later Solaris operating systems, developer tools, Web infrastructure software, and identity management applications. Technologies that Sun created include the Java programming language, the Java platform and Network File System (NFS).

In general, Sun was a proponent of open systems, particularly Unix. It was also a major contributor to open-source software, as evidenced by its $1 billion purchase, in 2008, of MySQL, an open-source relational database management system. Other notable Sun acquisitions include Cray Business Systems Division, Storagetek, and Innotek GmbH, creators of VirtualBox. On April 20, 2009, it was announced that Oracle would acquire Sun for 7.4 billion. The deal was completed on January 27, 2010.

==History==

The initial design for what became Sun&#x27;s first Unix workstation, the Sun-1, was conceived by Andy Bechtolsheim when he was a graduate student at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. Bechtolsheim originally designed the SUN workstation for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation. It was designed around the Motorola 68000 processor with an advanced memory management unit (MMU) to support the Unix operating system with virtual memory support. He built the first examples from spare parts obtained from Stanford&#x27;s Department of Computer Science and Silicon Valley supply houses.

On February 24, 1982, Scott McNealy, Andy Bechtolsheim, and Vinod Khosla, all Stanford graduate students, founded &quot;Sun Microsystems&quot;. Bill Joy of Berkeley, a primary developer of the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), joined soon after and is counted as one of the original founders. The company was the second, after rival Apollo Computer, to specialize in workstations. The name &quot;Sun&quot; is derived from the initials of the Stanford University Network (SUN). Sun was profitable from its first quarter in July 1982.

By 1983, Sun was known for producing 68k-based systems with high-quality graphics that were the only computers other than DEC&#x27;s VAX to run 4.2BSD. It licensed the computer design to other manufacturers, which typically used it to build Multibus-based systems running Unix from UniSoft. Sun&#x27;s initial public offering was in 1986 under the stock symbol &quot;SUNW&quot;, for &quot;Sun Workstations&quot; (later &quot;Sun Worldwide&quot;). The symbol was changed in 2007 to &quot;JAVA&quot;; Sun stated that the brand awareness associated with its Java platform better represented the company&#x27;s current strategy.

Sun&#x27;s logo, which features four interleaved copies of the word &quot;sun&quot; in the form of a rotationally symmetric ambigram, was designed by professor Vaughan Pratt, also of Stanford. The initial version of the logo was orange and had the sides oriented horizontally and vertically, but it was subsequently rotated to stand on one corner and re-colored purple, and later blue.

=== Dot-com bubble and aftermath===
During the dot-com bubble, Sun began making more money, with its stock rising as high as $250 per share. It also began spending much more, hiring workers and building itself out. Some of this was because of genuine demand, but much was from web start-up companies anticipating business that would never happen. In 2000, the bubble burst. Sales in Sun&#x27;s important hardware division went into free-fall as customers closed shop and auctioned high-end servers.

Several quarters of steep losses led to executive departures, rounds of layoffs, and other cost cutting. In December 2001, the stock fell to the 1998, pre-bubble level of about $100. It continued to fall, faster than many other technology companies. A year later, it had reached below $10 (a tenth of what it was in 1990), but it eventually bounced back to $20. In mid-2004, Sun closed their Newark, California, factory and consolidated all manufacturing to Hillsboro, Oregon and Linlithgow, Scotland. In 2006, the rest of the Newark campus was put on the market.

===Post-crash focus===

In 2004, Sun canceled two major processor projects which emphasized high instruction-level parallelism and operating frequency. Instead, the company chose to concentrate on processors optimized for multi-threading and multiprocessing, such as the UltraSPARC T1 processor (codenamed &quot;Niagara&quot;). The company also announced a collaboration with Fujitsu to use the Japanese company&#x27;s processor chips in mid-range and high-end Sun servers. These servers were announced on April 17, 2007, as the M-Series, part of the SPARC Enterprise series.

In February 2005, Sun announced the Sun Grid, a grid computing deployment on which it offered utility computing services priced at US$1 per CPU/hour for processing and per GB/month for storage. This offering built upon an existing 3,000-CPU server farm used for internal R&amp;D for over 10 years, which Sun marketed as being able to achieve 97% utilization. In August 2005, the first commercial use of this grid was announced for financial risk simulations which were later launched as its first software as a service product.

In January 2005, Sun reported a net profit of $19 million for fiscal 2005 second quarter, for the first time in three years. This was followed by net loss of $9 million on GAAP basis for the third quarter 2005, as reported on April 14, 2005. In January 2007, Sun reported a net GAAP profit of $126 million on revenue of $3.337 billion for its fiscal second quarter. Shortly following that news, it was announced that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) would invest $700 million in the company.

Sun had engineering groups in Bangalore, Beijing, Dublin, Grenoble, Hamburg, Prague, St. Petersburg, Tel Aviv, Tokyo, Canberra and Trondheim.

In 2007–2008, Sun posted revenue of $13.8 billion and had $2 billion in cash. First-quarter 2008 losses were $1.68 billion; revenue fell 7% to $12.99 billion. Sun&#x27;s stock lost 80% of its value November 2007 to November 2008, reducing the company&#x27;s market value to $3 billion. With falling sales to large corporate clients, Sun announced plans to lay off 5,000 to 6,000 workers, or 15–18% of its work force. It expected to save $700 million to $800 million a year as a result of the moves, while also taking up to $600 million in charges.

==Major stockholders==
As of May 11, 2009, the following shareholders held over 100,000 common shares of Sun and at $9.50 per share offered by Oracle, they received the amounts indicated when the acquisition closed.
==Hardware==
For the first decade of Sun&#x27;s history, the company positioned its products as technical workstations, competing successfully as a low-cost vendor during the Workstation Wars of the 1980s. It then shifted its hardware product line to emphasize servers and storage. High-level telecom control systems such as Operational Support Systems service predominantly used Sun equipment.

===Motorola-based systems===
Sun originally used Motorola 68000 family central processing units for the Sun-1 through Sun-3 computer series. The Sun-1 employed a 68000 CPU, the Sun-2 series, a 68010. The Sun-3 series was based on the 68020, with the later Sun-3x using the 68030.

===SPARC-based systems===
In 1987, the company began using &quot;SPARC (Scalable Processor ARChitecture)&quot;, a RISC processor architecture of its own design, in its computer systems, starting with the Sun-4 line. SPARC was initially a 32-bit architecture (SPARC V7) until the introduction of the SPARC V9 architecture in 1995, which added 64-bit extensions.

Sun developed several generations of SPARC-based computer systems, including the SPARCstation, Ultra, and Sun Blade series of workstations, and the SPARCserver, Netra, Enterprise, and Sun Fire line of servers.

In the early 1990s the company began to extend its product line to include large-scale symmetric multiprocessing servers, starting with the four-processor SPARCserver 600MP. This was followed by the 8-processor SPARCserver 1000 and 20-processor SPARCcenter 2000, which were based on work done in conjunction with Xerox PARC. In 1995 the company introduced Sun Ultra series machines that were equipped with the first 64-bit implementation of SPARC processors (UltraSPARC). In the late 1990s the transformation of product line in favor of large 64-bit SMP systems was accelerated by the acquisition of Cray Business Systems Division from Silicon Graphics. Their 32-bit, 64-processor Cray Superserver 6400, related to the SPARCcenter, led to the 64-bit Sun Enterprise 10000 high-end server (otherwise known as &quot;Starfire&quot; or E10K).

In September 2004, Sun made available systems with UltraSPARC IV which was the first multi-core SPARC processor. It was followed by UltraSPARC IV+ in September 2005 and its revisions with higher clock speeds in 2007. These CPUs were used in the most powerful, enterprise class high-end CC-NUMA servers developed by Sun, such as the Sun Fire E15K and the Sun Fire E25K.

In November 2005, Sun launched the UltraSPARC T1, notable for its ability to concurrently run 32 threads of execution on 8 processor cores. Its intent was to drive more efficient use of CPU resources, which is of particular importance in data centers, where there is an increasing need to reduce power and air conditioning demands, much of which comes from the heat generated by CPUs. The T1 was followed in 2007 by the UltraSPARC T2, which extended the number of threads per core from 4 to 8. Sun has open sourced the design specifications of both the T1 and T2 processors via the OpenSPARC project.

In 2006, Sun ventured into the &quot;blade server&quot; (high density rack-mounted systems) market with the Sun Blade (distinct from the Sun Blade workstation).

In April 2007, Sun released the SPARC Enterprise server products, jointly designed by Sun and Fujitsu and based on Fujitsu SPARC64 VI and later processors. The &quot;M-class&quot; SPARC Enterprise systems include high-end reliability and availability features. Later T-series servers have also been badged SPARC Enterprise rather than Sun Fire.

In April 2008, Sun released servers with UltraSPARC T2 Plus, which is an SMP capable version of UltraSPARC T2, available in 2 or 4 processor configurations. It was the first CoolThreads CPU with multi-processor capability and it made possible to build standard rack-mounted servers that could simultaneously process up to massive 256 CPU threads in hardware (Sun SPARC Enterprise T5440), which is considered a record in the industry.

Since 2010, all further development of Sun machines based on SPARC architecture (including new SPARC T-Series servers, SPARC T3 and T4 chips) is done as a part of Oracle Corporation hardware division.

===x86-based systems===
In the late 1980s, Sun also marketed an Intel 80386–based machine, the Sun386i; this was designed to be a hybrid system, running SunOS but at the same time supporting DOS applications. This only remained on the market for a brief time. A follow-up &quot;486i&quot; upgrade was announced but only a few prototype units were ever manufactured.

Sun&#x27;s brief first foray into x86 systems ended in the early 1990s, as it decided to concentrate on SPARC and retire the last Motorola systems and 386i products, a move dubbed by McNealy as &quot;all the wood behind one arrowhead&quot;. Even so, Sun kept its hand in the x86 world, as a release of Solaris for PC compatibles began shipping in 1993.

In 1997, Sun acquired Diba, Inc., followed later by the acquisition of Cobalt Networks in 2000, with the aim of building &quot;network appliances&quot; (single function computers meant for consumers). Sun also marketed a Network Computer (a term popularized and eventually trademarked by Oracle); the JavaStation was a diskless system designed to run Java applications.

Although none of these business initiatives were particularly successful, the Cobalt purchase gave Sun a toehold for its return to the x86 hardware market. In 2002, Sun introduced its first general purpose x86 system, the LX50, based in part on previous Cobalt system expertise. This was also Sun&#x27;s first system announced to support Linux as well as Solaris.

In 2003, Sun announced a strategic alliance with AMD to produce x86/x64 servers based on AMD&#x27;s Opteron processor; this was followed shortly by Sun&#x27;s acquisition of Kealia, a startup founded by original Sun founder Andy Bechtolsheim, which had been focusing on high-performance AMD-based servers.

The following year, Sun launched the Opteron-based Sun Fire V20z and V40z servers, and the Sun Java Workstation W1100z and W2100z workstations.

In September 2005 Sun unveiled a new range of Opteron-based servers: the Sun Fire X2100, X4100 and X4200 servers. These were designed from scratch by a team led by Bechtolsheim to address heat and power consumption issues commonly faced in data centers. In July 2006, the Sun Fire X4500 and X4600 systems were introduced, extending a line of x64 systems that support not only Solaris, but also Linux and Microsoft Windows.

In January 2007 Sun announced a broad strategic alliance with Intel. Intel endorsed Solaris as a mainstream operating system and as its mission critical Unix for its Xeon processor–based systems, and contributed engineering resources to OpenSolaris. Sun began using the Intel Xeon processor in its x64 server line, starting with the Sun Blade X6250 server module introduced in June 2007.

In May 2008 AMD announced its Operating System Research Center (OSRC) was expanding its focus to include optimization to Sun&#x27;s OpenSolaris and xVM virtualization products for AMD processors.

==Software==

Although Sun was initially known as a hardware company, its software history began with its founding in 1982; co-founder Bill Joy was one of the leading Unix developers of the time, having contributed the vi editor, the C shell, and significant work developing TCP/IP and the BSD Unix OS. Sun later developed software such as the Java programming language and acquired software such as StarOffice, VirtualBox and MySQL. In February 1991, the company established SunSoft, Inc., a wholly owned division of Sun dedicated to the development of operating systems and application software.

Sun used community-based and open-source licensing of its major technologies, and for its support of its products with other open source technologies. GNOME-based desktop software called Java Desktop System (originally code-named &quot;Madhatter&quot;) was distributed for the Solaris operating system, and at one point for Linux. Sun supported its Java Enterprise System (a middleware stack) on Linux. It released the source code for Solaris under the open-source Common Development and Distribution License, via the OpenSolaris community. Sun&#x27;s positioning includes a commitment to indemnify users of some software from intellectual property disputes concerning that software. It offers support services on a variety of pricing bases, including per-employee and per-socket.

A 2006 report prepared for the EU by UNU-MERIT stated that Sun was the largest corporate contributor to open source movements in the world. According to this report, Sun&#x27;s open source contributions exceed the combined total of the next five largest commercial contributors.

===Operating systems===
Sun is best known for its Unix systems, which have a reputation for system stability and a consistent design philosophy.

Sun&#x27;s first workstation shipped with UniSoft V7 Unix. Later in 1982 Sun began providing SunOS, a customized 4.2BSD Unix, as the operating system for its workstations.
SunOS included suntools, an early GUI window system.

In the late 1980s, AT&amp;T tapped Sun to help them develop the next release of their branded UNIX, and in 1988 announced they would purchase up to a 20% stake in Sun. UNIX System V Release 4 (SVR4) was jointly developed by AT&amp;T and Sun. Sun used SVR4 as the foundation for Solaris 2.x, which became the successor to SunOS 4.1.x (later retroactively named Solaris 1.x). By the mid-1990s, the ensuing Unix wars had largely subsided, AT&amp;T had sold off their Unix interests, and the relationship between the two companies was significantly reduced.

In the early 1990s, Brian P. Dougherty, founder of Berkeley Softworks (which would go on to be re-incorporated as the &quot;GeoWorks Corporation&quot;) accused 
the Java development team at Sun for studying GeoWorks&#x27;s PC/GEOS operating system and incorporating features of PC/GEOS into their Unix-based operating system. Brian claimed that the object-oriented and flexible UI of PC/GEOS was &quot;to this day the most sophisticated UI technology ever built into an OS&quot;.

From 1992 Sun also sold Interactive Unix, an operating system it acquired when it bought Interactive Systems Corporation from Eastman Kodak Company. This was a popular Unix variant for the PC platform and a major competitor to market leader SCO UNIX. Sun&#x27;s focus on Interactive Unix diminished in favor of Solaris on both SPARC and x86 systems; it was dropped as a product in 2001.

Sun dropped the Solaris 2.x version numbering scheme after the Solaris 2.6 release (1997); the following version was branded Solaris 7. This was the first 64-bit release, intended for the new UltraSPARC CPUs based on the SPARC V9 architecture. Within the next four years, the successors Solaris 8 and Solaris 9 were released in 2000 and 2002 respectively.

Following several years of difficult competition and loss of server market share to competitors&#x27; Linux-based systems, Sun began to include Linux as part of its strategy in 2002. Sun supported both Red Hat Enterprise Linux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on its x64 systems; companies such as Canonical Ltd., Wind River Systems and MontaVista also supported their versions of Linux on Sun&#x27;s SPARC-based systems.

In 2004, after having cultivated a reputation as one of Microsoft&#x27;s most vocal antagonists, Sun entered into a joint relationship with them, resolving various legal entanglements between the two companies and receiving US$1.95 billion in settlement payments from them. Sun supported Microsoft Windows on its x64 systems, and announced other collaborative agreements with Microsoft, including plans to support each other&#x27;s virtualization environments.

In 2005, the company released Solaris 10. The new version included a large number of enhancements to the operating system, as well as very novel features, previously unseen in the industry. Solaris 10 update releases continued through the next 8 years, the last release from Sun Microsystems being Solaris 10 10/09. The following updates were released by Oracle under the new license agreement; the final release is Solaris 10 1/13.

Previously, Sun offered a separate variant of Solaris called Trusted Solaris, which included augmented security features such as multilevel security and a least privilege access model. Solaris 10 included many of the same capabilities as Trusted Solaris at the time of its initial release; Solaris 10 11/06 included Solaris Trusted Extensions, which give it the remaining capabilities needed to make it the functional successor to Trusted Solaris.

After the release of Solaris 10, the Solaris source code was opened under the CDDL free software license and developed in open with contributing Opensolaris community through SXCE that used SVR4 .pkg packaging and supported OpenSolaris releases that used IPS.
Following the acquisition of Sun by Oracle, OpenSolaris continued to develop in open under illumos with illumos distributions.

Oracle Corporation continued to develop Solaris, reverting new development back to the proprietary licensing; its next release was Oracle Solaris 11 in November 2011.

===Java platform===

The Java platform was developed at Sun by James Gosling in the early 1990s with the objective of allowing programs to function regardless of the device they were used on, sparking the slogan &quot;Write once, run anywhere&quot; (WORA). While this objective was not entirely achieved (prompting the riposte &quot;Write once, debug everywhere&quot;), Java is regarded as being largely hardware—and operating system—independent.

Java was initially promoted as a platform for client-side &quot;applets&quot; running inside web browsers. Early examples of Java applications were the HotJava web browser and the HotJava Views suite. However, since then Java has been more successful on the server side of the Internet.

The platform consists of three major parts: the Java programming language, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and several Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The design of the Java platform is controlled by the vendor and user community through the Java Community Process (JCP).

Java is an object-oriented programming language. Since its introduction in late 1995, it became one of the world&#x27;s most popular programming languages.

Java programs are compiled to byte code, which can be executed by any JVM, regardless of the environment.

The Java APIs provide an extensive set of library routines. These APIs evolved into the &quot;Standard Edition&quot; (Java SE), which provides basic infrastructure and GUI functionality; the &quot;Enterprise Edition&quot; (Java EE), aimed at large software companies implementing enterprise-class application servers; and the &quot;Micro Edition&quot; (Java ME), used to build software for devices with limited resources, such as mobile devices.

On November 13, 2006, Sun announced it would be licensing its Java implementation under the GNU General Public License; it released its Java compiler and JVM at that time.

In February 2009, Sun entered a battle with Microsoft and Adobe Systems, which promoted rival platforms to build software applications for the Internet. JavaFX was a development platform for music, video and other applications that builds on the Java programming language.

===Office suite===
In 1999, Sun acquired the German software company Star Division and with it the office suite StarOffice, which Sun later released as OpenOffice.org under both GNU LGPL and the SISSL (Sun Industry Standards Source License). OpenOffice.org supported Microsoft Office file formats (though not perfectly), was available on many platforms (primarily Linux, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Solaris) and was used in the open source community.

The principal differences between StarOffice and OpenOffice.org were that StarOffice was supported by Sun, was available as either a single-user retail box kit or as per-user blocks of licensing for the enterprise, and included a wider range of fonts and document templates and a commercial quality spellchecker. StarOffice also contained commercially licensed functions and add-ons; in OpenOffice.org these were either replaced by open-source or free variants, or are not present at all. Both packages had native support for the OpenDocument format.

Derivatives of OpenOffice.org continue to be developed, these are LibreOffice, Collabora Online and Apache OpenOffice.

===Virtualization and datacenter automation software===

In 2007, Sun announced the Sun xVM virtualization and datacenter automation product suite for commodity hardware. Sun also acquired VirtualBox in 2008. Earlier virtualization technologies from Sun like &quot;Dynamic System Domains&quot; and &quot;Dynamic Reconfiguration&quot; were specifically designed for high-end SPARC servers, and Logical Domains only supports the UltraSPARC T1/T2/T2 Plus server platforms. Sun marketed &quot;Sun Ops Center&quot; provisioning software for datacenter automation.

On the client side, Sun offered virtual desktop solutions. Desktop environments and applications could be hosted in a datacenter, with users accessing these environments from a wide range of client devices, including Microsoft Windows PCs, Sun Ray virtual display clients, Apple Macintoshes, PDAs or any combination of supported devices. A variety of networks were supported, from LAN to WAN or the public Internet. Virtual desktop products included Sun Ray Server Software, Sun Secure Global Desktop and Sun Virtual Desktop Infrastructure.

===Database management systems===
Sun acquired MySQL AB, the developer of the MySQL database in 2008 for US$1 billion. CEO Jonathan Schwartz mentioned in his blog that optimizing the performance of MySQL was one of the priorities of the acquisition. In February 2008, Sun began to publish results of the MySQL performance optimization work. Sun contributed to the PostgreSQL project. On the Java platform, Sun contributed to and supported Java DB.

===Other software===
Sun offered other software products for software development and infrastructure services. Many were developed in house; others came from acquisitions, including Tarantella, Waveset Technologies, SeeBeyond, and Vaau. Sun acquired many of the Netscape non-browser software products as part a deal involving Netscape&#x27;s merger with AOL. These software products were initially offered under the &quot;iPlanet&quot; brand; once the Sun-Netscape alliance ended, they were re-branded as &quot;Sun ONE&quot; (Sun Open Network Environment), and then the &quot;Sun Java System&quot;.

Sun&#x27;s middleware product was branded as the &quot;Java Enterprise System&quot; (or JES), and marketed for web and application serving, communication, calendaring, directory, identity management and service-oriented architecture. Sun&#x27;s Open ESB and other software suites were available free of charge on systems running Solaris, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, HP-UX, and Windows, with support available optionally.

Sun developed data center management software products, which included the &quot;Solaris Cluster&quot; high availability software, and a grid management package called &quot;Sun Grid Engine&quot; and firewall software such as SunScreen.
For Network Equipment Providers and telecommunications customers, Sun developed the Sun Netra High-Availability Suite.

Sun produced compilers and development tools under the &quot;Sun Studio&quot; brand, for building and developing Solaris and Linux applications.
Sun entered the software as a service (SaaS) market with zembly, a social cloud-based computing platform and Project Kenai, an open-source project hosting service.

==Storage==
Sun sold its own storage systems to complement its system offerings; it has also made several storage-related acquisitions.
On June 2, 2005, Sun announced it would purchase Storage Technology Corporation (StorageTek) for US$4.1 billion in cash, or $37.00 per share, a deal completed in August 2005.

In 2006, Sun introduced the Sun StorageTek 5800 System, the first application-aware programmable storage solution. In 2008, Sun contributed the source code of the StorageTek 5800 System under the BSD license.

Sun announced the Sun Open Storage platform in 2008 built with open source technologies.
In late 2008 Sun announced the Sun Storage 7000 Unified Storage systems (codenamed Amber Road). Transparent placement of data in the systems&#x27; solid-state drives (SSD) and conventional hard drives was managed by ZFS to take advantage of the speed of SSDs and the economy of conventional hard disks.

Other storage products included Sun Fire X4500 storage server and SAM-QFS filesystem and storage management software.

==High-performance computing==
Sun marketed the Sun Constellation System for high-performance computing (HPC). Even before the introduction of the Sun Constellation System in 2007, Sun&#x27;s products were in use in many of the TOP500 systems and supercomputing centers:
* Lustre was used by seven of the top 10 supercomputers in 2008, as well as other industries that need high-performance storage: six major oil companies (including BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil), chip-design (including Synopsys and Sony), and the movie-industry (including Harry Potter and Spider-Man).
* Sun Fire X4500 was used by high-energy physics supercomputers to run dCache
* Sun Grid Engine was a popular workload scheduler for clusters and computer farms
* Sun Visualization System allowed users of the TeraGrid to remotely access the 3D rendering capabilities of the &quot;Maverick&quot; system at the University of Texas at Austin
* Sun Modular Datacenter (Project Blackbox) was two Sun MD S20 units used by the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center

The &quot;Sun HPC ClusterTools&quot; product was a set of Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries and tools for running parallel jobs on Solaris HPC clusters. Beginning with version 7.0, Sun switched from its own implementation of MPI to Open MPI, and donated engineering resources to the Open MPI project.

Sun was a participant in the OpenMP language committee. Sun Studio compilers and tools implemented the OpenMP specification for shared memory parallelization.

In 2006, Sun built the &quot;TSUBAME supercomputer&quot;, which was until June 2008 the fastest supercomputer in Asia. Sun built &quot;Ranger&quot; at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) in 2007. Ranger had a peak performance of over 500 TFLOPS, and was the sixth-most-powerful supercomputer on the TOP500 list in November 2008.
Sun announced an OpenSolaris distribution that integrated Sun&#x27;s HPC products with others.

==Staff==

Notable Sun employees included John Gilmore, Whitfield Diffie, Radia Perlman, Ivan Sutherland, Marc Tremblay, and Satya Nadella. Sun was an early advocate of Unix-based networked computing, promoting TCP/IP and especially NFS, as reflected in the company&#x27;s motto The Network is the Computer, coined by John Gage. James Gosling led the team which developed the Java programming language. Jon Bosak led the creation of the XML specification at W3C.

In 2005, Sun Microsystems was one of the first Fortune 500 companies that instituted a formal social media program. Sun staff published articles on the company&#x27;s blog site. Staff were encouraged to use the site to blog on any aspect of their work or personal life, with few restrictions placed on staff, other than commercially confidential material. Jonathan I. Schwartz was one of the first CEOs of large companies to regularly blog; his postings were frequently quoted and analyzed in the press.

== Acquisition by Oracle ==
On September 3, 2009, the European Commission opened an in-depth investigation into the proposed takeover of Sun Microsystems by Oracle. On November 9, 2009, the Commission issued a statement of objections relating to the acquisition. Finally, on January 21, 2010, the European Commission approved Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of Sun. The Commission&#x27;s investigation showed that another open database, PostgreSQL, was considered by many users of this type of software as a credible alternative to MySQL and could to some extent replace the competitive strength that the latter currently represents in the database market.

Sun was sold to Oracle Corporation in 2009 for $5.6 billion.

Sun&#x27;s staff were asked to share anecdotes about their experiences at Sun. A website containing videos, stories, and photographs from 27 years at Sun was made available on September 2, 2009.

In October, Sun announced a second round of thousands of employees to be laid off, blamed partially on delays in approval of the merger.

The transaction was completed in early 2010.

In January 2011, Oracle agreed to pay $46 million to settle charges that it submitted false claims to US federal government agencies and paid &quot;kickbacks&quot; to systems integrators.
In February 2011, Sun&#x27;s former Menlo Park, California, campus of about was sold, and it was announced that it would become headquarters for Facebook.
The sprawling facility built around an enclosed courtyard had been nicknamed &quot;Sun Quentin&quot;. The campus is now the headquarters of Facebook&#x27;s parent company Meta Platforms.

On September 1, 2011, Sun India legally became part of Oracle. It had been delayed due to legal issues in Indian court.
