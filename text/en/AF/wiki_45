<text>Rotterdam ( , ; ; ) is the second-largest city in the Netherlands after the national capital of Amsterdam. It is in the province of South Holland, part of the North Sea mouth of the Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta, via the &quot;New Meuse&quot; inland shipping channel, dug to connect to the Meuse at first and now to the Rhine.

Rotterdam&#x27;s history goes back to 1270, when a dam was constructed in the Rotte. In 1340, Rotterdam was granted city rights by William IV, Count of Holland. The Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area, with a population of approximately 2.7 million, is the 10th-largest in the European Union and the most populous in the country.

A major logistic and economic centre, Rotterdam is Europe&#x27;s largest seaport. In 2022, Rotterdam had a population of 655,468 and is home to over 180 different nationalities. 

Rotterdam is known for its university, riverside setting, lively cultural life, maritime heritage and modern architecture. The near-complete destruction of the city centre during the World War II German bombing has resulted in a varied architectural landscape, including skyscrapers designed by architects such as Rem Koolhaas, Piet Blom and Ben van Berkel.

The Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt give waterway access into the heart of Western Europe, including the highly industrialized Ruhr. The extensive distribution system including rail, roads, and waterways have earned Rotterdam the nicknames &quot;Gateway to Europe&quot; and &quot;Gateway to the World&quot;.

==History==
===Early history===
The settlement at the lower end of the fen stream &quot;Rotte&quot; (or &quot;Rotta&quot;, as it was then known, from &quot;rot&quot;, &quot;muddy&quot; and &quot;a&quot;, &quot;water&quot;, thus &quot;muddy water&quot;) dates from at least the year 950. Around 1150, large floods in the area ended development, leading to the construction of protective dikes and dams, including &quot;Schielands Hoge Zeedijk&quot; (&quot;Schieland&#x27;s High Sea Dike&quot;) along the northern banks of the present-day Nieuwe Maas river. A dam on the Rotte was built in the 1260s and was located at the present-day &quot;Hoogstraat&quot; (&quot;High Street&quot;).

On 7 July 1340, Count Willem IV of Holland granted city rights to Rotterdam, which then had a population of only a few thousand. Around the year 1350, a shipping canal (the &quot;Rotterdamse Schie&quot;) was completed, which provided Rotterdam access to the larger towns in the north, allowing it to become a local trans-shipment centre between the Netherlands, England and Germany, and to urbanize.

Beginning in the 1600&#x27;s, Rotterdam was involved in the Atlantic slave trade. According to historian Gerhard de Kok, &quot;Rotterdam merchants were the pioneers of the Dutch slave trade&quot;. From the 17th century until 1814, when the United Netherlands abolished the Netherland&#x27;s involvement in the slave trade at the request of the British government, Dutch slave ships from Rotterdam sailed to Africa and the Americas as part of the triangular trade. Rotterdam merchants also sold significant quantities of gunpowder to Zeeland-based slave ships.


The port of Rotterdam grew slowly but steadily into a port of importance, becoming the seat of one of the six &quot;chambers&quot; of the &quot;Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie&quot; (VOC), the Dutch East India Company and one of the five &quot;chambers&quot; of the &quot; West-Indische Compagnie&quot; (WIC), the Dutch West India Company.

The greatest spurt of growth, both in port activity and population, followed the completion of the Nieuwe Waterweg in 1872. The city and harbour started to expand on the south bank of the river. The &quot;Witte Huis&quot; or &quot;White House&quot; skyscraper, inspired by American office buildings and built in 1898 in the French Art Nouveau style, is evidence of Rotterdam&#x27;s rapid growth and success. When completed, it was the tallest office building in Europe, with a height of .

===20th century===

During World War I, the city was the world&#x27;s largest spy centre because of Dutch neutrality and its strategic location between Britain, Germany and German-occupied Belgium. Many spies who were arrested and executed in Britain were led by German secret agents operating from Rotterdam. MI6 had its main European office on de Boompjes. From there the British coordinated espionage in Germany and occupied Belgium. During World War I, an average of 25,000 Belgian refugees lived in the city, as well as hundreds of German deserters and escaped Allied prisoners of war.

During World War II, the German army invaded the Netherlands on 10 May 1940. Adolf Hitler had hoped to conquer the country in just one day, but his forces met unexpectedly fierce resistance. The Dutch army was forced to capitulate on 15 May 1940, following the bombing of Rotterdam on 14 May and the threat of bombing other Dutch cities. The heart of Rotterdam was almost completely destroyed by the Luftwaffe. Some 80,000 civilians were made homeless and 900 were killed; a relatively low number since many had fled the city because of the warfare and bombing going on in Rotterdam since the start of the invasion three days earlier. The City Hall survived the bombing. Ossip Zadkine later attempted to capture the event with his statue &quot;De Verwoeste Stad&quot; (&#x27;The Destroyed City&#x27;). The statue stands near the Leuvehaven, not far from the Erasmusbrug in the centre of the city, on the north shore of the river Nieuwe Maas. In 1941, 11,000 Jews still lived in Rotterdam. Before the war there were 13,000. Between 30 July 1942, and 22 April 1943, 6,790 people were deported in 8 transports via Loods 24. The vast majority of the Jews who were deported via Loods 24 were murdered in Sobibór and Auschwitz-Birkenau. Research in 2000 showed that 144 people survived the deportations. In 2013 the was unveiled.

In January 1948, Queen Wilhelmina presented the motto &#x27;Sterker door strijd&#x27; (Stronger through effort) as part of the coat of arms of Rotterdam to the city government:

&quot;...as a reminder also for posterity of the courage and strength with which the people of Rotterdam bore all the trials of the war and the important part they took in the liberation of the fatherland...&quot;
—Wilhelmina of the Netherlands

Rotterdam was gradually rebuilt from the 1950s through to the 1970s. Because the city centre was largely destroyed, new spatial infrastructure could be built, making it an open and modern city. In 1953 the Lijnbaan was opened, the first car-free shopping street in Europe. The progressive design attracted a lot of international attention, in which film and television played an important role. The new Central Station was completed in 1957, with the Groothandelsgebouw from 1953 next to it. The Euromast was erected in 1960 on the occasion of the Floriade.
From the 1980s onwards the city councils began developing an active architectural policy. The harbours were moving westwards and the old environment had to be reshaped. Daring and new styles of apartments, office buildings and recreation facilities resulted in a more &#x27;livable&#x27; city centre with a new skyline. In the 1990s, the Kop van Zuid was built on the south bank of the river as a new business centre. Rotterdam was voted 2015 European City of the Year by the Academy of Urbanism. A profile of Rem Koolhaas in &quot;The Guardian&quot; begins &quot;If you put the last 50 years of architecture in a blender, and spat it out in building-sized chunks across the skyline, you would probably end up with something that looked a bit like Rotterdam&quot;.

==Geography==
Rotterdam is divided into a northern and a southern part by the river Nieuwe Maas, connected by (from west to east): the Beneluxtunnel; the Maastunnel; the Erasmusbrug; a subway tunnel; the Willemsspoortunnel (&#x27;Willems railway tunnel&#x27;); the Willemsbrug (&#x27;Willems Bridge&#x27;) together with the Koninginnebrug (&#x27;Queen&#x27;s Bridge&#x27;); and the Van Brienenoordbrug (&#x27;Van Brienenoord Bridge&#x27;). The former railway lift bridge De Hef (&#x27;the Lift&#x27;) is preserved as a Rijksmonument (national heritage site) in lifted position between the Noordereiland (&#x27;North Island&#x27;) and the south of Rotterdam.

The city centre is located on the northern bank of the Nieuwe Maas, although recent urban development has extended the centre to parts of southern Rotterdam known as Kop van Zuid (&#x27;the Head of South&#x27;, i.e. the northern part of southern Rotterdam). From its inland core, Rotterdam reaches the North Sea by a swathe of predominantly harbour area.

Built mostly behind dikes, large parts of Rotterdam are below sea level. For instance, the Prins Alexander Polder in the northeast of Rotterdam extends below sea level, or rather below Normaal Amsterdams Peil (NAP) or &#x27;Amsterdam Ordnance Datum&#x27;. The lowest point in the Netherlands ( below NAP) is situated just to the east of Rotterdam, in the municipality of Nieuwerkerk aan den IJssel.
The Rotte river no longer joins the Nieuwe Maas directly. Since the early 1980s, when the construction of Rotterdam&#x27;s second underground line interfered with the Rotte&#x27;s course, its waters have been pumped through a pipe into the Nieuwe Maas via the Boerengat. 

Between the summers of 2003 and 2008, an artificial beach was created at the Boompjeskade along the Nieuwe Maas, between the Erasmus Bridge and the Willems Bridge. Swimming was not possible, digging pits was limited to the height of the layer of sand, about . Alternatively, people go to the beach of Hook of Holland (which is a Rotterdam district) or one of the beaches in Zeeland: Renesse or the Zuid Hollandse Eilanden: Ouddorp, Oostvoorne.

Rotterdam forms the centre of the Rijnmond conurbation, bordering the conurbation surrounding The Hague to the north-west. The two conurbations are close enough to be a single conurbation. They share the Rotterdam The Hague Airport and a light rail system called RandstadRail. Consideration is being given to creating an official Metropolitan region Rotterdam The Hague (&quot;Metropoolregio Rotterdam Den Haag&quot;), which would have a combined population approaching 2.5 million.

In its turn, the Rijnmond conurbation is part of the southern wing (the Zuidvleugel) of the Randstad, which is one of the most important economic and densely populated areas in the north-west of Europe. Having a population of 7.1 million, the Randstad is the sixth-largest urban area in Europe (after Moscow, London, Paris, Istanbul, and the Rhein-Ruhr Area). The Zuidvleugel, situated in the province of South Holland, has a population of around 3 million.

===Climate===
Rotterdam experiences a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) similar to all of the coastal areas in the Netherlands. Located near to the coast, its climate is slightly milder than locations further inland. Winters are cool with frequent cold days, while the summers are mild to warm, with occasional hot temperatures. Temperature rises above 30 °C on average 4 days each summer, while (night) temperatures can drop below −5 °C during winter for short periods of time, mostly during periods of sustained easterly (continental) winds. Precipitation is generally moderate throughout the year, although spring and summer (particularly before August) are relatively drier and sunnier, while autumn and winter are cloudier with more frequent rain (or snow). The following climate data is from the airport, which is slightly cooler than the city, being surrounded by water canals which make the climate milder and with a higher relative humidity. The city has an urban heat island, especially inside the city centre.
==Demographics==


Rotterdam is diverse, with the demographics differing by neighbourhood. The city centre has a disproportionately high number of single people when compared to other cities, with 70% of the population between the ages of 20 and 40 identifying as single. Those with higher education and higher income live disproportionately in the city centre, as do foreign-born citizens.

===Composition===

The municipality of Rotterdam is part of the Rotterdam–The Hague metropolitan area which, as of 2015, covers an area of 1,130 km2, of which 990 km km2 is land, and has a population of approximately 2,563,197. As of 2019, the municipality itself occupies an area of 325.79 km2, 208.80 km2 of which is land, and is home to 638,751 inhabitants. Its population peaked at 731,564 in 1965, but the dual processes of suburbanization and counterurbanization saw this number steadily decline over the next 2 decades, reaching 560,000 by 1985. Although Rotterdam has experienced population growth since then, it has done so at a slower pace than comparable cities in the Netherlands, like Amsterdam, The Hague and Utrecht.

Rotterdam consists of 14 submunicipalities: Centrum, Charlois (including Heijplaat), Delfshaven, Feijenoord, Hillegersberg-Schiebroek, Hook of Holland, Hoogvliet, IJsselmonde, Kralingen-Crooswijk, Noord, Overschie, Pernis, and Prins Alexander (the most populous submunicipality with around 85,000 inhabitants). One other area, Rozenburg, does have an official submunicipality status since 18 March 2010. Since the status of a submunicipality was lifted on 19 March 2014, it became an integral part of the municipality of Rotterdam.

The size of the municipality of Rotterdam is the result of the amalgamation of the following former municipalities, some of which were a submunicipality prior to 19 March 2014:

*Delfshaven (added on 30 January 1886)
*Charlois (added on 28 February 1895)
*Kralingen (added on 28 February 1895)
*Hoogvliet (added on 1 May 1934)
*Pernis (added on 1 May 1934)
*Hillegersberg (added on 1 August 1941)
*IJsselmonde (added on 1 August 1941)
*Overschie (added on 1 August 1941)
*Schiebroek (added on 1 August 1941)
*Rozenburg (added on 18 March 2010)

===Origin background makeup===
In the Netherlands, Rotterdam has the highest percentage of residents with a recent migration background from non-industrialised nations. They form a large part of Rotterdam&#x27;s multi-ethnic and multicultural diversity. 52.9% of the population have at least one parent born outside the country. There are 80,000 Muslims, constituting 13% of the population in 2010. The former mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb (2009-2024), is of Moroccan descent and is a practicing Muslim. The city is home to the largest Dutch Antillean community in the Netherlands. The city also has its own China Town at the West-Kruiskade, close to Rotterdam Centraal.

===Religion===

Christianity is the largest religion in Rotterdam, with 36.3% of the population identifying. The second and third largest religions are Islam (13.1%) and Hinduism (3.3%), while about half of the population has no religious affiliation.

Since 1795 Rotterdam has hosted the chief congregation of the liberal Protestant brotherhood of Remonstrants. From 1955 it has been the seat of the Catholic bishop of Rotterdam when the Rotterdam diocese was split from the Haarlem diocese. Since 2010 the city is home to the largest mosque in the Netherlands, the (capacity 1,500).

==Politics==

The municipal council consists of 45 members, the largest party is Livable Rotterdam. The municipal executive consists of mayor Carola Schouten and nine elderman, belonging to four parties.

==Economy==
Rotterdam has always been one of the main centres of the shipping industry in the Netherlands. From the Rotterdam Chamber of the VOC, the world&#x27;s first multinational, established in 1602, to the merchant shipping leader Royal Nedlloyd established in 1970, with its corporate headquarters located in the landmark building the &#x27;Willemswerf&#x27; in 1988. In 1997, Nedlloyd merged with the British shipping industry leader P&amp;O forming the third largest merchant shipping company in the world. The Anglo-Dutch P&amp;O Nedlloyd was bought by the Danish giant corporation &#x27;AP Moller Maersk&#x27; in 2005 and its Dutch operations are still headquartered in the &#x27;Willemswerf&#x27;. Nowadays, well-known companies with headquarters in Rotterdam are consumer goods company Unilever (since 2020 London), asset management firm Robeco, energy company Eneco, dredging company Van Oord, oil company Royal Dutch Shell (since 2021 London), terminal operator Vopak, commodity trading company Vitol and architecture firms MVRDV and Office for Metropolitan Architecture.

It is also home to the regional headquarters of chemical company LyondellBasell, commodities trading company Glencore, pharmaceutical company Pfizer, logistics companies Stolt-Nielsen, electrical equipment company ABB and consumer goods company Procter &amp; Gamble. Furthermore, Rotterdam has the Dutch headquarters of Allianz, Maersk, Petrobras, Samskip, Louis Dreyfus Group, and Aon. The City of Rotterdam makes use of the services of semi-government companies Roteb (to take care of sanitation, waste management and assorted services) and the Port of Rotterdam Authority (to maintain the Port of Rotterdam). Both these companies were once municipal bodies; now they are autonomous entities, owned by the city.

Being the largest port and one of the largest cities of the country, Rotterdam attracts many people seeking jobs, especially in the cheap labour segment. The city&#x27;s unemployment rate is 12%, almost twice the national average. Rotterdam is the largest port in Europe, with the rivers Maas and Rhine providing excellent access to the hinterland upstream reaching to Basel, Switzerland and into France. In 2004 Shanghai took over as the world&#x27;s busiest container port. In 2006, Rotterdam was the world&#x27;s seventh largest container port in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) handled. The port&#x27;s main activities are petrochemical industries and general cargo handling and transshipment. The harbour functions as an important transit point for bulk materials between the European continent and overseas. From Rotterdam, goods are transported by ship, river barge, train or road. In 2007, the &quot;Betuweroute&quot;, a new fast freight railway from Rotterdam to Germany, was completed.

Well-known streets in Rotterdam are the Lijnbaan (the first set of pedestrian streets of the country, opened in 1953), the Hoogstraat, the Coolsingel with the city hall, which was renovated between 2018 and 2021 giving cyclists and pedestrians more space, meaning that car traffic was reduced from 4 lanes (2 in each direction) to 2 lanes (1 in each direction). Another mainstreet is the Weena, which runs from the Central Station to the Hofplein (square). A modern shopping venue is the Beurstraverse (&quot;Stock Exchange Traverse&quot;), better known by its informal name &#x27;Koopgoot&#x27; (&#x27;Buying/Shopping Gutter&#x27;, after its subterranean position), which crosses the Coolsingel below street level. The Kruiskade is a more upscale shopping street, with retailers like Michael Kors, 7 For All Mankind, Calvin Klein, Hugo Boss, Tommy Hilfiger and the Dutch well-known men&#x27;s clothier Oger. Another upscale shopping venue is a flagship store of department store De Bijenkorf. Located a little more to the east is the Markthal, with lots of small retailers inside. This hall is also one of Rotterdam&#x27;s famous architectural landmarks. The main shopping venue in the south of Rotterdam is Zuidplein, which lies close to Rotterdam Ahoy, an accommodation centre for shows, exhibitions, sporting events, concerts and congresses. Another prominent shopping centre called Alexandrium lies in the east of Rotterdam. It includes a large kitchen and furniture centre.

==Education==

Rotterdam has one major university, the Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR), named after one of the city&#x27;s famous former inhabitants, Desiderius Erasmus. The Woudestein campus houses (among others) Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University. In Financial Times&#x27; 2005 rankings it placed 29th globally and 7th in Europe. In the 2009 rankings of Masters of Management, the school reached first place with the CEMS Master in Management and the tenth place with its RSM Master in Management. The university is also home to Europe&#x27;s largest student association, STAR Study Association Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University and the world&#x27;s largest student association, AIESEC, has its international office in the city.

The Willem de Kooning Academy is Rotterdam&#x27;s main art school, which is part of the Hogeschool Rotterdam. It is regarded as one of the most prestigious art schools in the Netherlands and the number 1 in Advertising and Copywriting. Part of the Willem de Kooning Academy is the Piet Zwart Institute for postgraduate studies and research in Fine Art, Media Design and Retail Design. The Piet Zwart Institute boasts a selective roster of emerging international artists.

The Hoboken campus of EUR houses the Dijkzigt (general) hospital, the Sophia Hospital (for children), Daniel den Hoed clinic (cancer institute) and the medical department of the university. They are known collectively as the Erasmus Medical Center. This center is ranked third in Europe by CSIC as a hospital, and is also ranked within top 50 universities of the world in the field of medicine (clinical, pre-clinical &amp; health, 2017).

Three &quot;Hogescholen&quot; (Universities of applied sciences) exist in Rotterdam. These schools award their students a professional Bachelor&#x27;s degree and postgraduate or Master&#x27;s degree. The three &quot;Hogescholen&quot; are Hogeschool Rotterdam, Hogeschool Inholland and Codarts University for the Arts (Codarts hogeschool voor de kunsten), a vocational university that teaches music, dance and circus.

Unique to the city is the Shipping &amp; Transport College which offers masters, bachelors and vocational diplomas on all levels.

==Culture==

Once primarily a city of labour, for its harbour and related industries, Rotterdam has now developed into a city of culture too, with various museums, cultural centres and activities, offering a stage for architecture, music, visuals arts, poetry, cinema, theatre, and culture more generally, with a range of festivals and other events, and a buzzing nightlife. The city has its own orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, with its well-regarded young music director Lahav Shani, which plays at the congress and concert building &quot;De Doelen&quot;. The Ahoy complex in the south of the city is used for pop concerts, exhibitions, tennis tournaments and other activities. There are also several theatres and cinemas, including LantarenVenster and Cinerama. 

Alongside Porto, Rotterdam was European Capital of Culture in 2001.

=== Museums, libraries and archives ===
Rotterdam has various cultural institutions. Well-known museums are the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Wereldmuseum, the Kunsthal, Kunstinstituut Melly and the Maritime Museum Rotterdam. The Historical Museum Rotterdam has changed into Museum Rotterdam, which aims to exhibit the development of Rotterdam as a contemporary transnational city, and not merely the city&#x27;s past. Other museums include the Tax &amp; Customs Museum, the Netherlands Marine Corps Museum, Rotterdam Public Transport Museum and the Natural History Museum. The FENIX Museum of Migration is scheduled to open in 2025.

The first municipal library of Rotterdam was founded in 1604. The current Bibliotheek Rotterdam (Public library), was established in 1869, and is currently the largest cultural organization in Rotterdam, with fifteen branches across the city. 

The Rotterdam City Archives (&quot;Stadsarchief Rotterdam&quot;) was established in 1857. Here one can find administrative records and sources about the city&#x27;s historical development. The archival holdings include, among other, general archives, notarial deeds, an audiovisual collection, and a library.

=== Popular music, film, festivals ===
Rotterdam has a long tradition of popular music, including the city&#x27;s Jazz scene before and after WWII. A major historical moment in the city&#x27;s music history is the legendary Kralingen Pop Festival, which took place in Rotterdam in 1970 (featuring, among other, Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane, The Byrds, Canned Heat, It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day, and Santana). The festival was also made into a film, &quot;Stamping Ground&quot; (dir. George Sluizer). Alternative (music) culture became prominently present in the city in these days. From the 1960s until the 2000s, Rotterdam had a thriving squatters movement, which not only accommodated thousands of people, but also created social centres and cultural venues. From this movement came clubs like Boogjes, Eksit, Nighttown, Vlerk and Waterfront. A major reference is Poortgebouw, which was squatted in 1980 and quickly legalised. 

Rotterdam also became the home of Gabber, a type of hardcore electronic music popular in the mid-1990s, with hard beats and samples. Groups like Neophyte and Rotterdam Terror Corps (RTC) started in Rotterdam, playing at clubs like Parkzicht. In the years 2005–2011, the city struggled with keeping venues for pop music; many of them suffered severe financial problems. This resulted in the disappearance of the major music venues Nighttown and WATT and smaller stages such as Waterfront, Exit, and Heidegger. The city today has a few stages for pop music, like Rotown, Poortgebouw and Annabel. Additionally, the venue WORM focuses on experimental music, as well as various other cultural activities. 

WORM also screens films and hosts a film lab, &quot;Filmwerkplaats&quot;. In fact, Rotterdam has an extensive film history, ranging from avant-garde classics, such as The Bridge (Ivens, 1928), to internationally acclaimed documentaries from the post-war era, such as Steady! (Van der Horst, 1952), and all kinds of fiction films. Of major importance within this context has also been the International Film Festival Rotterdam (IFFR), an annual event that lasts more than ten days (end of January, beginning of February), which has been organized since 1972. Besides the IFFR, several smaller film festivals take place in Rotterdam too, such as the Architecture Film Festival Rotterdam (AFFR). 

Throughout the year, many different festivals take place in Rotterdam. There are the summer festivals celebrating the city&#x27;s multicultural population and identity, such as the Caribbean-inspired &quot;Summer Carnival&quot;, the Dance Parade, Rotterdam 666, and the Metropolis pop festival. There are also Poetry International (in June), the North Sea Jazz Festival (in July), the Valery Gergiev Festival (in September), and, also in September, the festival &#x27;September in Rotterdam&#x27;, the festival &#x27;World of the Witte de With Quaret&#x27;, and the World Port Days. 

=== Eurovision Song Contest ===

On 30 August 2019, it was announced by the European Broadcasting Union and Dutch television broadcasters AVROTROS, NOS and NPO, that Rotterdam would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2020, following the Dutch victory at the contest in Tel Aviv, Israel with the song &quot;Arcade&quot;, performed by Duncan Laurence. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, the 2020 contest was cancelled, and Rotterdam was later retained as host of the contest. The contest took place at Rotterdam Ahoy, with the semi-finals taking place on 18 and 20 May 2021, and the final taking place on 22 May 2021. This was the first time that Rotterdam hosted the contest, and the first time that the Netherlands hosted the contest since , when it was held in The Hague.

=== Rivalry ===
There is a healthy competition with Amsterdam, which is often viewed as the cultural capital of the Netherlands. This rivalry is most common amongst the city&#x27;s football supporters, Feyenoord (Rotterdam) and Ajax (Amsterdam). There is a saying: &quot;Amsterdam to party, Den Haag (The Hague) to live, Rotterdam to work&quot;. Another one, more popular by Rotterdammers, is &quot;Money is earned in Rotterdam, distributed in The Hague and spent in Amsterdam&quot;. Another saying that reflects both the rivalry between Rotterdam and Amsterdam is &quot;Amsterdam has it, Rotterdam doesn&#x27;t need it&quot;. Bright magazine editor Erwin van der Zande notes that this phrase is on T-shirts in Rotterdam.

== Architecture ==
Rotterdam has become world famous because of its modern and groundbreaking architecture. Throughout the years the city has been nicknamed &quot;Manhattan at the Meuse&quot; and &quot;The architectural capital of the Netherlands&quot; both for its skyline and because it is home to internationally leading architectural firms involved in the design of famous buildings and bridges in other big cities. Examples include OMA (Rem Koolhaas), MVRDV, Neutelings &amp; Riedijk and Erick van Egeraat. It has the reputation in being a platform for architectural development and education through the NAi (Netherlands Architecture Institute), which is open to the public and has a variety of exhibitions on architecture and urban planning issues and prior the Berlage Institute, a postgraduate laboratory of architecture. The city has 38 skyscrapers and 352 high-rises and has many skyscrapers planned or under construction. The top 5 of highest buildings in the Netherlands consists entirely of buildings in Rotterdam. It is home to the two tallest buildings in the Netherlands, the Maastoren with a height of 165 meters and the Zalmhaven Tower (completed in 2021) with a height of 215 meters.

===History===
In 1898, the high-rise office building the White House (in Dutch Witte Huis) was completed, at that time the tallest office building in Europe.
In the first decades of the 20th century, some influential architecture in the modern style was built in Rotterdam. Notable are the Van Nelle fabriek (1929) a monument of modern factory design by Brinkman and Van der Vlugt, the Jugendstil clubhouse of the Royal Maas Yacht Club designed by Hooijkaas jr. en Brinkman (1909), and Feyenoord&#x27;s football stadium De Kuip (1936) also by Brinkman and Van der Vlugt. The architect J. J. P. Oud was a famous Rotterdammer in those days. The Van Nelle Factory obtained the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2014.
During the early stages of World War II the centre of Rotterdam was bombed by the German Luftwaffe, destroying many of the older buildings in the centre of the city. After an initial crisis re-construction, the centre of Rotterdam has become the site of the ambitious new architecture.


Rotterdam is also famous for its Lijnbaan 1952 by architects Broek en Bakema, Peperklip by architect Carel Weeber, Kubuswoningen or cube houses designed by architect Piet Blom 1984.

The newest landmark in Rotterdam is the Markthal, designed by architect firm MVRDV. In addition to that, there are many international well-known architects based in Rotterdam like O.M.A (Rem Koolhaas), Neutelings &amp; Riedijk and Erick van Egeraat to name a few. Two architectural landmarks are located in the Lloydkwartier: the STC college building and the Schiecentrale 4b. The construction of the Depot of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen was started in 2003 and was officially opened by king Willem-Alexander on 5 November 2021. It is the world&#x27;s first fully accessible art depot.

Rotterdam also houses several of the tallest structures in the Netherlands.
*The Erasmusbrug (1996) is a 790-meter (2,600 ft) cable-stayed bridge linking the north and south of Rotterdam. It is held up by a tall pylon with a characteristic bend, earning the bridge its nickname &#x27;De Zwaan&#x27; (&#x27;the Swan&#x27;).
*Rotterdam has the tallest residential building in the Netherlands: the De Zalmhaven Tower ().
*Rotterdam is also home to the tallest office building &#x27;Maastoren&#x27; () which houses Deloitte. This office tower surpassed the &#x27;Delftse Poort&#x27; () which houses Nationale-Nederlanden insurance company, part of ING Group as tallest office tower in 2009.

===Parks===
Within Rotterdam&#x27;s urban structure, parks and greenery play an important role. A number of well-known parks in Rotterdam are:
*&quot;Het Park&quot; (Het Park bij de Euromast), is a 70 acres park on the Maas, south of the Westzeedijk, at the Euromast. The eastern half of the park was constructed between 1852 and 1863 to a design by the firm Jan David Zocher. The western part was added in 1866 with some modifications.

The municipality of Rotterdam is encouraging the construction of green roofs. There is an attractive subsidy for roof owners and the city has now provided a number of municipal buildings with a green roof. As of 1 January 2020, the water storage capacity requirement has been increased to 30 liters of water storage capacity per square metre. This reduces the burden on the sewer system during heavy rainfall and reduces the risk of flooding on the street.
*The city&#x27;s largest green roof is located on top of the Groothandelsgebouw next to Central Station.
*The &quot;Dakakker&quot; is the largest roof farm in Europe on top of the Schieblok.

<text>Ringworld is a 1970 science fiction novel by Larry Niven, set in his Known Space universe and considered a classic of science fiction literature. &quot;Ringworld&quot; tells the story of Louis Wu and his companions on a mission to the Ringworld, an enormous rotating ring, an alien construct in space in diameter. Niven later wrote three sequel novels and then cowrote, with Edward M. Lerner, four prequels and a final sequel; the five latter novels constitute the &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot; series. All the novels in the &quot;Ringworld&quot; series tie into numerous other books set in Known Space. &quot;Ringworld&quot; won the Nebula Award in 1970, as well as both the Hugo Award and Locus Award in 1971.

==Plot summary==
On Earth in 2850 AD, a bored Louis Wu is celebrating his 200th birthday. Despite his age, Louis is in perfect physical condition due to the longevity drug boosterspice. Nessus, a Pierson&#x27;s puppeteer, offers him a mysterious job. Intrigued, Louis accepts. Nessus also recruits the Kzin Speaker-to-Animals and Teela Brown, a young human woman who becomes Louis&#x27;s lover, for the rest of the ship&#x27;s crew.

On the puppeteer home world (which is fleeing deadly radiation that will arrive in 20,000 years), they are told that their goal is to determine if the Ringworld, a gigantic artificial ring near the puppeteers&#x27; path, poses any threat to their migration. The Ringworld is about one million miles (1.6 million km) wide and approximately the diameter of Earth&#x27;s orbit, encircling a sunlike star. It rotates to provide artificial gravity 99% as strong as Earth&#x27;s from centrifugal force. It has a habitable inner surface (equivalent in area to approximately three million Earths), a breathable atmosphere, and a temperature optimal for humans. Night is provided by an inner ring of shadow squares which are connected to each other by thin, ultra-strong wire. When the crew completes its mission, as payment they will be given the starship they used to travel to the puppeteer world; it is about 1000 times faster than any human or Kzinti ship.

When they reach the vicinity of the Ringworld, they are unable to contact anyone. Their ship, the &quot;Lying Bastard&quot;, is disabled by an automated meteoroid-defense system. The vessel collides with a strand of shadow-square wire and crash-lands near a huge mountain, which is called &quot;Fist-of-God&quot; by the first natives they speak with. The fusion drive is destroyed, so they set out to find a way to get the &quot;Lying Bastard&quot; off the Ringworld and use the undamaged hyperdrive to return home.

Using their flycycles, they set out for the rim of the ring, searching for technology to help them get home. They encounter primitive human natives who live in the ruins of a once-advanced city. The natives think that Louis is one of the engineers who created the ring, whom they revere as gods. The crew is attacked when Louis accidentally commits what the natives consider a blasphemy, but extricate themselves.

During their journey, Nessus reveals several puppeteer secrets. They initiated research into rendering the Kzinti extinct, considering them dangerous and useless, but found that the numerous Man-Kzin wars—which the Kzinti always lost—had greatly reduced their aggression: a very high percentage of Kzinti males were killed in each conflict, leaving more prudent and cautious survivors to breed. The puppeteers had also used Birthright Lotteries to try to breed humans for luck: all of Teela&#x27;s ancestors for six generations are lottery winners. Speaker&#x27;s outrage at learning the former forces Nessus to flee from the group and then follow from a safe distance.

While flying through a giant storm, Teela becomes separated from the others. When Louis and Speaker search for her, their flycycles are caught by an automated trap designed to catch speeders. They are brought to a floating police station. There, they meet Halrloprillalar Hotrufan (&quot;Prill&quot;), a former crew member of a ship that had brought back goods from worlds abandoned by the Ringworld builders. Nessus, using a tasp (a remote pleasure-giving device), conditions Prill into helping and joining them. When her ship returned to the Ringworld the last time, they discovered that civilization had collapsed. Louis surmises that a mold inadvertently brought back by a ship like Prill&#x27;s mutated and broke down the superconductors vital to the Ringworld civilization, causing its fall.

Teela rejoins them, accompanied by her new lover, a traveling warrior named Seeker who protected her. Based on an insight gained from studying a Ringworld map, Louis comes up with a plan to get home. Teela chooses to remain on the Ringworld with Seeker. Louis, formerly skeptical about breeding for luck, now wonders if the entire mission was caused by Teela&#x27;s luck, to unite her with her true love and help her mature.

The party collects one end of the shadow-square wire that snapped after the collision with their ship and fell near their path, and drag it behind them. Louis threads it through the &quot;Lying Bastard&quot; to tether it to the floating police station. &quot;Fist-of-God&quot;, the enormous mountain near their crash site, was not on the Ringworld map, leading Louis to guess that it is the result of a meteoroid striking the underside of the ring, pushing the ring&#x27;s floor up and finally breaking through. The top of the mountain, above the atmosphere, is therefore just a hole. Louis uses the police station to drag the &quot;Lying Bastard&quot; up and into the hole. Once the ship falls through and clears the ring, they can use its hyperdrive to get home. The book concludes with Louis and Speaker discussing returning to the Ringworld.

==Reception==

Algis Budrys found &quot;Ringworld&quot; to be &quot;excellent and entertaining ... woven together very skillfully and proceed[ing] at a pretty smooth pace.&quot; While praising the novel generally, he faulted Niven for relying on inconsistencies regarding evolution in his extrapolations to support his fictional premises.

Sam Jordison described &quot;Ringworld&quot; as &quot;arguably one of the most influential science fiction novels of the past 50 years.&quot;

==Concepts reused==
In addition to the two aliens, Niven includes a number of concepts from his other Known Space stories:

* The puppeteers&#x27; General Products hulls, which are impervious to any known force except visible light and gravity, and for a long time thought indestructible by anything except antimatter. The &quot;Fleet of Worlds&quot; prequels reveal two other ways that the hulls can be destroyed. 
* The Slaver stasis field, which causes time in the enclosed volume to stand still; since time has for all intents and purposes ceased for an object in stasis, no harm can come to anything within the field.
* The idea that luck is a genetic trait that can be strengthened by selective breeding.
* The tasp, a device that remotely stimulates the pleasure center of the brain; it temporarily incapacitates its target and is extremely psychologically addictive. If the subject cannot, for whatever reason, get access to the device, intense depression can result, often to the point of madness or suicide. To use a tasp on someone from hiding, relieving them of their anger or depression, is called &quot;making their day&quot;.
* Boosterspice, a drug that restores or indefinitely preserves youth.
* Scrith, the metal-like substance of which the &quot;Ringworld&quot; is built (and presumably the shadow squares and wires too), that has a tensile strength nearly equal in magnitude to the strong nuclear force making it similar to the concept of nuclear matter. This makes it an example of unobtainium. This is similar to the Pak Protector&#x27;s &quot;twing&quot; used in other Larry Niven stories.
* Impact armor, a flexible form of clothing that hardens instantly into a rigid form stronger than steel when rapidly deformed, similar to certain types of bulletproof vests.
* The hyperspace shunt, an engine for faster-than-light travel, but slow enough (1 light-year per 3 days, ~122 &quot;c&quot;) to keep the galaxy vast and unknown; the new &quot;quantum II hyperspace shunt&quot;, developed by the Puppeteers but not yet released to humans, can cross a light-year in just 1.25 minutes (~421 000 &quot;c&quot;).
* Point-to-point teleportation at the speed of light is possible with transfer booths (on Earth) and stepping disks (on the Puppeteer homeworld); on Earth, people&#x27;s sense of place and global position has been lost due to instantaneous travel; cities and cultures have blended together.
* A theme well covered in the novel is that of cultures suffering technological breakdowns who then proceed to revert to belief systems along religious lines. Most &quot;Ringworld&quot; societies have forgotten that they live on an artificial structure, and now attribute the phenomena and origin of their world to divine power.

==Errors==

The opening chapter of the original paperback edition of &quot;Ringworld&quot; featured Louis Wu teleporting eastward around the Earth in order to extend his birthday. Moving in this direction would, in fact, make local time later rather than earlier, so that Wu would soon arrive in the early morning of the next calendar day. Niven was &quot;endlessly teased&quot; about this error, which he corrected in subsequent printings to show Wu teleporting westward. In his dedication to &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot;, Niven wrote, &quot;If you own a first paperback edition of &quot;Ringworld&quot;, it&#x27;s the one with the mistakes in it. It&#x27;s worth money.&quot;

After the publication of &quot;Ringworld&quot;, many fans identified numerous engineering problems in the Ringworld as described in the novel. One major one was that the Ringworld, being a rigid structure, was not actually in orbit around the star it encircled and would eventually drift, ultimately colliding with its sun and disintegrating. This led MIT students attending the 1971 Worldcon to chant, &quot;The Ringworld is unstable!&quot; Niven wrote the 1980 sequel &quot;The Ringworld Engineers&quot; in part to address these engineering issues.

The second chapter refers to standard Earth gravity as (or even gives the unit as m/s [&quot;sic&quot;]), while standard Earth gravity is . 
The fifth chapter refers to Nereid as Neptune&#x27;s largest moon; the planet&#x27;s largest moon is Triton.

==Influence==
&quot;Ringworld&quot; has become a generic term for such a structure, which is an example of what science fiction fans call a &quot;Big Dumb Object&quot;, or more formally a megastructure. Other science fiction authors have devised their own variants of Niven&#x27;s Ringworld, notably Iain M. Banks&#x27; Culture Orbitals, best described as miniature Ringworlds, and the titular ring-shaped Halo structures of the video game series &quot;Halo&quot;. Such a mini-Ringworld appears in &quot;Star Wars: The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, season 1, episode 5.. In the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Lower Decks season 4, episode 3, &quot;In the Cradle of Vexilon&quot;, a Ringworld-like world is prominently featured.

==Adaptations==

===Games===
In 1984, a role-playing game based on this setting was produced by Chaosium named &quot;The Ringworld Roleplaying Game&quot;. Information from the RPG, along with notes composed by RPG author John Hewitt with Niven, was later used to form the &quot;Bible&quot; given to authors writing in the &quot;Man-Kzin Wars&quot; series. Niven himself recommended that Hewitt write one of the stories for the original two MKW books, although this never came to pass.

Tsunami Games released two adventure games based on &quot;Ringworld&quot;. &quot;&quot; was released in 1992 and &quot;Return to Ringworld&quot; in 1994. A third game, &quot;Ringworld: Within ARM&#x27;s Reach&quot;, was also planned, but never completed.

The video game franchise &quot;Halo&quot;, created by Bungie, took inspiration from the book in the creation and development of its story around the eponymous rings, called Halos. These are physically similar to the Ringworld, however they are much smaller and do not encircle the star, instead orbiting stars or planets.

The open source video game &quot;Endless Sky&quot; features an alien species that creates ringworlds.

In 2017, Paradox Interactive added a DLC called &quot;Utopia&quot; to their game &quot;Stellaris&quot;, allowing the player to restore or build ringworlds.

In 2021, Mobius Digital added a DLC called &quot;Echoes of the Eye&quot; to their game &quot;Outer Wilds&quot;, which allows the player to explore a hidden, abandoned ringworld and determine what happened to its inhabitants.

===On screen===
There have been many aborted attempts to adapt the novel to the screen.

In 2001, Larry Niven reported that a movie deal had been signed and was in the early planning stages.

In 2004, the Sci-Fi Channel reported that it was developing a &quot;Ringworld&quot; miniseries. The series never came to fruition.

In 2013, it was again announced by the channel, now rebranded as Syfy, that a miniseries of the novel was in development. This proposed four-hour miniseries was being written by Michael R. Perry and would have been a co-production between MGM Television and Universal Cable Productions.

In 2017, Amazon announced that Ringworld was one of three science fiction series it was developing for its streaming service. MGM were again listed as a co-producer.

===OEL manga===
Tor/Seven Seas (same joint venture of Macmillan&#x27;s Tor Books and Seven Seas Entertainment who also published the English-language translation of &quot;Afro Samurai&quot;) published a two-part original English-language manga adaptation of &quot;Ringworld&quot;, with the script written by Robert Mandell and the artwork by Sean Lam. &quot;Ringworld: The Graphic Novel, Part One&quot;, covering the events of the novel up to the sunflower attack on Speaker, was released on July 8, 2014. &quot;Part Two&quot; was released on November 10, 2015.

==In other works==

* Terry Pratchett intended his 1981 novel &quot;Strata&quot; to be a &quot;piss-take/homage/satire&quot; of &quot;Ringworld&quot;. Niven took it in good humor and enjoyed the work.
* The plot of the first-person shooter &quot;&quot; for the Xbox, Windows, and Mac OS X also takes place on an artificial ring structure. Similarities to &quot;Ringworld&quot; have been noted in the game, and Niven was asked (but declined) to write the based on the series.
* &quot;All in Fun&quot; by Jerry Oltion, in &quot;Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, January 2009, mentions a faithful big-budget movie adaptation of &quot;Ringworld&quot;.
* In Ernest Cline&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, one of the sectors of the OASIS, the worldwide virtual reality network that is the novel&#x27;s primary setting, is mentioned as being an adaptation of &quot;Ringworld&quot;.
* The 1987 novel &quot;The Alexandrian Ring&quot; by William R. Forstchen takes place on a ring much like Niven&#x27;s.
* Episode 5 of &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot; features a station called Glavis that is shaped like a ring and features sun shades in much the same way that Niven&#x27;s does.

<doc id="26054" wikidata="Q150586" url="?curid=26054" title="Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor">
<text>Rudolf II (18 July 1552 – 20 January 1612) was Holy Roman Emperor (1576–1612), King of Hungary and Croatia (as Rudolf I, 1572–1608), King of Bohemia (1575–1608/1611) and Archduke of Austria (1576–1608). He was a member of the House of Habsburg.

Rudolf&#x27;s legacy has traditionally been viewed in three ways: an ineffectual ruler whose mistakes led directly to the Thirty Years&#x27; War; a great and influential patron of Northern Mannerist art; and an intellectual devotee of occult arts and learning which helped seed what would be called the Scientific Revolution. Determined to unify Christendom, he initiated the Long Turkish War (1593–1606) with the Ottoman Empire. Exhausted by war, his citizens in Hungary revolted in the Bocskai Uprising, which led to more authority being given to his brother Matthias. Under his reign, there was a policy of toleration towards Judaism.

==Early life==
Rudolf was born in Vienna on 18 July 1552. He was the eldest son and successor of Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, King of Bohemia, and King of Hungary and Croatia; his mother was the Spanish Princess Maria, a daughter of Charles V and Isabella of Portugal. He was the elder brother of Matthias who was to succeed him as King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor.
Rudolf spent eight formative years, from age 11 to 19 (1563–1571), in Spain, at the court of his maternal uncle Philip II, together with his younger brother Ernest, future governor of the Low Countries. 

After his return to Vienna, his father was concerned about Rudolf&#x27;s aloof and stiff manner, typical of the more conservative Spanish court, rather than the more relaxed and open Austrian court; but his Spanish mother saw in him courtliness and refinement. In the years following his return to Vienna, Rudolf was crowned King of Hungary (1572), King of Bohemia and King of the Romans (1575) when his father was still alive.

For the rest of his life, Rudolf would remain reserved, secretive, and largely a recluse who did not like to travel or even partake in the daily affairs of the state. 

He was more intrigued by occult learning such as astrology and alchemy, which was mainstream in the Renaissance period, and had a wide variety of personal hobbies such as horses, clocks, collecting rarities, and being a patron of the arts. He suffered from periodic bouts of &quot;melancholy&quot; (depression), which was common in the Habsburg line. These became worse with age and were manifested by a withdrawal from the world and its affairs into his private interests.

==Personal life==

Like Elizabeth I of England, whose birth was 19 years before his, Rudolf dangled himself as a prize in a string of diplomatic negotiations for marriages but never in fact married. Rudolf was known to have had a succession of affairs with women, some of whom claimed to have been impregnated by him. He had several illegitimate children by his mistress Catherina Strada. Their eldest son, Don Julius Caesar d&#x27;Austria, was likely born between 1584 and 1586 and received an education and opportunities for political and social prominence from his father. Another famous child was Caroline (1591–1662), Princess of Cantecroix, mother-in-law of Beatrice de Cusance, later Duchess of Lorraine as the second wife of Charles IV of Lorraine.

During his periods of self-imposed isolation, Rudolf reportedly had affairs with his Obersthofmeister, Wolfgang Siegmund Rumpf vom Wullroß (1536–1606), and a series of valets. One of them, Philipp Lang von Langenfels (1560–1609), influenced him for years and was hated by those seeking favours with the emperor.

Rudolf succeeded his father, Maximilian II, on 12 October 1576. In 1583, he moved the court to Prague.

In 1607, Rudolf sent Julius to live at Český Krumlov, in Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic, a castle that Rudolf had purchased from Peter Vok of Rosenberg, the last member of the House of Rosenberg, who had fallen into financial ruin. Julius lived at Český Krumlov in 1608, when he reportedly abused and murdered the daughter of a local barber, who had been living in the castle, and then disfigured her body. Rudolf condemned his son&#x27;s act and suggested that he should be imprisoned for the rest of his life.
However, Julius died in 1609 after he had shown signs of schizophrenia, refused to bathe and lived in squalor. His death was apparently caused by an ulcer that ruptured.

Many artworks commissioned by Rudolf are unusually erotic. The emperor was the subject of a whispering campaign by his enemies in his family and the Catholic Church in the years before he was deposed. Sexual allegations may well have formed a part of the campaign against him.

==Reign==

Historians have traditionally blamed Rudolf&#x27;s preoccupation with the arts, occult sciences, and other personal interests for the political disasters of his reign. More recently historians have re-evaluated that view and see his patronage of the arts and occult sciences as a triumph and key part of the Renaissance, and his political failures are seen as a legitimate attempt to create a unified Christian empire that was undermined by the realities of religious, political and intellectual disintegrations of the time.

Although raised in his uncle&#x27;s Catholic court in Spain, Rudolf was tolerant of Protestantism and other religions including Judaism. The tolerant policy by the empire towards the Jews would see Jewish cultural life flourishing, and their population increased under Rudolf&#x27;s reign.

He largely withdrew from Catholic observances and even in death refused the last sacramental rites. He had little attachment to Protestants either, except as a counter-weight to papal policies. He put his primary support behind conciliarists, irenicists and humanists. When the papacy instigated the Counter-Reformation by using agents sent to his court, Rudolf backed those who he thought were the most neutral in the debate, not taking a side or trying to effect restraint. This led to political chaos and threatened to provoke civil war.

His conflict with the Ottoman Empire was the final cause of his undoing. Unwilling to compromise with the Ottomans and stubbornly determined that he could unify all of Christendom with a new crusade, he started a long and indecisive war against the Ottomans in 1593. The war lasted until 1606 and is known as the &quot;Long Turkish War&quot;. 

By 1604, his Hungarian subjects were exhausted by the war and revolted, led by Stephen Bocskai (Bocskai uprising). In 1605, Rudolf was forced by his other family members to cede control of Hungarian affairs to his younger brother Archduke Matthias. By 1606, Matthias had forged a difficult peace with the Hungarian rebels (Peace of Vienna) and the Ottomans (Peace of Zsitvatorok). 

Rudolf was angry with Matthias&#x27;s concessions and saw them as giving away too much to further his hold on power. That made Rudolf prepare to start a new war against the Ottomans, but Matthias rallied support from the disaffected Hungarians and forced Rudolf to cede the crowns of Hungary, Austria and Moravia to him. Meanwhile, the Bohemian Protestants demanded greater religious liberty, which Rudolf granted in the &quot;Letter of Majesty&quot; in 1609. Bohemians continued to press for further freedoms, and Rudolf used his army to repress them.

Bohemian Protestants then appealed to Matthias for help. His army held Rudolf prisoner in his castle in Prague until 1611, when Rudolf ceded the crown of Bohemia, as well, to his brother.

==Death==
Rudolf died in 1612, nine months after he had been stripped of all effective power by his younger brother, except the empty title of Holy Roman Emperor, to which Matthias was elected five months later. In May 1618 with the event known as the Defenestration of Prague, the Protestant Bohemians, in defence of the rights granted them in the &quot;Letter of Majesty&quot;, threw imperial officials out of the window and thus the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) started.

==Art collecting and patronage==

Rudolf moved the Habsburg capital from Vienna to Prague in 1583. Rudolf loved collecting paintings and was often reported to sit and stare in rapture at a new work for hours on end. He spared no expense in acquiring great past masterworks, such as those of Dürer and Brueghel. He was also patron to some of the best contemporary artists, who mainly produced new works in the Northern Mannerist style, such as Bartholomeus Spranger, Hans von Aachen, Giambologna, Giuseppe Arcimboldo, Aegidius Sadeler, Roelant Savery, Joris Hoefnagel and Adrian de Vries, as well as commissioning works from Italians like Paolo Veronese.

Rudolf&#x27;s collections were the most impressive in the Europe of his day and the greatest collection of Northern Mannerist art ever to be assembled. The adjective Rudolfine, as in &quot;Rudolfine Mannerism&quot; is often used in art history to describe the style of the art that he patronised.

His love of collecting went far beyond paintings and sculptures. He commissioned decorative objects of all kinds and in particular mechanical moving devices. Ceremonial swords and musical instruments, clocks, waterworks, astrolabes, compasses, telescopes and other scientific instruments were all produced for him by some of the best craftsmen in Europe.

He patronized natural philosophers such as the botanist Charles de l&#x27;Ecluse, and the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler both attended his court. Tycho, who had spent much of his life making observations of stars and planets that were more accurate than any previous observations, directed Kepler to work on the planet Mars. In doing so, Kepler found that in order to fit the observations to the required accuracy, it was necessary to assume that each planet orbits the sun in an ellipse with the sun at one focus, sweeping out equal areas in equal times. Thus were born two of Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion. It was Rudolf&#x27;s patronage of the two astronomers that made this possible, as Kepler recognized when he eventually published the Rudolphine Tables. As mentioned earlier, Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as Jost Bürgi, Erasmus Habermel and Hans Christoph Schissler. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and through the financial support of the court were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.

The poet Elizabeth Jane Weston, a writer of Renaissance Latin poetry, was also part of his court and wrote numerous odes to him.
Rudolf kept a menagerie of exotic animals, botanical gardens, and Europe&#x27;s most extensive &quot;cabinet of curiosities&quot; (&quot;Kunstkammer&quot;) incorporating &quot;the three kingdoms of nature and the works of man&quot;. It was housed at Prague Castle, where between 1587 and 1605 he built the northern wing to house his growing collections. A lion and a tiger were allowed to roam the castle, as is documented by the account books, which record compensation paid to survivors of attacks or to family members of victims.

The &quot;Codex Gigas&quot; was one of Rudolf&#x27;s possessions. He was also alleged, by a single piece of hearsay, to have owned the Voynich manuscript, a codex whose author, purpose, language and script, and posited cipher remain unidentified to this day. In a letter written in 1665, Johannes Marcus Marci claims to have heard that Rudolf acquired the manuscript for 600 gold ducats at some unspecified time. No evidence in support of this assertion has ever been discovered.

As was typical of the time, Rudolf II had a portrait painted in the studio of the renowned Alonso Sánchez Coello. Completed in 1567, the portrait depicted Rudolf II at the age of 15. This painting can be seen at the Lobkowicz Palace in the Rozmberk room.

By 1597, the collection occupied three rooms of the incomplete northern wing. When building was completed in 1605, the collection was moved to the dedicated &quot;Kunstkammer&quot;. &quot;Naturalia&quot; (minerals and gemstones) were arranged in a 37-cabinet display that had three vaulted chambers in front, each about 5.5 m wide by 3 m high and 60 m long, connected to a main chamber 33 m long. Large uncut gemstones were held in strong boxes.

Apart from the fantastic nature of the objects, it is also the aesthetics of their arrangement and presentation which attracts the visitor&#x27;s attention. Without, however, there being a desire for purely scientific systematization on the part of the sovereign, it is necessary to detect the harmonious expression of the order of God and discern in the micro-macrocosm the analogy of a mimetic dependence on human arts towards nature and the world.

Rudolf&#x27;s &quot;Kunstkammer&quot; was not a typical &quot;cabinet of curiosities&quot;, a haphazard collection of unrelated specimens. Rather, the Rudolfine &quot;Kunstkammer&quot; was systematically arranged in an encyclopaedic fashion. In addition, Rudolf employed his court gemologist and physician Anselmus Boetius de Boodt (1550–1632), to curate the collection. Anselmus was an avid mineral collector and travelled widely on collecting trips to the mining regions of Germany, Bohemia and Silesia, often accompanied by his Bohemian naturalist friend, Thaddaeus Hagecius. Between 1607 and 1611, Anselmus catalogued the &quot;Kunstkammer&quot; and in 1609 published &quot;Gemmarum et Lapidum&quot;, the finest gemological treatise and encyclopedia ever written for this time.
As was customary at the time, the collection was private, but friends of the emperor, artists and professional scholars were allowed to study it. The collection became an invaluable research tool during the flowering of 17th-century European philosophy. 

Rudolf&#x27;s successors did not appreciate the collection, and the &quot;Kunstkammer&quot; gradually fell into disarray. Some 50 years after its establishment, most of the collection was packed into wooden crates and moved to Vienna. Most of the paintings that reached Vienna remain there, in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, with other pieces in the Secular Treasury and other museums. The collection remaining at Prague was looted during the last year of the Thirty Years&#x27; War by Swedish troops who sacked Prague Castle on 26 July 1648 and took the best of the paintings, many of which later passed to the Orléans Collection after the death of Christina of Sweden. In 1782, the remainder of the collection was sold piecemeal to private parties by Joseph II. One of the surviving items from the &quot;Kunstkammer&quot; is a &quot;fine chair&quot; that was looted by the Swedes in 1648 and now owned by the Earl of Radnor at Longford Castle in England, and others survive in museums.

==Occult sciences==

Astrology and alchemy were regarded as mainstream scientific fields in Renaissance Prague, and Rudolf was a firm devotee of both. His lifelong quest was to find the philosopher&#x27;s stone, and Rudolf spared no expense in bringing Europe&#x27;s best alchemists to court, such as Edward Kelley and John Dee. Rudolf even performed his own experiments in a private alchemy laboratory. When Rudolf was a prince, Nostradamus prepared a horoscope, which was dedicated to him as &#x27;Prince and King&#x27;. In the 1590s, Michael Sendivogius was active at Rudolph&#x27;s court.

Rudolf gave Prague a mystical reputation that persists in part to this day, with Alchemists&#x27; Alley l, on the grounds of Prague Castle, being a popular visiting place and tourist attraction.

Rudolf was a patron of the occult sciences. That and his practice of tolerance towards Jews caused during his reign the legend of the Golem of Prague to be established.

==Issue==
Rudolf had a relationship with the Royal mistress Kateřina Stradová (also known as Anna Marie Stradová, or Catherina Strada, c. 1568-1629), with whom he had six children:

* Don Julius Caesar d&#x27;Austria
* Matyáš d&#x27;Austria
* Carlos d&#x27;Austria
* Karolina d&#x27;Austria
* Dorothea d&#x27;Austria
* Alžběta d&#x27;Austria

<text>Radical Dreamers is a 1996 text-based visual novel adventure video game developed and published by Square for the Satellaview, a satellite peripheral for the Super Famicom. It forms part of the &quot;Chrono&quot; series, acting as a side story to the 1995 game &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. A version of the game is included with &quot;Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition&quot;, which was released worldwide on April 7, 2022, for Windows, the Nintendo Switch, the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One.

The game centers around an infiltration carried out by the titular thief gang led by Kid; aided by Serge and Magil, she seeks an artifact called the Frozen Flame and revenge on its keeper Lord Lynx. Players navigate the mansion&#x27;s environments and impact the story&#x27;s progression through text choices. &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; writer Masato Kato both directed and wrote the main scenario. Due to his attitude at the time, the plot and tone were considerably darker than &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, though the additional scenarists wrote alternate scenarios with comedic tones. The music was scored by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had worked on &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Production was completed in three months, and Kato was left unsatisfied with its quality.

As with most Satellaview titles, &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; did not receive a lasting commercial release at the time, and was exclusive to Japan. Attempts to bundle the game with the PlayStation port of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; were stopped by Kato due to quality concerns. The ROM for the game was released onto the web, allowing for the production of an English fan translation. While limited, the original&#x27;s coverage in news and fan sites have praised its narrative and tone. Kato would use plot elements from &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; in his next game &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay consists of word-based scenarios presented to the player through the narration of the main character, Serge. As the narrative progresses, the game presents a list of possible actions and the player chooses from them. Depending on the choices made, the player may enter a new area, be presented with a new situation or character, or have to choose again if the previous selection was incorrect. In combat with enemies, the player must select from options such as &quot;Fight&quot;, &quot;Magic&quot;, &quot;Run&quot;, and often more complex situational commands like &quot;Run my knife into the goblin&#x27;s chest!&quot; or &quot;Quickly slash at its hand!&quot;. Some decisions must be made before an invisible timer runs out; in combat, hesitation results in injury or death. Serge&#x27;s health is tracked by an invisible point count, restored by various events (such as finding a potion). The game also tracks Kid&#x27;s affection for Serge, influenced by battles and scripted events. Her feelings determine whether Serge survives the story&#x27;s climactic fight.

&quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; features minimal graphics and animation; most areas are rendered with dim, static backgrounds. The game also uses atmospheric music and sounds. Like other &quot;Chrono&quot; games, &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; contains a variant of New Game + mode. Only one scenario is available on the first play-through; after finishing it and obtaining one of three possible endings, players can explore six others. These later stories often feature comical situations or allusions to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;.

== Characters and story ==
&quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; features three protagonists—Serge, Kid, and Magil—who seek out treasure as venturesome, reputable thieves. The young adult narrator, Serge, is a drifting musician who met Kid by chance three years ago in a remote town. Serge enjoys adventure with a carefree attitude. Kid, only sixteen years old, is a renowned professional thief with a reputation for boisterous behavior. Possessing a turbulent history, Kid dubiously fancies herself as a kind of Robin Hood. Magil is an enigmatic, handsome masked man skilled in magic who rarely speaks and can fade into shadow at will. Crowned by flowing, blue hair, Magil accompanied Kid well before Serge joined the group. They seek the Frozen Flame, a mythic artifact capable of granting any wish. It is hidden in Viper Manor—the home of a terrible and powerful aristocrat named Lynx, who gained control of the estate after usurping power from and killing the Acacia Dragoons, a familial unit of warriors.
Following Kid, the group infiltrates Viper Manor on the night of a full moon. While sneaking through the corridors, they battle goblins and other creatures of legend while unraveling the history of the manor and its occupants. Magil explains that the Frozen Flame is a fragment of the massive, extraterrestrial creature known as Lavos, splintered off when Lavos impacted the planet in prehistory and burrowed to its core. The thieves locate Lynx and the Frozen Flame deep within an underground ruin of the Kingdom of Zeal—an ancient, airborne civilization destroyed after it awakened Lavos in search of immortality. Serge discovers that Kid is an orphan, hoping to exact revenge upon Lynx for killing her caretaker, Lucca. Kid attempted to find Lynx in her childhood after Lucca&#x27;s death, but was stopped and saved from certain defeat by Magil, who accompanied her thereafter.

The trio battle Lynx for the Frozen Flame, and Lynx gains the upper hand after trapping Magil with a powerful spell. He plans to acquire Kid&#x27;s special gift from Lucca—a Time Egg, or Chrono Trigger. With a Time Egg and the Frozen Flame, Lynx boasts that he shall achieve control over time. Kid lunges at him, but Lynx easily parries her attack and wounds her. She desperately removes the Chrono Trigger from her back pocket. The Trigger shatters and causes a localized temporal distortion, leading Serge to see various scenes in history. Kid learns of her heritage as princess Schala of Zeal, a meek girl who was coerced to help awaken Lavos with her magical power. As Zeal collapsed, Schala was wracked with anguish and guilt for her role in the incident. Nearby in the Ocean Palace, the Frozen Flame felt her grief and changed her to a baby, sending her to the modern era where Lucca found her. It is also circumstantially revealed that Magil is in fact Magus, Schala&#x27;s wayward brother who searched for her after battling Lavos in &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Once the distortion subsides, an army from Porre—a large nation in search of the Frozen Flame—storms the mansion. Lynx withdraws as Kid, Serge, and Magil flee. Kid tells Serge that she is aware of her true origin, and knowing that is a treasure which cannot be stolen. She bids him goodbye before disappearing into the darkness with Magil.

Other scenarios are available after players complete the first. These include both humorous and serious variations of the main plot.

* &quot;Magil: Love! Folly! Elopement!&quot; – Magil is actually a lifelong friend of Riddel who courts her. When the manor is alerted to his presence, Magil throws Riddel over his shoulder and dashes off into the morning sun as her proud father Lynx tearily bids goodbye.
* &quot;Kid and the Sunflower&quot; – Kid insults a lecherous sunflower who transforms her into a malicious monster. Serge must kiss her to change her back, or use a special dagger to take her soul at risk of his own soul&#x27;s capture. Three endings are available.
* &quot;The Great Space Chase!&quot; – Magil is a space cop searching for Lynx, secretly a green Martian creature with tentacles. Magil&#x27;s rock guitar forces Lynx out of hiding, and Serge assaults him with a Lesser Martian Bunny Bun-Bun.
* &quot;Homecoming: Felicia’s Light&quot; – Kid learns that Lynx and her caretaker Felicia are trapped in a magical seal as part of Lynx&#x27;s effort to escape a spirit prison. Felicia selflessly instructs Magil to destroy the Frozen Flame, killing Lynx forever.
* &quot;Paradeus: The Mystery Mega-Weapon&quot; – Serge finds an odd crystal inhabited by an entity named Ganju, who tests his strength with gladiatorial combat. Using Ganju&#x27;s Paradeus mecha, Serge and Ganju challenge Mecha-Lynx for the Frozen Flame.
* &quot;Death and the Realm of Shadow&quot; – Kid accidentally summons Lilith, the Goddess of Death. She tries to take Kid&#x27;s soul, but Magil intervenes. The outcome is slightly affected by Kid&#x27;s affection for Serge.

== Development ==
&quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; was developed by Square, the company which had previously developed &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Masato Kato wrote &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; after &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;″s release, feeling that &quot;Trigger&quot; concluded with &quot;unfinished business&quot;. He composed the main story and drafted the concepts for the sub-scenarios, leaving them to be completed by his peers. He allowed Makoto Shimamoto to write the entire &quot;Kid and the Sunflower&quot; segment, later joking that he &quot;avoided having any part in that episode,&quot; while Miwa Shoda was in charge of the &quot;Shadow Realm and the Goddess of Death&quot; segment. According to scenario writer Daisuke Fukugawa (responsible for the game&#x27;s &quot;The Enigmatic Gigaweapon: Paradise X&quot; subplot), the game&#x27;s graphical content pushed the Satellaview&#x27;s technical limits, requiring developers to redraw prerendered models until functional gameplay could be ensured. Compared to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, the plot of &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; had a bleak tone which Kato ascribed to his deep frustration and anger about coming to work every day following &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;″s hectic development. Specifically, Kid&#x27;s &quot;nihilistic&quot; feelings were Kato&#x27;s own expressions at the time. Kato intended both &quot;Dreamers&quot; and its eventual successor &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; to prompt players to pursue their personal dreams in life.

Due to being a small side project, there was a general sense of freedom compared to other Square titles. The decision to make it a text-based adventure helped push the game into its darker direction. Kato intended for it to be a survival adventure title, but abandoned this specific approach after the release of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. The more comedic additional scenarios helped balance out the sombre elements in the main narrative. Reflecting on his work, Kato felt his work on &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; helped solidify his style. Kato&#x27;s team completed &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; in only three months under a rushed production schedule, prompting him to label the game &quot;unfinished&quot; in an interview for the &quot;Ultimania&quot; &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; guide. Square had initially requested it be finished in two months. Kato regretted that the schedule hampered the quality of his work, and explained that the connections to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; were evoked towards the end of the project. The finished ROM totaled 8 megabits; the developers later reflected that the scenario was changed three times to work within this limited capacity.

=== Music ===
The music of &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; was written by composer Yasunori Mitsuda, who scored &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and later &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. During this time, Mitsuda was listening to Russian folk music, and used this style in the music for &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;. He wrote the score in a very relaxed style, which he felt produced his best work at that time. Mitsuda wrote the music in around three months, and in retrospect thought it turned out well. Several themes and musical patterns were later adapted for &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; at Kato&#x27;s suggestion; many appear unchanged except for new instrumentation. Mitsuda estimated that about half the music for &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; was reused in &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;.
== Release ==
&quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; was announced in early 1996 as part of a collection of four titles produced by Square for the Satellaview platform. It was first released for broadcast starting February 3 that year. Subsequent broadcast periods were held through until March 8, with Square commenting that there were no plans to release the game in cartridge form. Famitsu promoted the game without any clear connections or references to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Owing to the eventual shutdown of the service, &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; became impossible to play except on end users&#x27; cartridges that had the game installed during its broadcast period. It also received no English release due to the Satellaview&#x27;s Japanese exclusivity. Square originally wanted to include the game as part of the PlayStation port of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, but Kato stopped them due to his dissatisfaction with the final product. While he had the option of incorporating it into the Nintendo DS remake of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, he did not due to its very different tone and questionable market demand. While uncertain about its quality in the gaming market at the time, at the time Kato was open to the possibility of releasing a version of &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;.

In April 2003, the ROM hacking group Demiforce released a fan translation rendering &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; in English. The patch works by modifying the ROM image of &quot;Dreamers&quot; used for playing console-based video games on personal computers through emulation. The ability to save games was not enabled with the first patch, and some minor typos were left in, later remedied by successive releases. On Christmas Day 2005, Demiforce and Radical R released the final version (1.4) of the translation, which fixed remaining minor bugs. The French team Terminus Traduction made a French translation patch soon after. Masato Kato did not perceive significant demand to include &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; as a bonus with the release of &quot;Chrono Trigger DS&quot;, and omitted it to preserve continuity between &quot;Trigger&quot; and &quot;Cross&quot;. He expressed concern in 2009 over re-releasing &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; &quot;as-is&quot;, citing a need to revise the work.

On February 9, 2022, Square Enix announced that &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; would receive a re-release as part of &quot;Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition&quot;, as well as an official translation. It was released worldwide on April 7, 2022, for Windows, the Nintendo Switch, the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One with English, French, Italian, Spanish and German translations.

== Reception ==
Website Cubed3 gave the game a score of 8/10, praising its excellent use of atmosphere and music despite the difficulties for potential players to access it. A reviewer for Home of the Underdogs lauded the game&#x27;s excellent writing and the &quot;superb&quot; English translation patch, noting that the &quot;interesting plot&quot; would appeal to fantasy fans if they could stomach the limited interactivity. Having never played a &quot;Chrono&quot; game prior, the reviewer stated, &quot;I was still able to follow the story and be drawn into the world of colorful characters.&quot; While praising the replay value afforded by the extra scenarios, the critic derided the random battles of &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;, writing that &quot;RPG-style random combat doesn&#x27;t translate well to [a] text-only medium.&quot; The website awarded &quot;Dreamers&quot; &quot;Top Dog&quot; status, and the game maintains a voter score of 8.95 out of 10. Chris Kohler, in his 2004 book &quot;Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life&quot;, cited &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;&#x27; soundtrack as a precursor to Mitsuda&#x27;s explicitly Celtic musical style in &quot;Xenogears&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; preceded &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, a full role-playing video game sequel to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Masato Kato cited the desire to &quot;redo &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; properly&quot; as the genesis of &quot;Cross&quot;, attributing the latter&#x27;s serious atmosphere to the former. Kato&#x27;s desire to finish the story of the characters Kid and Serge principally shaped the plot of &quot;Cross&quot;. Several events in &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, such as the infiltration of Viper Manor, were also a direct reference to events in &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot;. He also incorporated &quot;Radical Dreamers&quot; into the plot of &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; as an alternate timeline. The character Gil, confirmed by Kato to be Magus, was going to be featured in &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;. This idea was scrapped due to difficulties in representing the story of Magus among the game&#x27;s numerous other characters; the unrelated, enigmatic magician Guile was created instead.

<doc id="26056" wikidata="Q314215" url="?curid=26056" title="Robert Anton Wilson">
<text>Robert Anton Wilson (born Robert Edward Wilson; January 18, 1932 – January 11, 2007) was an American author, futurist, psychologist, and self-described agnostic mystic. Recognized within Discordianism as an Episkopos, pope and saint, Wilson helped publicize Discordianism through his writings and interviews. In 1999 he described his work as an &quot;attempt to break down conditioned associations, to look at the world in a new way, with many models recognized as models or maps, and no one model elevated to the truth&quot;. Wilson&#x27;s goal was &quot;to try to get people into a state of generalized agnosticism, not agnosticism about God alone but agnosticism about everything.&quot;

In addition to writing several science-fiction novels, Wilson also wrote non-fiction books on extrasensory perception, mental telepathy, metaphysics, paranormal experiences, conspiracy theory, sex, drugs, and what Wilson called &quot;quantum psychology&quot;.

Following a career in journalism and as an editor, notably for &quot;Playboy&quot;, Wilson emerged as a major countercultural figure in the mid-1970s, comparable to one of his coauthors, Timothy Leary, as well as Terence McKenna.

==Early life==
Born Robert Edward Wilson in Methodist Hospital, in Brooklyn, New York, he spent his first years in Flatbush, and moved with his family to Gerritsen Beach, in a lower middle class area, around the age of four or five, where they stayed until relocating to the then-socioeconomically analogous South Slope section (in part to facilitate an easier high school commute for Wilson) when he was thirteen. He had polio as a child, and found generally effective treatment with the Kenny Method (created by Elizabeth Kenny) which the American Medical Association repudiated at that time. Polio&#x27;s effects remained with Wilson throughout his life, usually manifesting as minor muscle spasms causing him to occasionally use a cane, until 2000, when he experienced a major bout with post-polio syndrome that would continue until his death.

He attended Catholic grammar schools before securing admission to the selective Brooklyn Technical High School. Removed from the Catholic influence at &quot;Brooklyn Tech&quot;, Wilson became enamored of literary modernism (particularly Ezra Pound and James Joyce), the Western philosophical tradition, then-innovative historians such as Charles A. Beard, science fiction (including the works of Olaf Stapledon, Robert A. Heinlein and Theodore Sturgeon) and Alfred Korzybski&#x27;s interdisciplinary theory of general semantics. He would later recall that the family was &quot;living so well ... compared to the Depression&quot; during this period &quot;that I imagined we were lace-curtain Irish at last.&quot;

Following his graduation in 1950, Wilson was employed in a succession of jobs (including ambulance driver, engineering aide, salesman and medical orderly) and absorbed various philosophers and cultural practices (including bebop, psychoanalysis, Friedrich Nietzsche, Alfred Korzybski, James Joyce, Bertrand Russell, Carl Jung, Wilhelm Reich, Leon Trotsky, and Ayn Rand, whom he later repudiated) while writing in his spare time. He studied electrical engineering and mathematics intermittently at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute from 1952 to 1957 before enrolling in an English education undergraduate program at New York University from 1957 to 1958 but did not complete a degree at either institution.

After having smoked cannabis for nearly a decade, Wilson first experimented with mescaline in Yellow Springs, Ohio, on December 28, 1961. Wilson began to work as a freelance journalist and advertising copywriter in the late 1950s. He adopted his maternal grandfather&#x27;s name, Anton, for his writings and told himself that he would save the &quot;Edward&quot; for when he wrote the Great American Novel. He later found that &quot;Robert Anton Wilson&quot; had become an established identity.

He assumed co-editorship of the School for Living&#x27;s Brookville, Ohio-based &quot;Balanced Living&quot; magazine in 1962 and briefly returned to New York as associate editor of Ralph Ginzburg&#x27;s quarterly magazine, called &quot;fact:&quot;, before leaving for &quot;Playboy&quot;, where he served as an associate editor from 1965 to 1971. According to Wilson, &quot;Playboy&quot; &quot;paid me a higher salary than any other magazine at which I had worked and never expected me to become a conformist or sell my soul in return. I enjoyed my years in the Bunny Empire. I only resigned when I reached 40 and felt I could not live with myself if I didn&#x27;t make an effort to write full-time at last.&quot; Along with frequent collaborator Robert Shea, Wilson edited the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Playboy&quot; Forum, a letters section consisting of responses to the &quot;Playboy&quot; Philosophy editorial column. During this period, he covered Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert&#x27;s Millbrook, New York-based Castalia Foundation at the instigation of Alan Watts in &quot;The Realist&quot;, cultivated important friendships with William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, and lectured at the Free University of New York on &#x27;Anarchist and Synergetic Politics&#x27; in 1965.

He received a BA, MA (1978) and PhD (1981) in psychology from Paideia University, which was an accredited university in California at the time he graduated in 1981 but later on became unaccredited and then closed. Wilson reworked his dissertation, and it found publication in 1983 as &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot;.

Wilson married freelance writer and poet Arlen Riley in 1958. They had four children, including Christina Wilson Pearson and Patricia Luna Wilson. Luna was beaten to death in an apparent robbery in the store where she worked in 1976 at the age of 15, and became the first person to have her brain preserved by the American Cryonics Society (which was called the Bay Area Cryonics Society at the time). Arlen Riley Wilson died on May 22, 1999, following a series of strokes.

==The &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; Trilogy==

Among Wilson&#x27;s 35 books and many other works, perhaps his best-known volumes remain the cult classic series &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot; (1975), co-authored with Shea. Advertised as &quot;a fairy tale for paranoids&quot;, the three books—&quot;The Eye in the Pyramid&quot;, &quot;The Golden Apple&quot;, and &quot;Leviathan&quot;, soon offered as a single volume—philosophically and humorously examined, among many other themes, occult and magical symbolism and history, the counterculture of the 1960s, secret societies, data concerning author H. P. Lovecraft and author and occultist Aleister Crowley, and American paranoia about conspiracies and conspiracy theories. The book was intended to poke fun at the conspiratorial frame of mind.

Wilson and Shea derived much of the odder material from letters sent to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine while they worked as the editors of its Forum. The books mixed true information with imaginative fiction to engage the reader in what Wilson called &quot;guerrilla ontology&quot;, which he apparently referred to as &quot;Operation Mindfuck&quot; in &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; The trilogy also outlined a set of libertarian and anarchist axioms known as Celine&#x27;s laws (named after Hagbard Celine, a character in &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;), concepts Wilson revisited several times in other writings.

Among the many subplots of &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; one addresses biological warfare and the overriding of the United States Bill of Rights, another gives a detailed account of the John F. Kennedy assassination (in which no fewer than five snipers, all working for different causes, prepare to shoot Kennedy), and the book&#x27;s climax occurs at a rock concert where the audience collectively face the danger of becoming a mass human sacrifice.

&quot;Illuminatus!&quot; popularized Discordianism and the use of the term &quot;fnord&quot;. It incorporates experimental prose styles influenced by writers such as William S. Burroughs, James Joyce, and Ezra Pound. Although Shea and Wilson never co-operated on such a scale again, Wilson continued to expand upon the themes of the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; books throughout his writing career. Most of his later fiction contains cross-over characters from &quot;The Sex Magicians&quot; (Wilson&#x27;s first novel, written before the release of &quot;Illuminatus!&quot;, which includes many of his same characters) and &quot;The Illuminatus! Trilogy&quot;.

&quot;Illuminatus!&quot; won the Prometheus Hall of Fame award for Best Classic Fiction, voted by the Libertarian Futurist Society for science fiction in 1986, has many international editions, and found adaptation for the stage when Ken Campbell produced it as a ten-hour drama. It also appeared as two card based games from Steve Jackson Games, one a trading-card game (). Eye N Apple Productions and Rip Off Press produced a comic book version of the trilogy.

==&quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat&quot; Trilogy, &quot;The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles&quot;, and &quot;Masks of the Illuminati&quot;==

Wilson wrote two more popular fiction series. The first, a trilogy later published as a single volume, was &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat&quot;. The second, &quot;The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles&quot;, appeared as three books. In between publishing the two trilogies Wilson released a stand-alone novel, &quot;Masks of the Illuminati&quot; (1981), which, due to the main character&#x27;s ancestry, fits into the timeline of &quot;The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles&quot; and, while published earlier, may qualify as the fourth volume in that series.

&quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s Cat&quot; consists of three volumes: &quot;The Universe Next Door&quot;, &quot;The Trick Top Hat&quot;, and &quot;The Homing Pigeons&quot;. Wilson set the three books in differing alternative universes, in which the cast of characters remains almost the same aside from variations in names, careers and background stories. The books cover the fields of quantum mechanics and the varied philosophies and explanations that exist within the science. The single volume describes itself as a magical textbook and a type of initiation. The single-volume edition omits many entire pages and has many other omissions when compared with the original separate books.

&quot;The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles&quot;, composed of &quot;The Earth Will Shake&quot; (1982), &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Son&quot; (1985), and &quot;Nature&#x27;s God&quot; (1991), follows the timelines of several characters through different generations, time periods, and countries. The books cover a range of topics, including (but not limited to) the history, legacy, and rituals of the Illuminati and related groups.

&quot;Masks of the Illuminati&quot; features historical characters in a fictionalized setting, and contains a blend of occult history. Intermixing Albert Einstein, James Joyce, Aleister Crowley, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, and others, the book focuses on Pan as well as other occult icons, ideas, and practices. It also includes homages, parodies and pastiches from both the lives and works of Crowley and Joyce.

==Plays and screenplays==
Wilson&#x27;s play, &quot;Wilhelm Reich in Hell&quot;, was published as a book in 1987 and first performed at the Edmund Burke Theatre in Dublin, in San Francisco, and in Los Angeles. It features many factual and fictional characters, including Marilyn Monroe, Uncle Sam, and Wilhelm Reich himself. Wilson also wrote and published as books two screenplays, not yet produced: &quot;Reality Is What You Can Get Away With: an Illustrated Screenplay&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Walls Came Tumbling Down&quot; (1997).

Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot; has been adapted as a theatrical stage play by Daisy Eris Campbell, daughter of Ken Campbell the British theatre maverick who staged &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; at the Royal National Theatre in 1977. The play opened on November 23, 2014, in Liverpool before transferring to London and Brighton. Some of the costs were met through crowdfunding. Wilson&#x27;s book is itself dedicated to &quot;Ken Campbell and the Science-Fiction Theatre Of Liverpool, England.&quot;

==The &quot;Cosmic Trigger&quot; series and other books==
In his nonfiction and partly autobiographical &quot;Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati&quot; (1977) and its two sequels, as well as in many other works, Wilson examined Freemasons, Discordianism, Sufism, the Illuminati, Futurology, Zen Buddhism, Dennis and Terence McKenna, Jack Parsons, the occult practices of Aleister Crowley and G.I. Gurdjieff, Yoga, and many other esoteric or counterculture philosophies, personalities, and occurrences.

Wilson advocated Timothy Leary&#x27;s 8-Circuit Model of Consciousness and neurosomatic/linguistic engineering, which he wrote about in many books including &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; (1983, revised 1997) and &quot;Quantum Psychology&quot; (1990), which contain practical techniques intended to help the reader break free of one&#x27;s reality tunnels. With Leary, he helped promote the futurist ideas of space migration, intelligence increase, and life extension, which they combined to form the word symbol SMI²LE.

Wilson&#x27;s 1986 book, &quot;The New Inquisition&quot;, argues that whatever reality consists of it actually would seem much weirder than we commonly imagine. It cites, among other sources, Bell&#x27;s theorem and Alain Aspect&#x27;s experimental proof of Bell&#x27;s to suggest that mainstream science has a strong materialist bias, and that in fact modern physics may have already disproved materialist metaphysics.

Wilson also supported the work and utopian theories of Buckminster Fuller and examined the theories of Charles Fort. He and Loren Coleman became friends, as he did with media theorist Marshall McLuhan and Neuro Linguistic Programming co-founder Richard Bandler, with whom he taught workshops. He also admired James Joyce, and wrote extensive commentaries on the author and on two of Joyce&#x27;s novels, &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;, in his 1988 book &quot;&quot;.

Although Wilson often lampooned and criticized some New Age beliefs, bookstores specializing in New Age material often sell his books. Wilson, a well-known author in occult and Neo-Pagan circles, used Aleister Crowley as a main character in his 1981 novel &quot;Masks of the Illuminati&quot;, also included some elements of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s work in his novels, and at times claimed to have perceived encounters with magical &quot;entities&quot; (when asked whether these entities seemed &quot;real&quot;, he answered they seemed &quot;real enough&quot;, although &quot;not as real as the IRS&quot; but &quot;easier to get rid of&quot;, and later decided that his experiences may have emerged from &quot;just my right brain hemisphere talking to my left&quot;). He warned against beginners using occult practice, since to rush into such practices and the resulting &quot;energies&quot; they unleash could lead people to &quot;go totally nuts&quot;.

Wilson also criticized scientific types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with religious fundamentalists in their fanaticism. In a 1988 interview, when asked about his newly published book &quot;The New Inquisition: Irrational Rationalism and the Citadel of Science&quot;, Wilson commented:

==Probability reliance==
In a 2003 interview with &quot;High Times&quot; magazine, Wilson described himself as &quot;model-agnostic&quot; which he said

Wilson claimed in &quot;Cosmic Trigger: Volume 1&quot; &quot;not to believe anything&quot;, since &quot;belief is the death of intelligence&quot;. He described this approach as &quot;Maybe Logic&quot;.

Wilson wrote about this and other topics in articles for the cyberpunk magazine &quot;Mondo 2000&quot;.

==Economic thought==

Wilson favored a form of basic income guarantee; synthesizing several ideas under the acronym RICH. His ideas are set forth in the essay &quot;The RICH Economy&quot;, found in &quot;The Illuminati Papers&quot;. In an article critical of capitalism, Wilson self-identified as a &quot;libertarian socialist&quot;, saying that &quot;I ask only one thing of skeptics: don&#x27;t bring up Soviet Russia, please. That horrible example of State Capitalism has nothing to do with what I, and other libertarian socialists, would offer as an alternative to the present system.&quot; By the 1980s he was less enthusiastic about the socialist label, writing in &quot;Prometheus Rising&quot; that he &quot;does not like&quot; the spread of socialism. In his book &quot;Right Where You Are Sitting Now&quot;, he praises the georgist economist Silvio Gesell. In the essay &quot;Left and Right: A Non-Euclidean Perspective&quot;, Wilson speaks favorably of several &quot;excluded middles&quot; that &quot;transcend the hackneyed debate between monopoly Capitalism and totalitarian Socialism&quot;; he says his favorite is the mutualist anarchism of Benjamin Tucker and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, but he also offers kind words for the ideas of Gesell, Henry George, C. H. Douglas, and Buckminster Fuller. Wilson also identified as an anarchist and described his belief system as &quot;a blend of Tucker, Spooner, Fuller, Pound, Henry George, Rothbard, Douglas, Korzybski, Proudhon and Marx.&quot; Wilson spoke several times at conventions of the American Libertarian Party. He included Benjamin Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Instead of a Book&quot;, Henry George&#x27;s &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, and Gesell&#x27;s &quot;The Natural Economic Order&quot; in a list of 20 book recommendations, &quot;the bare minimum of what everybody really needs to chew and digest before they can converse intelligently about the 21st Century.&quot;

==Other activities==
Robert Anton Wilson and his wife Arlen Riley Wilson founded the Institute for the Study of the Human Future in 1975.

From 1982 until his death, Wilson had a business relationship with the Association for Consciousness Exploration, which hosted his first on-stage dialogue with his long-time friend Timothy Leary entitled &quot;The Inner Frontier&quot;. Wilson dedicated his book &quot;The New Inquisition&quot; to A.C.E.&#x27;s co-directors, Jeff Rosenbaum and Joseph Rothenberg.

Wilson also joined the Church of the SubGenius, who referred to him as &quot;Pope Bob&quot;. He contributed to their literature, including the book &quot;Three-Fisted Tales of &quot;Bob&quot;&quot;, and shared a stage with their founder, Rev. Ivan Stang, on several occasions. Wilson also founded the Guns and Dope Party.

As a member of the Board of Advisors of the Fully Informed Jury Association, Wilson worked to inform the public about jury nullification, the right of jurors to nullify a law they deem unjust.

Wilson advocated for and wrote about E-Prime, a form of English lacking all forms of the verb &quot;to be&quot; (such as &quot;is&quot;, &quot;are&quot;, &quot;was&quot;, &quot;were&quot; etc.).

A decades-long researcher into drugs and a strong opponent of what he called &quot;the war on some drugs&quot;, Wilson participated as a Special Guest in the week-long 1999 Annual Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, and used and often promoted the use of medical marijuana. He participated in a protest organized by the Wo/Men&#x27;s Alliance for Medical Marijuana in Santa Cruz in 2002.

==Death==
On June 22, 2006, Paul Krassner reported on &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; that Wilson was under hospice care at home with friends and family. On October 2, Douglas Rushkoff reported that Wilson was in severe financial trouble. Slashdot, Boing Boing, and the Church of the SubGenius also picked up on the story, linking to Rushkoff&#x27;s appeal. As his webpage reported on October 10, these efforts succeeded beyond expectation and raised a sum that would have supported him for at least six months. On October 5, 2006, Wilson responded to the support by posting the following comment on his personal website, expressing his gratitude:

On January 6, 2007, Wilson wrote on his blog that according to several medical authorities, he would likely only have between two days and two months left to live. He closed this message with &quot;I look forward without dogmatic optimism but without dread. I love you all and I deeply implore you to keep the lasagna flying. Please pardon my levity, I don&#x27;t see how to take death seriously. It seems absurd.&quot;

Wilson died five days later, on January 11 at 4:50 am, just a week short of his 75th birthday. After his cremation on January 18 (also his 75th birthday), his family held a memorial service on February 18 and then scattered most of his ashes at the same spot as his wife&#x27;s—off the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk in Santa Cruz, California.

A tribute show to Wilson, organized by Coldcut and Mixmaster Morris and performed in London as a part of the &quot;Ether 07 Festival&quot; held at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on March 18, 2007, also included Ken Campbell, Bill Drummond and Alan Moore.

==Cultural references==
Wilson appears as a fictional version of himself in Timothy Leary&#x27;s 1979 book, &quot;The Intelligence Agents&quot;. It features a full facsimile reproduction of an article ostensibly authored by Wilson, titled Marilyn&#x27;s Input System, from &quot;Peeple Magazine&quot; of March 1986.

== Filmography ==
=== Actor ===
Wilson appeared in the 1998 German film &quot;23 Nichts ist so wie es scheint&quot;. He has approximately two minutes featured as himself, with the main actor, portraying hacker Karl Koch, meeting Wilson at the annual German Computer Hackers Convention in 1985. The film is a biographical piece about Germany&#x27;s infamous computer hackers, and the 1985 meeting in Germany between Wilson and Koch is authentic. Wilson spoke at the 1985 German Computer Hackers Convention, warning of a future in which governments would have total digital control over the citizen. He signed one of his books for Koch. These events are depicted in the film.

<doc id="26059" wikidata="Q3440462" url="?curid=26059" title="Roller hockey">
<text>Roller hockey is a form of hockey played on a dry surface using wheeled skates. It can be played with traditional roller skates (quad skates) or with inline skates and use either a ball or puck. Combined, roller hockey is played in nearly 60 countries worldwide.

There are three major variants of organized roller hockey. Traditional &quot;roller hockey&quot; (also called rink hockey, quad hockey, and hardball hockey) is played using quad skates, curved/&#x27;cane&#x27; sticks, and a ball; it is a limited-contact sport. &quot;Inline hockey&quot; is played using inline skates, ice hockey sticks, and a puck; it is a full-contact sport though body checks are not allowed. &quot;Inline skater hockey&quot; is a European version of inline hockey that uses a ball instead of a puck. Rink hockey and inline hockey are governed internationally by World Skate, while inline skater hockey is governed by International Inline Skater Hockey Federation. Most professional hockey games take place on an indoor or outdoor sport court (a type of plastic interlinking tiles used to create a skating surface). Otherwise, any dry surface can be used to host a game, typically a roller rink, macadam (asphalt), or cement.

== Variants ==
Roller hockey is played on both quad skates and inline skates, have different rules and equipment, and involve different types of skating but share the category and name of roller hockey. Roller hockey (quad) is played using traditional quad roller skates, affording greater maneuverability to the player - this results in games filled with fancy footwork, tight maneuvering, and is more similar to football or basketball. The stick is more or less the same as in bandy and shinty. Roller hockey (inline) bears close resemblance to ice hockey and is played on inline skates, uses an ice hockey stick and includes a lot of fast &quot;racing back and forth&quot; action. Inline hockey goalies use a glove called a catcher to catch shots made on goal, and a flat, usually square, mitt called a blocker which is used to deflect shots on goal. The Quad hockey goalie uses a flat batting glove that provides rebound characteristics when blocking a shot on goal.

=== Rink hockey===


Rink hockey is a variation of roller hockey. Rink hockey is the overarching name for a rollersport that has existed long before inline skates were &quot;re-invented&quot; in the &#x27;70s (They were actually invented before quads, in the 1760s). Rink hockey has been played on quad skates, in sixty countries worldwide and so has many names worldwide. Sometimes the sport is called quad hockey, international style ball hockey, Rink hockey, roller hockey and hardball hockey, depending on which region of the world it is played. Roller hockey was a demonstration rollersport in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Since 2017, the World Championships have been held every two years at the World Roller Games organised by World Skate. In England, 9 teams currently play in the Roller Hockey Premier League, which is governed by the NRHA.

=== Inline hockey ===

Inline hockey is a variation of roller hockey very similar to ice hockey, from which it is derived. It is referred to by many names worldwide, including Ball Hockey, Inline hockey, Roller hockey, Longstick hockey, Deck hockey, Road hockey, Street hockey and Skater hockey depending on which region of the world in which it is played.

Like ice hockey, inline hockey is considered a &quot;contact sport&quot;, however body checking is prohibited. It is similar to ice hockey in that teamwork, skill and aggressiveness are needed. Excepting the use of inline roller skates instead of ice skates, the equipment of inline roller hockey is similar to that of ice hockey.

The game is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. When played more informally, the game often takes place on a smooth, asphalt surface outdoors. The game is played in three 15-minute periods or if it is higher standard it&#x27;s played 20-minutes in each of the three periods, plus 10- to 15-minute intermission breaks. The game rules differ from ice hockey in a few simple ways: there is no icing and it is played in a 4 on 4 player format instead of 5 on 5. The overtime method used here is golden goal (a.k.a. &quot;sudden death&quot;) in which whoever scores first is the winner; 5 minutes is the duration per period.

Generally speaking, only competitive-level inline hockey is strictly bound by the governing body&#x27;s rules. Recreational hockey leagues may make modifications to certain aspects of the rules to suit local requirements (size of rink, length of periods and penalties). Roller hockey is a growing sport with teams cropping up all over the country. The fact that it can be played on any dry surface means that it can be played in almost any leisure center.

==Tournaments==
Most competitive youth hockey teams play in tournaments. The tournaments vary depending on location, but a typical bracket system is usually used.

World Skate is the international association that organize the biggest roller hockey world championship for rink hockey and inline hockey. The championships are part of the biennial World Roller Games and over twenty national teams participate in these events.

For inline hockey in the U.S., teams travel to different locations around their state, sometimes even going out of state. There are intrastate tournaments and out-of-state tournaments. There are even national tournaments competitive teams compete for. There are other tournaments located in the U.S but played by players all around the world. Narch and Statewars are two Nationwide tournaments of every skill level and age group.

In Europe, rink hockey is governed by World Skate Europe - Rink Hockey (CERH), inline hockey is governed by World Skate Europe - Inline Hockey (CERILH), and inline skater hockey is governed by International Inline Skater Hockey Federation (IISHF).

==Roller hockey brands==
Many of the same brands that make ice hockey equipment also make roller hockey skates including Bauer, Easton, Mission, Tron and many more. There are also some brands that specialize in roller hockey like el Leon de Oro (Spain), Tour, Alkali, Revision and Mission (but they make some ice hockey equipment also). Other rink hockey brands include Reno, TVD, Meneghini, Proskate and Azemad.

<text>The Royal Navy (RN) is the naval warfare force of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is a component of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Service, and its officers hold their commissions from the King. Although warships were used by English and Scottish kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War against France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the English Navy of the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK&#x27;s armed services, it is consequently known as the Senior Service.

From the 19th century until the Second World War, it was the world&#x27;s most powerful navy. The Royal Navy played a key part in establishing and defending the British Empire, and four Imperial fortress colonies and a string of imperial bases and coaling stations secured the Royal Navy&#x27;s ability to assert naval superiority. Following World War I, it was significantly reduced in size. During the Cold War, the Royal Navy transformed into a primarily anti-submarine force, hunting for Soviet submarines and mostly active in the GIUK gap. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, its focus returned to expeditionary operations.

The Royal Navy maintains a fleet of technologically sophisticated ships, submarines, and aircraft, including two aircraft carriers, four ballistic missile submarines (which maintain the nuclear deterrent), five nuclear fleet submarines, six guided missile destroyers, eight frigates, seven mine-countermeasure vessels and 26 patrol vessels. As of December 2024, there are 62 active and commissioned ships (including submarines as well as one historic ship, ) in the Royal Navy, plus 11 ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA). There are also four Point-class sealift ships from the Merchant Navy available to the RFA under a private finance initiative, while the civilian Marine Services operate auxiliary vessels which further support the Royal Navy in various capacities. The RFA replenishes Royal Navy warships at sea and, as of 2024-25, provides the lead elements of the Royal Navy&#x27;s amphibious warfare capabilities through its three vessels. It also works as a force multiplier for the Royal Navy, often doing patrols that frigates used to do.

The Royal Navy is part of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Service, which also includes the Royal Marines and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The professional head of the Naval Service is the First Sea Lord who is an admiral and member of the Defence Council of the United Kingdom. The Defence Council delegates management of the Naval Service to the Admiralty Board, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence. The Royal Navy operates from three bases in Britain where commissioned ships and submarines are based: Portsmouth, Clyde and Devonport, the last being the largest operational naval base in Western Europe, as well as two naval air stations, RNAS Yeovilton and RNAS Culdrose where maritime aircraft are based.

==Role==
The Royal Navy stated its six major roles in umbrella terms in 2017 as.
* Preventing Conflict – On a global and regional level
* Providing Security At Sea – To ensure the stability of international trade at sea
* International Partnerships – To help cement the relationship with the United Kingdom&#x27;s allies (such as NATO)
* Maintaining a Readiness To Fight – To protect the United Kingdom&#x27;s interests across the globe 
* Protecting the Economy – To safeguard vital trade routes to guarantee the United Kingdom&#x27;s and its allies&#x27; economic prosperity at sea
* Providing Humanitarian Aid – To deliver a fast and effective response to global catastrophes

The Royal Navy protects British interests at home and abroad, executing the foreign and defence policies of His Majesty&#x27;s Government through the exercise of military effect, diplomatic activities and other activities in support of these objectives. It is also a key element of the British contribution to NATO, with a number of ships or aircraft allocated to NATO tasks at any time. In 2007 core capabilities were described as:

* Maintenance of the UK Nuclear Deterrent through a policy of &quot;Continuous at Sea Deterrence&quot;
* Provision of two medium-scale maritime task groups with the Fleet Air Arm
* Delivery of the UK Commando force
* Contribution of assets to the Joint Aviation Command
* Maintenance of standing patrol commitments
* Provision of mine counter measures capability to United Kingdom and allied commitments
* Provision of hydrographic and meteorological services deployable worldwide
* Protection of Britain&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone

==History==
The English Royal Navy was formally founded in 1546 by Henry VIII, though the Kingdom of England had possessed less-organised naval forces for centuries prior to this.

The Royal Scots Navy (or Old Scots Navy) had its origins in the Middle Ages until its merger with the English Royal Navy per the Acts of Union 1707.

===Earlier fleets===
During much of the medieval period, fleets or &quot;king&#x27;s ships&quot; were often established or gathered for specific campaigns or actions, and these would disperse afterwards. These were generally merchant ships enlisted into service. Unlike some European states, England did not maintain a small permanent core of warships in peacetime. England&#x27;s naval organisation was haphazard and the mobilisation of fleets when war broke out was slow. Control of the sea only became critical to Anglo-Saxon kings in the 10th century. In the 11th century, Aethelred II had a large fleet built by a national levy. During the period of Danish rule in the 11th century, authorities maintained a standing fleet by taxation, and this continued for a time under Edward the Confessor, who frequently commanded fleets in person. After the Norman Conquest, English naval power waned and England suffered large naval raids from the Vikings. In 1069, this allowed for the invasion and ravaging of England by Jarl Osborn, brother of King Svein Estridsson, and his sons.

The lack of an organised navy came to a head during the First Barons&#x27; War, in which Prince Louis of France invaded England in support of northern barons. With King John unable to organise a navy, this meant the French landed at Sandwich unopposed in April 1216. John&#x27;s flight to Winchester and his death later that year left the Earl of Pembroke as regent, and he was able to marshal ships to fight the French in the Battle of Sandwich in 1217 – one of the first major English battles at sea. The outbreak of the Hundred Years War emphasised the need for an English fleet. French plans for an invasion of England failed when Edward III of England destroyed the French fleet in the Battle of Sluys in 1340. England&#x27;s naval forces could not prevent frequent raids on the south-coast ports by the French and their allies. Such raids halted only with the occupation of northern France by Henry V. A Scottish fleet existed by the reign of William the Lion. In the early 13th century there was a resurgence of Viking naval power in the region. The Vikings clashed with Scotland over control of the isles though Alexander III was ultimately successful in asserting Scottish control. The Scottish fleet was of particular import in repulsing English forces in the early 14th century.

===Age of Sail===

A standing &quot;Navy Royal&quot;, with its own secretariat, dockyards and a permanent core of purpose-built warships, emerged during the reign of Henry VIII. Under Elizabeth I, England became involved in a war with Spain, which saw privately owned vessels combining with the Queen&#x27;s ships in highly profitable raids against Spanish commerce and colonies. The Royal Navy was then used in 1588 to repulse the Spanish Armada, but the English Armada was lost the next year. In 1603, the Union of the Crowns created a personal union between England and Scotland. While the two remained distinct sovereign states for a further century, the two navies increasingly fought as a single force. During the early 17th century, England&#x27;s relative naval power deteriorated until Charles I undertook a major programme of shipbuilding. His methods of financing the fleet contributed to the outbreak of the English Civil War, and the abolition of the monarchy.

The Commonwealth of England replaced many names and symbols in the new Commonwealth Navy, associated with royalty and the high church, and expanded it to become the most powerful in the world. The fleet was quickly tested in the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–1654) and the Anglo-Spanish War (1654–1660), which saw the British conquest of Jamaica and successful attacks on Spanish treasure fleets. The 1660 Restoration saw Charles II rename the Royal Navy again, and started use of the prefix HMS. The Navy remained a national institution and not a possession of the Crown as it had been before. Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688, England joined the War of the Grand Alliance which marked the end of France&#x27;s brief pre-eminence at sea and the beginning of an enduring British supremacy which would help with the creation of the British Empire.

In 1707, the Scottish navy was united with the English Royal Navy. On Scottish men-of-war, the cross of St Andrew was replaced with the Union Jack. On English ships, the red, white, or blue ensigns had the St George&#x27;s Cross of England removed from the canton, and the combined crosses of the Union flag put in its place. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the Royal Navy was the largest maritime force in the world, maintaining superiority in financing, tactics, training, organisation, social cohesion, hygiene, logistical support and warship design. The peace settlement following the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–1714) granted Britain Gibraltar and Menorca, providing the Navy with Mediterranean bases. The expansion of the Royal Navy would encourage the British colonisation of the Americas, with British (North) America becoming a vital source of timber for the Royal Navy. There was a defeat during the frustrated siege of Cartagena de Indias in 1741. A new French attempt to invade Britain was thwarted by the defeat of their escort fleet in the extraordinary Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759, fought in dangerous conditions. In 1762, the resumption of hostilities with Spain led to the British capture of Manila and of Havana, along with a Spanish fleet sheltering there. British naval supremacy could however be challenged still in this period by coalitions of other nations, as seen in the American War of Independence. The United States was allied to France, and the Netherlands and Spain were also at war with Britain. In the Battle of the Chesapeake, the British fleet failed to lift the French blockade, resulting in the surrender of an entire British army at Yorktown. 

The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1793–1801, 1803–1814 &amp; 1815) saw the Royal Navy reach a peak of efficiency, dominating the navies of all Britain&#x27;s adversaries, which spent most of the war blockaded in port. Under Lord Nelson, the navy defeated the combined Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar (1805). Ships of the line and even frigates, as well as manpower, were prioritised for the naval war in Europe, however, leaving only smaller vessels on the North America Station and other less active stations, and a heavy reliance upon impressed labour. This would result in problems countering large, well-armed United States Navy frigates which outgunned Royal Naval vessels in single-opponent actions, as well as United States privateers, when the American War of 1812 broke out concurrent with the war against Napoleonic France and its allies. The Royal Navy still enjoyed a numerical advantage over the former colonists on the Atlantic, and from its base in Bermuda it blockaded the Atlantic seaboard of the United States throughout the war and carried out (with Royal Marines, Colonial Marines, British Army, and Board of Ordnance military corps units) various amphibious operations, most notably the Chesapeake campaign. On the Great Lakes, however, the United States Navy established an advantage.

===Splendid isolation===
In 1860, Albert, Prince Consort, wrote to the Foreign Secretary John Russell, 1st Earl Russell with his concern about &quot;a perfect disgrace to our country, and particularly to the Admiralty&quot;. The stated shipbuilding policy of the British monarchy was to take advantage of technological change and so be able to deploy a new weapons system that could defend British interests before other national and imperial resources are reasonably mobilized. Nevertheless, British taxpayers scrutinized progress in modernizing the Royal Navy so as to ensure, that taypayers&#x27; money is not wasted.

Between 1815 and 1914, the Royal Navy saw little serious action, owing to the absence of any opponent strong enough to challenge its dominance. It did not suffer the drastic cutbacks the various military forces underwent in the period of economic austerity that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the American War of 1812 (when the British Army and the Board of Ordnance military corps were cut back, weakening garrisons around the Empire, the Militia became a paper tiger, and the Volunteer Force and Fencible units disbanded, though the Yeomanry was maintained as a back-up to the police). Britain relied, throughout the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, on imperial fortress colonies (originally Bermuda, Gibraltar, Halifax (Nova Scotia), and Malta). These areas permitted Britain to control the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Control of military forces in Nova Scotia passed to the new Government of Canada after the 1867 Confederation of Canada and control of the naval dockyard in Halifax, Nova Scotia was transferred to the Government of Canada in 1905, five years prior to the establishment of the Royal Canadian Navy. Prior to the 1920s, it was presumed that the only navies that could challenge the Royal Navy belonged to nations on the Atlantic Ocean or its connected seas, despite the growth of the Imperial Russian and United States Pacific fleets during the latter half of the 19th Century. Britain relied on Malta, in the Mediterranean Sea, to project power to the Indian Ocean and western Pacific Ocean via the Suez Canal after its completion in 1869. It relied on friendship and common interests between Britain and the United States (which controlled transit through the Panama Canal, completed in 1914) during and after the First World War, and on Bermuda, to project power the length of the western Atlantic, including the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The area controlled from Bermuda (and Halifax until 1905) had been part of the North America Station, until the 1820s, which then absorbed the Jamaica Station to become the North America and West Indies Station. After the First World War, this formation assumed responsibility for the eastern Pacific Ocean and the western South Atlantic and was known as the &quot;America and West Indies Station&quot; until 1956. In 1921, due to the ambitions of Imperial Japan and the threat of the Imperial Japanese Navy, it was decided to construct the Singapore Naval Base.

During this period, naval warfare underwent a comprehensive transformation, brought about by steam propulsion, metal ship construction, and explosive munitions. Despite having to completely replace its war fleet, the Navy managed to maintain its overwhelming advantage over all potential rivals. Owing to British leadership in the Industrial Revolution, the country enjoyed unparalleled shipbuilding capacity and financial resources, which ensured that no rival could take advantage of these revolutionary changes to negate the British advantage in ship numbers.

In 1889, Parliament passed the Naval Defence Act, which formally adopted the &#x27;two-power standard&#x27;, which stipulated that the Royal Navy should maintain a number of battleships at least equal to the combined strength of the next two largest navies. The end of the 19th century saw structural changes and older vessels were scrapped or placed into reserve, making funds and manpower available for newer ships. The launch of in 1906 rendered all existing battleships obsolete. The transition at this time from coal to fuel-oil for boiler firing would encourage Britain to expand their foothold in former Ottoman territories in the Middle East, especially Iraq.

===Exploration===

The Royal Navy played an historic role in several great global explorations of science and discovery. Beginning in the 18th century many great voyages were commissioned often in co-operation with the Royal Society, such as the Northwest Passage expedition of 1741. James Cook led three great voyages, with goals such as discovering Terra Australis, observing the Transit of Venus and searching for the elusive North-West Passage, these voyages are considered to have contributed to world knowledge and science. In the late 18th century, during a four year voyage Captain George Vancouver made detailed maps of the western coastline of North America.

In the 19th century, Charles Darwin made further contributions to science during the second voyage of HMS Beagle. The Ross expedition to the Antarctic made several important discoveries in biology and zoology. Several of the Royal Navy&#x27;s voyages ended in disaster such as those of Franklin and Scott. Between 1872 and 1876 undertook the first global marine research expedition, the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition.

===World War I===

During World War I, the Royal Navy&#x27;s strength was mostly deployed at home in the Grand Fleet, confronting the German High Seas Fleet across the North Sea. Several inconclusive clashes took place between them, chiefly the Battle of Jutland in 1916. The British fighting advantage proved insurmountable, leading the High Seas Fleet to abandon any attempt to challenge British dominance. The Royal Navy under John Jellicoe also tried to avoid combat and remained in port at Scapa Flow for much of the war. This was contrary to widespread prewar expectations that in the event of a Continental conflict Britain would primarily provide naval support to the Entente Powers while sending at most only a small ground army. Nevertheless, the Royal Navy played an important role in securing the British Isles and the English Channel, notably ferrying the entire British Expeditionary Force to the Western Front at the beginning of the war without the loss of a single life.

The Royal Navy nevertheless remained active in other theatres, most notably in the Mediterranean Sea, where they waged the Dardanelles and Gallipoli campaigns in 1914 and 1915. British cruisers hunted down German commerce raiders across the world&#x27;s oceans in 1914 and 1915, including the battles of Coronel, Falklands Islands, Cocos, and Rufiji Delta, among others.

===Interwar period===
At the end of World War I, the Royal Navy remained by far the world&#x27;s most powerful navy, larger than the U.S. Navy and French Navy combined, and over twice as large as the Imperial Japanese Navy and Royal Italian Navy combined. Its former primary competitor, the Imperial German Navy, was destroyed at the end of the war. In the inter-war period, the Royal Navy was stripped of much of its power. The Washington and London Naval Treaties imposed the scrapping of some capital ships and limitations on new construction.

The lack of an imperial fortress in the region of Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean was always to be a weakness throughout the 19th century as the former North American colonies that had become the United States of America had multiplied towards the Pacific Coast of North America, and the Russian Empire and Japanese Empire both had ports on the Pacific and had begun building large, modern fleets which went to war with each other in 1904. Britain&#x27;s reliance on Malta, via the Suez Canal, as the nearest Imperial fortress was improved, relying on amity and common interests that developed between Britain and the United States during and after World War I, by the completion of the Panama Canal in 1914, allowing the cruisers based in Bermuda to more easily and rapidly reach the eastern Pacific Ocean (after the war, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Bermuda-based &quot;North America and West Indies Station&quot; was consequently re-designated the &quot;America and West Indies station&quot;, including a South American division. The rising power and increasing belligerence of the Japanese Empire after World War I, however, resulted in the construction of the Singapore Naval Base, which was completed in 1938, less than four years before hostilities with Japan did commence during World War II.

In 1932, the Invergordon Mutiny took place in the Atlantic Fleet over the National Government&#x27;s proposed 25% pay cut, which was eventually reduced to 10%. International tensions increased in the mid-1930s and the re-armament of the Royal Navy was well under way by 1938. In addition to new construction, several existing old battleships, battlecruisers and heavy cruisers were reconstructed, and anti-aircraft weaponry reinforced, while new technologies, such as ASDIC, Huff-Duff and hydrophones, were developed.

===World War II===

At the start of World War II in 1939, the Royal Navy was still the largest in the world, with over 1,400 vessels. The Royal Navy provided critical cover during Operation Dynamo, the British evacuations from Dunkirk, and as the ultimate deterrent to a German invasion of Britain during the following four months. The Luftwaffe under Hermann Göring attempted to gain air supremacy over southern England in the Battle of Britain in order to neutralise the Home Fleet, but faced stiff resistance from the Royal Air Force. The Luftwaffe bombing offensive during the Kanalkampf phase of the battle targeted naval convoys and bases in order to lure large concentrations of RAF fighters into attrition warfare. At Taranto, Admiral Cunningham commanded a fleet that launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history. The Royal Navy suffered heavy losses in the first two years of the war. Over 3,000 people were lost when the converted troopship &quot;Lancastria&quot; was sunk in June 1940, the greatest maritime disaster in Britain&#x27;s history. The Navy&#x27;s most critical struggle was the Battle of the Atlantic defending Britain&#x27;s vital North American commercial supply lines against U-boat attack. A traditional convoy system was instituted from the start of the war, but German submarine tactics, based on group attacks by &quot;wolf-packs&quot;, were much more effective than in the previous war, and the threat remained serious for well over three years.

===Cold War===
After World War II, the decline of the British Empire and the economic hardships in Britain forced the reduction in the size and capability of the Royal Navy. The United States Navy instead took on the role of global naval power. Governments since have faced increasing budgetary pressures, partly due to the increasing cost of weapons systems. 

In 1981, Defence Secretary John Nott had advocated and initiated a series of cutbacks to the Navy. The Falklands War however proved a need for the Royal Navy to regain an expeditionary and littoral capability which, with its resources and structure at the time, would prove difficult. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Royal Navy was a force focused on blue-water anti-submarine warfare. Its purpose was to search for and destroy Soviet submarines in the North Atlantic, and to operate the nuclear deterrent submarine force. The navy received its first nuclear weapons with the introduction of the first of the s armed with the Polaris missile.

===Post-Cold War===
Following the conclusion of the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War in 1991, the Royal Navy began to experience a gradual decline in its fleet size in accordance with the changed strategic environment it operated in. While new and more capable ships are continually brought into service, such as the s, s, and Type 45 destroyers, the total number of ships and submarines operated has continued to steadily reduce. This has caused considerable debate about the size of the Royal Navy. A 2013 report found that the Royal Navy was already too small, and that Britain would have to depend on her allies if her territories were attacked. 

The Royal Navy was responsible for training the fledgling Iraqi Navy and securing Iraq&#x27;s oil terminals following the cessation of hostilities in the country. The Iraqi Training and Advisory Mission (Navy) (Umm Qasr), headed by a Royal Navy captain, has been responsible for the former duty whilst Commander Task Force Iraqi Maritime, a Royal Navy commodore, was responsible for the latter. The mission ended in May 2011.

The financial costs attached to nuclear deterrence, including Trident missile upgrades and replacements, have become an increasingly significant issue for the navy.

==Assets and resources==

===Personnel===

 at Torpoint, Cornwall, is the basic training facility for newly enlisted ratings. Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, Devon is the initial officer training establishment for the Royal Navy. Personnel are divided into a warfare branch, which includes Warfare Officers (previously named seamen officers) and Naval Aviators, as well other branches including the Royal Naval Engineers, Royal Navy Medical Branch, and Logistics Officers (previously named Supply Officers). Present-day officers and ratings have several different uniforms; some are designed to be worn aboard ship, others ashore or in ceremonial duties. Women began to join the Royal Navy in 1917 with the formation of the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), which was disbanded after the end of the First World War in 1919. It was revived in 1939, and the WRNS continued until disbandment in 1993, as a result of the decision to fully integrate women into the structures of the Royal Navy. Women now serve in all sections of the Royal Navy including the Royal Marines.

In August 2019, the Ministry of Defence published figures showing that the Royal Navy and Royal Marines had 29,090 full-time trained personnel compared with a target of 30,600. In 2023, it was reported that the Royal Navy was experiencing significant recruiting challenges with a net drop of some 1,600 personnel (4 percent of the force) from mid-2022 to mid-2023. This was posing a significant problem in the ability of the navy to meet its commitments. 

In December 2019 the First Sea Lord, Admiral Tony Radakin, outlined a proposal to reduce the number of Rear-Admirals at Navy Command by five. The fighting arms (excluding Commandant General Royal Marines) would be reduced to commodore (1-star) rank and the surface flotillas would be combined. Training would be concentrated under the Fleet Commander.

===Surface fleet===
====Aircraft carriers====

The Royal Navy has two &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers. Each carrier cost £3.2 billion and has an empty load displacement of , rising up to an estimated full load displacement. Both are intended to operate the STOVL variant of the F-35 Lightning II. The first, , commenced flight trials in 2018. &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; began sea trials in June 2017, was commissioned later that year, and entered service in 2020, while the second, , began sea trials on 22 September 2019, was commissioned in December 2019 and was declared operational as of October 2021. The aircraft carriers form a central part of the UK Carrier Strike Group alongside escorts and support ships.

====Amphibious warfare====
Until 2024/25, the Royal Navy&#x27;s amphibious capability consisted of two landing platform docks ( and ). While their primary role was to conduct amphibious warfare, they were also deployed for humanitarian aid missions. Both vessels were in reserve as of 2024 and in November 2024, the newly elected Labour government indicated that they would in fact be retired from service completely by March 2025. While second-line amphibious capabilities remained within the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, the future of the navy&#x27;s amphibious capability was now in question.

====Clearance diving====
The Royal Navy clearance diving unit, the Fleet Diving Squadron, was reorganised and renamed the Diving and Threat Exploitation Group in 2022. The group consists of five squadrons: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, and Echo. The Royal Navy has a separate unit with divers the special forces unit the Special Boat Service.

====Escort fleet====
The escort fleet comprises guided missile destroyers and frigates and is the traditional workhorse of the Navy. there are six Type 45 destroyers and eight Type 23 frigates in commission. Among their primary roles is to provide escort for the larger capital ships—protecting them from air, surface and subsurface threats. Other duties include undertaking the Royal Navy&#x27;s standing deployments across the globe, which often consists of: counter-narcotics, anti-piracy missions and providing humanitarian aid.

The Type 45 is primarily designed for anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare and the Royal Navy describe the destroyer&#x27;s mission as &quot;to shield the Fleet from air attack&quot;. They are equipped with the PAAMS (also known as Sea Viper) integrated anti-aircraft warfare system which incorporates the sophisticated SAMPSON and S1850M long range radars and the Aster 15 and 30 missiles.

Sixteen Type 23 frigates were delivered to the Royal Navy, with the final vessel, , commissioned in June 2002. However, the 2004 Delivering Security in a Changing World review announced that three frigates would be paid off as part of a cost-cutting exercise, and these were subsequently sold to the Chilean Navy. The 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review announced that the remaining 13 Type 23 frigates would eventually be replaced by the Type 26 Frigate, with the incremental retirement of the remaining Type 23s commencing in 2021. The Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 reduced the procurement of Type 26 to eight with five Type 31e frigates also to be procured.

====Mine countermeasure vessels (MCMV)====
There are two classes of MCMVs in the Royal Navy: one and six s. All the Sandown-class vessels are to be withdrawn from service by 2025 and are being replaced by autonomous systems that are planned to operate from a range of vessels, including so-called &quot;motherships&quot; planned for procurement for either the navy or the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. The Hunt-class vessels combine the separate roles of the traditional minesweeper and the active minehunter in one hull. If required, the vessels can take on the role of offshore patrol vessels.

====Offshore patrol vessels (OPV)====
A fleet of eight River-class offshore patrol vessels are in service with the Royal Navy. The three Batch 1 ships of the class serve in U.K. waters in a sovereignty and fisheries protection role while the five Batch 2 ships are forward-deployed on a long-term basis to Gibraltar, the Caribbean, the Falkland Islands and the Indo-Pacific region. The vessel MV &quot;Grampian Frontier&quot; is leased from Scottish-based North Star Shipping for patrol duties around the British Indian Ocean Territory. However, she is not in commission with the Royal Navy.

In December 2019, the modified Batch 1 River-class vessel, , was decommissioned, with the Batch 2 taking over duties as the Falkland Islands patrol ship.

====Survey ships====
 is a dedicated Antarctica patrol ship that fulfils the nation&#x27;s mandate to provide support to the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). is an ocean survey vessel and at 13,500 tonnes is one of the largest ships in the Navy. As of 2018, the newly commissioned also undertakes survey duties at sea. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary plans to introduce two new Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance Ships, in part to protect undersea cables and gas pipelines and partly to compensate for the withdrawal of all ocean-going survey vessels from Royal Navy service. The first of these vessels, RFA Proteus, entered service in October 2023.

====Royal Fleet Auxiliary====

The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) provides support to the Royal Navy at sea in several capacities. For fleet replenishment, it deploys one Fleet Solid Support Ship (in reserve as of late 2024) and four fleet tankers (one of which is maintained in reserve). The RFA also has one aviation training and casualty reception vessel, which also operates as a Littoral Strike Ship.

Three amphibious transport docks are also incorporated within its fleet. These are known as the landing ships, of which four were introduced in 2006–2007, but one was sold to the Royal Australian Navy in 2011. In November 2006, the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Jonathon Band described the Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels as &quot;a major uplift in the Royal Navy&#x27;s war fighting capability&quot;.

In February 2023, a commercial vessel was also acquired to act as a Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance (MROS) Ship for the protection of critical seabed infrastructure and other tasks. She entered service as RFA &quot;Proteus&quot;. An additional vessel, , was acquired in 2023 to act as a mothership for autonomous minehunting systems.

====Other ships====
The Royal Navy also includes a number of smaller non-commissioned assets such as the Sea-class workboats. On 29 July 2022, the Royal Navy christened a new experimental ship, XV &quot;Patrick Blackett&quot;, which it aims to use as a testbed for autonomous systems. Whilst the ship flies the Blue Ensign, it is crewed by Royal Navy personnel and will participate in Royal Navy and NATO exercises.

===Submarine Service===
The Submarine Service is the submarine based element of the Royal Navy. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Silent Service&quot;, as the submarines are generally required to operate undetected. Founded in 1901, the service made history in 1982 when, during the Falklands War, became the first nuclear-powered submarine to sink a surface ship, . Today, all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarines are nuclear-powered.

====Ballistic missile submarines (SSBN)====
The Royal Navy operates four ballistic missile submarines displacing nearly 16,000 tonnes and equipped with Trident II missiles (armed with nuclear weapons) and heavyweight Spearfish torpedoes, to carry out Operation Relentless, the United Kingdom&#x27;s Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD). The UK government has committed to replace these submarines with four new s, which will enter service in the &quot;early 2030s&quot; to maintain this capability.

====Fleet submarines (SSN)====
As of December 2024, five fleet submarines of the &quot;Astute-&quot;class are in commission with the one remaining Trafalgar class submarine preparing to decommission. Two more &quot;Astute-&quot;class fleet submarines are scheduled to enter service by the mid-2020s.

The &quot;Astute-&quot;class, at 7,400 tonnes, carry both Tomahawk land-attack missiles and Spearfish torpedoes. In 2022, was the most recent &quot;Astute&quot;-class boat to be commissioned.

===Fleet Air Arm===


The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) is the branch of the Royal Navy responsible for the operation of naval aircraft, it can trace its roots back to 1912 and the formation of the Royal Flying Corps. The Fleet Air Arm currently operates the AW-101 Merlin HC4 (in support of UK Commando Force) as the Commando Helicopter Force; the AW-159 Wildcat HM2; the AW101 Merlin HM2 in the anti-submarine role; and the F-35B Lightning II in the carrier strike role.

Pilots designated for rotary wing service train under No. 1 Flying Training School (1 FTS) at RAF Shawbury.

===Royal Marines===

The Royal Marines are an amphibious, specialised light infantry force of commandos, capable of deploying at short notice in support of His Majesty&#x27;s Government&#x27;s military and diplomatic objectives overseas. The Royal Marines are organised into a highly mobile light infantry brigade (UK Commando Force) and 7 commando units including 47 Commando (Raiding Group) Royal Marines, 43 Commando Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines and a company strength commitment to the Special Forces Support Group. The Corps operates in all environments and climates, though particular expertise and training is spent on amphibious warfare, Arctic warfare, mountain warfare, expeditionary warfare and commitment to the UK&#x27;s Rapid Reaction Force. The Royal Marines are also the primary source of personnel for the Royal Navy&#x27;s special forces unit the Special Boat Service (SBS).

The Corps operates its own fleet of landing and other craft, and also incorporates the Royal Marines Band Service, the musical wing of the Royal Navy.

The Royal Marines have seen constant action since they were formed, often fighting beside the British Army; including in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, World War I and World War II. Most has been offshore away from the United Kingdom. In recent times, the Corps has been deployed in the Falklands War, the Gulf War, the Bosnian War, the Kosovo War, the Sierra Leone Civil War, the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021). The Royal Marines have international ties with allied marine forces, particularly the United States Marine Corps and the Netherlands Marine Corps/Korps Mariniers.

==Command, control and organisation==
The Sovereign is the Commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. The titular head of the Royal Navy is the Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom, a position which was held by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh from 2011 until his death in 2021 and which remains in the reigning monarch&#x27;s gift. The position had been held by Queen Elizabeth II from 1964 to 2011. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is &quot;de facto&quot; commander-in-chief of the armed forces, with the Secretary of State for Defence the minister permanently responsible. The professional head of the Naval Service is the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff (1SL/CNS), an admiral and member of the Defence Council of the United Kingdom. The Defence Council delegates management of the Naval Service to the Admiralty Board, chaired by the Secretary of State for Defence, which directs the Navy Board, a sub-committee of the Admiralty Board comprising only naval officers and Ministry of Defence (MOD) civil servants. These are all based in the Ministry of Defence Main Building in London, where the First Sea Lord &amp; CNS is supported by the Naval Staff.

===Organisation===
The Fleet Commander has responsibility for the provision of ships, submarines and aircraft ready for any operations that the Government requires. Fleet Commander exercises his authority through the Navy Command Headquarters, based at in Portsmouth. Day-to-day operational command of ships, aircraft and Royal Marines is split: large deployed operations such as United Kingdom Carrier Strike Group 21 (Operation Fortis) often fall under the Permanent Joint Headquarters of the United Kingdom&#x27;s armed forces, at Northwood in the northwest suburbs of London; while across the same site at the Northwood Headquarters, Commander Operations (Royal Navy) supervises individual ships on independent activities and the patrolling Vanguard-class submarine. The UK retains control of the NATO functional Allied Maritime Command, also on the same site.

The Royal Navy was the first of the three armed forces to combine the personnel and training command, under the Principal Personnel Officer, with the operational and policy command, combining the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, Fleet and Naval Home Command into a single organisation, Fleet Command, in 2005 and becoming Navy Command in 2008. Within the combined command, the Second Sea Lord continues to act as the Principal Personnel Officer. Previously, Flag Officer Sea Training was part of the list of top senior appointments in Navy Command, however, as part of the Navy Command Transformation Programme, the post has reduced from Rear-Admiral to Commodore, renamed as Commander Fleet Operational Sea Training.

The Naval Command senior appointments are:
The Commandant General Royal Marines was previously a major-general&#x27;s post and charged with leading amphibious warfare operations. Since Lieutenant General Robert Magowan was appointed for the second time the post is an additional responsibility for a senior Royal Marine holding other duties. The current CG RM is General Gwyn Jenkins, the Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.

Intelligence support to fleet operations is provided by intelligence sections at the various headquarters and from MOD Defence Intelligence, renamed from the Defence Intelligence Staff in early 2010.

===Current deployments===
The Royal Navy is currently deployed in different areas of the world, including some standing Royal Navy deployments. These include several home tasks as well as overseas deployments. The Navy is deployed in the Mediterranean as part of standing NATO deployments including mine countermeasures and NATO Maritime Group 2. In both the North and South Atlantic, RN vessels are patrolling. There is always a Falkland Islands patrol vessel on deployment, currently HMS &quot;Forth&quot;.

The Royal Navy operates a Response Force Task Group (a product of the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review), which is poised to respond globally to short-notice tasking across a range of defence activities, such as non-combatant evacuation operations, disaster relief, humanitarian aid or amphibious operations. In 2011, the first deployment of the task group occurred under the name &#x27;COUGAR 11&#x27; which saw them transit through the Mediterranean where they took part in multinational amphibious exercises before moving further east through the Suez Canal for further exercises in the Indian Ocean.

In the Persian Gulf, the RN sustains commitments in support of both national and coalition efforts to stabilise the region. Operation Kipion is the navy&#x27;s primary activity in the Gulf region. The Royal Navy also contributes to the US-led Combined Maritime Forces in the Gulf in partnership with the United States. The UK Maritime Component Commander, overseer of all of His Majesty&#x27;s warships in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters, is also deputy commander of the Combined Maritime Forces. 

The Royal Navy contributes to standing NATO formations and maintains forces as part of the NATO Response Force. The RN also has a long-standing commitment to supporting the Five Powers Defence Arrangements countries and occasionally deploys to the Far East as a result. This deployment typically consists of a frigate and a survey vessel, operating separately. Operation Atalanta, the European Union&#x27;s anti-piracy operation in the Indian Ocean, is permanently commanded by a senior Royal Navy or Royal Marines officer at Northwood Headquarters and the navy contributes ships to the operation.

From 2015, the Royal Navy also re-formed its UK Carrier Strike Group (UKCSG) after it was disbanded in 2011 due to the retirement of HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and Harrier GR9s. The &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers form the central part of this formation, supported by various escorts and support ships, with the aim to facilitate carrier-enabled power projection. The UKCSG first assembled at sea in October 2020 as part of a rehearsal for its first operational deployment in 2021.

In 2019, the Royal Navy announced the formation of two Littoral Response Groups as part of a transformation of its amphibious forces. These forward-based special operations-capable task groups were to be rapidly-deployable and able to carry out a range of tasks within the littoral, including raids and precision strikes. The first one, based in Europe, became operational in 2021, whilst the second was to be ready for deployment in the Indo-Pacific from 2023. They centred around the two navy amphibious assault ships, amphibious auxiliary ships from the Royal Fleet Auxiliary, elements from the Royal Marines and supporting units. However, in November 2024, with the government&#x27;s decision to retire the &quot;Albion&quot;-class assault ships, the viability of these plans were brought into question.

===Locations===

Historically the Navy had a number of geographical commands, each under a Commander-in-Chief, and often informally referred to as &quot;stations.&quot; Over 300 years to 1971 these commands were repeatedly reduced in number, until they were merged into a single entity. The former stations of the Royal Navy included the East Indies Station (1744–1831); East Indies and China Station (1832–1865); East Indies Station (1865–1913); Egypt and East Indies Station (1913–1918); East Indies Station (1918–1941). Later the Eastern Fleet became the East Indies Fleet. In 1952, after the Second World War ended, the East Indies Fleet became the Far East Fleet. In 1971 the final merger into a single fleet took place with Far East Fleet merged into the larger single formation under the orders of the Commander-in-Chief Fleet (CINCFLEET).

The Royal Navy currently operates from three bases in the United Kingdom where commissioned ships are based; Portsmouth, Clyde and Devonport, Plymouth—Devonport is the largest operational naval base in the UK and Western Europe. Each base hosts a flotilla command under a commodore, responsible for the provision of operational capability using the ships and submarines within the flotilla. UK Commando Force is similarly commanded by a brigadier and based in Plymouth.

The Royal Navy has historically maintained Royal Navy Dockyards around the world. Dockyards of the Royal Navy are harbours where ships are overhauled and refitted. Only four are operating today; at Devonport, Faslane, Rosyth and at Portsmouth. A Naval Base Review was undertaken in 2006 and early 2007, the outcome being announced by Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, confirming that all would remain however some reductions in manpower were anticipated.

The academy where initial training for future Royal Navy officers takes place is Britannia Royal Naval College, located on a hill overlooking Dartmouth, Devon. Basic training for future ratings takes place at HMS &quot;Raleigh&quot; at Torpoint, Cornwall, close to HMNB Devonport.

Significant numbers of naval personnel are employed within the Ministry of Defence, Defence Equipment and Support and on exchange with the Army and Royal Air Force. Small numbers are also on exchange within other government departments and with allied fleets, such as the United States Navy. The navy also posts personnel in small units around the world to support ongoing operations and maintain standing commitments. Nineteen personnel are stationed in Gibraltar to support the small Gibraltar Squadron, the RN&#x27;s only permanent overseas squadron. Some personnel are also based at East Cove Military Port and RAF Mount Pleasant in the Falkland Islands to support APT(S). Small numbers of personnel are based in Diego Garcia (Naval Party 1002), Miami (NP 1011 – AUTEC), Singapore (NP 1022), Dubai (NP 1023) and elsewhere.

On 6 December 2014, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced it would expand the UK&#x27;s naval facilities in Bahrain to support larger Royal Navy ships deployed to the Persian Gulf. Once completed, it became the UK&#x27;s first permanent military base located East of Suez since it withdrew from the region in 1971. The base is reportedly large enough to accommodate Type 45 destroyers and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers.

====Bases in the United Kingdom====
*HMNB Devonport (HMS &quot;Drake&quot;) – This is currently the largest operational naval base in Western Europe. Devonport&#x27;s flotilla consists of most of the Type 23 frigates. In the past, Devonport was also home to some of the RN&#x27;s submarine service.

*HMNB Portsmouth (HMS &quot;Nelson&quot;) – This is home to the Queen Elizabeth Class supercarriers. Portsmouth is also the home to the Type 45 Daring Class Destroyer and a moderate fleet of Type 23 frigates as well as Overseas Patrol Squadron.
*HMNB Clyde (HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;) – This is situated in Central Scotland along the River Clyde. Faslane is known as the home of the UK&#x27;s nuclear deterrent, as it maintains the fleet of &quot;Vanguard&quot;-class ballistic missile (SSBN) submarines, as well as the fleet of &quot;Astute&quot;-class fleet (SSN) submarines. Faslane will become the home to all Royal Navy submarines, and thus the RN Submarine Service. As a result, 43 Commando (Fleet Protection Group) are stationed in Faslane alongside to guard the base as well as The Royal Naval Armaments Depot at Coulport. The newly established Mine and Threat Exploitation Group (MTXG) is also based within Faslane as a successor to the Sandown class mine hunters. Moreover, Faslane is also home to Faslane Patrol Boat Squadron (FPBS) who operates a fleet of Archer class patrol vessels.

*RNAS Yeovilton (HMS &quot;Heron&quot;) – Yeovilton is home to Commando Helicopter Force and Wildcat Maritime Force.

*RNAS Culdrose (HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;) – This is home to Mk2 Merlins, primarily tasked with conducting Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) and Early Airborne Warning (EAW). Culdrose is also currently the largest helicopter base in Europe.
* – Previously known as RNAS Prestwick. Previously used for Defence of the Clyde and Search and Rescue tasking, it is now used primarily as a FOB for ASW Merlins deployed from RNAS Culdrose to support the SSBN and defence of the Clyde tasking.

====Bases abroad====

* UK National Support Element (Bahrain) – The home port for vessels deployed on Operation Kipion and acts as the hub of the Royal Navy&#x27;s operations in the Persian Gulf, Red Sea and Indian Ocean. Vessels based there include the 9th Mine Countermeasures Squadron, and (as of early 2023) .
* UK Joint Logistics Support Base (Oman) – A logistical support facility which is strategically located in the Middle East but outside the Persian Gulf.
* British Defence Singapore Support Unit (Singapore) – A remnant of HMNB Singapore which repairs and resupplies Royal Navy ships in the Asia Pacific. It is the primary logistics support hub for the Royal Navy offshore patrol vessels assigned to the Asia-Pacific region, and .
* HMNB Gibraltar – A current Royal Navy dockyard in Gibraltar which is still used for docking, repairs, training and resupply. Vessels permanently based with the Gibraltar Squadron include the Offshore Patrol Ship, HMS &quot;Trent&quot; and the &quot;Cutlass&quot;-class fast patrol boats, HMS &quot;Cutlass&quot; and HMS &quot;Dagger&quot;.
* Mare Harbour (Falkland Islands) – Serves as the port facility for RAF Mount Pleasant, the main British base in the Falkland Islands. Mare Harbour incorporates several berths which support Royal Navy and marine services vessels operating in the South Atlantic. The facility also supports the British Antarctic Survey ship, RRS Sir David Attenborough, when she operates in Antarctic waters during the regional summer.

==Titles and naming==
===Of the Navy===

The navy was referred to as the &quot;Navy Royal&quot; at the time of its founding in 1546, and this title remained in use into the Stuart period. During the interregnum, the commonwealth under Oliver Cromwell replaced many historical names and titles, with the fleet then referred to as the &quot;Commonwealth Navy&quot;. The navy was renamed once again after the restoration in 1660 to the present title.

Today, the navy of the United Kingdom is commonly referred to as the &quot;Royal Navy&quot; both in the United Kingdom and other countries. Navies of other Commonwealth countries where the British monarch is also head of state include their national name, e.g. Royal Australian Navy. Some navies of other monarchies, such as the &quot;Koninklijke Marine&quot; (Royal Netherlands Navy) and &quot;Kungliga Flottan&quot; (Royal Swedish Navy), are also called &quot;Royal Navy&quot; in their own language. The Danish Navy uses the term &quot;Royal&quot; incorporated in its official name (Royal Danish Navy), but only &quot;Flåden&quot; (Navy) in everyday speech. The French Navy, despite France being a republic since 1870, is often nicknamed &quot;La Royale&quot; (literally: The Royal).

===Of ships===
Royal Navy ships in commission are prefixed since 1789 with His Majesty&#x27;s Ship (or &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;, when the monarch is a queen), abbreviated to &quot;HMS&quot;; for example, . Submarines are styled HM Submarine, also abbreviated &quot;HMS&quot;. Names are allocated to ships and submarines by a naming committee within the MOD and given by class, with the names of ships within a class often being thematic (for example, the Type 23s are named after British dukes) or traditional (for example, the s all carry the names of famous historic ships). Names are frequently re-used, offering a new ship the rich heritage, battle honours and traditions of her predecessors. Often, a particular vessel class will be named after the first ship of that type to be built. As well as a name, each ship and submarine of the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary is given a pennant number which in part denotes its role. For example, the destroyer displays the pennant number &#x27;D32&#x27;.

==Ranks, rates and insignia==
The Royal Navy ranks, rates and insignia form part of the uniform of the Royal Navy. The Royal Navy uniform is the pattern on which many of the uniforms of the other national navies of the world are based (e.g. Ranks and insignia of NATO navies officers, Uniforms of the United States Navy, Uniforms of the Royal Canadian Navy, French Naval Uniforms).

1 Rank in abeyance – routine appointments no longer made to this rank, though honorary awards of this rank are occasionally made to senior members of the Royal family and prominent former First Sea Lords.

==Customs and traditions==
===Traditions===
The Royal Navy has several formal customs and traditions including the use of ensigns and ships badges. Royal Navy ships have several ensigns used when under way and when in port. Commissioned ships and submarines wear the White Ensign at the stern whilst alongside during daylight hours and at the main-mast whilst under way. When alongside, the &quot;Union Jack&quot; is flown from the jackstaff at the bow, and can only be flown under way either to signal a court-martial is in progress or to indicate the presence of an admiral of the fleet on-board (including the Lord High Admiral or the monarch).

The Fleet Review is an irregular tradition of assembling the fleet before the monarch. The first review on record was held in 1400, and the most recent review was held on 28 June 2005 to mark the bi-centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar; 167 ships from many different nations attended with the Royal Navy supplying 67.

===&quot;Jackspeak&quot;===

There are several less formal traditions including service nicknames and Naval slang, known as &quot;Jackspeak&quot;. The nicknames include &quot;The Andrew&quot; (of uncertain origin, possibly after a zealous press ganger) and &quot;The Senior Service&quot;. British sailors are referred to as &quot;Jack&quot; (or &quot;Jenny&quot;), or more widely as &quot;Matelots&quot;. Royal Marines are fondly known as &quot;Bootnecks&quot; or often just as &quot;Royals&quot;. A compendium of Naval slang was brought together by Commander A.T.L. Covey-Crump and his name has in itself become the subject of Naval slang; &quot;Covey-Crump&quot;. A game traditionally played by the Navy is the four-player board game known as &quot;Uckers&quot;. This is similar to Ludo and it is regarded as easy to learn, but difficult to play well.

==Navy cadets==
The Royal Navy sponsors or supports three youth organisations:
* Volunteer Cadet Corps – consisting of Royal Naval Volunteer Cadet Corps and Royal Marines Volunteer Cadet Corps, the VCC was the first youth organisation officially supported or sponsored by the Admiralty in 1901.
* Combined Cadet Force – in schools, specifically the Royal Navy Section and the Royal Marines Section.
* Sea Cadets – supporting teenagers who are interested in naval matters, consisting of the Sea Cadets and the Royal Marines Cadets.

The above organisations are the responsibility of the CUY branch of Commander Core Training and Recruiting (COMCORE) who reports to Flag Officer Sea Training (FOST).

==In popular culture==

The Royal Navy of the 18th century is depicted in many novels and several films dramatising the voyage and mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;. The Royal Navy&#x27;s Napoleonic campaigns of the early 19th century are also a popular subject of historical novels. Some of the best-known are Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey-Maturin series and C. S. Forester&#x27;s Horatio Hornblower chronicles.

The Navy can also be seen in numerous films. The fictional spy James Bond is a sometimes commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR). The Royal Navy is featured in &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, when a nuclear ballistic-missile submarine is stolen, and in &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; when the media mogul Elliot Carver sinks a Royal Navy warship in an attempt to trigger a war between the UK and People&#x27;s Republic of China. &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; was based on Patrick O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s Aubrey-Maturin series. The &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot; series of films also includes the Navy as the force pursuing the eponymous pirates. Noël Coward directed and starred in his own film &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;, which tells the story of the crew of the fictional HMS &quot;Torrin&quot; during the Second World War. It was intended as a propaganda film and was released in 1942. Coward starred as the ship&#x27;s captain, with supporting roles from John Mills and Richard Attenborough. The Navy can also be seen in another James Bond film, The Man with the Golden Gun; here they are inside the wreck of the RMS Queen Elizabeth.

C. S. Forester&#x27;s Hornblower novels have been adapted for television. The Royal Navy was the subject of the 1970s BBC television drama series, &quot;Warship&quot;, and of a five-part documentary, &quot;Shipmates&quot;, that followed the workings of the Royal Navy day to day.

Television documentaries about the Royal Navy include: &quot;Empire of the Seas: How the Navy Forged the Modern World&quot;, a four-part documentary depicting Britain&#x27;s rise as a naval superpower, up until the First World War; &quot;Sailor&quot;, about life on the aircraft carrier ; and &quot;Submarine&quot;, about the submarine captains&#x27; training course, &#x27;The Perisher&#x27;. There have also been Channel 5 documentaries such as &quot;Royal Navy Submarine Mission&quot;, following a nuclear-powered fleet submarine.

The BBC Light Programme radio comedy series &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; featured a fictitious warship (&quot;HMS &quot;Troutbridge&quot;&quot;) and ran from 1959 to 1977.

<text>Robert Maynard Pirsig (; September 6, 1928 – April 24, 2017) was an American writer and philosopher. He is the author of the philosophical books &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values&quot; (1974) and &quot;&quot; (1991), and he co-authored &quot;On Quality: An Inquiry Into Excellence: Selected and Unpublished Writings&quot; (2022) along with his wife and editor, Wendy Pirsig.

==Early life==
Pirsig was born on September 6, 1928, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Harriet Marie Sjobeck and Maynard Pirsig. He was of German and Swedish descent. His father was a graduate of the University of Minnesota Law School, taught in that school from 1934, served as its dean from 1948 to 1955, and retired from teaching there in 1970. Pirsig senior subsequently taught at the William Mitchell College of Law until his retirement in 1993.

A precocious child with an alleged IQ of 170 at the age of nine, Pirsig skipped several grades at the Blake School in Minneapolis. In May 1943, he was awarded a high school diploma at the age of 14 by the University High School (later renamed Marshall-University High School), where he had edited the school yearbook, the Bisbilla. Pirsig then studied biochemistry at the University of Minnesota. In &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, he describes the central character, thought to represent himself, as being an atypical student, interested in science in itself rather than as a professional career path.

In the course of his studies, Pirsig became intrigued by the multiplicity of putative causes for a given phenomenon, and increasingly focused on the role played by hypotheses in the scientific method and sources from which they originate. His preoccupation with these matters led to a decline in his grades and expulsion from the university.

In 1946, Pirsig enlisted in the United States Army and was stationed in South Korea until 1948. Upon his discharge from the Army, he lived for several months in Seattle, Washington, and then returned to the University of Minnesota, from which he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1950. He subsequently studied philosophy at Banaras Hindu University in India and the Committee on the Analysis of Ideas and Study of Methods at the University of Chicago. In 1958 he earned a master&#x27;s degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota.

==Career==
In 1958, he became a professor at Montana State University in Bozeman, and taught creative writing courses for two years. Shortly thereafter he taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Pirsig&#x27;s published writing consists most notably of two books. The better known, &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, delves into Pirsig&#x27;s exploration into the nature of &quot;quality&quot;. Ostensibly a first-person narrative based on a motorcycle trip he and his young son Chris had taken from Minneapolis to San Francisco, it is an exploration of the underlying metaphysics of Western culture. He also gives the reader a short summary of the history of philosophy, including his interpretation of the philosophy of Aristotle as part of an ongoing dispute between &quot;universalists&quot;, admitting the existence of &quot;universals&quot;, and the Sophists, opposed by Socrates and his student Plato. Pirsig finds in &quot;Quality&quot; a special significance and common ground between Western and Eastern world views. 

Pirsig took nearly four years to complete &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, writing most of the book while living above a shoe store in south Minneapolis, while working as a tech writer for Honeywell.

Pirsig had great difficulty finding a publisher for &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;. Pirsig pitched the idea for his book to 121 different publishers, sending them a cover letter along with two sample pages, with 22 responding favorably. Ultimately, an editor at William Morrow accepted the finished manuscript; when he did, his publisher&#x27;s internal recommendation stated, &quot;This book is brilliant beyond belief, it is probably a work of genius, and will, I&#x27;ll wager, attain classic stature.&quot; In his book review, George Steiner compared Pirsig&#x27;s writing to Dostoevsky, Broch, Proust, and Bergson, stating that &quot;the assertion itself is valid ... the analogies with &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; are patent&quot;.

Pirsig described the development of his ideas and writing his book in a videotaped lecture that can be viewed on YouTube. The talk was at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design on May 20, 1974. A transcript of this talk also appears as the introduction to &quot;On Quality: An Inquiry into Excellence&quot;, a 2022 book of Pirsig&#x27;s unpublished and selected writings.

In 1974, Pirsig was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to allow him to write a follow-up, &quot;&quot; (1991), in which he developed a value-based metaphysics, Metaphysics of Quality, that challenges our subject–object view of reality. The second book, this time &quot;the captain&quot; of a sailboat, follows on from where &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; left off.

Pirsig was vice-president of the Minnesota Zen Meditation Center from 1973 to 1975 and also served on the board of directors.

==Personal life==
Robert Pirsig married Nancy Ann James on May 10, 1954. They had two sons: Chris, born in 1956, and Theodore (Ted), born in 1958.

Pirsig had a mental breakdown and spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals between 1961 and 1963. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with electroconvulsive therapy on numerous occasions, a treatment he discusses in &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;. Nancy sought a divorce during this time; they formally separated in 1976 and divorced in 1978. On December 28, 1978, Pirsig married Wendy Kimball in Tremont, Maine.

In 1979, his son Chris, who figured prominently in &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, was fatally stabbed in a mugging outside the San Francisco Zen Center at the age of 22. Pirsig discusses this tragedy in an afterword to subsequent editions of &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, writing that he and his second wife Wendy Kimball decided not to abort the child they conceived in 1980 because he believed that this unborn childlater their daughter Nellwas a continuation of the &quot;life pattern&quot; that Chris had occupied.

==Death==
Pirsig died aged 88, at his home in South Berwick, Maine, on April 24, 2017, after a period of failing health.

==Legacy and recognition==
Pirsig received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1974 for General Nonfiction, which later allowed him to complete his second book. The University of Minnesota conferred an Outstanding Achievement Award in 1975. He won an award for literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1979.

On December 15, 2012, Montana State University bestowed upon Pirsig an honorary doctorate in philosophy during the university&#x27;s fall commencement. Pirsig was also honored in a commencement speech by MSU Regent Professor Michael Sexson. Pirsig had been an instructor in writing at what was then Montana State College from 1958 to 1960.

Pirsig did not travel to Bozeman in December 2012 to accept the accolade, allegedly due to frailty of health. However, in &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, Pirsig writes about his time at Montana State College as a less than pleasurable experience, and that this limited his ability to teach writing effectively and to develop his own philosophy and writing.
In December 2019, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History acquired Pirsig&#x27;s 1966 Honda CB77 Super Hawk on which the 1968 ride with his son Chris was taken. The donation included a manuscript of &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;, a signed first edition of the book, and tools and clothing from the ride. In April 2024 Pirsig&#x27;s bike went on public display for the first time ever, in the museum&#x27;s exhibition &quot;America on the Move&quot;, along with the book&#x27;s original manuscript, Pirsig&#x27;s manual typewriter and an Apple II computer to which he made extraordinary upgrades that earned him the honor of a room named for him — the Pirsig Meeting Room — at Apple headquarters. In 2020, the Smithsonian acquired additional material from the Pirsig family relating to Pirsig&#x27;s maritime interests and background, also included in the display. In 2020, the Robert M. Pirsig archive was collected by the Houghton Library at Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; a 2021 article in the &quot;International Journal of Motorcycle Studies&quot; details the writer&#x27;s close historic relationship with motorcycles from the age of four to shortly before his death.

<doc id="26072" wikidata="Q220182" url="?curid=26072" title="Red Hat Linux">
<text>Red Hat Linux was a widely used commercial open-source Linux distribution created by Red Hat until its discontinuation in 2004.

Early releases of Red Hat Linux were called Red Hat Commercial Linux. Red Hat published the first non-beta release in May 1995. It included the Red Hat Package Manager as its packaging format, and over time RPM has served as the starting point for several other distributions, such as Mandriva Linux and Yellow Dog Linux.

In 2003, Red Hat discontinued the Red Hat Linux line in favor of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for enterprise environments. Fedora Linux, developed by the community-supported Fedora Project and sponsored by Red Hat, is a free-of-cost alternative intended for home use. Red Hat Linux 9, the final release, hit its official end-of-life on April 30, 2004, although updates were published for it through 2006 by the Fedora Legacy project until the updates were discontinued in early 2007.

==Features==
Version 3.0.3 was one of the first Linux distributions to support ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) binaries instead of the older a.out format.

Red Hat Linux introduced a graphical installer called Anaconda developed by Ketan Bagal, intended to be easy to use for novices, and which has since been adopted by some other Linux distributions. It also introduced a built-in tool called &quot;Lokkit&quot; for configuring the firewall capabilities.

In version 6 Red Hat moved to glibc 2.1, egcs-1.2, and to the 2.2 kernel. It was the first version to use the GNOME as its default graphical environment. It also introduced Kudzu, a software library for automatic discovery and configuration of hardware.

Version 7 was released in preparation for the 2.4 kernel, although the first release still used the stable 2.2 kernel. Glibc was updated to version 2.1.92, which was a beta of the upcoming version 2.2 and Red Hat used a patched version of GCC from CVS that they called &quot;2.96&quot;. The decision to ship an unstable GCC version was due to GCC 2.95&#x27;s bad performance on non-i386 platforms, especially DEC Alpha. Newer GCCs had also improved support for the C++ standard, which caused much of the existing code not to compile.

In particular, the use of a non-released version of GCC caused some criticism, e.g. from Linus Torvalds and the GCC Steering Committee; Red Hat was forced to defend this decision.
GCC 2.96 failed to compile the Linux kernel, and some other software used in Red Hat, due to stricter checks. It also had an incompatible C++ ABI with other compilers. The distribution included a previous version of GCC for compiling the kernel, called &quot;kgcc&quot;.

As of Red Hat Linux 7.0, UTF-8 was enabled as the default character encoding for the system. This had little effect on English-speaking users, but enabled much easier internationalisation and seamless support for multiple languages, including ideographic, bi-directional and complex script languages along with European languages. However, this did cause some negative reactions among existing Western European users, whose legacy ISO-8859–based setups were broken by the change.

Version 8.0 was also the second to include the Bluecurve desktop theme. It used a common theme for GNOME-2 and KDE 3.0.2 desktops, as well as OpenOffice-1.0. KDE members did not appreciate the change, claiming that it was not in the best interests of KDE.

Version 9 supported the Native POSIX Thread Library, which was ported to the 2.4 series kernels by Red Hat.

Red Hat Linux lacked many features due to possible copyright and patent problems. For example, MP3 support was disabled in both Rhythmbox and XMMS; instead, Red Hat recommended using Ogg Vorbis, which has no patents. MP3 support, however, could be installed afterwards, through the use of packages. Support for Microsoft&#x27;s NTFS file system was also missing, but could be freely installed as well.

==Fedora Linux==
Red Hat Linux was originally developed exclusively inside Red Hat, with the only feedback from users coming through bug reports and contributions to the included software packages – not contributions to the distribution as such. This was changed in late 2003 when Red Hat Linux merged with the community-based Fedora Project. The new plan was to draw most of the codebase from Fedora Linux when creating new Red Hat Enterprise Linux distributions. Fedora Linux replaced the original Red Hat Linux download and retail version. The model is similar to the relationship between Netscape Communicator and Mozilla, or StarOffice and OpenOffice.org, although in this case the resulting commercial product is also fully free software.

==Version history==

Release dates were drawn from announcements on &quot;comp.os.linux.announce&quot;. Version names are chosen as to be cognitively related to the prior release, yet not related in the same way as the release before that.

The Fedora and Red Hat Projects were merged on September 22, 2003.

<doc id="26073" wikidata="Q13442" url="?curid=26073" title="Right ascension">
<text>Right ascension (abbreviated RA; symbol ) is the angular distance of a particular point measured eastward along the celestial equator from the Sun at the March equinox to the (hour circle of the) point in question above the Earth. 
When paired with declination, these astronomical coordinates specify the location of a point on the celestial sphere in the equatorial coordinate system.

An old term, &quot;right ascension&quot; () refers to the &quot;ascension&quot;, or the point on the celestial equator that rises with any celestial object as seen from Earth&#x27;s equator, where the celestial equator intersects the horizon at a right angle. It contrasts with &quot;oblique ascension&quot;, the point on the celestial equator that rises with any celestial object as seen from most latitudes on Earth, where the celestial equator intersects the horizon at an oblique angle.

==Explanation==

Right ascension is the celestial equivalent of terrestrial longitude. Both right ascension and longitude measure an angle from a primary direction (a zero point) on an equator. Right ascension is measured from the Sun at the March equinox i.e. the First Point of Aries, which is the place on the celestial sphere where the Sun crosses the celestial equator from south to north at the March equinox and is currently located in the constellation Pisces. Right ascension is measured continuously in a full circle from that alignment of Earth and Sun in space, that equinox, the measurement increasing towards the east.

As seen from Earth (except at the poles), objects noted to have 12 are longest visible (appear throughout the night) at the March equinox; those with 0 (apart from the sun) do so at the September equinox. On those dates at midnight, such objects will reach (&quot;culminate&quot; at) their highest point (their meridian). How high depends on their declination; if 0° declination (i.e. on the celestial equator) then at Earth&#x27;s equator they are directly overhead (at zenith).

Any angular unit could have been chosen for right ascension, but it is customarily measured in hours (h), minutes (m), and seconds (s), with 24h being equivalent to a full circle. Astronomers have chosen this unit to measure right ascension because they measure a star&#x27;s location by timing its passage through the highest point in the sky as the Earth rotates. The line which passes through the highest point in the sky, called the meridian, is the projection of a longitude line onto the celestial sphere. Since a complete circle contains 24h of right ascension or 360° (degrees of arc), of a circle is measured as 1h of right ascension, or 15°; of a circle is measured as 1m of right ascension, or 15 minutes of arc (also written as 15′); and of a circle contains 1s of right ascension, or 15 seconds of arc (also written as 15″). A full circle, measured in right-ascension units, contains , or , or 24h.

Because right ascensions are measured in hours (of rotation of the Earth), they can be used
to time the positions of objects in the sky. For example, if a star with RA = is at its meridian, then a star with RA = will be on the/at its meridian (at its apparent highest point) 18.5 sidereal hours later.

Sidereal hour angle, used in celestial navigation, is similar to right ascension but increases westward rather than eastward. Usually measured in degrees (°), it is the complement of right ascension with respect to 24h. It is important not to confuse sidereal hour angle with the astronomical concept of hour angle, which measures the angular distance of an object westward from the local meridian.

== Effects of precession ==
The Earth&#x27;s axis traces a small circle (relative to its celestial equator) slowly westward about the celestial poles, completing one cycle in about 26,000 years. This movement, known as precession, causes the coordinates of stationary celestial objects to change continuously, if rather slowly. Therefore, equatorial coordinates (including right ascension) are inherently relative to the year of their observation, and astronomers specify them with reference to a particular year, known as an epoch. Coordinates from different epochs must be mathematically rotated to match each other, or to match a standard epoch. Right ascension for &quot;fixed stars&quot; on the equator increases by about 3.1 seconds per year or 5.1 minutes per century, but for fixed stars away from the equator the rate of change can be anything from negative infinity to positive infinity. (To this must be added the proper motion of a star.) Over a precession cycle of 26,000 years, &quot;fixed stars&quot; that are far from the ecliptic poles increase in right ascension by 24h, or about 5.6&#x27; per century, whereas stars within 23.5° of an ecliptic pole undergo a net change of0h. The right ascension of Polaris is increasing quicklyin AD 2000 it was 2.5h, but when it gets closest to the north celestial pole in 2100 its right ascension will be 6h. The North Ecliptic Pole in Draco and the South Ecliptic Pole in Dorado are always at right ascension 18h and 6h respectively.

The currently used standard epoch is J2000.0, which is January 1, 2000 at 12:00 TT. The prefix &quot;J&quot; indicates that it is a Julian epoch. Prior to J2000.0, astronomers used the successive Besselian epochs B1875.0, B1900.0, and B1950.0.

==History==


The concept of right ascension has been known at least as far back as Hipparchus who measured stars in equatorial coordinates in the 2nd century BC. But Hipparchus and his successors made their star catalogs in ecliptic coordinates, and the use of RA was limited to special cases.

With the invention of the telescope, it became possible for astronomers to observe celestial objects in greater detail, provided that the telescope could be kept pointed at the object for a period of time. The easiest way to do that is to use an equatorial mount, which allows the telescope to be aligned with one of its two pivots parallel to the Earth&#x27;s axis. A motorized clock drive often is used with an equatorial mount to cancel out the Earth&#x27;s rotation. As the equatorial mount became widely adopted for observation, the equatorial coordinate system, which includes right ascension, was adopted at the same time for simplicity. Equatorial mounts could then be accurately pointed at objects with known right ascension and declination by the use of setting circles. The first star catalog to use right ascension and declination was John Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot; (1712, 1725).

<text>William Roger Clemens (born August 4, 1962), nicknamed &quot;Rocket&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), most notably with the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees and also played for the Toronto Blue Jays and Houston Astros. He was one of the most dominant pitchers in major league history, tallying 354 wins, a 3.12 earned run average (ERA), and 4,672 strikeouts, the third-most all time. An 11-time MLB All-Star and two-time World Series champion, Clemens won seven Cy Young Awards, more than any other pitcher in history. Clemens was known for his fierce competitive nature and hard-throwing pitching style, which he used to intimidate batters.

Clemens debuted in the MLB in 1984 with the Red Sox, whose pitching staff he anchored for 12 years. In 1986, he won the American League (AL) Cy Young Award, the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, and the All-Star Game MVP Award, and he struck out an MLB-record 20 batters in a single game. After the 1996 season, in which he achieved his second 20-strikeout performance, Clemens left Boston via free agency and joined the Toronto Blue Jays. In each of his two seasons with Toronto, Clemens won a Cy Young Award, as well as the pitching triple crown by leading the league in wins, ERA, and strikeouts. Before the 1999 season, Clemens was traded to the Yankees where he won his two World Series titles. In 2001, Clemens became the first pitcher in major league history to start a season with a win–loss record of 20–1. In 2003, he reached his 300th win and 4,000th strikeout in the same game. Clemens left for the Houston Astros in 2004, where he spent three seasons and won his seventh Cy Young Award. He rejoined the Yankees in 2007 for one last season before retiring. He is the only pitcher in Major League history to record more than 350 wins and strike out more than 4,500 batters.

Clemens was alleged by the Mitchell Report to have used anabolic steroids during his late career, mainly based on testimony given by his former trainer, Brian McNamee. Clemens denied these allegations under oath before the United States Congress, leading congressional leaders to refer his case to the Justice Department on suspicions of perjury. On August 19, 2010, a federal grand jury at the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., indicted Clemens on six felony counts involving perjury, false statements, and contempt of Congress. Clemens pleaded not guilty, but proceedings were complicated by prosecutorial misconduct, leading to a mistrial. In June 2012, Clemens was found not guilty on all six counts of lying to Congress. These controversies hurt his chances for election to the Baseball Hall of Fame. He never received the 75% of votes required in his ten years of eligibility, ending with 65.2% in 2022. However, despite the steroid controversies, Clemens is still considered by many as one of greatest pitchers in baseball history.

==Early life==
Clemens was born in Dayton, Ohio, the fifth child of Bill and Bess (Lee) Clemens. He is of German descent, his great-grandfather Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens’ parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. Booher died when Clemens was nine years old, and Clemens has said that the only time he ever felt envious of other players was when he saw them in the clubhouse with their fathers. Clemens lived in Vandalia, Ohio, until 1977, and then spent most of his high school years in Houston, Texas. At Spring Woods High School, Clemens played baseball for longtime head coach Charles Maiorana and also played football and basketball. He was scouted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Minnesota Twins during his senior year, but opted to go to college.

==College career==
He began his college career pitching for San Jacinto College North in 1981, where he posted a 9–2 win–loss record. He then attended the University of Texas at Austin, compiling a 25–7 record in two All-American seasons, and was on the mound when the Longhorns won the 1983 College World Series. He became the first player to have his baseball uniform number retired at the University of Texas. In 2004, the Rotary Smith Award, given to America&#x27;s best college baseball player, was changed to the Roger Clemens Award, honoring the best pitcher. At Texas, Clemens pitched 35 consecutive scoreless innings, an NCAA record that stood until Justin Pope broke it in 2001.

==Professional career==
===Drafts and minor leagues===
The New York Mets selected Clemens in the 12th round of the 1981 Major League Baseball draft, however, he did not sign. Clemens was selected in the first round (19th overall) of the 1983 MLB draft by the Boston Red Sox and quickly rose through the minor league system. In 1983, Clemens pitched for two different teams in two different leagues and at two different levels. He pitched for the A-ball Winter Haven Red Sox of the Florida State League and the AA New Britain Red Sox of the Eastern League. Clemens started all four games he played with Winter Haven and pitched three complete games with one shutout and allowed no home runs. He posted a 3–1 win–loss record, a 1.24 earned run average, struck out 36 batters in 29 innings pitched and his walks plus hits per inning pitched was 0.759. Clemens started all seven games he played with New Britain and pitched one complete game shutout and allowed one home run. He posted a 4–1 win–loss record, a 1.38 earned run average, struck out 59 batters in 52 innings pitched and his walks and hits per innings pitched was 0.827. His combined minor league totals in 1983 included starting all 11 games he played and pitched four complete games with two shutouts and only one home run allowed. He posted a 7–2 win–loss record, a 1.33 earned run average, struck out 95 batters in 81 innings pitched and his walks and hits per innings pitched was 0.802.

Clemens started the 1984 season with AAA Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League. In seven games, he started six of them, pitching three complete games with one shutout. Despite posting a 2–3 win–loss record and a walks and hits per innings pitched of 1.136, his earned run average was 1.93, and he struck out 50 batters in innings pitched.

===Boston Red Sox (1984–1996)===

On May 15, 1984 at Cleveland Stadium, Clemens made his Major League debut. An undiagnosed torn labrum threatened to end his career early; he underwent successful arthroscopic surgery by Dr. James Andrews.

On April 29, 1986 at Fenway Park, in a 3–1 win over the Seattle Mariners, Clemens struck out a career-high 20 batters, becoming the first pitcher in MLB history to strike out 20 batters in a nine-inning game. Following his performance, Clemens made the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, which carried the headline &quot;Lord of the K&#x27;s [strikeouts].&quot; Other than Clemens, only Kerry Wood and Max Scherzer have matched the total. (Randy Johnson fanned 20 batters in nine innings on May 8, 2001. However, as the game went into extra innings, it is not categorized as occurring in a nine-inning game. Tom Cheney holds the record for any game: 21 strikeouts in 16 innings.)

Clemens started the 1986 All-Star Game (played in his hometown of Houston) in the Astrodome and was named the Most Valuable Player of the contest by throwing three perfect innings and striking out two. He also won the first of his seven Cy Young Awards. In 1986, Clemens won the American League MVP award, finishing with a 24–4 record, 2.48 ERA, and 238 strikeouts. When Hank Aaron said that pitchers should not be eligible for the MVP, Clemens responded: &quot;I wish he were still playing. I&#x27;d probably crack his head open to show him how valuable I was.&quot; Clemens was the only starting pitcher since Vida Blue in 1971 to win a league MVP award until Justin Verlander won the award in 2011. Clemens attributes his switch from what he calls a &quot;thrower&quot; to a &quot;pitcher&quot; to the partial season Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver spent with the Red Sox in 1986.

Facing the California Angels in the 1986 ALCS, Clemens pitched poorly in the opening game, watched the Boston bullpen blow his 3–1 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4, and then pitched a strong Game 7 to wrap up the series for Boston. The League Championship Series clincher was Clemens&#x27;s first postseason career victory. He did not win his second until 13 years later. After a victory in game five, Boston led 3 games to 2 over the New York Mets in the 1986 World Series with Clemens set to start game six at Shea Stadium. Clemens who was pitching on five days rest started strong by striking out eight while throwing a no-hitter through four innings. In the top of eighth and with Boston ahead 3–2, manager John McNamara sent rookie Mike Greenwell to pinch hit for Roger Clemens. It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute this. Clemens said to Bob Costas on an MLB Network program concerning the 1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens &quot;begged out&quot; of the game. The Mets rallied and took both game six and seven to win the World Series.
The Red Sox had a miserable 1987 season, finishing at 78–84, though Clemens won his second consecutive Cy Young Award with a 20–9 record, 2.97 ERA, 256 strikeouts, and seven shutouts. He was the first AL pitcher with back-to-back 20-win seasons since Tommy John won 20 with the Yankees in 1979 and &#x27;80. Boston rebounded with success in 1988 and 1990, clinching the AL East Division each year, but were swept by the Oakland Athletics in each ALCS matchup. His greatest postseason failure came in the second inning of the final game of the 1990 ALCS, when he was ejected for arguing balls and strikes with umpire Terry Cooney, accentuating the A&#x27;s four-game sweep of the Red Sox. He was suspended for the first five games of the 1991 season and fined $10,000.
Clemens led the American League in 1988 with 291 strikeouts and a career-high 8 shutouts. On September 10, 1988, Clemens threw a one-hitter against the Cleveland Indians at Fenway Park. Dave Clark&#x27;s one-out single in the eighth inning was the only hit Clemens allowed in the game. In a 9–1 victory over Cleveland on April 13, 1989, Clemens recorded his 1,000 career strikeout by fanning Brook Jacoby with the bases loaded in the second inning. Clemens finished second to Oakland&#x27;s Bob Welch for the 1990 AL Cy Young Award, despite the fact that Clemens crushed Welch in ERA (1.93 to 2.95), strikeouts (209 to 127), walks (54 to 77), home runs allowed (7 to 26), and WAR (10.4 to 2.9). Clemens did, however, capture his third Cy Young Award in 1991 with an 18–10 record, 2.62 ERA, and 241 strikeouts. On June 21, 1989, Clemens surrendered the first of Sammy Sosa&#x27;s 609 home runs. On September 18, 1996 at Tiger Stadium, in a 4–0 win over the Detroit Tigers, Clemens had a second 20-strikeout game. This second 20-K day occurred in his third-to-last game as a member of the Boston Red Sox. Later, the Tigers presented him with a baseball containing the autographs of each batter who had struck out (those with multiple strikeouts signed the appropriate number of times).
The Red Sox did not re-sign Clemens following the 1996 season, despite leading the A.L. with 257 strikeouts and offering him &quot;by far the most money ever offered to a player in the history of the Red Sox franchise.&quot; General Manager Dan Duquette remarked that he &quot;hoped to keep him in Boston during the twilight of his career&quot;, but Clemens left and signed with the Toronto Blue Jays.

The emphasis on the misquoted 1996 &quot;twilight&quot; comment took on a life of its own following Clemens&#x27;s post-Boston successes, and Duquette was vilified for letting the star pitcher go. Ultimately, Clemens would go on to have a record of 162–73 for the rest of his career after leaving the Red Sox. Clemens recorded 192 wins and 38 shutouts for the Red Sox, both tied with Cy Young for the franchise record and is their all-time strikeout leader with 2,590. Clemens&#x27;s overall postseason record with Boston was 1–2 with a 3.88 ERA, and 45 strikeouts, and 19 walks in 56 innings. No Red Sox player has worn his uniform #21 since Clemens left the team in the 1996–97 offseason.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1997–1998)===
Clemens signed a four-year, $40 million deal with the Toronto Blue Jays after the 1996 season. In his first start in Fenway Park as a member of the Blue Jays, he pitched eight innings allowing only 4 hits and 1 earned run. 16 of his 24 outs were strikeouts, and every batter who faced him struck out at least once. As he left the field following his last inning of work, he stared up angrily towards the owner&#x27;s box.

Clemens was dominant in his two seasons with the Blue Jays, winning the pitching Triple Crown and the Cy Young Award in both seasons (1997: 21–7 record, 2.05 ERA, and 292 strikeouts; 1998: 20–6 record, 2.65 ERA, and 271 strikeouts). After the 1998 season, Clemens asked to be traded, indicating that he did not believe the Blue Jays would be competitive enough the following year and that he was dedicated to winning a championship.

===New York Yankees (1999–2003)===
Before the 1999 season, the Blue Jays traded Clemens to the New York Yankees for David Wells, Homer Bush, and Graeme Lloyd. Since his longtime uniform number #21 was in use by teammate Paul O&#x27;Neill, Clemens initially wore #12, before switching mid-season to #22.

During the 1999 regular season, Clemens posted a 14–10 record with a 4.60 ERA. He logged a pair of wins in the postseason, though he lost Game 3 of the 1999 ALCS in a matchup against Red Sox ace Pedro Martínez, which was the Yankees&#x27; only loss in the 1999 playoffs. Clemens won the Yankees&#x27; Game 4 clincher over the Atlanta Braves, giving up only one run in innings.

Clemens followed up with a strong 2000 season, in which he finished with a 13–8 record with a 3.70 ERA for the regular season. Though Clemens lost two games in the ALDS against Oakland, the Yankees won the other three and thus advanced. In Game 4 of the ALCS against Seattle, Clemens set the ALCS record for strikeouts in a game when he fanned 15 batters in a one-hit shutout. In Game 2 of the 2000 World Series, Clemens pitched eight scoreless innings against the New York Mets.

In 2001, Clemens became the first pitcher in MLB history to start a season 20–1 (finishing 20–3), and won his sixth Cy Young Award. Clemens started for the Yankees in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he dueled Curt Schilling to a standstill after 6 innings, yielding only one run. The Diamondbacks went on to win the game in the 9th.

Early in 2003, Clemens announced his retirement, effective at the end of that season. On June 13, 2003, pitching against the St. Louis Cardinals in Yankee Stadium, Clemens recorded his 300th career win and 4,000th career strikeout, the only player in history to record both milestones in the same game. The 300th win came on his fourth try; the Yankee bullpen had blown his chance of a win in his previous two attempts. He became the 21st pitcher ever to record 300 wins and the third ever to record 4,000 strikeouts. His career record upon reaching the milestones was 300–155. Clemens finished the season with a 17–9 record and a 3.91 ERA.

The end of Clemens&#x27;s 2003 season became a series of public farewells met with appreciative cheering. His last games in each AL park were given extra attention, particularly his final regular-season appearance in Fenway Park, when despite wearing the uniform of the hated arch-rival, he was afforded a standing ovation by Red Sox fans as he left the field. (This spectacle was repeated when the Yankees ended up playing the Red Sox in the 2003 ALCS and Clemens got a second &quot;final start&quot; in his original stadium.) As part of a tradition of manager Joe Torre, Clemens was chosen to manage the Yankees&#x27; last game of the regular season. Clemens made one start in the World Series against the Florida Marlins; when he left trailing 3–1 after seven innings, the Marlins left their dugout to give him a standing ovation.

===Houston Astros (2004–2006)===

Clemens came out of retirement, signing a one-year deal with his adopted hometown Houston Astros on January 12, 2004, joining close friend and former Yankees teammate Andy Pettitte. On May 5, 2004, Clemens recorded his 4,137th career strikeout to place him second on the all-time list behind Nolan Ryan. He was named the starter for the National League All-Star team but ultimately was the losing pitcher in that game after allowing six runs on five hits, including a three-run home run to Alfonso Soriano. Clemens finished the season with an 18–4 record, and was awarded his seventh Cy Young Award, becoming the oldest player ever to win the Cy Young at age 42. This made him one of six pitchers to win the award in both leagues, joining Gaylord Perry, Pedro Martínez, and Randy Johnson and later joined by Roy Halladay and Max Scherzer. Clemens was the losing pitcher for the Astros in Game Seven of the 2004 NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals, allowing four runs in six innings. Although he pitched well, he tired in the sixth inning, surrendering all four runs.

Clemens again decided to put off retirement before the 2005 season after the Astros offered salary arbitration. The Astros submitted an offer of $13.5 million, and Clemens countered with a record $22 million demand. On January 21, 2005, both sides agreed on a one-year, $18,000,022 contract, thus avoiding arbitration. The deal gave Clemens the highest yearly salary earned by a pitcher in MLB history.
Clemens&#x27;s 2005 season ended as one of the finest he had ever posted. His 1.87 ERA was the lowest in the major leagues, the lowest of his 22-season career, and the lowest by any National Leaguer since Greg Maddux in 1995. He finished with a 13–8 record, with his lower win total primarily due to the fact that he ranked near the bottom of the major leagues in run support. The Astros scored an average of only 3.5 runs per game in games in which he was the pitcher of record. The Astros were shut out nine times in Clemens&#x27;s 32 starts, and failed to score in a 10th until after Clemens was out of the game. The Astros lost five of Clemens&#x27;s starts by scores of 1–0. In April, Clemens did not allow a run in three consecutive starts. However, the Astros lost all three of those starts by a 1–0 score in extra innings.

Clemens won an emotional start on September 15, following his mother&#x27;s death that morning. In his final start of the 2005 season, Clemens got his 4,500th strikeout. On October 9, 2005, Clemens made his first relief appearance since 1984, entering as a pinch hitter in the 15th, then pitching three innings to get the win as the Astros defeated the Atlanta Braves in Game 4 of the NLDS. It is the longest postseason game in MLB history at 18 innings. Clemens lasted only two innings in Game 1 of the 2005 World Series, and the Astros went on to be swept by the Chicago White Sox. It was the Astros&#x27; first World Series appearance. Clemens had aggravated a hamstring pull that had limited his performance since at least September.

Clemens said that he would retire again after the World Series but he wanted to represent the United States in the inaugural World Baseball Classic, which would be played in March 2006. He went 1–1 in the tournament, with a 2.08 ERA, striking out 10 batters in innings. After pitching in a second-round loss to Mexico that eliminated the United States, Clemens began considering a return to the major leagues. On May 31, 2006, following another extended period of speculation, it was announced that Clemens was coming out of retirement for the third time to pitch for the Astros for the remainder of the 2006 season. Clemens signed a contract worth $22,000,022 (his uniform number #22). Since Clemens did not play a full season, he received a prorated percentage of that: approximately $12.25 million. Clemens made his return on June 22, 2006, against the Minnesota Twins, losing to their rookie phenom, Francisco Liriano, 4–2. For the second year in a row, his win total did not match his performance, as he finished the season with a 7–6 record, a 2.30 ERA, and a 1.04 WHIP. However, Clemens averaged just under 6 innings in his starts and never pitched into the eighth.

===Return to the Yankees (2007)===

Clemens unexpectedly appeared in the owner&#x27;s box at Yankee Stadium on May 6, 2007, during the seventh-inning stretch of a game against the Seattle Mariners, and made a brief statement: &quot;Thank y&#x27;all. Well they came and got me out of Texas, and uhh, I can tell you it&#x27;s a privilege to be back. I&#x27;ll be talkin&#x27; to y&#x27;all soon.&quot; It was simultaneously announced that Clemens had rejoined the Yankees roster, agreeing to a pro-rated one-year deal worth $28,000,022, or about $4.7 million per month. Over the contract life, he would make $18.7 million. This equated to just over $1 million per start that season.

Clemens made his 2007 return on June 9, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates by pitching six innings with seven strikeouts and three runs allowed. On June 21, with a single in the 5th inning against the Colorado Rockies, Clemens became the oldest New York Yankee to record a hit (44 years, 321 days). On June 24, Clemens pitched an inning in relief against the San Francisco Giants. It had been 22 years and 341 days since his previous regular-season relief appearance, the longest such gap in major league history. On July 2, Clemens collected his 350th win against the Minnesota Twins at Yankee Stadium, giving up just two hits and one run over eight innings. Clemens is one of only three pitchers to pitch his entire career in the live-ball era and reach 350 wins. The other two are Warren Spahn (whose catcher for his 350th win was Joe Torre, Clemens&#x27;s manager for his 350th), and Greg Maddux, who earned his 350th win in 2008. His final regular-season appearance was a start against the Red Sox at Fenway Park, in which he allowed two hits and one unearned run in six innings, and received a no-decision. Clemens finished the 2007 regular season with a record of 6–6 and a 4.18 ERA.

Clemens was forced to leave Game 3 of the 2007 ALDS in the third inning after aggravating a hamstring injury. He struck out Victor Martinez of the Cleveland Indians with his final pitch, and was replaced by right-hander Phil Hughes. Yankees manager Joe Torre removed Clemens from the roster due to his injury, and replaced him with left-hander Ron Villone. Clemens&#x27;s overall postseason record with the Yankees was 7–4 with a 2.97 ERA, 98 strikeouts and 35 walks in 102 innings.

==Pitching appearances after retirement==
On August 20, 2012, Clemens signed with the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He made his debut for the Skeeters against the Bridgeport Bluefish on August 25, 2012, in front of a crowd of 7,724. It was the first time the 50-year-old had taken the mound in almost five years. Clemens pitched scoreless innings and struck out two: former major leaguers Joey Gathright and Prentice Redman. He also retired Luis Figueroa, who played briefly with the Pirates, Blue Jays and the Giants. Clemens allowed only one hit and no walks on 37 pitches in the Skeeters&#x27; 1–0 victory. Clemens made his second start for the Skeeters on September 7 against the Long Island Ducks. He pitched scoreless innings, with his son, Koby, as his catcher. He retired former New York Met outfielder Timo Perez for the final out in the fourth inning, and was named the winning pitcher by the official scorer. Clemens&#x27;s fastball was clocked as high as 88 mph, and the Astros sent scouts to both of his outings with the Skeeters in consideration of a possible return to the team that season.

Roger Clemens joined the Kansas Stars, a group of 24 retired major leaguers and his son Koby, to compete in the 2016 National Baseball Congress World Series. The team was put together by Kansas natives Adam LaRoche and Nate Robertson, and featured eleven former All-Stars, including Tim Hudson, Roy Oswalt, and J. D. Drew as well as Clemens. Pitching just six days after his 54th birthday, Clemens started for the Kansas Stars in a game against the NJCAA National Team on August 10, 2016. He pitched innings, allowing 3 runs with one strikeout in an 11–10 loss. On August 22, 2019, Clemens wore his Red Sox uniform and pitched in the Abbot Financial Management Oldtime Baseball Game, an annual charity event held at St. Peter&#x27;s Field in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The 2019 game benefitted Compassionate Care ALS, in memory of longtime Fenway Park supervisor John Welch, who died from Lou Gehrig&#x27;s Disease in December 2018. Facing mostly young college players, Clemens pitched two shutout innings in the game, then moved to first base.

===National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration===
In 2013 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, his first year of eligibility, Clemens received 37.6% of the votes cast by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA), falling well short of the 75% required for induction into the Hall of Fame. He has garnered more votes in subsequent elections without reaching the 75% threshold: he received 59.5% in 2019, 61.0% in 2020, and 61.6% in 2021. With the inductions of Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine in 2014 and Randy Johnson in 2015, Clemens is currently the only eligible member of the 300 win club not to be inducted into the Hall. He received 65.2% of the votes in his final year of eligibility, 2022.

Despite falling off the ballot, Clemens is still eligible for induction through the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Today&#x27;s Game Committee. The committee is composed of 16 members of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, executives, and veteran media members. (hence the nickname of &quot;veterans committee&quot;) who consider retired players who lost ballot eligibility while still having made notable contributions to baseball from 1986-2016. The most recent voting by the committee was held in December 2022, and 12 votes were required for induction. Clemens received fewer than four votes out of sixteen cast and as a result was not selected for induction.

==Pitching style==
Clemens was a prototypical power pitcher with an aggressive edge, especially early in his career. Clemens was said to throw &quot;two pitches: a 98-mph fastball and a hard breaking ball. At 23, Clemens simply reared back and threw the ball past batters.&quot; Later in his career, Clemens developed a split-finger fastball. Clemens has jocularly referred to this pitch as &quot;Mr. Splitty&quot;.

By the time Clemens retired from Major League Baseball in 2007, his four-seam fastball had settled in the 91–94 mph range. He also threw a two-seam fastball, a slider in the mid 80s, a splitter, and an occasional curveball. Clemens was a durable pitcher, leading the American League in complete games three times and innings pitched twice. Clemens threw 18 complete games in 1987 which no pitcher has since matched. Clemens was also known as a strikeout pitcher, leading the AL in Ks five times and strikeouts per nine innings three times. He is currently the only pitcher in Major League history to have thrown two 20-strikeout games.

==Controversies==
Clemens has the reputation of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in 1995, but he was among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career and subsequently tapered off. After the 2000 ALCS game against the Mariners where he knocked down future teammate Alex Rodriguez and then argued with him, Seattle Mariners manager Lou Piniella, a former Yankee, called Clemens a &quot;headhunter.&quot; His beaning earlier that year of Mike Piazza, followed by throwing a broken bat in Piazza&#x27;s direction in the 2000 World Series, cemented Clemens&#x27;s surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many. In 2009, former manager Cito Gaston publicly denounced Clemens as a &quot;double-talker&quot; and &quot;a complete asshole&quot;. Clemens was ranked 14th all-time in hit batsmen after the 2020 season, although not far off from other pitchers of his era at 1 hit batsmen per 125 batters faced. Numbers reflect similar rate of hit batsmen to pitchers such as Nolan Ryan, Justin Verlander, and Greg Maddux.

Clemens has attracted controversy over the years for his outspoken comments, such as his complaints about having to carry his own luggage through an airport and his criticism of Fenway Park for being a subpar facility. On April 4, 2006, Clemens made an insulting remark when asked about the devotion of Japanese and South Korean fans during the World Baseball Classic: &quot;None of the dry cleaners were open, they were all at the game, Japan and Korea&quot;. Toward the end of his career, his annual on-and-off &quot;retirements&quot; revived a reputation for diva-like behavior.

Clemens has received criticism for getting special treatment from the teams that sign him. While playing for Houston, Clemens was not obliged to travel with the team on road trips if he was not pitching. His 2007 contract with the New York Yankees had a &quot;family plan&quot; clause that stipulated that he not be required to go on road trips in which he was not scheduled to pitch and allowed him to leave the team between starts to be with his family. These perks were publicly criticized by Yankee reliever Kyle Farnsworth. Most of Clemens&#x27;s teammates, however, did not complain of such perks because of Clemens&#x27;s success on the mound and valuable presence in the clubhouse. Yankee teammate Jason Giambi spoke for such players when he said, &quot;I&#x27;d carry his bags for him, just as long as he is on the mound.&quot;

=== Steroid use accusations ===
In José Canseco&#x27;s book, &quot;&quot;, Canseco suggested that Clemens had expert knowledge about steroids and suggested that he used them, based on the improvement in his performance after leaving the Red Sox. While not addressing the allegations directly, Clemens stated: &quot;I could care less about the rules [sic]&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve talked to some friends of his and I&#x27;ve teased them that when you&#x27;re under house arrest and have ankle bracelets on, you have a lot of time to write a book.&quot;

Jason Grimsley named Clemens, as well as Andy Pettitte, as a user of performance-enhancing drugs. According to a 20-page search warrant affidavit signed by IRS Special Agent Jeff Novitzky, Grimsley told investigators he obtained amphetamines, anabolic steroids and human growth hormone from someone recommended to him by former Yankees trainer Brian McNamee. McNamee was a personal strength coach for Clemens and Pettitte, hired by Clemens in 1998. At the time of the Grimsley revelations, McNamee denied knowledge of steroid use by Clemens and Pettitte. Despite initial media reports, the affidavit made no mention of Clemens or Pettitte.

However, Clemens&#x27;s name was mentioned 82 times in the Mitchell Report on steroid use in baseball. In the report, McNamee stated that during the 1998, 2000, and 2001 baseball seasons, he injected Clemens with Winstrol. Clemens&#x27;s attorney Rusty Hardin denied the claims, calling McNamee &quot;a troubled and unreliable witness&quot; who has changed his story five times in an attempt to avoid criminal prosecution. He noted that Clemens has never tested positive in a steroid test. Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, who prepared the report, stated that he relayed the allegations to each athlete implicated in the report and gave them a chance to respond before his findings were published.

On January 6, 2008, Clemens went on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to address the allegations. He told Mike Wallace that his longevity in baseball was due to &quot;hard work&quot; rather than illegal substances and denied all of McNamee&#x27;s assertions that he injected Clemens with steroids, saying it &quot;never happened&quot;. On January 7, Clemens filed a defamation lawsuit against McNamee, claiming that the former trainer lied after being threatened with prosecution. McNamee&#x27;s attorneys argued that he was compelled to cooperate by federal officials and so his statements were protected. A federal judge agreed, throwing out all claims related to McNamee&#x27;s statements to investigators on February 13, 2009, but allowing the case to proceed on statements McNamee made about Clemens to Pettitte.

On February 13, 2008, Clemens appeared before a Congressional committee, along with Brian McNamee and swore under oath that he did not take steroids, that he did not discuss HGH with McNamee, that he did not attend a party at José Canseco&#x27;s where steroids were the topic of conversation, that he was only injected with B-12 and lidocaine and that he never told Pettitte he had taken HGH. This last point was in contradiction to testimony Pettitte had given under oath on February 4, 2008, wherein Pettitte said he repeated to McNamee a conversation Pettitte had with Clemens. During this conversation, Pettitte said Clemens had told him that McNamee had injected Clemens with human growth hormone. Pettitte said McNamee reacted angrily, saying that Clemens &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have done that.&quot;

The bipartisan House committee in front of which Clemens appeared, citing seven apparent inconsistencies in Clemens&#x27;s testimony, recommended that the Justice Department investigate whether Clemens lied under oath about using performance-enhancing drugs. In a letter sent February 27 to Attorney General Michael Mukasey, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Henry Waxman and ranking Republican Tom Davis said Clemens&#x27;s testimony that he &quot;never used anabolic steroids or human growth hormone warrants further investigation&quot;.

As a result of the Mitchell Report, Clemens was asked to end his involvement with the Giff Nielsen Day of Golf for Kids charity tournament in Houston that he has hosted for four years. As well, his name has been removed from the Houston-based Roger Clemens Institute for Sports Medicine and will be renamed the Memorial Hermann Sports Medicine Institute.

After Washington prosecutors showed &quot;a renewed interest in the case in the final months of 2008&quot;, a federal grand jury was convened in January 2009 to hear evidence of Clemens&#x27;s possible perjury before Congress. The grand jury indicted Clemens on August 19, 2010, on charges of making false statements to Congress about his use of performance-enhancing drugs. The indictment charges Clemens with one count of obstruction of Congress, three counts of making false statements and two counts of perjury in connection with his February 2008 testimony.

His first trial began on July 13, 2011, but on the second day of testimony the judge in the case declared a mistrial over prosecutorial misconduct after prosecutors showed the jury prejudicial evidence they were not allowed to. Clemens was subsequently retried. The verdict from his second trial came in on June 18, 2012. Clemens was found not guilty on all six counts of lying to Congress in 2008, when he testified that he never took performance-enhancing drugs.

In January 2016, after Clemens once again fell short of the votes required for election into the Hall of Fame, former major-league star Roy Halladay tweeted &quot;No Clemens no Bonds&quot; as part of a message indicating no performance-enhancing substance users should be voted into the Hall. Clemens countered by accusing Halladay of using amphetamines during his playing career.

==Filmography==

Clemens has appeared as himself in several movies and television episodes and has also occasionally acted in films. Perhaps best known was his appearance in the season three episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;Homer at the Bat&quot;), in which he is recruited to the Springfield nuclear plant&#x27;s softball team but is accidentally hypnotized into thinking he is a chicken; in addition to his lines, Clemens voiced his own clucking. Clemens has also made guest appearances as himself on the TV shows &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot;, &quot;Arli$$&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; as well as the movie &quot;Anger Management&quot;, and makes a brief appearance in the movie &quot;Kingpin&quot; as the character Skidmark. He also is shown playing an actual game with the Houston Astros in the film &quot;Boyhood&quot;.

He appeared in the 1994 movie &quot;Cobb&quot; as an unidentified pitcher for the Philadelphia A&#x27;s. In 2003, he was part of an advertising campaign for Armour hot dogs with MLB players Ken Griffey Jr., Derek Jeter, and Sammy Sosa. Since 2005, Clemens has also appeared in many commercials for Texas-based supermarket chain H-E-B. In 2007, he appeared on a baseball-themed episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; (&quot;Baseball Myths&quot;). He has also starred in a commercial for Cingular parodying his return from retirement. He was calling his wife, Debra Godfrey, and a dropped call resulted in his return to the Yankees.

He released an early autobiography, &quot;Rocket Man: The Roger Clemens Story&quot; (written with Peter Gammons), in 1987. Clemens is also the spokesperson for Champion car dealerships in South Texas. In April 2009, Clemens was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Jeff Pearlman, titled &quot;The Rocket that Fell to Earth-Roger Clemens and the Rage for Baseball Immortality&quot;, that focused on his childhood and early career and accused Mike Piazza of using steroids. On May 12, Clemens broke a long silence to denounce a heavily researched exposé by four investigative reporters from the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; called &quot;American Icon: The Fall of Roger Clemens and the Rise of Steroids in America&#x27;s Pastime&quot;. Clemens went on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Mike and Mike&quot; show to call the book &quot;garbage&quot;, but a review by Michiko Kakutani of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the book &quot;gripping&quot; and compared it to the work of Bob Woodward.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1999, while many of his performances and milestones were yet to come he ranked number 53 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was elected by the fans to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2005, the updated &quot;Sporting News&quot; list moved Clemens up to #15.

By the end of the 2005 season, Clemens had won seven Cy Young Awards (he won the AL award in 1986, 1987, 1991, 1997, 1998, and 2001, and the National League award in 2004), an MVP and two pitching triple crowns. With his 2004 win, he joined Gaylord Perry, Randy Johnson, and Pedro Martínez as the only pitchers to win it in both leagues and became the oldest pitcher to ever win the Cy Young. He has also won the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award five times, was named an All-Star 11 times, and won the All-Star MVP in 1986.

In October 2006, Clemens was named to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s &quot;all-time&quot; team.

On August 18, 2007, Clemens got his 1,000th strikeout as a Yankee. He is only the ninth player in major league history to record 1,000 or more strikeouts with two different teams. Clemens has recorded a total of 2,590 strikeouts as a member of the Red Sox and 1,014 strikeouts as a Yankee. He also had 563 strikeouts for Toronto, and 505 strikeouts for Houston.

Clemens was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2014, and was inducted into the Pawtucket Red Sox Hall of Fame on June 21, 2019.

==Personal life==

Clemens married Debra Lynn Godfrey (born May 27, 1963) on November 24, 1984. The couple has four sons: Koby Aaron, Kory Allen, Kacy Austin, and Kody Alec—all given &quot;K&quot; names to honor Clemens&#x27;s strikeouts (&quot;K&quot;s). Koby was at one time a minor league prospect for some MLB clubs. Kacy played college baseball for the Texas Longhorns. Kody also played college baseball for the Texas Longhorns and made his major league debut with the Detroit Tigers on May 31, 2022.

Debra once left a Red Sox game, when Clemens pitched for another team, in tears from the heckling she received. This is documented in an updated edition of Dan Shaughnessy&#x27;s best-selling book, &quot;Curse of the Bambino&quot;. Debra was quoted in the book as saying that it was the poor attitude of Red Sox fans that prevented the team from winning the World Series (this was quoted prior to the team&#x27;s 2004 World Series victory).

Clemens is a member of the Republican Party and donated money to Texas congressman Ted Poe during his 2006 campaign.

Debra posed in a bikini with her husband for a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; pictorial regarding athletes and their wives. This appeared in the annual &quot;Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition&quot; for 2003. Roger wore his Yankees uniform, with the jersey open.

On February 27, 2006, to train for the World Baseball Classic, Roger pitched in an exhibition game between the Astros and his son&#x27;s minor league team. In his first at-bat, Koby hit a home run off his father. In his next at-bat, Roger threw an inside pitch that almost hit Koby. Koby laughed in an interview after the game about the incident.

===Adultery accusations===
In April 2008, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported on a possible long-term relationship between Clemens and country music singer Mindy McCready that began when she was 15 years old. Clemens&#x27;s attorney Rusty Hardin denied the affair and also stated that Clemens would be bringing a defamation suit regarding this allegation. Clemens&#x27;s attorney admitted that a relationship existed but described McCready as a &quot;close family friend&quot;. He also stated that McCready had traveled on Clemens&#x27;s personal jet and that Clemens&#x27;s wife was aware of the relationship. However, when contacted by the &quot;Daily News&quot;, McCready said, &quot;I cannot refute anything in the story.&quot;

On November 17, 2008, McCready spoke in more detail to &quot;Inside Edition&quot; about her affair with Clemens, saying their relationship lasted for more than a decade and that it ended when Clemens refused to leave his wife to marry her. However, she denied that she was 15 years old when it began, saying that they met when she was 16 and the affair only became sexual &quot;several years later&quot;. In another soon-to-be-released sex tape by Vivid Entertainment, she claimed that the first time she had sex with him was when she was 21. A few days after the &quot;Daily News&quot; broke the story about the McCready relationship, they reported on another Clemens extramarital relationship, this time with Paulette Dean Daly, the now ex-wife of pro golfer John Daly. Daly declined to elaborate on the nature of her relationship with the pitcher but did not deny that it was romantic and included financial support.

There have been reports of Clemens having at least three other affairs with women. On April 29, 2008, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Clemens had relationships with two or more women. One, a former bartender in Manhattan, refused comment on the story, while another, a woman from Tampa, could not be located. On May 2 of the same year, the &quot;Daily News&quot; reported a stripper in Detroit called a local radio station and said she had an affair with Clemens. He also gave tickets to baseball games, jewelry, and trips to women he was wooing.

<doc id="26078" wikidata="Q207640" url="?curid=26078" title="Robert E. Howard">
<text>Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 – June 11, 1936) was an American writer who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He created the character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre.

Howard was born and raised in Texas. He spent most of his life in the town of Cross Plains, with some time spent in nearby Brownwood. A bookish and intellectual child, he was also a fan of boxing, eventually taking up amateur boxing, and spent some time in his late teens bodybuilding. From the age of nine, he longed to become a writer of adventure fiction but did not have real success until he was 23. Thereafter, until his death by suicide at age 30, Howard&#x27;s writings were published in a wide selection of magazines, journals, and newspapers, and he became proficient in several subgenres. His greatest success occurred after his death.

Although a Conan novel was nearly published in 1934, Howard&#x27;s stories were never collected during his lifetime. The main outlet for his stories was &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, where Howard created Conan the Barbarian. With Conan and his other heroes, Howard helped fashion the genre now known as sword and sorcery, spawning many imitators and giving him a large influence in the fantasy field. Howard remains a highly read author, with his best works still reprinted, and is one of the best-selling fantasy writers of all time.

Howard&#x27;s suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have led to speculation about his mental health. His mother had been ill with tuberculosis her entire life, and upon learning she had entered a coma from which she was not expected to wake, he walked out to his car parked outside his kitchen window and shot himself in the head while sitting in the driver&#x27;s seat. He died eight hours later.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Howard was born January 22, 1906, in Peaster, Texas, the only son of a traveling country physician, Dr. Isaac Mordecai Howard, and his wife, Hester Jane Ervin Howard. His early life was spent wandering through a variety of Texas cowtowns and boomtowns: Dark Valley (1906), Seminole (1908), Bronte (1909), Poteet (1910), Oran (1912), Wichita Falls (1913), Bagwell (1913), Cross Cut (1915), and Burkett (1917).

During Howard&#x27;s youth his parents&#x27; relationship began to break down. The Howard family had problems with money, which might have been exacerbated by Isaac Howard investing in get-rich-quick schemes. Hester Howard, meanwhile, came to believe that she had married below herself. Soon the pair were actively fighting. Hester did not want Isaac to have anything to do with their son. She had a particularly strong influence on her son&#x27;s intellectual growth. She had spent her early years helping a variety of sick relatives, contracting tuberculosis in the process. She instilled in her son a deep love of poetry and literature, recited verse daily and supported him unceasingly in his efforts to write.

Other experiences would later seep into his prose. Although he loved reading and learning, he found school to be confining and began to hate having anyone in authority over him. Experiences watching and confronting bullies revealed the omnipresence of evil and enemies in the world, and taught him the value of physical strength and violence. As the son of the local doctor, Howard had frequent exposure to the effects of injury and violence, due to accidents on farms and oil fields combined with the massive increase in crime that came with the oil boom. Firsthand tales of gunfights, lynchings, feuds, and Indian raids developed his distinctly Texan, hardboiled outlook on the world. Sports, especially boxing, became a passionate preoccupation. At the time, boxing was the most popular sport in the country, with a cultural influence far in excess of what it is today. James J. Jeffries, Jack Johnson, Bob Fitzsimmons, and later Jack Dempsey were the names that inspired during those years, and he grew up a lover of all contests of violent, masculine struggle.

=== First writings ===
Voracious reading, along with a natural talent for prose writing and the encouragement of teachers, created in Howard an interest in becoming a professional writer. From the age of nine he began writing stories, mostly tales of historical fiction centering on Vikings, Arabs, battles, and bloodshed. One by one he discovered the authors who would influence his later work: Jack London and his stories of reincarnation and past lives, most notably &quot;The Star Rover&quot; (1915); Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s tales of subcontinent adventures; the classic mythological tales collected by Thomas Bulfinch. Howard was considered by friends to be eidetic, and astounded them with his ability to memorize lengthy reams of poetry with ease after one or two readings.

In 1919, when Howard was thirteen, Dr. Howard moved his family to the Central Texas hamlet of Cross Plains, and there the family would stay for the rest of Howard&#x27;s life. Howard&#x27;s father bought a house in the town with a cash down payment and made extensive renovations. That same year, sitting in a library in New Orleans while his father took medical courses at a nearby college, Howard discovered a book concerned with the scant fact and abundant legends surrounding an indigenous culture in ancient Scotland called the Picts.

In 1920, the Vestal Well within the limits of Cross Plains struck oil and Cross Plains became an oil boomtown. Thousands of people arrived in the town looking for oil wealth. New businesses sprang up from scratch and the crime rate increased to match. Cross Plains&#x27; population quickly grew from 1,500 to 10,000, it suffered overcrowding, the traffic ruined its unpaved roads and vice crime exploded but it also used its new wealth on civic improvements, including a new school, an ice manufacturing plant, and new hotels. Howard hated the boom and despised the people who came with it. He was already poorly disposed towards oil booms as they were the cause of the constant traveling in his early years but this was aggravated by what he perceived to be the effect oil booms had on towns.

At fifteen Howard first sampled pulp magazines, especially &quot;Adventure&quot; and its star authors Talbot Mundy and Harold Lamb. The next few years saw him creating a variety of series characters. Soon he was submitting stories to magazines such as &quot;Adventure&quot; and &quot;Argosy&quot;. Rejections piled up, and with no mentors or instructions of any kind to aid him, Howard became a writing autodidact, methodically studying the markets and tailoring his stories and style to each.

In the fall of 1922, when Howard was sixteen, he temporarily moved to a boarding house in the nearby city of Brownwood to complete his senior year of high school, accompanied by his mother. It was in Brownwood that he first met friends his own age who shared his interest not only for sports and history but also writing and poetry. The two most important of these, Tevis Clyde Smith and Truett Vinson, shared his Bohemian and literary outlook on life, and together they wrote amateur papers and magazines, exchanged long letters filled with poetry and existential thoughts on life and philosophy, and encouraged each other&#x27;s writing endeavors. Through Vinson, Howard was introduced to &quot;The Tattler&quot;, the newspaper of the Brownwood High School. It was in this publication that Howard&#x27;s stories were first printed. The December 1922 issue featured two stories, &quot;&#x27;Golden Hope Christmas&quot; and &quot;West is West&quot;, which won gold and silver prizes respectively.

Howard graduated from high school in May 1923 and moved back to Cross Plains. On his return to his home town he engaged in a self-created regimen of exercise, including cutting down oak trees and chopping them into firewood every day, lifting weights, punching a bag and springing exercises, eventually building himself from a skinny teenager into a more muscled, burly form.

=== Professional writer ===

Howard spent his late teens working odd jobs around Cross Plains, all of which he hated. In 1924, Howard returned to Brownwood to take a stenography course at Howard Payne College, this time boarding with his friend Lindsey Tyson instead of his mother. Howard would have preferred a literary course but was not allowed to take one. The reason for this is undocumented, however biographer Mark Finn suggests that his father refused to pay for such a non-vocational education. In the week of Thanksgiving that year, and after years of rejection slips and near acceptances, he finally sold a short caveman tale titled &quot;Spear and Fang&quot;, which netted him the sum of $16 and introduced him to the readers of a struggling pulp called &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

Now that his career in fiction had begun, Howard dropped out of Howard Payne College at the end of the semester and returned to Cross Plains. Shortly afterwards, he received notice that another story, &quot;The Hyena&quot;, had been accepted by &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. During the same period, Howard made his first attempt to write a novel, a loosely autobiographical book modeled on Jack London&#x27;s &quot;Martin Eden&quot; and titled &quot;Post Oaks &amp; Sand Roughs&quot;. The book was otherwise of middling quality and was never published in the author&#x27;s lifetime, but it is of interest to Howard scholars for the personal information it contains. Howard&#x27;s alter ego in this novel is Steve Costigan, a name he would use more than once in the future. The novel was finished in 1928, but not published until long after his death.

&quot;Weird Tales&quot; paid on publication, meaning that Howard had no money of his own at this time. To remedy this, he took a job writing oil news for the local newspaper &quot;Cross Plains Review&quot; at $5 per column. It was not until July 1925 that Howard received payment for his first printed story. Howard lost his job at the newspaper in the same year and spent one month working in a post office before quitting over the low wages. His next job, at the Cross Plains Natural Gas Company, did not last long due to his refusal to be subservient to his boss. He did manual labor for a surveyor for a time before beginning a job as a stenographer for an oil company.

In conjunction with his friend Tevis Clyde Smith, he dabbled heavily in verse, writing hundreds of poems and getting dozens published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and assorted poetry journals. With poor sales, and many publishers recoiling from his subject matter, Howard ultimately judged poetry writing a luxury he could not afford, and after 1930 he wrote little verse, instead dedicating his time to short stories and higher-paying markets. Nevertheless, as a result of this apprenticeship, his stories increasingly took on the aura of &quot;prose-poems&quot; filled with hypnotic, dreamy imagery and a power lacking in most other pulp efforts of the time.

Further story sales to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; were sporadic but encouraging, and soon Howard was a regular in the magazine. His first cover story was for &quot;Wolfshead&quot;, a werewolf story published when he was only twenty. On reading &quot;Wolfshead&quot; in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; Howard became dismayed with his writing. He quit his stenographer&#x27;s job to work at Robertson&#x27;s Drug Store, where he rose to become head soda jerk on $80 per week. However, he resented the job itself and worked such long hours every day of the week that he became ill. He relaxed by visiting the Neeb Ice House, to which he was introduced by an oil field worker befriended at the drug store, to drink and began to take part in boxing matches. These matches became an important part of his life; the combination of boxing and writing provided an outlet for his frustrations and anger.

=== Sword and sorcery ===

In August 1926, Howard quit his exhausting job at the drug store and, in September, returned to Brownwood to complete his bookkeeping course. It was during this August that he began working on the story that would become &quot;The Shadow Kingdom&quot;, one of the most important works of his career. While at college, Howard wrote for their newspaper, &quot;The Yellow Jacket&quot;. One of the short stories printed in this newspaper was a comedy called &quot;Cupid vs. Pollux&quot;. This story is Howard&#x27;s earliest surviving boxing story known to exist; it is told in the first person, uses elements of a traditional tall-tale and is a fictionalized account of Howard (as &quot;Steve&quot;) and his friend Lindsey Tyson (as &quot;Spike&quot;) training for a fight. This story and the elements it uses would also be important in Howard&#x27;s literary future.

In May 1927, after having to return home due to contracting measles and then being forced to retake the course, Howard passed his exams. While waiting for the official graduation in August, he returned to writing, including a re-write of &quot;The Shadow Kingdom&quot;. He rewrote it again in August and submitted it to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in September. This story was an experiment with the entire concept of the &quot;weird tale&quot; horror fiction as defined by practitioners such as Edgar Allan Poe, A. Merritt, and H. P. Lovecraft, mixing elements of fantasy, horror and mythology with historical romance, action and swordplay into thematic vehicles never before seen, a new style of tale that ultimately became known as &quot;sword and sorcery&quot;. Featuring Kull, a barbarian precursor to later Howard heroes such as Conan, the tale hit &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in August 1929 and received fanfare from readers. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; editor Farnsworth Wright bought the story for $100, the most Howard had earned for a story at this time, and several more Kull stories followed. However, all but two were rejected, convincing Howard not to continue the series.

In March 1928, Howard salvaged and re-submitted to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; a story rejected by the more popular pulp &quot;Argosy&quot;, and the result was &quot;Red Shadows&quot;, the first of many stories featuring the vengeful Puritan swashbuckler Solomon Kane. Appearing in the August 1928 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, the character was a big hit with readers and this was the first of Howard&#x27;s characters to sustain a series in print beyond just two stories, with seven Kane stories printed from 1928 to 1932. As the magazine published the Solomon Kane tale before Kull, this can be considered the first published example of sword and sorcery.

1929 was the year Howard broke out into other pulp markets, rather than just &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. The first story he sold to another magazine was &quot;The Apparition in the Prize Ring&quot;, a boxing-related ghost story published in the magazine &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;. In July of the same year, &quot;Argosy&quot; finally published one of Howard&#x27;s stories, &quot;Crowd-Horror&quot;, which was also a boxing story. Neither developed into ongoing series, however.

After several minor successes and false starts, he struck gold again with a new series based on one of his favorite passions: boxing. July 1929 saw the debut of Sailor Steve Costigan in the pages of &quot;Fight Stories&quot;. A tough-as-nails, two-fisted mariner with a head of rocks and occasionally a heart of gold, Costigan began boxing his way through a variety of exotic seaports and adventure locales, becoming so popular in &quot;Fight Stories&quot; that the same editors began using additional Costigan episodes in their sister magazine &quot;Action Stories&quot;. The series saw a return to Howard&#x27;s use of humor and (unreliable) first-person narration, with the combination of a traditional tall tale and slapstick comedy. Stories sold to &quot;Fight Stories&quot; provided Howard with a market just as stable as &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

Due to his success in &quot;Fight Stories&quot;, Howard was contacted by the publisher Street &amp; Smith in February 1931 with a request to move the Steve Costigan stories to their own pulp &quot;Sport Story Magazine&quot;. Howard refused but created a new, similar series just for them based on a boxer called Kid Allison. Howard wrote ten stories for this series but &quot;Sport Story&quot; only published three of them.

With solid markets now all buying up his stories regularly, Howard quit taking college classes, and indeed would never again work a regular job. At twenty-three years of age, from the middle of nowhere in Texas, he had become a full-time writer; he was making good money and his father began bragging about his success, not to mention buying multiple copies of his work in the pulps.

Howard&#x27;s &quot;Celtic phase&quot; began in 1930, during which he became fascinated by Celtic themes and his own Irish ancestry. He shared this enthusiasm with Harold Preece, a friend made in Austin in the summer of 1927; Howard&#x27;s letters to both Preece and Clyde Smith contain much Irish-related material and discussion. Howard taught himself a little Gaelic, examined the Irish parts of his family history and began writing about Irish characters. Turlogh Dubh O&#x27;Brien and Cormac Mac Art were created at this time, although he was not able to sell the latter&#x27;s stories.

When Farnsworth Wright started a new pulp in 1930 called &quot;Oriental Stories&quot;, Howard was overjoyed—here was a venue where he could run riot through favorite themes of history and battle and exotic mysticism. During the four years of the magazine&#x27;s existence, he crafted some of his very best tales, gloomy vignettes of war and rapine in the Middle and Far East during the Middle Ages and the early Renaissance, tales that rival even his best Conan stories for their historical sweep and splendor. In addition to series characters such as Turlogh Dubh O&#x27;Brien and Cormac Fitzgeoffrey, Howard sold a variety of tales depicting various times and periods from the fall of Rome to the fifteenth century. The magazine eventually ceased publication in 1934 due to the Depression, leaving several of Howard&#x27;s stories aimed at this market unsold.

===Lovecraft Circle===
In August 1930 Howard wrote a letter to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; praising a recent reprint of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot; and discussing some of the obscure Gaelic references used within. Editor Farnsworth Wright forwarded the letter to Lovecraft, who responded warmly to Howard, and soon the two &quot;Weird Tales&quot; veterans were engaged in a vigorous correspondence that would last for the rest of Howard&#x27;s life. By virtue of this, Howard quickly became a member of the &quot;Lovecraft Circle&quot;, a group of writers and friends all linked via the immense correspondence of H. P. Lovecraft (who wrote over 100,000 letters in his lifetime), who made it a point to introduce his many like-minded friends to one another and encourage them to share stories, utilize each other&#x27;s invented fictional trappings, and help each other succeed in the pulp field. In time this circle of correspondents has developed a legendary patina about it rivaling similar literary conclaves such as The Inklings, the Bloomsbury Group, and the Beats.

Howard was given the affectionate nickname &quot;Two-Gun Bob&quot; by virtue of his long explications to Lovecraft about the history of his beloved Southwest, and during the ensuing years he contributed several notable elements to Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos of horror stories (beginning with &quot;The Black Stone&quot;, his Mythos stories also included &quot;The Cairn on the Headland&quot;, &quot;The Children of the Night&quot; and &quot;The Fire of Asshurbanipal&quot;). He also corresponded with other &quot;Weird Tale&quot; writers such as Clark Ashton Smith, August Derleth, and E. Hoffmann Price.

The correspondence between Howard and Lovecraft contained a lengthy discussion on a frequent element in Howard&#x27;s fiction, barbarism versus civilization. Howard held that civilization was inherently corrupt and fragile. This attitude is summed up in his famous line from &quot;Beyond the Black River&quot;: &quot;Barbarism is the natural state of mankind. Civilization is unnatural. It is a whim of circumstance. And barbarism must always ultimately triumph.&quot; Lovecraft held the opposite viewpoint, that civilization was the peak of human achievement and the only way forward. Howard countered by listing many historic abuses of the citizenry by so-called &#x27;civilized&#x27; leaders. Howard initially deferred to Lovecraft but gradually asserted his own views, even coming to deride Lovecraft&#x27;s opinions.

In 1930, with his interest in Solomon Kane dwindling and his Kull stories not catching on, Howard applied his new sword-and-sorcery and horror experience to one of his first loves: the Picts. His story &quot;Kings of the Night&quot; depicted King Kull conjured into pre-Christian Britain to aid the Picts in their struggle against the invading Romans, and introduced readers to Howard&#x27;s king of the Picts, Bran Mak Morn. Howard followed up this tale with the now-classic revenge nightmare &quot;Worms of the Earth&quot; and several other tales, creating horrific adventures tinged with a Cthulhu-esque gloss and notable for their use of metaphor and symbolism.

With the onset of the Great Depression, many pulp markets reduced their schedules or went out of business entirely. Howard saw market after market falter and vanish. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; became a bimonthly publication and pulps such as &quot;Fight Stories&quot;, &quot;Action Stories&quot;, and &quot;Strange Tales&quot; all folded. Howard was further hit when his savings were wiped out in 1931 when the Farmer&#x27;s National Bank failed, and again, after transferring to another bank, when that one failed as well.

=== Conan ===


Early 1932 saw Howard taking one of his frequent trips around Texas. He traveled through the southern part of the state with his main occupation being, in his own words, &quot;the wholesale consumption of tortillas, enchiladas and cheap Spanish wine.&quot; In Fredericksburg, while overlooking sullen hills through a misty rain, he conceived of the fantasy land of Cimmeria, a bitter hard northern region home to fearsome barbarians. In February, while in Mission, he wrote the poem &quot;Cimmeria&quot;.

It was also during this trip that Howard first conceived of the character of Conan. Later, in 1935, Howard claimed in a letter to Clark Ashton Smith that Conan &quot;simply grew up in my mind a few years ago when I was stopping in a little border town on the lower Rio Grande.&quot; However, the character actually took nine months to develop.

Howard had originally used the name &quot;Conan&quot; for a Gael in a past-life-themed story he completed in October 1931, which was published in the magazine &quot;Strange Tales&quot; in June 1932. Although the character swears by the god &quot;Crom&quot;, that is his only link to the more famous successor character.

Going back home he developed the idea, fleshing out a new invented world—his Hyborian Age—and populating it with all manner of countries, peoples, monsters, and magic. Howard loved history and enjoyed writing historical stories. However, the research necessary for a purely historical setting was too time-consuming for him to engage in on a regular basis and still earn a living. The Hyborian Age, with its varied settings similar to real places and eras of history, allowed him to write fantastical historical fiction without such problems. He may have been inspired in the creation of his setting by Thomas Bulfinch&#x27;s 1913 edition of his &quot;Bulfinch&#x27;s Mythology&quot; called &quot;The Outline of Mythology&quot;, which contained stories from history and legend, including many that were direct influences on Howard&#x27;s work. Another potential inspiration is G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;The Ballad of the White Horse&quot; and Chesterton&#x27;s concept that &quot;it is the chief value of legend to mix up the centuries while preserving the sentiment.&quot;

By March, Howard had recycled an unpublished Kull story called &quot;By This Axe I Rule!&quot; into his first Conan story. The central plot remains that of a barbarian having become king of a civilized country and a conspiracy to assassinate him. However, he removed an entire subplot concerning a couple&#x27;s romance and created a new one with a supernatural element; the story was re-titled &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot;, an element from this new subplot. Howard immediately went on to write two more Conan stories. The first of these was &quot;The Frost-Giant&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, an inversion of the Greek myth surrounding Apollo and Daphne, set much earlier in Conan&#x27;s life. The last of the initial trio was &quot;The God in the Bowl&quot;, which went through three drafts and has a slower pace than most Conan stories. This one is a murder mystery filled with corrupt officials and serves as Conan&#x27;s introduction into civilization, while showing that he is a more decent person than the civilized characters. Before the end of the month, he sent the first two stories to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the same package, with the third following a few days later.

With these three completed he created an essay called &quot;The Hyborian Age&quot; in order to flesh out his setting in more detail. There were four drafts of this essay, starting with a two-page outline and finishing as an 8,000-word essay. Howard supplemented this with two sketched maps and an additional short piece entitled &quot;Notes on Various Peoples of the Hyborian Age.&quot;

In a letter dated March 10, 1932, Farnsworth Wright rejected &quot;The Frost-Giant&#x27;s Daughter&quot; but noted that &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; had &quot;points of real excellence&quot; and suggested changes. &quot;The God in the Bowl&quot; would also be rejected and so a potential fourth Conan story concerning Conan as a thief was abandoned at the synopsis stage. Instead of abandoning the entire Conan concept, as had happened with previous failed characters, Howard rewrote &quot;The Phoenix on the Sword&quot; based on Wright&#x27;s feedback and including material from his essay. Both this revision and the next Conan story, &quot;The Tower of the Elephant&quot;, sold with no problems. Howard had written nine Conan stories before the first saw print.

Conan first appeared to the public in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in December 1932 and was such a hit that Howard was eventually able to place seventeen Conan stories in the magazine between 1933 and 1936. Howard then took a short break from Conan after his initial burst of stories, returning to the character in mid-1933. These stories, his &quot;middle period&quot;, are routine and considered the weakest of the series. Stories, such as &quot;Iron Shadows in the Moon&quot;, were often simply Conan rescuing a damsel in distress from a monster in some ruins. While earlier Conan stories had three or four drafts, some in this period had only two including the final version. &quot;Rogues in the House&quot; is the only Conan story to be completed in a single draft. These stories sold easily and they include the first and second Conan stories to feature on the cover of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, &quot;Black Colossus&quot; and &quot;Xuthal of the Dusk&quot;. Howard&#x27;s motivation for quick and easy sales at this time was influenced by the collapse of some other markets, such as &quot;Fight Stories&quot;, in the Depression.

Also in this period, Howard wrote the first of the James Allison stories, &quot;Marchers of Valhalla&quot;. Allison is a disabled Texan who begins to recall his past lives, the first of which is in the later part of Howard&#x27;s new Hyborian age. In a letter to Clark Ashton Smith in October 1933, he wrote that its sequel &quot;The Garden of Fear&quot; was &quot;dealing with one of my various conceptions of the Hyborian and post-Hyborian world.&quot;

In May 1933, a British publisher, Denis Archer, contacted Howard about publishing a book in the United Kingdom. Howard submitted a batch of his best available stories, including &quot;The Tower of the Elephant&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Citadel&quot;, on June 15. In January 1934 the publisher rejected the collection but suggested a novel instead. Though the publisher was &quot;exceedingly interested&quot; in the stories, the rejection letter explained that there was a &quot;prejudice that is very strong over here just now against collections of short stories.&quot; The suggested novel, however, could be published by Pawling and Ness Ltd in a first edition of 5,000 copies for lending libraries.

In late 1933 Howard returned to Conan, starting again slightly awkwardly with &quot;The Devil in Iron&quot;. However, this was followed with the beginning of the latter group of Conan stories that &quot;carry the most intellectual punch,&quot; starting with &quot;The People of the Black Circle&quot;.

Howard probably began to work on the novel in February 1934, starting to write &quot;Almuric&quot; (a non-Conan, sword and planet science fiction novel) but abandoned it half way. This was followed by another abortive attempt at a novel, this time a Conan novel that later became &quot;Drums of Tombalku&quot;. The third attempt at writing the novel was more successful, resulting in Howard&#x27;s only Conan novel &quot;The Hour of the Dragon&quot;, which was probably started on or around March 17, 1934. This novel combines elements of two previous Conan stories, &quot;Black Colossus&quot; and &quot;The Scarlet Citadel&quot;, with Arthurian myth and provides an overview of Conan and the Hyborian age for the new British audience. Howard sent his final draft to Denis Archer on May 20, 1934. He had worked exclusively on the novel for two months, writing approximately 5,000 words per day, seven days a week. Although he told acquaintances that he had little hope for this novel, he had put a lot of effort into it. However, the publisher went into receivership in late 1934, before it could print the novel. The story was briefly held as part of the company&#x27;s assets before being returned to Howard. It was later printed in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; as a serial over five months, beginning with the December 1935 issue.

Howard may have begun losing interest in Conan in late 1934, with a growing desire to write westerns. He began to write, although never finished, a Conan story called &quot;Wolves Beyond the Border&quot;. This was the first Conan tale to have an explicit (Robert W. Chambers-influenced) American setting, although American themes had appeared earlier, and the only one in which Conan himself does not appear. His next story was based on his unfinished material and became &quot;Beyond the Black River&quot;, which not only used the different American-frontier setting but was also, in Howard&#x27;s own words, a &quot;Conan yarn without sex interest.&quot; In another novel twist, Conan and the other protagonists have, at best, a pyrrhic victory; this was rare for pulp magazines. This was followed by another experimental Conan story, &quot;The Black Stranger&quot;, with a similar setting. The story was, however, rejected by &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, which was rare for later Conan stories. Howard&#x27;s next piece, &quot;The Man-Eaters of Zamboula&quot;, was more formulaic and was accepted by the magazine with no problems. Howard only wrote one more Conan story, &quot;Red Nails&quot;, which was influenced both by his personal experiences at the time and an extrapolation of his views on civilization.

The character of Conan had a wide and enduring influence among other &quot;Weird Tales&quot; writers, including C. L. Moore and Fritz Leiber, and over the ensuing decades the genre of sword and sorcery grew up around Howard&#x27;s masterwork, with dozens of practitioners evoking Howard&#x27;s creation to one degree or another.

=== New markets ===
In spring 1933, Howard started to place work with Otis Adelbert Kline, a former pulp writer, as his agent. Kline encouraged him to try writing in other genres in order to expand into different markets. Kline&#x27;s agency was successful in finding outlets for more of Howard&#x27;s stories and even placed works that had been rejected when Howard was marketing himself alone. Howard continued to sell directly to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, however.

Howard wrote one of the first &quot;Weird Western&quot; stories ever created, &quot;The Horror from the Mound&quot;, published in the May 1932 issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. This genre acted as a bridge between his early &quot;weird&quot; stories (a contemporary term for horror and fantasy) and his later straight western tales.

He tried writing detective fiction but hated reading mystery stories and disliked writing them; he was not successful in this genre. More successfully, in late 1933 Howard took a character conceived in his youth, El Borak, and began using him in mature, professional tales of World War I-era Middle Eastern adventure that landed in &quot;Top Notch&quot;, &quot;Complete Stories&quot;, and &quot;Thrilling Adventures&quot;. The 1920s version was a treasure-hunting adventurer but the 1930s version, first seen in &quot;The Daughter of Erlik Khan&quot; in the December 1934 issue of &quot;Top-Notch&quot;, was a grim gun-fighter keeping the peace after having gone native in Afghanistan. The stories have a lot in common with those of Talbot Mundy, Harold Lamb and T. E. Lawrence, with Western themes and Howard&#x27;s hardboiled style of writing. As with his other series, he created another character in the same vein, Kirby O&#x27;Donnell, but this character lacked the grim, western elements and was not as successful.

In the years since Conan had been created, Howard found himself increasingly fascinated with the history and lore of Texas and the American Southwest. Many of his letters to H. P. Lovecraft ran for a dozen pages or more, filled with stories he had picked up from elderly Civil War veterans, Texas Rangers, and pioneers. His Conan stories began featuring western elements, most notably in &quot;Beyond the Black River&quot;, &quot;The Black Stranger&quot;, and the unfinished &quot;Wolves Beyond the Border&quot;. By 1934 some of the markets killed off by the Depression had come back, and &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was over $1500 behind on payments to Howard. The author therefore stopped writing weird fiction and turned his attentions to this steadily growing passion.

The first of Howard&#x27;s most commercially successful series (within his own lifetime) was started in July 1933. &quot;Mountain Man&quot; was the first of the Breckinridge Elkins stories, humorous westerns in a similar style to his earlier Sailor Steve Costigan stories and again featuring an exaggerated, cartoonish version of Howard himself as the main character. Written as tall tales in the vein of Texas &quot;Tall Lying&quot; stories, the story first appeared in the March–April 1934 issue of &quot;Action Stories&quot; and was so successful that other magazines asked Howard for similar characters. Howard created Pike Bearfield for &quot;Argosy&quot; and Buckner J. Grimes for &quot;Cowboy Stories&quot;. &quot;Action Stories&quot; published a new Elkins story every issue without fail until well after Howard&#x27;s death. At Kline&#x27;s suggestion, he also created &quot;A Gent from Bear Creek&quot;, a Breckinridge Elkins novel comprising existing short stories and new material.

Conan remained the only character that Howard ever spoke of with his friends in Texas and the only one in whom they seemed interested. It is possible that Breckinridge Elkins and the other characters in his stories were too close to home for Howard to be entirely comfortable discussing them.

In the spring of 1936, Howard sold a series of &quot;spicy&quot; stories to &quot;Spicy-Adventure Stories&quot;. The &quot;spicy&quot; series of pulp magazines dealt in stories that were considered borderline softcore pornography at the time but are now similar to romance novels. These stories, which Howard referred to as &quot;bubby-twisters&quot;, featured the character Wild Bill Clanton and were published under the pseudonym Sam Walser.

=== Novalyne Price ===
Howard is known to have had only one girlfriend in his life, Novalyne Price. Price was an ex-girlfriend of Tevis Clyde Smith, one of Howard&#x27;s best friends, whom she had known since high school; Smith and Price had remained friends after their relationship ended. In the spring of 1933, Howard was visiting Smith after driving his mother to a Brownwood clinic. Howard and Smith drove to the Price farm and Smith introduced his friends to each other. Price was an aspiring writer, had heard of Howard from Smith in the past, and was enthusiastic to meet him in person. However, he was not what she expected. She wrote in her diary about this first meeting: &quot;This man was a writer! Him? It was unbelievable. He was not dressed as I thought a writer should dress.&quot; They parted after a drive and would not see each other again for over a year.

In late 1934, Price got a job as a schoolteacher in Cross Plains High School through her cousin, who was the head of the English department. When Howard came up in conversation with her new colleagues, she defended him from accusations of being a &quot;freak&quot; and &quot;crazy&quot;, then phoned his house and left a message. When the call was not returned, she tried a few more times. Price finally visited the Howard house in person after having her telephone calls blocked by Hester Howard. After a drive through town, Howard and Price arranged their first date.

Over much of the next two years, they dated on and off, spending much time discussing writing, philosophy, history, religion, reincarnation, and much else. Both considered marriage but never at the same time. Price became ill from overwork in mid-1935. Her doctor, a friend of Howard&#x27;s father, advised her to end the relationship and get a job in a different state. Despite agreeing to this, she met with Howard soon after being discharged. Howard, however, was too preoccupied with the state of his mother&#x27;s health to give her the attention she wanted. Their relationship did not last much longer.

Not considering herself to be in an exclusive relationship, Price began dating one of Howard&#x27;s best friends, Truett Vinson. Howard discovered his friends&#x27; relationship while he and Truett were on a week&#x27;s trip together to New Mexico (the same trip that inspired a lot of the final Conan story &quot;Red Nails&quot;). The relationship between Howard and Price was irrevocably scarred, but they continued visiting with each other as friends until May 1936, when Price left Cross Plains for to pursue a graduate degree at Louisiana State University. The two never spoke or wrote to each other again.

In an effort to improve her memory and writing, Price had begun recording all her daily conversations into a journal, in the process preserving an intimate record of her time with Howard. This was useful years later when she wrote of their relationship in her book &quot;One Who Walked Alone&quot;. This book became the basis for the 1996 film &quot;The Whole Wide World&quot; starring Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio as Howard and Renée Zellweger as Price.

=== Death ===

By 1936, almost all of Howard&#x27;s fiction writing was being devoted to westerns. The novel &quot;A Gent from Bear Creek&quot; was due to be published by Herbert Jenkins in England, and by all accounts it looked as if he was finally breaking out of the pulps and into the more prestigious book market. However, life was becoming especially difficult for Howard. All of his close friends had married and were immersed in their careers, Novalyne Price had left Cross Plains for graduate school, and his most reliable market, &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, had grown far behind on its payments. His home life was also falling apart. Having suffered from tuberculosis for decades, his mother was finally nearing death. The constant interruptions of care workers at home, combined with frequent trips to various sanatoriums for her care, made it nearly impossible for Howard to write.

In hindsight, there were hints about Howard&#x27;s plans. Several times in 1935–36, whenever his mother&#x27;s health had declined, he made veiled allusions to his father about planning suicide, which his father did not understand at the time. He had made references when speaking to Novalyne Price about being in his &quot;sere and yellow leaf&quot;. The words sounded familiar to her, but it was only in early June 1936 that she found the source in &quot;Macbeth&quot;:
In the weeks before his suicide, Howard wrote to Kline giving his agent instructions of what to do in case of his death, he wrote his last will and testament, and he borrowed a .380 Colt Automatic from his friend Lindsey Tyson. On June 10, he drove to Brownwood and bought a burial plot for the whole family. On the night before his suicide, when his father confirmed that his mother was finally dying, he asked where his father would go afterwards. Isaac Howard replied that he would go wherever his son went, thinking he meant to leave Cross Plains. It is possible that Howard thought his father would join him in ending their lives together as a family.

In June 1936, as Hester Howard slipped into her final coma, her son maintained a death vigil with his father and friends of the family, getting little sleep, drinking huge amounts of coffee, and growing more despondent. On the morning of June 11, 1936, Howard asked one of his mother&#x27;s nurses, a Mrs. Green, if his mother would ever regain consciousness. When she told him no, he walked out to his car in the driveway, took the pistol from the glove box, and shot himself in the head. He died eight hours later, and his mother died the following day. The story occupied the entirety of that week&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Cross Plains Review&quot;, along with the publication of Howard&#x27;s &quot;A Man-Eating Jeopard&quot;. On June 14, 1936, a double funeral service was held at Cross Plains First Baptist Church, and both were buried in Greenleaf Cemetery in Brownwood, Texas.
==Health==
Robert E. Howard&#x27;s health, especially his mental health, has been the focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life. In terms of physical health, Howard had a weak heart, which he treated by taking Digoxin. The precise nature of Howard&#x27;s mental health has been much debated, both during his life and following his suicide. Three main points of view exist: some have declared that Howard suffered from an Oedipal complex or similar; another viewpoint is that Howard suffered from major depressive disorder; the third view is that Howard had no disorders and his suicide was a common reaction to stress.

==Character sketch==
===Attitudes===
Howard&#x27;s attitude towards race and racism is debated. Howard used race as shorthand for physical characteristics and motivation. He would also employ some racial stereotypes, possibly for the sake of simplification. He was also of the belief that, no matter who won the subsequent conflicts, it would only ever be a temporary victory. In &quot;Wings in the Night&quot;, for instance, Howard writes that:

Howard became less racist as he grew older, due to several influences. Later works include more sympathetic black characters, as well as other minority groups, such as Jews. Significant works in terms of Howard&#x27;s views on race are &quot;Black Canaan&quot; and &quot;The Last White Man&quot;, which depict white protagonists at war with black characters defined by barbarity.

Howard had feminist views, despite his era and location, which he espoused in both personal and professional life. Howard wrote to his friends and associates defending the achievements and capabilities of women. Strong female characters in Howard&#x27;s works of fiction include the protofeminist Dark Agnes de Chastillon (first appearing in &quot;Sword Woman&quot;, circa 1932–1934); the early modern pirate Helen Tavrel (&quot;The Isle of Pirates&#x27; Doom&quot;, 1928), two pirates and Conan supporting characters, Bêlit (&quot;Queen of the Black Coast&quot;, 1934) and Valeria of the Red Brotherhood (&quot;Red Nails&quot;, 1936); as well as the Ukrainian mercenary Red Sonya of Rogatino (&quot;The Shadow of the Vulture&quot;, 1934).

===Physical===
Physically, Howard was tall and heavily built. He had a gentle, round face with a soft, deep voice. E. Hoffmann Price wrote that when he first met Howard in 1934 he &quot;was busy trying to combine two images, that of the actual man, and that of the man who loomed up in those stirring yarns. The synthesis was never effected. He was packed with the whimsy and poetry which rang out in his letters, and blazed up in much of his published fiction, but, as is usually the case with writers, his appearance belied him. His face was boyish, not yet having squared off into angles; his blue eyes slightly prominent, had a wide-openness which did not suggest anything of the man&#x27;s keen wit and agile fancy. That first picture persists—a powerful, solid, round-faced fellow, kindly and somewhat stolid seeming.&quot;

===Leisure activities===
Howard enjoyed listening to other people&#x27;s stories. He listened to tales told by family members growing up and, as an adult, collected stories from any older people willing to tell them. Howard&#x27;s parents were both natural storytellers of different kinds and he grew up in early 20th century Texas, an environment in which the telling of tall tales was a standard form of entertainment. Howard himself was a natural storyteller and later a professional storyteller. Combined, this often led to Howard embellishing facts in his communication, not with an intention to deceive but just to make a better story. This can be a problem for biographers reading his works and letters with an aim to understand Howard himself.

Howard had an almost photographic memory and could memorize long poems after only a few readings. Howard also enjoyed listening to music and drama on the radio. However his main interests were sports and politics, and he would listen to match reports and election results as they came in.

After Howard bought a car in 1932, he and his friends took regular excursions across Texas and nearby states. His letters to Lovecraft also contain information about the history and geography he encountered on his journeys. Howard was also a practitioner and fan of boxing, as well as an avid weightlifter.

== Writing ==

Howard&#x27;s first published poem was &quot;&quot;, in an early 1923 issue of local newspaper &quot;The Baylor United Statement&quot;. His first published story was &quot;Spear and Fang&quot;, sold in late November 1924 and published in the July 1925 issue of the pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. However, Howard&#x27;s first real success was the Sailor Steve Costigan series of humorous boxing stories, beginning with &quot;The Pit of the Serpent&quot; published in the July 1929 issue of the pulp magazine &quot;Fight Stories&quot;.

===Styles and themes===
Howard&#x27;s distinctive literary style relies on a combination of existentialism, poetic lyricism, violence, grimness, humour, burlesque, and a degree of hardboiled realism. Howard&#x27;s background in Texan tall tales is the source of the rhythm, drive and authenticity of his work. Howard used an economy of words to sketch out scenes in his stories; his ability to do so has been attributed to his skill with, and experience of, both tall tales and poetry. The tone of Howard&#x27;s works, especially in the Conan stories, is hardboiled and dark. This is contrasted with the fantastic elements contained within the stories. Direct experience of the oil booms in early 20th century Texas influenced Howard&#x27;s view of civilization. The benefits of progress came with lawlessness and corruption. One of the most common themes in Howard&#x27;s writing is based on his view of history, a repeating pattern of civilizations reaching their peak, becoming decadent, decaying and then being conquered by another people. Many of his works are set in the period of decay or among the ruins the dead civilization leaves behind.

===Influence and influences===
The oil boom in Texas was &quot;one of the most powerful influences on [Howard&#x27;s] life and art&quot;, albeit one that he hated. Howard grew to despise the oil industry along with everyone and everything associated with it. The oil boom heavily influenced Howard&#x27;s view of civilization as a constant cycle of boom and bust in the same manner as the oil industry in contemporary Texas. A town such as Cross Plains was built by pioneers. The boom brought civilization in the form of people and investment but also social breakdown. The oil people contributed little or nothing to the town in the long term and eventually left for the next oil field. This led Howard to see civilization as corrupting and society as a whole in decay.

Howard first bought a pulp magazine, a copy of &quot;Adventure&quot;, when he was fifteen. The stories and writers featured in this magazine were a strong influence on Howard. In the same year, he sent his first story, &quot;Bill Smalley and the Power of the Human Eye&quot;, to the magazine, although it was rejected. Despite repeated attempts during his life, Howard never sold a story to &quot;Adventure&quot;.

Howard was both influenced by and an influence on his friend H. P. Lovecraft. Many ideas that he discussed in his letters to Lovecraft were repeated in his fiction and the discussion with a fellow professional writer was useful to him. For his part, Lovecraft began to include Howardian action sequences in his own work, for example in &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;. Much of 1931 was spent by Howard attempting to mimic Lovecraft&#x27;s style. After that year, he had absorbed the parts of it that worked best for him and made them his own.

Another inspiration for Howard was Theosophy and the theories of Helena Blavatsky and William Scott-Elliot, who described lost civilizations, ancient wisdom, races, magic and sunken continents and the lands of Lemuria, Atlantis and Hyperborea, and also influenced other writers of weird fiction.

Howard influenced and inspired later writers including Samuel R. Delany, David Gemmell, Michael Moorcock, Matthew Woodring Stover, Charles R. Saunders, Karl Edward Wagner, Paul Kearney, Steven Erikson, Joe R. Lansdale, and William King. He also has an influence on the field of fantasy fiction rivaled only by J. R. R. Tolkien and Tolkien&#x27;s similarly inspired creation of the modern genre of high fantasy.

===Criticism===
Criticism of Robert E. Howard and his work often turns towards biographical details and &quot;backhanded Some imply that Howard was an uneducated idiot savant and that his success was due more to luck than skill.

The first professional critic to comment on Howard&#x27;s work was Hoffman Reynolds Hays, reviewing the Arkham House collection &quot;Skull-Face and Others&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot;. Under the title &quot;Superman on a Psychotic Bender&quot;, Hays wrote, &quot;Howard used a good deal of the Lovecraft cosmogony and demonology, but his own contribution was a sadistic conqueror who, when cracking heads did not solve his difficulties, had recourse to magic and the aid of Lovecraft&#x27;s Elder Gods. The stories are written on a competent pulp level (a higher level, by the way, than that of some best sellers) and are allied to the Superman genre which pours forth in countless comic books and radio serials.&quot; Hays then moved on to Howard himself and the genre in which he wrote:

In a review of Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s essay &quot;H. P. Lovecraft: Against the World, Against Life&quot; published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, April 17, 2005, Stephen King implies that Howard did not work at his craft and was merely Lovecraft. King described his disapproval of the sword and sorcery genre, and superheroes, in his book on writing &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;: &quot;[It] is not fantasy at its lowest, but it still has a pretty tacky feel. ... Sword and sorcery novels and stories are tales of power for the powerless. The fellow who is afraid of being rousted by those young punks who hang around his bus stop can go home at night and imagine himself wielding a sword, his potbelly miraculously gone, his slack muscles magically transmuted into those &quot;iron thews&quot; which have been sung and storied in the pulps for the last fifty years.&quot; On Howard in particular, he wrote:

An exception to this, in King&#x27;s opinion (again from &quot;Danse Macabre&quot;), was the author&#x27;s Southern Gothic horror story &quot;Pigeons From Hell&quot;. King referred to this work as &quot;one of the finest horror stories of our century.&quot;

In the foreword to &quot;Two-Gun Bob&quot;, a collection of essays on the subject of Howard, fellow fantasy fiction writer, Michael Moorcock, wrote: &quot;The ability to paint a complex scene with a few expert brushstrokes remains Howard&#x27;s greatest talent, and such talent can&#x27;t, of course, ever be taught.&quot; Howard scholar Rob Roehm considers the use of the phrase &quot;can&#x27;t ever be taught&quot; to be a variation on the recurrent theme of Howard&#x27;s lack of skill or training. Moorcock&#x27;s foreword goes on &quot;[Howard&#x27;s] greatest hero, Conan the Barbarian, is his best, created from whole cloth, with a nod to Natty Bumppo and Tarzan of the Apes, and most closely representing the kind of person Howard, home-bound, mother-worshipping, suspicious of big cities, would in his dreams most like to be.&quot; Roehm counters that none of the assertions made about Howard in that comment are true, although none of them are unique to Moorcock either. In &quot;Wizardry &amp; Wild Romance&quot;, Moorcock has also written both that Howard &quot;brought a brash, tough element to the epic fantasy that did as much to change the course of the American school away from previous writing and static imagery as Hammett, Chandler and the &quot;Black Mask&quot; pulp writers were to change the course of the American detective fiction&quot; and that he &quot;was never a commercially successful writer in his lifetime. His brash, hasty, careless style did not lend itself to the classier pulps. Most of his work appeared in the cheapest of them.&quot;

===Earnings===
The following table shows Howard&#x27;s earnings from writing throughout his career, with appropriate milestones and events noted by each year. During the Depression, Howard earned more than anyone else in Cross Plains. When Howard died, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; still owed him between $800 and $1,300. (Adjusted for inflation, this amount would be equivalent to between $ and $.)

===Letters===
Three publishing houses have put out collections of Howard&#x27;s letters. In 1989 and 1991, Necronomicon Press published &quot;Robert E. Howard: Selected Letters&quot; in two volumes (1923–1930 and 1931–1936) edited by Glenn Lord with Rusty Burke, S. T. Joshi, and Steve Behrends. In 2007 and 2008, The Robert E. Howard Foundation Press published a three volume set (1923–1929, 1930–1932, and 1933–1936) titled &quot;The Collected Letters of Robert E. Howard&quot;, edited by Rob Roehm. Additionally, in 2009, Hippocampus Press published two volumes (1930–1932 and 1933–1936) of Howard&#x27;s correspondence with H. P. Lovecraft as &quot;A Means to Freedom: The Letters of H.P. Lovecraft &amp; Robert E. Howard&quot;, edited by S. T. Joshi, David Schultz, and Rusty Burke.

== Legacy ==


Robert E. Howard&#x27;s legacy extended after his death in 1936. Howard&#x27;s most famous character, Conan the Barbarian, has a pop-culture imprint that has been compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Count Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond. Howard&#x27;s critical reputation suffered at first but, over the decades, works of Howard scholarship have been published. The first professionally published example of this was L. Sprague de Camp&#x27;s &quot;Dark Valley Destiny&quot; (1983), which was followed by other works including Don Herron&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Barbarian&quot; (1984) and Mark Finn&#x27;s &quot;Blood &amp; Thunder&quot; (2006). Also in 2006, a charity, Robert E. Howard Foundation, was created to promote further scholarship.

Following Robert E. Howard&#x27;s death, the courts granted his estate to his father, who continued to work with Howard&#x27;s literary agent Otis Adelbert Kline. Dr. Isaac Howard passed the rights on to his friend Dr. Pere Kuykendall, who passed them to his wife, Alla Ray Kuykendall, and daughter, Alla Ray Morris. Morris left the rights to the widow of her cousin, Zora Mae Bryant, who gave control to her children, Jack Baum and Terry Baum Rogers. The Baums eventually sold their rights to the Swedish (now US) company Paradox Entertainment.

Howard&#x27;s first published book, &quot;A Gent from Bear Creek&quot;, was printed in Britain one year after his death. This was followed in the United States by a collection of Howard&#x27;s stories, &quot;Skull-Face and Others&quot; (1946) and then the novel &quot;Conan the Conqueror&quot; (1950). The success of &quot;Conan the Conqueror&quot; led to a series of Conan books from publisher Gnome Press, the later editor of which was L. Sprague de Camp. The series led to the first Conan pastiche, the novel &quot;The Return of Conan&quot; by de Camp and Swedish Howard fan Björn Nyberg. De Camp eventually achieved control over the Conan stories and Conan brand in general. Oscar Friend took over from Kline as literary agent and he was followed by his daughter Kittie West. When she closed the agency in 1965, a new agent was required. De Camp was offered the role but he recommended Glenn Lord instead. Lord began as a fan of Howard and had re-discovered many unpublished pieces that would otherwise have been lost, printing them in books such as &quot;Always Comes Evening&quot; (1957) and his own magazine &quot;The Howard Collector&quot; (1961–1973). He became responsible for the non-Conan works and later restored, textually-pure versions of the Conan stories themselves.

In 1966, de Camp made a deal with Lancer Books to republish the Conan series, which led to the &quot;First Howard Boom&quot; of the 1970s; their popularity was enhanced by the cover artwork of Frank Frazetta on most of the volumes. Many of his works were reprinted (some printed for the first time) and they expanded into other media such as comic books and films. The Conan stories were increasingly edited by de Camp and the series was extended by pastiches until they replaced the original stories. In response, a puristic movement grew up demanding Howard&#x27;s original, un-edited stories. The first boom ended in the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s and early 21st century, the &quot;Second Howard Boom&quot; occurred. This saw the printing of new collections of Howard&#x27;s work, with the restored texts desired by purists. As before, the boom led to new comic books, films and computer games. Howard&#x27;s house in Cross Plains has been converted into the Robert E. Howard Museum, which has been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

==Adaptations==
The works of Robert E. Howard have been adapted into multiple media, such as the two Conan films released in the 1980s starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and another in 2011 starring Jason Momoa. In addition to the Conan films, other adaptations have included &quot;Kull the Conqueror&quot; (1997) and &quot;Solomon Kane&quot; (2009). In television, the anthology series &quot;Thriller&quot; (1961) led the adaptations with an episode based on the short story &quot;Pigeons from Hell&quot;. The bulk of the adaptations have, however, been based on Conan with two animated and one live action series. Multiple audio dramas have been adapted, from professional audio books and plays to LibriVox recordings of works in the public domain. Computer games have focussed on Conan, beginning with &quot;&quot; (1984) and continuing on to the MMO &quot;Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures&quot; (2008). The first table-top roleplaying game based on Howard&#x27;s works was TSR&#x27;s &quot;Conan Unchained!&quot; (1984) for their game &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The first comic book adaptation was in the Mexican &quot;Cuentos de Abuelito – La Reina de la Costa Negra&quot; No. 17 (1952). Howard-related comic books continued to be published to the present day.

Howard is an ongoing inspiration for and influence on heavy metal music. Several bands have adapted Howard&#x27;s works to tracks or entire albums. The British metal band Bal-Sagoth is named after Howard&#x27;s story &quot;The Gods of Bal-Sagoth&quot;.

<text>The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) (, &quot;Jamiʿat-e Enqelābi-ye Zanān-e Afghānestān&quot;, ) is a women&#x27;s organization originally based in Kabul, Afghanistan, that promotes women&#x27;s rights and secular democracy. It was founded in 1977 by Meena Keshwar Kamal, an Afghan student activist who was assassinated in February 1987 for her political activities. The group, which supports non-violent strategies, had its initial office in Kabul, Afghanistan, but then moved to Pakistan in the early 1980s.

The organization aims to involve women of Afghanistan in both political and social activities aimed at acquiring human rights for women and continuing the struggle against the government of Afghanistan based on democratic and secular, not fundamentalist principles, in which women can participate fully. RAWA also strives for multilateral disarmament. Since 1977, the group opposed all the Afghan government systems: the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, the Islamic State of Afghanistan, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (1996-2001), the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (2001-2021), and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (from 2021).

==Background==

The RAWA was first initiated in Kabul in 1977 as an independent social and political organization of Afghan women fighting for human rights and social justice. The organization then moved parts of its work out of Afghanistan into Pakistan and established their main base there to work for Afghan women.

==Founder==
RAWA was founded by a group of Afghan women led by Meena Keshwar Kamal. At age 21, she laid the foundations of RAWA through her work educating women. In 1979, Kamal began a campaign against the Soviet occupation and the Soviet-supported government of Afghanistan. In 1981, she launched a bilingual magazine &quot;Payam-e-Zan&quot; (&quot;Women&#x27;s Message&quot;). In the same year, she visited France for the French Socialist Party Congress. She also established schools for Afghan refugee children, hospitals and handicraft centers for refugee women in Pakistan. Her activities and views, as well as her work against the government and religious fundamentalists led to her assassination on February 4, 1987.

==Early activities==
Much of RAWA&#x27;s efforts in the 1990s involved holding seminars and press conferences and other fund-raising activities in Pakistan. RAWA also created secret schools, orphanages, nursing courses, and handicraft centers for women and girls in Pakistan and Afghanistan. They secretly filmed women being beaten in the street in Afghanistan by the Mutaween religious police, and being executed. RAWA activities were forbidden by both the Taliban and the United Islamic Front (&quot;Northern Alliance&quot;), but they persisted, and even publicised their work in publications like &quot;Payam-e-Zan&quot;.

==RAWA after the 2001 invasion==
RAWA is highly critical of the NATO intervention that began in 2001, because of the high rate of casualties among the civilian population. The organization went so far as to threaten to sue United States government for unauthorized use of four photos from their website that were used in propaganda handbills dropped on various cities in Afghanistan during the 2001 invasion.

After the defeat of the Taliban government, RAWA warned that the NATO-allied Afghan forces were just as fundamentalist and dangerous as the Taliban. They charge that the government led by President Hamid Karzai lacked support in most areas of Afghanistan, and that fundamentalists are enforcing laws unfairly treating women as they were under the Taliban. These claims are supported by media reports about the Herat government of Ismail Khan, who has created a Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice that forces women to obey strict dress and behavior codes, as well as many reports by Human Rights Watch. One report released by Human Rights Watch in 2012 describes a situation where women are punished by the judicial system for attempting to escape from domestic abuse and also occasionally for being victims of rape. It says that Karzai is &quot;[u]nwilling or unable to take a consistent line against conservative forces within the country,&quot; and that the lack of improvement in the plight of women in Afghanistan after ten years is &quot;shocking.&quot;

==Recent activities==
RAWA collects funds to support hospitals, schools and orphanages and still run many projects in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including a project in conjunction with CharityHelp.org for orphan sponsorships. In 2020 RAWA restarted its mission inside Afghanistan and organized some of its events in Kabul. They have held events annually on International Women&#x27;s Day since 2006.

On October 7, 2006, the Afghan Women&#x27;s Mission (AWM) organized a fund-raising event for RAWA in Los Angeles, California. Eve Ensler was the chief guest and radio host Sonali Kolhatkar and Zoya, a member of RAWA, were among the speakers. &quot;Zoya&quot; is a pseudonym for an active member of RAWA&#x27;s Foreign Committee who has traveled to many countries, including the United States, Spain and Germany. In 2003, she received international acclaim for her biography &quot;Zoya’s Story - An Afghan Woman&#x27;s Battle for Freedom&quot;. In June 2008, Zoya testified to the Human Rights Commission of the German Parliament (Bundestag) to persuade the German government to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan.

In 2009, RAWA and other women&#x27;s rights groups strongly condemned a &quot;Shia Family Code&quot; which is claimed to legalise spousal rape within Northern Afghan Shia Muslim communities, as well as endorsing child marriage, purdah (seclusion) for married women, which was passed by President Hamid Karzai to garner support for his coalition government from hardline elements within the aforesaid communities, as well as the neighbouring Shia-dominated Islamic Republic of Iran. In addition to the above, the new &quot;Family Code&quot; also enshrines discriminatory legal status in the context of inheritance and divorce against women.

In February 2012, the group commemorated the 25th anniversary of the death of RAWA founder Meena Keshwar Kamal with a gathering of women in Kabul. In August 2012, a RAWA representative was a keynote speaker at the annual convention of Veterans For Peace at the University of Maryland in College Park.

Following the American and coalition exit from Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban swiftly regained control of the country. The new regime reinstituted an old policy of denying women and girls access to schooling. RAWA has operated secret schools for women to subvert this policy.

==Recognition==
RAWA has so far won 16 awards and certificates from around the world for its work for human rights and democracy. They include the sixth Asian Human Rights Award - 2001, the French Republic&#x27;s Liberty, Equality, Fraternity Human Rights Prize, 2000, Emma Humphreys Memorial Prize 2001,
Glamour Women of the Year 2001, 2001 SAIS-Novartis International Journalism Award from Johns Hopkins University, Certificate of Special Congressional Recognition from the U.S. Congress, 2004, Honorary Doctorate from University of Antwerp (Belgium) for outstanding non-academic achievements, and many other awards.

==Perspectives on RAWA==
In the book &quot;With All Our Strength: The Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan&quot;
by Anne Brodsky, a number of world-known writers and human rights activists share their views of RAWA. They include Arundhati Roy who says &quot;Each of us needs a little RAWA&quot;; Eve Ensler, author of &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, who suggests that RAWA must stand as a model for every group working to end violence; Katha Pollitt, author of &quot;Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture&quot;; Ahmed Rashid, author of &quot;Taliban&quot; and &quot;Jihad&quot;; and Asma Jahangir, Special Rapporteur of the United Nations and prominent Pakistani women&#x27;s rights activist are two Pakistanis who write about RAWA and express their support.

<text>Railtrack was a group of companies that owned the track, signalling, tunnels, bridges, level crossings and all but a handful of the stations of the British railway system from 1994 until 2002. It was created as part of the privatisation of British Rail, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. In 2002, after experiencing major financial difficulty, most of Railtrack&#x27;s operations were transferred to the state-controlled non-profit company Network Rail. The remainder of Railtrack was renamed RT Group plc and eventually dissolved on 22 June 2010.

==History==

===Background and founding===
During the early 1990s, the Conservative Party decided to pursue the privatisation of Britain&#x27;s nationalised railway operator British Rail. A white paper released in July 1992 had called for a publicly-owned company to be primarily responsible for the railway infrastructure, including the tracks, signalling, and stations, while train operations would be franchised out to various private companies. However, Robert Horton, who would become the first chairman of Railtrack and thus play a leading role through the early years of the organisation&#x27;s existence, lobbied for the infrastructure-holding company to be privatised as well in order to maximise financial gains; this position was also supported by several figures within the Conservative government, such as the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and the Secretary of State for Transport Brian Mawhinney.

On 1 April 1994, in accordance with recently passed legislation, the newly-established Railtrack took control of Britain&#x27;s railway infrastructure from British Rail. Its primary revenue sources were the track access charges levied on train operators and the lease of stations and depots. Furthermore, the company routinely received funding from the British government; the resulting money was largely spent on the railway network in accordance with plans laid out by the rail regulator. Between its creation and late 1998, the company reportedly had a relatively calm relationship with its first economic regulator, John Swift QC, who exercised a strategy of encouraging Railtrack to make its own commitments towards improvement. According to the railway historian Christian Wolmar, the regulator had intentionally acted weak as to avoid complicating the creation and privatisation of Railtrack.
In January 1996, the British government confirmed its plans to privatise Railtrack for £2 billion with a total asset value of £4 billion. During May 1996, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange, albeit at a lower than planned price, allegedly in response to a threatened intervention by the Labour Party. This action effectively privatised Railtrack, although the company remained closely intertwined with the British government from an operational standpoint.

Railtrack&#x27;s initial operations were disrupted by an industrial dispute that largely ran between June and September 1994; at one point, the company&#x27;s management proposed dismissing all of its signallers, comprising roughly 4,600 staff. Railtrack&#x27;s first chief executive, John Edmonds, pursued a strategy of disposing of engineers and outsourcing their work wherever possible with the goal of reducing costs. Within its first few years of operation, Railtrack appeared to perform well financially, annual profits were recorded while its share value quadrupled within a relatively short timeframe. Furthermore, during the mid-to-late 1990s, several high-profile investment projects in cooperation with train operators and other partners were announced by the company. However, as early as 1997, Railtrack was being criticised for paying little attention to infrastructure investment.

===Issues and controversies===
The Southall rail crash in 1997 and the Ladbroke Grove rail crash in 1999 called into question the negative consequences that the fragmentation of the railway network had introduced to both safety and maintenance procedures. Railtrack was severely criticised for both its performance in improving Britain&#x27;s railway infrastructure and for its safety record. It was observed in Lord Cullen&#x27;s inquiry into the Ladbroke Grove accident that trains would have been prevented from passing any signal at red had an Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system had been fitted and operational; however, ATP&#x27;s national adoption, a recommendation made after the Clapham Junction rail crash in 1988, had been abandoned as the cost was considered to be excessive for the increase in safety.
One particular area of criticism was that the regulator was not tough enough on Railtrack and, as a result, the company had been able to abuse its monopoly position. In particular, Railtrack&#x27;s customers, the passenger and freight train operators, were allegedly desperate for regulatory action to compel the company to improve its stewardship of the network and its performance. During 1993, Swift had been appointed rail regulator by the then Conservative transport secretary John MacGregor MP. When the Labour government took over after the general election in May 1997, the new transport secretary (and deputy prime minister) John Prescott took a much harder line. When Swift&#x27;s five-year term of office expired on 30 November 1998, he was not reappointed.

After an interim period, during which Chris Bolt, Swift&#x27;s chief economic adviser and effective deputy, filled the regulator&#x27;s position, in July 1999 a new rail regulator began a five-year term, starting a much tougher regulatory era. Tom Winsor, the new rail regulator, had been Swift&#x27;s general counsel (1993–95), and adopted a more interventionist and aggressive regulatory approach. The relationship between the two parties was reportedly stormy at times; in April 2000, it was reported in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that &quot;Railtrack is adopting a deliberate &#x27;culture of defiance&#x27; against the rail regulator&quot;. Gerald Corbett, Railtrack&#x27;s chief executive at the time, and Winsor did not share the same vision for the network. Railtrack resisted regulatory action to improve its performance, and as the regulator probed ever more deeply, serious shortcomings in the company&#x27;s stewardship of the network were revealed. Winsor informed Railtrack that if it did not improve passenger train performance by 12.7 per cent by March 2000, the company would have to pay fines out of its profits.

On 17 October 2000, the Hatfield rail crash occurred; this would prove to be the defining moment in Railtrack&#x27;s subsequent collapse. The cause of the fatal accident was quickly determined to be an infrastructure-related failure, and thus within Railtrack&#x27;s remit. In Hatfield&#x27;s aftermath, major repairs were undertaken across the whole British rail network which were estimated to have cost in the order of £580 million. Railtrack had no idea how many potential Hatfields were waiting to happen, nor did they have any way of assessing the consequence of the speed restrictions they were ordering, largely because the majority of the engineering skill of British Rail had been sold off into separate maintenance and renewal companies. These restrictions brought the railway network to an almost total standstill and drew significant public ire. According to Wolmar, the Railtrack board had panicked in the wake of Hatfield.

Around this time, regulatory and customer pressure on Railtrack audibly increased while the company&#x27;s share price fell sharply as it became apparent that there were serious shortcomings in the company&#x27;s ability to tackle and solve fundamental problems with its core activities. During February 1999, a significant fall in Railtrack&#x27;s share price occurred in response to the company&#x27;s launch of a bond issue intended to finance the West Coast Main Line modernisation and Thameslink Programmes. The modernisation of the West Coast Main Line had suffered from spiralling costs, rising from an estimated £2 billion to roughly £10 billion. The modernisation programme had failures that were technical as well as managerial, such as the moving block signalling apparatus being immature for such a busy mixed-traffic mainline. In 2000, reports emerged that Railtrack might not be able to go through with its planned commitment to purchase section 2 of High Speed 1, resulting in disruption and uncertainty for that programme as well.

In February 2001, Steve Marshall, the company&#x27;s chairman, stated that Railtrack could have a net debt of approximately £8 billion by 2003. During May 2001, Railtrack announced that, despite making a pre-tax profits before exceptional expenses of £199m, the £733m of costs and compensation paid out over the Hatfield crash plunged Railtrack from profit to a loss of £534m. This loss compelled the organisation to approach the government for funding, which it controversially used to pay a £137m dividend to its shareholders in May 2001. Months later, Railtrack sought another bailout from the government.

===Administration===
On 7 October 2001, Railtrack plc was placed into railway administration under the Railways Act 1993, following an application to the High Court by the then Transport Secretary, Stephen Byers. This was effectively a form of bankruptcy protection that allowed the railway network to continue operating despite the financial problems of the operator. The parent company, Railtrack Group plc, was not put into administration and continued operating its other subsidiaries, which included property and telecommunications interests. If this action had not been taken, rail services throughout Britain might have entirely stopped for a time.

For most of the year in administration, the government&#x27;s position had been that the new company would have to live within the existing regulatory settlement (£14.8 billion for the five years 2001–2006). However, it soon became obvious that that was impossible, and that the aftermath of the Hatfield crash had revealed that the network required significantly more money for its operation, maintenance and renewal. It was reported on 23 November 2001, that a further £3.5 billion might be needed to keep the national railway network running, a sum disputed by Ernst &amp; Young, the administrators. During February 2002, the European Commission approved the provision of state aid to the ailing Railtrack in order to maintain operations. 

To get Railtrack out of administration, the government had to go back to the High Court and present evidence that the company was no longer insolvent. The principal reason given by the government to the court for this assertion was the decision of the rail regulator – announced on 22 September 2002 – to carry out an interim review of the company&#x27;s finances, with the potential to advance significant additional sums to the company. The High Court accepted that the company was not therefore insolvent, and the railway administration order was discharged on 2 October 2002.

===Transfer of assets to Network Rail===
Network Rail was formed with the principal purpose of acquiring and owning Railtrack plc. Originally the Government allowed private companies to bid for Railtrack plc. However, with limited availability of financial data on Railtrack, the political implications of owning the company and the very obvious preference of the government that the national railway network should go to Network Rail, no bidders apart from Network Rail were forthcoming, and Network Rail bought Railtrack plc on 3 October 2002. Railtrack plc was subsequently renamed to &quot;Network Rail Infrastructure Limited&quot;.

Network Rail&#x27;s acquisition of Railtrack plc was welcomed at the time by groups that represented British train passengers. The attitude of Railtrack&#x27;s customers – the passenger- and freight-train operators – was much more cautious, especially as they were wary of a corporate structure under which shareholders&#x27; equity was not at risk if the company&#x27;s new management mis-managed its affairs.

===Liquidation===
On 18 October 2002, Railtrack&#x27;s parent company, Railtrack Group, was placed into members&#x27; voluntary liquidation as RT Group. The Railtrack business (and its £7 billion debt) had been sold to Network Rail for £500 million, and the various diversified businesses it had created to seek to protect itself from the loss-making business of running a railway were disposed of to various buyers. £370 million held by Railtrack Group was frozen at the time the company went into administration and was earmarked to pay Railtrack shareholders an estimated 70p a share in compensation. The Group&#x27;s interest in the partially built High Speed 1 line was also sold for £295m. During December 2002, Railtrack Group was delisted from the London Stock Exchange; that same month, the company announced an agreement to sell its remaining property interests, RT Group Developments, to the property developer Hammerson in exchange for £63 million.

==Compensation==

===Litigation===
In late 2001, Railtrack shareholders formed two groups to press for increased compensation. A lawyer speaking for one of those groups remarked on GMTV that his strategy was to sue the government for incorrect and misleading information given at the time Railtrack was created, when John Major was Conservative Prime Minister. An increased offer of up to 262p per share was enough to convince the larger shareholder group, the Railtrack Action Group, to abandon legal action. The Chairman, Usman Mahmud, believed that legal action would not be successful without the support of management and major shareholders.

The legality of the decision to put Railtrack into railway administration was challenged by the smaller Railtrack Private Shareholders Action Group. Their action against the government alleged that the Secretary of State for Transport at the time – Stephen Byers MP – had, by deciding to cut off funding for Railtrack and asking the High Court to put the company into railway administration, committed the common law tort of misfeasance in public office. It is believed that there was £532 million available to Railtrack comprising £370 million in the bank, along with £162 million of an existing Department of Transport loan facility still available to be drawn down, but Stephen Byers MP cancelled this facility, causing shareholders to believe that he had broken the loan agreement.

This was the largest class action ever conducted in the English courts – there were 49,500 claimants, all small shareholders in Railtrack. Keith Rowley, QC, the barrister for the shareholders, alleged Byers had &quot;devised a scheme by which he intended to injure the shareholders of Railtrack Group by impairing the value of their interests in that company without paying compensation and without the approval of Parliament&quot;.

The case was heard in the High Court in London in July 2005; some embarrassment was caused to Byers when he admitted that an answer he had given to a House of Commons Select Committee was inaccurate, but on 14 October 2005 the judge found that there was no evidence that Byers had committed the tort of misfeasance in public office. The private shareholders decided not to appeal against the judgment because there were no legal grounds for doing so. For many of them – who had contributed around £50 each, on average, to the fighting fund to bring the action – the case had served its purpose.

The circumstances in which Railtrack had been put into administration were highly controversial, with allegations in Parliament on 24 October 2005 that the company had not been insolvent at the time (7 October 2001) and therefore that the administration order had been wrongly obtained. This was because of the jurisdiction of the independent rail regulator – at the time Tom Winsor – to provide additional money to maintain the company&#x27;s financial position. Sir Alan Duncan MP, then the shadow transport secretary, said in Parliament that this aspect of the affair – which was not dealt with in the shareholders&#x27; case in the High Court – was &quot;perhaps the most shameful scar on the Government&#x27;s honesty&quot; and &quot;an absolute scandal&quot;.

Byers apologised in the House of Commons on 17 October 2005 for having given a &quot;factually inaccurate&quot; reply to the Select Committee but said that he had not intended to mislead them. This personal statement to Parliament was not accepted by the MP who had asked the original question, and the matter was remitted to the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee for investigation. As a result of that committee&#x27;s report, Mr Byers made another statement of apology to Parliament.

===Payments to shareholders===
RT Group plc (in voluntary liquidation) made a number of payments to shareholders during the winding up of the company&#x27;s affairs before finally being dissolved on 22 June 2010.

==Management==
Robert Horton was the first chairman of Railtrack; he resigned from this role in early 1999 amid reports of disagreements between Horton and the company&#x27;s then-chief executive Gerald Corbett. Steve Marshall became the company&#x27;s next chairman; following the company&#x27;s entering into receivership, he announced his own resignation in October 2001 and actually stood down in March 2002. That same month, Geoffrey Howe was appointed chairman of Railtrack Group (the part of the business not in administration) and quickly pursued a strategy of seeking compensation from the British government.

Railtrack&#x27;s first Chief Executive, John Edmonds, was a keen proponent of outsourcing the company&#x27;s engineering activities and driving down costs. During late 1997, Gerald Corbett succeeded Edmonds as chief executive. During his tenure, numerous accidents occurred; Corbett issued multiple apologies and issued recommendations for reforms of the rail industry. In November 2000, Corbett submitted his resignation, having been publicly called on to do so by multiple politicians and public figures. Corbett was Railtrack&#x27;s chief executive as it went into receivership.

<text>Rock Bridge High School is a public high school located in southern Columbia, Missouri, United States. The school serves grades 9 through 12 and is one of four High Schools in Columbia Public Schools. It is located next to the Columbia Area Career Center. The mascot is the Bruin Bear.

==History==
Due to the crowding of David H. Hickman High School towards the end of the 1960s and the increasing population of Columbia in the 1970s, the Columbia Board of Education decided to form a new high school. The board bought of land in the southern portion of the city and started the construction of the new high school. The name &quot;Rock Bridge&quot; was chosen because of the school&#x27;s proximity to the natural rock bridge at Rock Bridge Memorial State Park.

Construction started in 1969 on the original portion of the building, which consisted of 18 classrooms and one office area in the present-day east wing of the building. The school was planned to open in 1971, but funding issues pushed back construction of the second phase of the building. As such, this original portion sat unused for a year or two while the second portion was not yet complete. Construction started on the second portion in early 1972, which added the &quot;Main Commons&quot;, another office area, the library, the gymnasium, and a few specialty classrooms underneath that area. In September 1973, with the completion of the second portion, Rock Bridge was considered &quot;complete enough&quot; to open and had a class of 583 students, mostly sophomores and juniors. This high school was the second centrally air-conditioned school built in Columbia after Oakland Junior High School north of town. However, the air-conditioning system was prone to failure and the school was difficult to keep cool in warm weather due to the fact that the windows were not designed to be opened. Later additions to the building included some windows that were able to be opened.

The school had a Sonitrol security system which enabled remote 24x7 security monitoring.

In 1974, the planetarium was completed with a capacity of nearly 90 people, which features a state-of-the-art star ball. A full-dome projection system was later added with the advent of newer technology.

In 1979, the west wing opened, which adopts the same basic design of the original 1971 building but with a finished basement. This added about ten general-purpose classrooms, as well as science, art, and band rooms; in turn, this would provide the school a then-total of about 40 classrooms. A north wing similar in design to the east and west wings was also proposed as part of the original master plan but was never built. However, three new science classrooms and a performing arts center were added in 1992. Enrollment reached 1000 in the 1995–96 school year.

In 1980, a Career Center was opened north of the school that taught Computer Programming in COBOL and RPG-II on an IBM System/34 computer. Courses in Data Entry were also available.

In the early 1990s, three science classrooms north of the west wing and the Performing Arts Center near the commons area were added.

In 2000, a large addition opened between and north of the east and west wings and portions of the existing building, especially the west wing, were renovated, effectively doubling the size of the building. This project added twenty-five general-purpose classrooms, seven science classrooms, expanded performing arts facilities, a new media center, three new computer labs (since converted to classrooms), and several new office spaces. In January 2013, a second gymnasium was added after the district added ninth-graders to the high schools. The area under the auxiliary gym added other athletic facilities, making room for four new classrooms elsewhere in the building.

==Academics==
The school offers 18 Advanced Placement courses and a multitude of honors classes available to students. RBHS has weighted and unweighted grade point averages. Ranked #2,856 in the nation by US News, Rock Bridge has a very decent academic standings. According to Niche, 30% of students at Rock Bridge are enrolled in at least 1 AP Class, and roughly 73.5% of students planning on college at Rock Bridge plan to stay in the county. Niche also states that 93% of students graduate Rock Bridge.

==Mascot==
Rock Bridge High&#x27;s mascot is the bruin bear. The school&#x27;s original band director, Phil Wood, wanted the mascot of the school to be a troll. He ordered custom marching band uniforms that were green with a large white bib with a troll on the front of them. His decision was overridden and the mascot was officially made the bruin bear. Unable to return the uniforms, the band used them for a number of years. The band members unofficially referred to themselves as the Marching Munchkins.

==Athletics==
The school offers a variety of sports. Fall sports include cross country, football, golf, soccer, softball, swimming and diving, tennis and volleyball. Rock Bridge has won Football State Championships with undefeated teams in 1975 and 1977. Winter sports include basketball and wrestling. Spring sports include baseball and track and field. Year-round sports include cheerleading and poms. They have won 47 state championships in baseball (1), boys (1) and girls (5) basketball, boys cross country (2), football (2), boys (5) and girls (2) golf, softball (1), boys (2) and girls (4) swimming and diving, boys (8) and girls (13) tennis, and boys track and field (1). They are most prolific in tennis, winning 8 boys championships and 13 girls championships. During the 2020/21 school year, they were state champions in boys cross country, softball, and boys track and field.

==Journalism==
From the time the school opened journalism has been part of the course offerings for the school. There was a newspaper, &quot;The Rock&quot;, as well as a yearbook, &quot;Flashback&quot;. In 1995, the school created a prerequisite class called Journalistic Writing, and the paper became a monthly publication. The journalism department created a special edition magazine, &quot;Southpaw&quot;, in 2005, and in 2011, an online news source, &quot;Bearing News&quot;. &quot;The Rock&quot; began on letter-sized sheets that were published through a class. In 1994, it began its run as a monthly publication.

<text>Ringwood Brewery is a brand of beer owned by Carlsberg Marston&#x27;s Brewing Company, and was formerly a small brewery on the edge of the New Forest in Hampshire, England, near the Dorset border. It produced mainly cask ales and some bottled beers.

The emblem for the brewery is a boar.

== History ==

There are records from the early 19th century of four breweries, one owned by a banker named Stephen Tunks, that stood on the site of the present day Ringwood Brewery. Of the four, none survive today. The last to close was Carters on West Street, in 1923.

In 1975 the former head brewery of Hull Brewery, Peter Austin retired to Hampshire to enjoy more time sailing after a career at Hull dating back to 1945, preceded by a pupillage at Friary, Holroyd and Healy in Guildford, and a brief spell at Morrell&#x27;s Brewing Company in Oxford. However the retirement was not to last and Austin was keen to pursue new ventures. An invitation two years later by Terry Jones of Monty Python fame and journalist; Richard Boston to create a micro brewery in an ex-cattle byre at Penrhos Court, Penrhos, Herefordshire reignited Austin&#x27;s interest in brewing.

In 1978, Peter Austin and Partners Limited established Ringwood Brewery and started brewing in an old bakery at Minty&#x27;s Yard, New Street, Ringwood in April of that year. Austin was an influence on Britain&#x27;s craft brewery rebirth in much the same way that Fritz Maytag of San Francisco&#x27;s Anchor Brewing Company and Pierre Celis of Belgium&#x27;s Hoegaarden Brewery were to their countries. However, Austin had a much more direct role in brewery development through his consulting business and equipment sales. Several American craft brewers use his Original Peter Austin Brick Kettle Brewing System including Geary&#x27;s Brewing, Shipyard and Middle Ages Brewing Company. The equipment sales part of the business was separated from the main Ringwood Brewery company in 1982.

In 1980, Austin became the first chairman of the Small Independent Brewers&#x27; Association.

Austin later brought in two business partners: David and Nigel Welsh. The business continued to expand with the purchase of a number of pubs and in 1986, having outgrown their existing brewery, the company moved to the site on Christchurch Road, historically previously part of Stephen Tunk&#x27;s Brewery.

In 1988, the brewery was awarded &#x27;Champion Beer of Britain&#x27; by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), for &#x27;Old Thumper&#x27;. Peter Austin sold his shares in Ringwood to David Welsh in 1990, becoming a brewing consultant.

In 1989, an enquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the brewing industry resulted in the Beer Orders requiring large brewers to restruct their number of tied pubs to 2,000 and to those tied pubs to stock at least one guest beer. This allowed tenants to buy an ale from a different brewer other than their landlord. This transformed Ringwood&#x27;s output and between 1990 and 1994 production rose from 5,000 barrels per annum to 13,000 barrels per annum. The brewhouse was extended to accommodate this from 1994, with a further extension taking place in 1999 to allow more than one brew per day.

By the mid-1990s Ringwood had allowed Old Thumper to be brewed under license in the United States. Licensing was pursued in an effort to export their products to America, and was felt a more secure approach after two failed attempts in the mid and late 1980s. Alan Puglsey, a former Ringwood Brewery employee was the brewer for this through his brewery, Shipyard Brewery in Portland, Maine.

Ringwood branched out from brewing in 1997 with the purchase of the Château de Fayolle and its vineyard near Saussignac in the Dordogne region of France. The vineyard produced several varieties of wine including Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Further diversification took place with the purchase of several local public houses, number 7 in total by 2007.

In 2007, Ringwood was purchased from David Welsh by Marston&#x27;s plc for £19.2 million. Marston&#x27;s stated that they would keep the brewery in operation and continue producing the full range of Ringwood beers.

Marston&#x27;s sold Château de Fayolle and the vineyard in 2011.

In 2013, Ringwood underwent a full re-brand, and the ABV of Old Thumper was reduced from 5.6% to 5.1%.

In 2015, Ringwood Best Bitter was rebranded as Ringwood Razorback.

In May 2020, it was announced that subject to competition law and shareholder approval, Marston&#x27;s would merge its brewing business, including Ringwood Brewery, with Carlsberg UK (the United Kingdom arm of Carlsberg Group), into a joint venture to be known as Carlsberg Marston&#x27;s Brewing Company (CMBC), valued at £780m. Marston&#x27;s took a 40% stake in the joint venture and received c.£273m in cash.

In June 2023 the brewery and its brands were put up for sale by CMBC, who announced the closure of their logistics base in Ringwood as part of the same announcement.

On 4 December 2023, CMBC announced they had failed to find a buyer for the brewery and Ringwood Brewery would close in January 2024. Production of the Ringwood Brewery beers was to be moved to other facilities owned by CMBC. Cask brewing of Razorback, Fortyniner and Boondoggle would be moved to The Park Brewery in Wolverhampton (Banks&#x27;s), whilst cask brewing of Old Thumper cask brewing would go to The Marston&#x27;s Brewery in Burton upon Trent. Razorback, Boondoggle and Fortyniner bottles were already brewed in Burton. The Ringwood CMBC logistic base had already been moved to CMBC&#x27;s sites in Tiverton and Farnborough.

Controversy arose soon after however when The Salisbury Journal reported on 6 December 2023 that a potential purchaser condemned CMBC&#x27;s decision to close the site. CMBC stated they had been &quot;unable to secure a credible offer which met our bidding threshold&quot;; however, the threshold was not disclosed. A follow up article in the Morning Advertiser quoted local businessman, Anthony Swift, as saying that CMBC had not engaged or even responded to an indicative offer he had put forward together with a consortium during the sale process.

The brewery shop closed on Christmas Eve 2023.

Marston&#x27;s sold their stake in CMBC for £206 million in July 2024, in order to reduce debts and to allow it to concentrate on running its pub estate across the country. The sale gave Carlsberg full control of CMBC and ended Marston&#x27;s 150 year heritage in brewing. A review of brewing activities was undertaken as a result of the sale and in November 2024 CMBC announced it was to delist Boondoggle and Old Thumper as cask ales by the end of the year, although confirming that Boondoggle would remain available as a bottled beer.

<text>The red wolf (Canis rufus) is a canine native to the southeastern United States. Its size is intermediate between the coyote (&quot;Canis latrans&quot;) and gray wolf (&quot;Canis lupus&quot;).

The red wolf&#x27;s taxonomic classification as being a separate species has been contentious for nearly a century, being classified either as a subspecies of the gray wolf &quot;Canis lupus rufus&quot;, or a coywolf (a genetic admixture of wolf and coyote). Because of this, it is sometimes excluded from endangered species lists, despite its critically low numbers. Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service recognizes the red wolf as an endangered species and grants it protected status. Since 1996, the IUCN has listed the red wolf as a Critically Endangered species; however, it is not listed in the CITES Appendices of endangered species.

==History==
Red wolves were once distributed throughout the southeastern and south-central United States from the Atlantic Ocean to central Texas, southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Illinois in the west, and in the north from the Ohio River Valley, northern Pennsylvania, southern New York, and extreme southern Ontario in Canada south to the Gulf of Mexico. The red wolf was nearly driven to extinction by the mid-1900s due to aggressive predator-control programs, habitat destruction, and extensive hybridization with coyotes. By the late 1960s, it occurred in small numbers in the Gulf Coast of western Louisiana and eastern Texas.

Fourteen of these survivors were selected to be the founders of a captive-bred population, which was established in the Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium between 1974 and 1980. After a successful experimental relocation to Bulls Island off the coast of South Carolina in 1978, the red wolf was declared extinct in the wild in 1980 so that restoration efforts could proceed. In 1987, the captive animals were released into the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) on the Albemarle Peninsula in North Carolina, with a second unsuccessful release taking place two years later in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Of 63 red wolves released from 1987 to 1994, the population rose to as many as 100–120 individuals in 2012, but due to the lack of regulation enforcement by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the population has declined to 40 individuals in 2018, about 14 in 2019 and 8 as of October 2021. No wild litters were born between 2019 and 2020.

Under pressure from conservation groups, the US Fish and Wildlife Service resumed reintroductions in 2021 and increased protection. In 2022, the first wild litter was born since 2018. As of 2023, there are between 15 and 17 wild red wolves in ARNWR.

== Description and behavior ==

The red wolf&#x27;s appearance is typical of the genus &quot;Canis&quot;, and is generally intermediate in size between the coyote and gray wolf, though some specimens may overlap in size with small gray wolves. A study of &quot;Canis&quot; morphometrics conducted in eastern North Carolina reported that red wolves are morphometrically distinct from coyotes and hybrids. Adults measure 136–165 cm (53.5–65 in) in length, comprising a tail of about 37 cm (14.6 in). Their weight ranges from 20 to 39 kg (44–85 lbs) with males averaging 29 kg (64 lbs) and females 25 kg (55 lbs). Its pelage is typically more reddish and sparsely furred than the coyote&#x27;s and gray wolf&#x27;s, though melanistic individuals do occur. Its fur is generally tawny to grayish in color, with light markings around the lips and eyes. The red wolf has been compared by some authors to the greyhound in general form, owing to its relatively long and slender limbs. The ears are also proportionately larger than the coyote&#x27;s and gray wolf&#x27;s. The skull is typically narrow, with a long and slender rostrum, a small braincase and a well developed sagittal crest. Its cerebellum is unlike that of other &quot;Canis&quot; species, being closer in form to that of canids of the &quot;Vulpes&quot; and &quot;Urocyon&quot; genera, thus indicating that the red wolf is one of the more plesiomorphic members of its genus.

The red wolf is more sociable than the coyote, but less so than the gray wolf. It mates in January–February, with an average of 6–7 pups being born in March, April, and May. It is monogamous, with both parents participating in the rearing of young. Denning sites include hollow tree trunks, along stream banks and the abandoned earths of other animals. By the age of six weeks, the pups distance themselves from the den, and reach full size at the age of one year, becoming sexually mature two years later.

Using long-term data on red wolf individuals of known pedigree, it was found that inbreeding among first-degree relatives was rare. A likely mechanism for avoidance of inbreeding is independent dispersal trajectories from the natal pack. Many of the young wolves spend time alone or in small non-breeding packs composed of unrelated individuals. The union of two unrelated individuals in a new home range is the predominant pattern of breeding pair formation. Inbreeding is avoided because it results in progeny with reduced fitness (inbreeding depression) that is predominantly caused by the homozygous expression of recessive deleterious alleles.

Prior to its extinction in the wild, the red wolf&#x27;s diet consisted of rabbits, rodents, and nutria (an introduced species). In contrast, the red wolves from the restored population rely on white-tailed deer, pig, raccoon, rice rats, muskrats, nutria, rabbits and carrion. White-tailed deer were largely absent from the last wild refuge of red wolves on the Gulf Coast between Texas and Louisiana (where specimens were trapped from the last wild population for captive breeding), which likely accounts for the discrepancy in their dietary habits listed here. Historical accounts of wolves in the southeast by early explorers such as William Hilton, who sailed along the Cape Fear River in what is now North Carolina in 1644, also note that they ate deer.

== Range and habitat ==

The originally recognized red wolf range extended throughout the southeastern United States from the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, north to the Ohio River Valley and central Pennsylvania, and west to Central Texas and southeastern Missouri. Research into paleontological, archaeological and historical specimens of red wolves by Ronald Nowak expanded their known range to include land south of the Saint Lawrence River in Canada, along the eastern seaboard, and west to Missouri and mid-Illinois, terminating in the southern latitudes of Central Texas.

Given their wide historical distribution, red wolves probably used a large suite of habitat types at one time. The last naturally occurring population used coastal prairie marshes, swamps, and agricultural fields used to grow rice and cotton. However, this environment probably does not typify preferred red wolf habitat. Some evidence shows the species was found in highest numbers in the once extensive bottom-land river forests and swamps of the southeastern United States. Red wolves reintroduced into northeastern North Carolina have used habitat types ranging from agricultural lands to forest/wetland mosaics characterized by an overstory of pine and an understory of evergreen shrubs. This suggests that red wolves are habitat generalists and can thrive in most settings where prey populations are adequate and persecution by humans is slight.

=== Extirpation in the wild ===

In 1940, the biologist Stanley P. Young noted that the red wolf was still common in eastern Texas, where more than 800 had been caught in 1939 because of their attacks on livestock. He did not believe that they could be exterminated because of their habit of living concealed in thickets. In 1962 a study of skull morphology of wild &quot;Canis&quot; in the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas indicated that the red wolf existed in only a few populations due to hybridization with the coyote. The explanation was that either the red wolf could not adapt to changes to its environment due to human land-use along with its accompanying influx of competing coyotes from the west, or that the red wolf was being hybridized out of existence by the coyote.

===Reintroduced habitat===
Since 1987, red wolves have been released into northeastern North Carolina, where they roam 1.7 million acres. These lands span five counties (Dare, Hyde, Tyrrell, Washington, and Beaufort) and include three national wildlife refuges, a U.S. Air Force bombing range, and private land. The red wolf recovery program is unique for a large carnivore reintroduction in that more than half of the land used for reintroduction lies on private property. Approximately are federal and state lands, and are private lands.

Beginning in 1991, red wolves were also released into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in eastern Tennessee. However, due to exposure to environmental disease (parvovirus), parasites, and competition (with coyotes as well as intraspecific aggression), the red wolf was unable to successfully establish a wild population in the park. Low prey density was also a problem, forcing the wolves to leave the park boundaries in pursuit of food in lower elevations. In 1998, the FWS took away the remaining red wolves in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, relocating them to Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina. Other red wolves have been released on the coastal islands in Florida, Mississippi, and South Carolina as part of the captive breeding management plan. St. Vincent Island in Florida is currently the only active island propagation site.

==Captive breeding and reintroduction==

After the passage of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, formal efforts backed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began to save the red wolf from extinction, when a captive-breeding program was established at the Point Defiance Zoological Gardens, Tacoma, Washington. Four hundred animals were captured from southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas from 1973 to 1980 by the USFWS.

Measurements, vocalization analyses, and skull X-rays were used to distinguish red wolves from coyotes and red wolf × coyote hybrids. Of the 400 canids captured, only 43 were believed to be red wolves and sent to the breeding facility. The first litters were produced in captivity in May 1977. Some of the pups were determined to be hybrids, and they and their parents were removed from the program. Of the original 43 animals, only 17 were considered pure red wolves and since three were unable to breed, 14 became the breeding stock for the captive-breeding program. These 14 were so closely related that they had the genetic effect of being only eight individuals.

In 1996, the red wolf was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as a critically endangered species.

===20th century releases===
;1976 release in Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge
:In December 1976, two wolves were released onto Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge&#x27;s Bulls Island in South Carolina with the intent of testing and honing reintroduction methods. They were not released with the intent of beginning a permanent population on the island. The first experimental translocation lasted for 11 days, during which a mated pair of red wolves was monitored day and night with remote telemetry. A second experimental translocation was tried in 1978 with a different mated pair, and they were allowed to remain on the island for close to nine months. After that, a larger project was executed in 1987 to reintroduce a permanent population of red wolves back to the wild in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge (ARNWR) on the eastern coast of North Carolina. Also in 1987, Bulls Island became the first island breeding site. Pups were raised on the island and relocated to North Carolina until 2005.

;1986 release in Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge
:In September 1987, four male-female pairs of red wolves were released in the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, in northeastern North Carolina, and designated as an experimental population. Since then, the experimental population has grown and the recovery area expanded to include four national wildlife refuges, a Department of Defense bombing range, state-owned lands, and private lands, encompassing about .

;1989 release on Horn Island, Mississippi
:In 1989, the second island propagation project was initiated with release of a population on Horn Island off the Mississippi coast. This population was removed in 1998 because of a likelihood of encounters with humans. The third island propagation project introduced a population on St. Vincent Island, Florida, offshore between Cape San Blas and Apalachicola, Florida, in 1990, and in 1997, the fourth island propagation program introduced a population to Cape St. George Island, Florida, south of Apalachicola.

;1991 release in the Great Smoky Mountains
:In 1991, two pairs were reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where the last known red wolf was killed in 1905. Despite some early success, the wolves were relocated to eastern North Carolina in 1998, ending the effort to reintroduce the species to the park.

===21st century status===
Over 30 facilities participate in the red wolf Species Survival Plan and oversee the breeding and reintroduction of over 150 wolves.

In 2007, the USFWS estimated that 300 red wolves remained in the world, with 207 of those in captivity. By late 2020, the number of wild individuals had shrunk to only about 7 radio-collared and a dozen uncollared individuals, with no wild pups born since 2018. This decline has been linked to shooting and poisoning of wolves by landowners, and suspended conservation efforts by the USFWS.

A 2019 analysis by the Center for Biological Diversity of available habitat throughout the red wolf&#x27;s former range found that over 20,000 square miles of public land across five sites had viable habitat for red wolves to be reintroduced to in the future. These sites were chosen based on prey levels, isolation from coyotes and human development, and connectivity with other sites. These sites include: the Apalachicola and Osceola National Forests along with the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge and nearby protected lands; numerous national parks and national forests in the Appalachian Mountains including the Monongahela, George Washington &amp; Jefferson, Cherokee, Pisgah, Nantahala, Chattahoochee, and Talladega National Forests along with Shenandoah National Park and the lower elevations of Great Smoky Mountains National Park; Croatoan National Forest and Hofmann Forest on the North Carolina coast, and the Ozark, Ouatchita, and Mark Twain National Forests in the central United States.

In late 2018, two canids that are largely coyote were found on Galveston Island, Texas with red wolf alleles (gene expressions) left from a ghost population of red wolves. Since these alleles are from a different population from the red wolves in the North Carolina captive breeding program, there has been a proposal to selectively cross-breed the Galveston Island coyotes into the captive red wolf population. Another study published around the same time analyzing canid scat and hair samples in southwestern Louisiana found genetic evidence of red wolf ancestry in about 55% of sampled canids, with one such individual having between 78 and 100% red wolf ancestry, suggesting the possibility of more red wolf genes in the wild that may not be present in the captive population.

From 2015 to 2019, there were no red wolves released into the wild. But in March 2020, the FWS released a new breeding pair of red wolves, including a young male red wolf from St. Vincent Island, Florida into the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. The pair were unsuccessful at producing a litter of pups in the wild. On March 1, 2021, two male red wolves from Florida were paired with two female wild red wolves from eastern North Carolina and released into the wild. One of the male wolves was killed by a car shortly after being released into the wild. On April 30 and May 1, four adult red wolves were released into the wild and four red wolf pups were fostered by a wild female red wolf. In addition to the eight released wolves, the total number of red wolves living in the wild amount to nearly thirty wild individuals, including a dozen other wolves not wearing radio collars.

A study published in 2020 reported camera traps recorded &quot;the presence of a large canid possessing wolf-like characters&quot; in northeast Texas and later hair samples and tracks from the area indicated the presence of red wolves.

By fall of 2021, a total of six red wolves had been killed, including the four adults that had been released in the spring. Three of the released adults had been killed in vehicle collisions, two had died from unknown cases, and the fourth released adult had been shot by a landowner who feared the wolf was attempting to get his chickens. These losses dropped the number of wolves in the wild down to about 20 wild individuals. In the winter of 2021–2022, the Fish and Wildlife Services selected nine captive adult red wolves to be released into the wild. A family of five red wolves were released into the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge, while two new breeding pairs of adult wolves were released into the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. The release of these new wolves brought the number of wild red wolves in eastern North Carolina up to less than 30 wild individuals.

On April 22, 2022, one of the breeding pairs of adult red wolves produced a litter of six wolf pups, four females and two males. This new litter of red wolf pups became the first litter born in the wild since 2018. As of 2023, there are between 15 and 17 wild red wolves in Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge.

===Existing population===

In April and May 2023, two captive male red wolves were paired with two wild female wolves in acclimation pens and were later released into the wild. At the same time, the wild breeding pair that produced a litter of pups the previous year gave birth to a second litter of 5 pups, 2 males and 3 females. A male wolf pup from a captive litter was fostered into the pack, and with this new addition, the family of red wolves, which was named the Milltail pack by FWS, has grown to 13 wild individuals. These six new pups has brought the wild population of red wolves up to 23–25 wild individuals.

In May 2023, two families of red wolves were placed in acclimation pens to be released into the wild in the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge in Tyrrell County. One family consisted of a breeding pair and three pups, while the other consisted of a breeding pair, a yearling female, and four young pups that were born in the acclamation pen. In early June 2023, the two families of red wolves were released into the wild to roam through PLNWR. With the addition of these two separate packs, the wild population of red wolves had increased to about 35 wild individuals. In addition to the wild population, there are approximately 270 red wolves in zoos and captive breeding programs across the U.S.

===Coyote × re-introduced red wolf issues===
Interbreeding with the coyote has been recognized as a threat affecting the restoration of red wolves. Adaptive management efforts are making progress in reducing the threat of coyotes to the red wolf population in northeastern North Carolina. Other threats, such as habitat fragmentation, disease, and human-caused mortality, are of concern in the restoration of red wolves. Efforts to reduce the threats are presently being explored.

By 1999, introgression of coyote genes was recognized as the single greatest threat to wild red wolf recovery and an adaptive management plan which included coyote sterilization has been successful, with coyote genes being reduced by 2015 to less than 4% of the wild red wolf population.

Since the 2014 programmatic review, the USFWS ceased implementing the red wolf adaptive management plan that was responsible for preventing red wolf hybridization with coyotes and allowed the release of captive-born red wolves into the wild population. Since then, the wild population has decreased from 100–115 red wolves to less than 30. Despite the controversy over the red wolf&#x27;s status as a unique taxon as well as the USFWS&#x27; apparent disinterest towards wolf conservation in the wild, the vast majority of public comments (including NC residents) submitted to the USFWS in 2017 over their new wolf management plan were in favor of the original wild conservation plan.

A 2016 genetic study of canid scats found that despite high coyote density inside the Red Wolf Experimental Population Area (RWEPA), hybridization occurs rarely (4% are hybrids).

===Contested killing of re-introduced red wolves===
High wolf mortality related to anthropogenic causes appeared to be the main factor limiting wolf dispersal westward from the RWEPA. High anthropogenic wolf mortality similarly limits expansion of eastern wolves outside of protected areas in south-eastern Canada.

In 2012, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit against the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission for jeopardizing the existence of the wild red wolf population by allowing nighttime hunting of coyotes in the five-county restoration area in eastern North Carolina. A 2014 court-approved settlement agreement was reached that banned nighttime hunting of coyotes and requires permitting and reporting coyote hunting. In response to the settlement, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission adopted a resolution requesting the USFWS to remove all wild red wolves from private lands, terminate recovery efforts, and declare red wolves extinct in the wild. This resolution came in the wake of a 2014 programmatic review of the red wolf conservation program conducted by The Wildlife Management Institute. The Wildlife Management Institute indicated the reintroduction of the red wolf was an incredible achievement. The report indicated that red wolves could be released and survive in the wild, but that illegal killing of red wolves threatens the long-term persistence of the population. The report stated that the USFWS needed to update its red wolf recovery plan, thoroughly evaluate its strategy for preventing coyote hybridization and increase its public outreach.

In 2014, the USFWS issued the first take permit for a red wolf to a private landowner. Since then, the USFWS issued several other take permits to landowners in the five-county restoration area. During June 2015, a landowner shot and killed a female red wolf after being authorized a take permit, causing a public outcry. In response, the Southern Environmental Law Center filed a lawsuit against the USFWS for violating the Endangered Species Act.

By 2016, the red wolf population of North Carolina had declined to 45–60 wolves. The largest cause of this decline was gunshot.

In June 2018, the USFWS announced a proposal that would limit the wolves&#x27; safe range to only Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge, where only about 35 wolves remain, thus allowing hunting on private land. In November 2018, Chief Judge Terrence W. Boyle found that the USFWS had violated its congressional mandate to protect the red wolf, and ruled that USFWS had no power to give landowners the right to shoot them.

==Relationship to humans==
Since before European colonization of the Americas, the red wolf has featured prominently in Cherokee spiritual beliefs, where it is known as &quot;wa&#x27;ya&quot; (ᏩᏯ), and is said to be the companion of Kana&#x27;ti - the hunter and father of the &quot;Aniwaya&quot; or Wolf Clan. Traditionally, Cherokee people generally avoid killing red wolves, as such an act is believed to bring about the vengeance of the killed animals&#x27; pack-mates.

== Taxonomy ==
The taxonomic status of the red wolf is debated. It has been described as either a species with a distinct lineage, a recent hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, an ancient hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote which warrants species status, or a distinct species that has undergone recent hybridization with the coyote.

The naturalists John James Audubon and John Bachman were the first to suggest that the wolves of the southern United States were different from wolves in its other regions. In 1851 they recorded the &quot;Black American Wolf&quot; as &quot;C. l.&quot; var. &quot;ater&quot; that existed in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Missouri, Louisiana, and northern Texas. They also recorded the &quot;Red Texan Wolf&quot; as &quot;C. l.&quot; var. &quot;rufus&quot; that existed from northern Arkansas, through Texas, and into Mexico. In 1912 the zoologist Gerrit Smith Miller Jr. noted that the designation &quot;ater&quot; was unavailable and recorded these wolves as &quot;C. l. floridanus&quot;.

In 1937, the zoologist Edward Alphonso Goldman proposed a new species of wolf &quot;Canis rufus&quot;. Three subspecies of red wolf were originally recognized by Goldman, with two of these subspecies now being extinct. The Florida black wolf (&quot;Canis rufus floridanus&quot;) (Maine to Florida) has been extinct since 1908 and the Mississippi Valley red wolf (&quot;Canis rufus gregoryi&quot;) (south-central United States) was declared extinct by 1980. By the 1970s, the Texas red wolf (&quot;Canis rufus rufus&quot;) existed only in the coastal prairies and marshes of extreme southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana. These were removed from the wild to form a captive breeding program and reintroduced into eastern North Carolina in 1987.

In 1967, the zoologists Barbara Lawrence and William H. Bossert believed that the case for classifying &quot;C. rufus&quot; as a species was based too heavily on the small red wolves of central Texas, from where it was known that there existed hybridization with the coyote. They said that if an adequate number of specimens had been included from Florida, then the separation of &quot;C. rufus&quot; from &quot;C. lupus&quot; would have been unlikely. The taxonomic reference &quot;Catalogue of Life&quot; classifies the red wolf as a subspecies of &quot;Canis lupus&quot;. The mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft, writing in &quot;Mammal Species of the World&quot; (2005), regards the red wolf as a hybrid of the gray wolf and the coyote, but due to its uncertain status compromised by recognizing it as a subspecies of the gray wolf &quot;Canis lupus rufus&quot;.

In 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists considered the red wolf as its own species (&quot;Canis rufus&quot;).

=== Taxonomic debate ===
When European settlers first arrived to North America, the coyote&#x27;s range was limited to the western half of the continent. They existed in the arid areas and across the open plains, including the prairie regions of the midwestern states. Early explorers found some in Indiana and Wisconsin. From the mid-1800s onward, coyotes began expanding beyond their original range.

The taxonomic debate regarding North American wolves can be summarised as follows:
==== Fossil evidence ====
The paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak notes that the oldest fossil remains of the red wolf are 10,000 years old and were found in Florida near Melbourne, Brevard County, Withlacoochee River, Citrus County, and Devil&#x27;s Den Cave, Levy County. He notes that there are only a few, but questionable, fossil remains of the gray wolf found in the southeastern states. He proposes that following the extinction of the dire wolf, the coyote appears to have been displaced from the southeastern US by the red wolf until the last century, when the extirpation of wolves allowed the coyote to expand its range. He also proposes that the ancestor of all North American and Eurasian wolves was &quot;C. mosbachensis&quot;, which lived in the Middle Pleistocene 700,000–300,000 years ago.

&quot;C. mosbachensis&quot; was a wolf that once lived across Eurasia before going extinct. It was smaller than most North American wolf populations and smaller than &quot;C. rufus&quot;, and has been described as being similar in size to the small Indian wolf, &quot;Canis lupus pallipes&quot;. He further proposes that &quot;C. mosbachensis&quot; invaded North America where it became isolated by the later glaciation and there gave rise to &quot;C. rufus&quot;. In Eurasia, &quot;C. mosbachensis&quot; evolved into &quot;C. lupus&quot;, which later invaded North America.

The paleontologist and expert on the genus &quot;Canis&quot;″ natural history, Xiaoming Wang, looked at red wolf fossil material but could not state if it was, or was not, a separate species. He said that Nowak had put together more morphometric data on red wolves than anybody else, but Nowak&#x27;s statistical analysis of the data revealed a red wolf that is difficult to deal with. Wang proposes that studies of ancient DNA taken from fossils might help settle the debate.

==== Morphological evidence ====

In 1771, the English naturalist Mark Catesby referred to Florida and the Carolinas when he wrote that &quot;The Wolves in America are like those of Europe, in shape and colour, but are somewhat smaller.&quot; They were described as being more timid and less voracious. In 1791 the American naturalist William Bartram wrote in his book &quot;Travels&quot; about a wolf which he had encountered in Florida that was larger than a dog, but was black in contrast to the larger yellow-brown wolves of Pennsylvania and Canada. In 1851 the naturalists John James Audubon and John Bachman described the &quot;Red Texan Wolf&quot; in detail. They noted that it could be found in Florida and other southeastern states, but it differed from other North American wolves and named it &quot;Canis lupus rufus&quot;. It was described as being more fox-like than the gray wolf, but retaining the same &quot;sneaking, cowardly, yet ferocious disposition&quot;.

In 1905, the mammalogist Vernon Bailey referred to the &quot;Texan Red Wolf&quot; with the first use of the name &quot;Canis rufus&quot;. In 1937 the zoologist Edward Goldman undertook a morphological study of southeastern wolf specimens. He noted that their skulls and dentition differed from those of gray wolves and closely approached those of coyotes. He identified the specimens as all belonging to the one species which he referred to as &quot;Canis rufus&quot;. Goldman then examined a large number of southeastern wolf specimens and identified three subspecies, noting that their colors ranged from black, gray, and cinnamon-buff.

It is difficult to distinguish the red wolf from a red wolf × coyote hybrid. During the 1960s, two studies of the skull morphology of wild &quot;Canis&quot; in the southeastern states found them to belong to the red wolf, the coyote, or many variations in between. The conclusion was that there has been recent massive hybridization with the coyote. In contrast, another 1960s study of &quot;Canis&quot; morphology concluded that the red wolf, eastern wolf, and domestic dog were closer to the gray wolf than the coyote, while still remaining clearly distinctive from each other. The study regarded these 3 canines as subspecies of the gray wolf. However, the study noted that &quot;red wolf&quot; specimens taken from the edge of their range which they shared with the coyote could not be attributed to any one species because the cranial variation was very wide. The study proposed further research to ascertain if hybridization had occurred.

In 1971, a study of the skulls of &quot;C. rufus&quot;, &quot;C. lupus&quot; and &quot;C. latrans&quot; indicated that &quot;C. rufus&quot; was distinguishable by being in size and shape midway between the gray wolf and the coyote. A re-examination of museum canine skulls collected from central Texas between 1915 and 1918 showed variations spanning from &quot;C. rufus&quot; through to &quot;C. latrans&quot;. The study proposes that by 1930 due to human habitat modification, the red wolf had disappeared from this region and had been replaced by a hybrid swarm. By 1969, this hybrid swarm was moving eastwards into eastern Texas and Louisiana.

In the late 19th century, sheep farmers in Kerr County, Texas, stated that the coyotes in the region were larger than normal coyotes, and they believed that they were a gray wolf and coyote cross. In 1970, the wolf mammalogist L. David Mech proposed that the red wolf was a hybrid of the gray wolf and coyote. However, a 1971 study compared the cerebellum within the brain of six &quot;Canis&quot; species and found that the cerebellum of the red wolf indicated a distinct species, was closest to that of the gray wolf, but in contrast indicated some characteristics that were more primitive than those found in any of the other &quot;Canis&quot; species. In 2014, a three-dimensional morphometrics study of &quot;Canis&quot; species accepted only six red wolf specimens for analysis from those on offer, due to the impact of hybridization on the others.

==== DNA studies ====
Different DNA studies may give conflicting results because of the specimens selected, the technology used, and the assumptions made by the researchers.

Phylogenetic trees compiled using different genetic markers have given conflicting results on the relationship between the wolf, dog and coyote. One study based on SNPs (a single mutation), and another based on nuclear gene sequences (taken from the cell nucleus), showed dogs clustering with coyotes and separate from wolves. Another study based on SNPS showed wolves clustering with coyotes and separate from dogs. Other studies based on a number of markers show the more widely accepted result of wolves clustering with dogs separate from coyotes. These results demonstrate that caution is needed when interpreting the results provided by genetic markers.

===== Genetic marker evidence =====
In 1980, a study used gel electrophoresis to look at fragments of DNA taken from dogs, coyotes, and wolves from the red wolf&#x27;s core range. The study found that a unique allele (expression of a gene) associated with Lactate dehydrogenase could be found in red wolves, but not dogs and coyotes. The study suggests that this allele survives in the red wolf. The study did not compare gray wolves for the existence of this allele.

Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. In 1991, a study of red wolf mDNA indicates that red wolf genotypes match those known to belong to the gray wolf or the coyote. The study concluded that the red wolf is either a wolf × coyote hybrid or a species that has hybridized with the wolf and coyote across its entire range. The study proposed that the red wolf is a southeastern occurring subspecies of the gray wolf that has undergone hybridization due to an expanding coyote population; however, being unique and threatened that it should remain protected. This conclusion led to debate for the remainder of the decade.

In 2000, a study looked at red wolves and eastern Canadian wolves. The study agreed that these two wolves readily hybridize with the coyote. The study used eight microsatellites (genetic markers taken from across the genome of a specimen). The phylogenetic tree produced from the genetic sequences showed red wolves and eastern Canadian wolves clustering together. These then clustered next closer with the coyote and away from the gray wolf. A further analysis using mDNA sequences indicated the presence of coyote in both of these two wolves, and that these two wolves had diverged from the coyote 150,000–300,000 years ago. No gray wolf sequences were detected in the samples. The study proposes that these findings are inconsistent with the two wolves being subspecies of the gray wolf, that red wolves and eastern Canadian wolves evolved in North America after having diverged from the coyote, and therefore they are more likely to hybridize with coyotes.

In 2009, a study of eastern Canadian wolves using microsatellites, mDNA, and the paternally-inherited yDNA markers found that the eastern Canadian wolf was a unique ecotype of the gray wolf that had undergone recent hybridization with other gray wolves and coyotes. It could find no evidence to support the findings of the earlier 2000 study regarding the eastern Canadian wolf. The study did not include the red wolf.

In 2011, a study compared the genetic sequences of 48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (mutations) taken from the genomes of canids from around the world. The comparison indicated that the red wolf was about 76% coyote and 24% gray wolf with hybridization having occurred 287–430 years ago. The eastern wolf was 58% gray wolf and 42% coyote with hybridization having occurred 546–963 years ago. The study rejected the theory of a common ancestry for the red and eastern wolves. However the next year, a study reviewed a subset of the 2011 study&#x27;s Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and proposed that its methodology had skewed the results and that the red and eastern wolves are not hybrids but are in fact the same species separate from the gray wolf. The 2012 study proposed that there are three true &quot;Canis&quot; species in North America: The gray wolf, the western coyote, and the red wolf / eastern wolf. The eastern wolf was represented by the Algonquin wolf. The Great Lakes wolf was found to be a hybrid of the eastern wolf and the gray wolf. Finally, the study found the eastern coyote itself to be yet another a hybrid between the western coyote and the eastern (Algonquin) wolf (for more on eastern North American wolf-coyote hybrids, &quot;see&quot; coywolf).

Also in 2011, a scientific literature review was undertaken to help assess the taxonomy of North American wolves. One of the findings proposed was that the eastern wolf is supported as a separate species by morphological and genetic data. Genetic data supports a close relationship between the eastern and red wolves, but not close enough to support these as one species. It was &quot;likely&quot; that these were the separate descendants of a common ancestor shared with coyotes. This review was published in 2012. In 2014, the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis was invited by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to provide an independent review of its proposed rule relating to gray wolves. The center&#x27;s panel findings were that the proposed rule depended heavily upon a single analysis contained in a scientific literature review by Chambers &quot;et al&quot;. (2011 ), that that study was not universally accepted, that the issue was &quot;not settled&quot;, and that the rule does not represent the &quot;best available science&quot;.

Brzeski &quot;et al&quot;. (2016) conducted an mDNA analysis of three ancient (300–1,900 years old) wolf-like samples from the southeastern United States found that they grouped with the coyote clade, although their teeth were wolf-like. The study proposed that the specimens were either coyotes and this would mean that coyotes had occupied this region continuously rather than intermittently, a North American evolved red wolf lineage related to coyotes, or an ancient coyote–wolf hybrid. Ancient hybridization between wolves and coyotes would likely have been due to natural events or early human activities, not landscape changes associated with European colonization because of the age of these samples. Coyote–wolf hybrids may have occupied the southeastern United States for a long time, filling an important niche as a medium-large predator.

===== Whole-genome evidence =====

In July 2016, a whole-genome DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000–117,000 years ago. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the red wolf and Great Lakes region wolf are highly admixed with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000 and 117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present. Other tests and modelling showed various divergence ranges and the conclusion was a range of less than 6,000 and 117,000 years before present. The study found that coyote ancestry was highest in red wolves from the southeast of the United States and lowest among the Great Lakes region wolves.

The theory proposed was that this pattern matched the south-to-north disappearance of the wolf due to European colonization and its resulting loss of habitat. Bounties led to the extirpation of wolves initially in the southeast, and as the wolf population declined wolf-coyote admixture increased. Later, this process occurred in the Great Lakes region with the influx of coyotes replacing wolves, followed by the expansion of coyotes and their hybrids across the wider region. The red wolf may possess some genomic elements that were unique to gray wolf and coyote lineages from the American South. The proposed timing of the wolf/coyote divergence conflicts with the finding of a coyote-like specimen in strata dated to 1 million years before present, and red wolf fossil specimens dating back 10,000 years ago. The study concluded by stating that because of the extirpation of gray wolves in the American Southeast, &quot;the reintroduced population of red wolves in eastern North Carolina is doomed to genetic swamping by coyotes without the extensive management of hybrids, as is currently practiced by the USFWS.&quot;

In September 2016, the USFWS announced a program of changes to the red wolf recovery program and &quot;will begin implementing a series of actions based on the best and latest scientific information&quot;. The service will secure the captive population which is regarded as not sustainable, determine new sites for additional experimental wild populations, revise the application of the existing experimental population rule in North Carolina, and complete a comprehensive Species Status Assessment.

In 2017, a group of canid researchers challenged the recent finding that the red wolf and the eastern wolf were the result of recent coyote-wolf hybridization. The group highlight that no testing had been undertaken to ascertain the time period that hybridization had occurred and that, by the previous study&#x27;s own figures, the hybridization could not have occurred recently but supports a much more ancient hybridization. The group found deficiencies in the previous study&#x27;s selection of specimens and the findings drawn from the different techniques used. Therefore, the group argues that both the red wolf and the eastern wolf remain genetically distinct North American taxa. This was rebutted by the authors of the earlier study. Another study in late 2018 of wild canids in southwestern Louisiana also supported the red wolf as a separate species, citing distinct red wolf DNA within hybrid canids.

In 2019, a literature review of the previous studies was undertaken by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. The position of the National Academies is that the historical red wolf forms a valid taxonomic species, the modern red wolf is distinct from wolves and coyotes, and modern red wolves trace some of their ancestry to historic red wolves. The species &quot;Canis rufus&quot; is supported for the modern red wolf, unless genomic evidence from historical red wolf specimens changes this assessment, due to a lack of continuity between the historic and the modern red wolves.

===== Wolf genome =====
Genetic studies relating to wolves or dogs have inferred phylogenetic relationships based on the only reference genome available, that of the Boxer dog. In 2017, the first reference genome of the wolf &quot;Canis lupus lupus&quot; was mapped to aid future research. In 2018, a study looked at the genomic structure and admixture of North American wolves, wolf-like canids, and coyotes using specimens from across their entire range that mapped the largest dataset of nuclear genome sequences against the wolf reference genome. The study supports the findings of previous studies that North American gray wolves and wolf-like canids were the result of complex gray wolf and coyote mixing. A polar wolf from Greenland and a coyote from Mexico represented the purest specimens. The coyotes from Alaska, California, Alabama, and Quebec show almost no wolf ancestry. Coyotes from Missouri, Illinois, and Florida exhibit 5–10% wolf ancestry. There was 40%:60% wolf to coyote ancestry in red wolves, 60%:40% in Eastern timber wolves, and 75%:25% in the Great Lakes wolves. There was 10% coyote ancestry in Mexican wolves and Atlantic Coast wolves, 5% in Pacific Coast and Yellowstone wolves, and less than 3% in Canadian archipelago wolves.

The study shows that the genomic ancestry of red, eastern timber and Great Lakes wolves were the result of admixture between modern gray wolves and modern coyotes. This was then followed by development into local populations. Individuals within each group showed consistent levels of coyote to wolf inheritance, indicating that this was the result of relatively ancient admixture. The eastern timber wolf (Algonquin Provincial Park) is genetically closely related to the Great Lakes wolf (Minnesota, Isle Royale National Park). If a third canid had been involved in the admixture of the North American wolf-like canids, then its genetic signature would have been found in coyotes and wolves, which it has not.

Gray wolves suffered a species-wide population bottleneck (reduction) approximately 25,000 YBP during the Last Glacial Maximum. This was followed by a single population of modern wolves expanding out of a Beringia refuge to repopulate the wolf&#x27;s former range, replacing the remaining Late Pleistocene wolf populations across Eurasia and North America as they did so. This implies that if the coyote and red wolf were derived from this invasion, their histories date only tens of thousands and not hundreds of thousands of years ago, which is consistent with other studies.

The Endangered Species Act provides protection to endangered species, but does not provide protection for endangered admixed individuals, even if these serve as reservoirs for extinct genetic variation. Researchers on both sides of the red wolf debate argue that admixed canids warrant full protection under this Act.

===== Separate species that can be strengthened from hybrids =====
In 2020, a study conducted DNA sequencing of canines across southeastern US to detect those with any red wolf ancestry. The study found that red wolf ancestry exists in the coyote populations of southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas, but also newly detected in North Carolina. The red wolf ancestry of these populations possess unique red wolf alleles not found in the current captive red wolf population. The study proposes that the expanding coyotes admixed with red wolves to gain genetic material that was suited to the southeastern environment and would aid their adaptation to it, and that surviving red wolves admixed with coyotes because the red wolves were suffering from inbreeding.

In 2021, a study conducted DNA sequencing of canines across the remnant red wolf hybrid zone of southwestern Louisiana and southeastern Texas. The study found red wolf ancestry in the coyote genomes which increases up to 60% in a westward gradient. This was due to introgression from the remnant red wolf population over the past 100 years. The study proposes that coyotes expanded into the gulf region and admixed with red wolves prior to the red wolf going extinct in the wild due to loss of habitat and persecution. In the past two decades the hybrid region has expanded. The study presented the genetic evidence that the red wolf is a separate species, based on the structure of one of the loci of its X-chromosome which is accepted as a marker for distinct species. As such, the study suggested that the introgressed red wolf ancestry could be de-introgressed back as a basis for breeding further red wolves from the hybrids.

===== Pre-dates the coyote in North America =====
In 2021, a study of mitochondrial genomes sourced from specimens dated before the 20th century revealed that red wolves could be found across North America. With the arrival of the gray wolf between 80,000 and 60,000 years ago, the red wolf&#x27;s range shrank to the eastern forests and California, and the coyote replaced the red wolf mid-continent between 60,000 and 30,000 years ago. The coyote expanded into California at the beginning of the Holocene era 12,000–10,000 years ago and admixed with the red wolf, phenotypically replacing them. The study proposes that the red wolf may pre-date the coyote in North America.

<doc id="26089" wikidata="Q1751476" url="?curid=26089" title="Real ale">
<text>Real ale is the name coined by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) for ale that is &quot;brewed from traditional ingredients, matured by secondary fermentation in the container from which it is dispensed, and served without the use of extraneous carbon dioxide&quot;.

==Cask and bottle-conditioned beers==
Cask and bottle-conditioned beers are referred to as real ale by CAMRA, as both fit its description of beers served from a container in which they have undergone secondary fermentation.

==Distinction from filtered beer==

The fundamental distinction between real and other ales is that real ale is unfiltered and unpasteurized, leaving its yeast alive and slowly fermentating in bottle or keg. This secondary fermentation continues until the ale is served, allowing it to retain its natural carbonation. In contrast, natural carbonation is removed from standard beer and ale during filtering, requiring them to be artificially re-carbonated (and often very &#x27;gassy&#x27;). 

Real ales are served &quot;bottle conditioned&quot;, gravity direct from the cask, or hand pumped. No external pressurization is used. Electric pumps are occasionally seen, especially in the Midlands and Scotland. powered by mains water pressure, were the traditional means of dispensing draught beer in Scotland but this method is discontinued.

==Cask breather==
A cask breather adds low pressure carbon dioxide into the cask to replace the beer as it is drawn off, preventing the admission of ambient air containing oxygen and nitrogen, forestalling spoilage, and thereby extending the beer&#x27;s saleable life. It does not pressurize the beer like typical of keg beer.

Before 2018, CAMRA refused to regard a cask ale kept &quot;fresh&quot; by cask breather as real ale. In 2018, this policy was changed, allowing pubs using cask breathers to be listed in the &quot;Good Beer Guide&quot;.

==CAMRA==
The term &quot;real ale&quot; was coined by CAMRA in the 1970s to attract media attention in the U.K. to naturally fermented and served ales at a time when there were very few independent breweries left and most production had gone over to filtered and pasteurised &quot;filtered ales&quot; - &quot;keg beer&quot; - served under carbon dioxide pressure.

== Popularity ==
Cask conditioned ale remains popular within the UK, particularly in traditional pubs. In 2019, 420 million pints were sold in the UK, 13.5% of total pint sales. Described as &#x27;Britain&#x27;s National Drink&#x27;, cask ale&#x27;s &#x27;Britishness&#x27; is an important factor in its promotion and consumption.

==Early life==

Myers was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His father owned a hardware store and his mother was a homemaker. He graduated from Shawnee Mission North High School in 1960. He graduated from Kansas State University (KSU) with a Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering in 1965 where he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. He was commissioned by Detachment 270 of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps at KSU. He graduated from Auburn University at Montgomery with a Master of Business Administration in 1977. Myers has attended the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama; the U.S. Army War College at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the Program for Senior Executives in National and International Security at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

Myers entered the United States Air Force in 1965 through the Reserve Officer Training Corps program. He received pilot training from 1965 to 1966 at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Myers is a command pilot with more than 4,100 flying hours in the T-33 Shooting Star, C-37, C-21, F-4 Phantom II, F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon, including 600 combat hours in the F-4. During his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Myers often flew official aircraft such as the Gulfstream C-37A and C-37B by himself during official trips. According to his 2009 autobiography (&quot;Eyes on The Horizon: Serving on the Front Lines of National Security)&quot;, &quot;one of the pleasures he had as both Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was to be able to sometimes fly on his required travels and stay pilot-qualified.&quot;

==Commander and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff==
From November 1993 to June 1996, Myers was Commander of United States Forces Japan and Fifth Air Force at Yokota Air Base, Japan and From July 1996 to July 1997 Myers served as assistant to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon. Myers received his fourth-star in 1997 when he was appointed as commander in chief of Pacific Air Forces. He commanded the Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, from July 1997 to July 1998. From August 1998 to February 2000, Myers was commander in chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command and United States Space Command; Commander of the Air Force Space Command; and Department of Defense manager of the space transportation system contingency support at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. As commander, Myers was responsible for defending America through space and intercontinental ballistic missile operations.

Following the appointment of General Joseph Ralston as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), Myers was appointed by President Bill Clinton to succeed Ralston as Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in February 2000. He assumed his duties on 29 February 2000. As vice chairman, Myers served as the chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, vice chairman of the Defense Acquisition Board, and as a member of the National Security Council Deputies Committee and the Nuclear Weapons Council. In addition, he acted for the chairman in all aspects of the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System including participation in the Defense Resources Board.

In August 2001, a year after assuming the role of Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President George W. Bush appointed Myers to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Myers was the first vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to be appointed chairman, since the role was established in 1987 after the enactment of Goldwater–Nichols Act of 1986.

=== September 11 Attacks ===
On the morning of 11 September 2001 Myers was on Capitol Hill to meet Georgia Senator Max Cleland for his scheduled courtesy calls before his Senate confirmation hearings to be the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While waiting for the senator, Myers watched a television news network in the outer office of Senator Cleland that a plane had just hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. A few minutes later Myers was informed by his military aide Captain Chris Donahue about the hijacked plane that just hit the second tower of the World Trade Center. Later on General Ralph Eberhart, the Commander-in-Chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, managed to contact Myers and inform him about the recent hijacking situation. Myers then immediately left Capitol Hill to proceed back to The Pentagon, where he was informed that this time another commercial airplane had just hit the western side of The Pentagon. During the crisis, Myers became the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, since General Hugh Shelton was en route to Europe for a NATO Summit. Upon arriving at The Pentagon and after a rendezvous with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Myers then conferred with Secretary Rumsfeld about the current situation and the next steps to be taken. Myers took command as the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for half of the day during the attacks on 11 September, until General Shelton arrived back in Washington after he aborted his flight to Europe at 5:40 p.m. local time.

==Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff==


Myers was sworn in as the 15th chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on 1 October 2001. He served as the principal military advisor to the president, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Council during the earliest stages of the War on Terror, including planning of the War in Afghanistan and planning and execution of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. A few days later, on 7 October 2001, Operation Enduring Freedom was initiated. Myers and General Tommy Franks, the commander of United States Central Command (CENTCOM), coordinated the early stage of Operation Enduring Freedom. Within three months, several radical terrorist groups had been toppled.

Myers also supported the involvement of NATO and allied coalition forces during the War on Terror. As a result of Operation Enduring Freedom, the political regime in Afghanistan was toppled and a new constitution was ratified in January 2004, which provided for direct presidential elections on 9 October 2004.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
During his tenure as chairman, Myers also oversaw the early stage of the invasion of Iraq. Together with CENTCOM commander General Tommy Franks, Myers coordinated the plan for the Iraqi invasion and the reconstruction of the country, and also established a combined joint task force in order to focus on post-conflict issues in Iraq. Operation Iraqi Freedom was initiated on 20 March 2003, which was preceded by an airstrike on Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Palace and followed by the Fall of Baghdad in April 2003. Operation Iraqi Freedom eventually led to the downfall of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s 24-year regime and the captured of Hussein on 13 December 2003. Following Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Coalition Provisional Authority was established in Iraq and was succeeded by the Iraqi Interim Government, which presided over parliamentary elections in 2005.

In order to gain support on both the War on Terror and the invasion of Iraq, Myers often travelled abroad in order to strengthen military relations with other allied nations, such as Mongolia. He was the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to visit Mongolia. Myers met with Mongolian President Natsagiin Bagabandi at Ulaanbaatar on 15 January 2004. As a result, the United States gained the support of the Mongolian government and Mongolia also deployed troops in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

===Military transformation===

In February 2004 Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état, leading to conflict within the country. The United States deployed Marines to Haiti as part of the multinational Operation Secure Tomorrow from February to July 2004. On March 13, Myers visited the United States troops deployed to Haiti.

Together with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Myers conducted weekly press briefings at The Pentagon on the War on Terror.One of Myers&#x27; achievements as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was his pursuit of the transformation of the United States military. Myers orchestrated substantive changes to the nation&#x27;s Unified Combatant Command&#x27;s plan following the September 11 attacks, leading to the establishment of United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) as the new Unified Combatant Command to consolidate and coordinate domestic defense. It was also to support local, state and federal authorities in order to assist the newly created Department of Homeland Security, especially in responding to national emergencies. Following the establishment of USNORTHCOM, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was also merged into USNORTHCOM and the United States Space Command was merged in to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) in order to consolidate and strengthen the nation&#x27;s nuclear deterrent and space missions. Like his predecessors, Myers also continued to promote a joint culture among the nation&#x27;s military services in order to avoid interservice rivalry.

In order to emphasize the War on Terror, Myers created what was known as &quot;National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism 2002-2005.&quot; The Strategic Plan provided a new guidance to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, regional commanders and Unified Combatant Command commanders for a multi-pronged strategy that aimed at targeting global terrorist networks.

Myers&#x27; tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ended in September 2005 and he was succeeded by General Peter Pace, who had served as Myers&#x27; Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff. Myers retired from active duty on 30 September 2005, after more than forty years of active service. His retirement ceremony was held at Fort Myer, Virginia, with President George W. Bush delivering the retirement remarks.

<text>Keith Rupert Murdoch ( ; born 11 March 1931) is an Australian-born American retired business magnate, investor, and media mogul. Through his company News Corp, he is the owner of hundreds of local, national, and international publishing outlets around the world, including in the UK (&quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;), in Australia (&quot;The Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Australian&quot;), in the US (&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and the &quot;New York Post&quot;), book publisher HarperCollins, and the television broadcasting channels Sky News Australia and Fox News (through the Fox Corporation). He was also the owner of Sky (until 2018), 21st Century Fox (until 2019), and the now-defunct &quot;News of the World&quot;. With a net worth of billion Murdoch is the 31st richest person in the United States and the 71st richest in the world according to &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine. Due to his extensive wealth influence over media and politics, Murdoch has been described as an oligarch.

After his father Keith Murdoch died in 1952, Murdoch took over the running of &quot;The News&quot;, a small Adelaide newspaper owned by his father. In the 1950s and 1960s, Murdoch acquired a number of newspapers in Australia and New Zealand before expanding into the United Kingdom in 1969, taking over the &quot;News of the World&quot;, followed closely by &quot;The Sun&quot;. In 1974, Murdoch moved to New York City, to expand into the US market; however, he retained interests in Australia and the UK. In 1981, Murdoch bought &quot;The Times&quot;, his first British broadsheet, and, in 1985, became a naturalized US citizen, giving up his Australian citizenship, to satisfy the legal requirement for US television network ownership. In 1986, keen to adopt newer electronic publishing technologies, Murdoch consolidated his UK printing operations in London, causing bitter industrial disputes. His holding company News Corporation acquired Twentieth Century Fox (1985), HarperCollins (1989), and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (2007). Murdoch formed the British broadcaster BSkyB in 1990 and, during the 1990s, expanded into Asian networks and South American television. By 2000, Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation owned more than 800 companies in more than 50 countries, with a net worth of more than $5 billion.

In July 2011, Murdoch faced allegations that his companies, including the &quot;News of the World&quot;, owned by News Corporation, had been regularly hacking the phones of celebrities, royalty, and public citizens. Murdoch faced police and government investigations into bribery and corruption by the British government and FBI investigations in the US. On 21 July 2012, Murdoch resigned as a director of News International. In September 2023, Murdoch announced he would be stepping down as chairman of Fox Corp. and News Corp. 

Many of Murdoch&#x27;s papers and television channels have been accused of biased and misleading coverage to support his business interests and political allies, and some have linked his influence with major political developments in the UK, US, and Australia.

, the Murdoch family is involved in a court case in the US in which his three children Elisabeth, Prudence, and James are challenging their father&#x27;s bid to amend the family trust to ensure that his eldest son, Lachlan, retains control of News Corp and Fox Corp, rather than the trust benefiting all of his six children, as is specified in its &quot;irrevocable&quot; terms.

== Early life and education==
Keith Rupert Murdoch was born on 11 March 1931 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, the second of four children of Sir Keith Arthur Murdoch (1885–1952) and Dame Elisabeth Joy (; 1909–2012). He is of English, Irish and Scottish ancestry. His parents were also born in Melbourne. Murdoch&#x27;s father was a war correspondent and later a regional newspaper magnate; he owned two newspapers in Adelaide, South Australia and a radio station in a remote mining town and was chairman of the Herald and Weekly Times publishing company. Murdoch has three sisters: Helen (1929–2004), Anne (born 1935) and Janet (born 1939). His paternal grandfather, Patrick John Murdoch, was a Scottish-born Presbyterian minister who emigrated to Australia in 1884. 

Murdoch attended Geelong Grammar School, where he was co-editor of the school&#x27;s official journal &quot;The Corian&quot; and editor of the student journal &quot;If Revived&quot;. Murdoch studied philosophy, politics and economics at Worcester College, Oxford, in England, where he kept a bust of Lenin in his rooms and came to be known as &quot;Red Rupert&quot;. He was a member of the Oxford University Labour Party, stood for secretary of the Labour Club and managed Oxford Student Publications Limited, the publishing house of &quot;Cherwell&quot;. 

After his father&#x27;s death from cancer in 1952, Murdoch&#x27;s mother did charity work as the life governor of the Royal Women&#x27;s Hospital in Melbourne and established the Murdoch Children&#x27;s Research Institute; at the age of 102 (in 2011), she had 74 descendants. While his father was alive, Murdoch worked part-time at the &quot;Melbourne Herald&quot; and was groomed by his father to take over the family business. After his father&#x27;s death, he began working as a sub-editor with the &quot;Daily Express&quot; for two years.

== Activities in Australia and New Zealand ==
Following his father&#x27;s death, when he was 21, Murdoch returned from Oxford to take charge of what was left of the family business. After liquidation of his father&#x27;s &quot;Herald&quot; stake to pay taxes, what was left was News Limited, which had been established in 1923. Rupert Murdoch turned its Adelaide newspaper, &quot;The News&quot;, its main asset, into a major success. He began to direct his attention to acquisition and expansion, buying the troubled &quot;Sunday Times&quot; in Perth, Western Australia (1956) and over the next few years acquiring suburban and provincial newspapers in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and the Northern Territory, including the Sydney afternoon tabloid &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot; (1960). &quot;The Economist&quot; describes Murdoch as &quot;inventing the modern tabloid&quot;, as he developed a pattern for his newspapers, increasing sports and scandal coverage and adopting eye-catching headlines.

Murdoch&#x27;s first foray outside Australia involved the purchase of a controlling interest in the New Zealand daily &quot;The Dominion&quot;. In January 1964, while touring New Zealand with friends in a rented Morris Minor after sailing across the Tasman, Murdoch read of a takeover bid for the Wellington paper by the British-based Canadian newspaper magnate Lord Thomson of Fleet. On the spur of the moment, he launched a counter-bid. A four-way battle for control ensued in which the 32-year-old Murdoch was ultimately successful. Later in 1964, Murdoch launched &quot;The Australian&quot;, Australia&#x27;s first national daily newspaper, which was based first in Canberra and later in Sydney. In 1972, Murdoch acquired the Sydney morning tabloid &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; from Australian media mogul Sir Frank Packer, who later regretted selling it to him. In 1984, Murdoch was appointed Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to publishing.

After the Keating government relaxed media ownership laws, in 1986 Murdoch launched a takeover bid for The Herald and Weekly Times, which was the largest newspaper publisher in Australia. There was a three-way takeover battle between Murdoch, Fairfax and Robert Holmes à Court, with Murdoch succeeding after agreeing to some divestments.

In 1999, Murdoch significantly expanded his music holdings in Australia by acquiring the controlling share in a leading Australian independent label, Michael Gudinski&#x27;s Mushroom Records; he merged that with Festival Records, and the result was Festival Mushroom Records (FMR). Both Festival and FMR were managed by Murdoch&#x27;s son James Murdoch for several years.

=== Political activities in Australia ===
Murdoch found a political ally in Sir John McEwen, leader of the Australian Country Party (now known as the National Party of Australia), who was governing in coalition with the larger Menzies-Holt-Gorton Liberal Party. From the first issue of &quot;The Australian,&quot; Murdoch began taking McEwen&#x27;s side in every issue that divided the long-serving coalition partners. (&quot;The Australian&quot;, 15 July 1964, first edition, front page: &quot;Strain in Cabinet, Liberal-CP row flares.&quot;) It was an issue that threatened to split the coalition government and open the way for the stronger Australian Labor Party to dominate Australian politics. It was the beginning of a long campaign that served McEwen well.

After McEwen and Menzies retired, Murdoch threw his growing power behind the Australian Labor Party under the leadership of Gough Whitlam and duly saw it elected on a social platform that included universal free health care, free education for all Australians to tertiary level, recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and public ownership of Australia&#x27;s oil, gas and mineral resources. Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s backing of Whitlam turned out to be brief. Murdoch had already started his short-lived &quot;National Star&quot; newspaper in America, and was seeking to strengthen his political contacts there.

Asked about the 2007 Australian federal election at News Corporation&#x27;s annual general meeting in New York on 19 October 2007, its chairman Rupert Murdoch said: &quot;I am not commenting on anything to do with Australian politics. I&#x27;m sorry. I always get into trouble when I do that.&quot; Pressed as to whether he believed Prime Minister John Howard should continue as prime minister, he said: &quot;I have nothing further to say. I&#x27;m sorry. Read our editorials in the papers. It&#x27;ll be the journalists who decide that – the editors.&quot;

Murdoch described Howard&#x27;s successor, Labor Party Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, as &quot;more ambitious to lead the world [in tackling climate change] than to lead Australia&quot; and criticised Rudd&#x27;s expansionary fiscal policies in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008 as unnecessary. In 2009, in response to accusations by Rudd that News Limited was running vendettas against him and his government, Murdoch opined that Rudd was &quot;oversensitive&quot;. Although News Limited&#x27;s interests are extensive, also including the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, the &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; and the &quot;Adelaide Advertiser&quot;, it was suggested by the commentator Mungo MacCallum in &quot;The Monthly&quot; that &quot;the anti-Rudd push, if coordinated at all, was almost certainly locally driven&quot; as opposed to being directed by Murdoch, who also took a different position from local editors on such matters as climate change and stimulus packages to combat the financial crisis.

Murdoch is a supporter of the formation of an Australian republic, having campaigned for such a change during the 1999 referendum.

== Activities in the United Kingdom ==
=== Business activities in the United Kingdom ===

In 1968, Murdoch entered the British newspaper market with his acquisition of the populist &quot;News of the World&quot;, followed in 1969 with the purchase of the struggling daily &quot;The Sun&quot; from IPC. Murdoch turned &quot;The Sun&quot; into a tabloid format and reduced costs by using the same printing press for both newspapers. On acquiring it, he appointed Albert &#x27;Larry&#x27; Lamb as editor and – Lamb recalled later – told him: &quot;I want a tearaway paper with lots of tits in it&quot;. In 1997 &quot;The Sun&quot; attracted 10 million daily readers. In 1981, Murdoch acquired the struggling &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; from Canadian newspaper publisher Lord Thomson of Fleet. Ownership of &quot;The Times&quot; came to him through his relationship with Lord Thomson, who had grown tired of losing money on it as a result of an extended period of industrial action that stopped publication. In the light of success and expansion at &quot;The Sun&quot; the owners believed that Murdoch could turn the papers around. Harold Evans, editor of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; from 1967, was switched to the daily &quot;Times&quot;, though he stayed only a year amid editorial conflict with Murdoch.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Murdoch&#x27;s publications were generally supportive of Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. At the end of the Thatcher/Major era, Murdoch switched his support to the Labour Party and its leader, Tony Blair. The closeness of his relationship with Blair and their secret meetings to discuss national policies was to become a political issue in Britain. This later changed, with &quot;The Sun&quot;, in its English editions, publicly renouncing the ruling Labour government and lending its support to David Cameron&#x27;s Conservative Party, which soon afterwards formed a coalition government. In Scotland, where the Conservatives had suffered a complete annihilation in 1997, the paper began to endorse the Scottish National Party (though not yet its flagship policy of independence), which soon after came to form the first-ever outright majority in the proportionally elected Scottish Parliament. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown&#x27;s official spokesman said in November 2009 that Brown and Murdoch &quot;were in regular communication&quot; and that &quot;there is nothing unusual in the prime minister talking to Rupert Murdoch&quot;.

In 1986, Murdoch introduced electronic production processes to his newspapers in Australia, Britain and the United States. The greater degree of automation led to significant reductions in the number of employees involved in the printing process. In England, the move roused the anger of the print unions, resulting in a long and often violent dispute that played out in Wapping, one of London&#x27;s docklands areas, where Murdoch had installed the very latest electronic newspaper purpose-built publishing facility in an old warehouse. The bitter Wapping dispute started with the dismissal of 6,000 employees who had gone on strike and resulted in street battles and demonstrations. Many on the political left in Britain alleged the collusion of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government with Murdoch in the Wapping affair, as a way of damaging the British trade union movement. In 1987, the dismissed workers accepted a settlement of £60 million.

In 1998, Murdoch made an attempt to buy the football club Manchester United F.C., with an offer of £625 million, but this failed. It was the largest amount ever offered for a sports club. It was blocked by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Competition Commission, which stated that the acquisition would have &quot;hurt competition in the broadcast industry and the quality of British football&quot;.

Murdoch&#x27;s British-based satellite network, Sky Television, incurred massive losses in its early years of operation. As with many of his other business interests, Sky was heavily subsidised by the profits generated by his other holdings, but convinced rival satellite operator British Satellite Broadcasting to accept a merger on his terms in 1990. The merged company, BSkyB, has dominated the British pay-TV market ever since, pursuing direct to home (DTH) satellite broadcasting. By 1996, BSkyB had more than 3.6 million subscribers, triple the number of cable customers in the UK.

Murdoch has a seat on the Strategic Advisory Board of Genie Oil and Gas, having jointly invested with Lord Rothschild in a 5.5% stake in the company which conducted shale gas and oil exploration in Colorado, Mongolia, Israel, and the occupied Golan Heights.

In response to print media&#x27;s decline and the increasing influence of online journalism during the 2000s, Murdoch proclaimed his support of the micropayments model for obtaining revenue from online news, although this has been criticised by some.

In January 2018, the CMA blocked Murdoch from taking over the remaining 61% of BSkyB he did not already own, over fear of market dominance that could potentialise censorship of the media. His bid for BSkyB was later approved by the CMA as long as he sold Sky News to the Walt Disney Company, which was already set to acquire 21st Century Fox. However, it was Comcast who won control of BSkyB in a blind auction ordered by the CMA. Murdoch ultimately sold his 39% of BSkyB to Comcast.

News Corporation has subsidiaries in the Bahamas, the Cayman Islands, the Channel Islands and the Virgin Islands. From 1986, News Corporation&#x27;s annual tax bill averaged around seven percent of its profits.

=== Political activities in the United Kingdom ===
In Britain, in the 1980s, Murdoch formed a close alliance with Conservative prime minister Margaret Thatcher. In February 1981, when Murdoch, already owner of &quot;The Sun&quot; and &quot;The News of the World&quot;, sought to buy &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Thatcher&#x27;s government let his bid pass without referring it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which was usual practice at the time. Although contact between the two before this point had been explicitly denied in an official history of &quot;The Times&quot;, documents found in Thatcher&#x27;s archives in 2012 revealed a secret meeting had taken place a month before in which Murdoch briefed Thatcher on his plans for the paper, such as taking on trade unions.

&quot;The Sun&quot; credited itself with helping her successor John Major to win an unexpected election victory in the 1992 general election, which had been expected to end in a hung parliament or a narrow win for Labour, then led by Neil Kinnock. In the general elections of 1997, 2001 and 2005, Murdoch&#x27;s papers were either neutral or supported Labour under Tony Blair.

The Labour Party, from when Blair became leader in 1994, had moved from the centre-left to a more centrist position on many economic issues before 1997. Murdoch identifies himself as a libertarian, saying &quot;What does libertarian mean? As much individual responsibility as possible, as little government as possible, as few rules as possible. But I&#x27;m not saying it should be taken to the absolute limit.&quot;

In a speech he delivered in New York in 2005, Murdoch claimed that Blair described the BBC coverage of the Hurricane Katrina disaster, which was critical of the Bush administration&#x27;s response, as full of hatred of America.

On 28 June 2006, the BBC reported that Murdoch and News Corporation were considering backing new Conservative leader David Cameron at the next General Election – still up to four years away. In a later interview in July 2006, when he was asked what he thought of the Conservative leader, Murdoch replied &quot;Not much&quot;. In a 2009 blog, it was suggested that in the aftermath of the &quot;News of the World&quot; phone hacking scandal, which might yet have transatlantic implications, Murdoch and News Corporation might have decided to back Cameron. Despite this, there had already been a convergence of interests between the two men over the muting of Britain&#x27;s communications regulator Ofcom.

In August 2008, Cameron accepted free flights to hold private talks and attend private parties with Murdoch on his yacht, the &quot;Rosehearty&quot;. Cameron declared in the Commons register of interests he accepted a private plane provided by Murdoch&#x27;s son-in-law, public relations guru Matthew Freud; Cameron did not reveal his talks with Murdoch. The gift of travel in Freud&#x27;s Gulfstream IV private jet was valued at around £30,000. Other guests attending the &quot;social events&quot; included the then EU trade commissioner Lord Mandelson, the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska and co-chairman of NBC Universal Ben Silverman. The Conservatives did not disclose what was discussed.

In July 2011, it emerged that Cameron had met key executives of Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation a total of 26 times during the 14 months that Cameron had served as prime minister up to that point. It was also reported that Murdoch had given Cameron a personal guarantee that there would be no risk attached to hiring Andy Coulson, the former editor of &quot;News of the World&quot;, as the Conservative Party&#x27;s communication director in 2007. This was in spite of Coulson having resigned as editor over phone hacking by a reporter. Cameron chose to take Murdoch&#x27;s advice, despite warnings from the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, Lord Ashdown and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Coulson resigned his post in 2011 and was later arrested and questioned on allegations of further criminal activity at the &quot;News of the World&quot;, specifically the phone hacking scandal. As a result of the subsequent trial, Coulson was sentenced to 18 months in jail.

In June 2016, &quot;The Sun&quot; supported Vote Leave in the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. Murdoch called the Brexit result &quot;wonderful&quot;, comparing the decision to withdraw from the EU to &quot;a prison break ... we&#x27;re out&quot;. Anthony Hilton, economics editor for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; but describing a period when he interviewed Murdoch for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, quoted Murdoch as justifying his Euroscepticism with the words &quot;When I go into Downing Street, they do what I say; when I go to Brussels, they take no notice.&quot; Murdoch denied saying this later in a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

With some exceptions, &quot;The Sun&quot; had generally been supportive of the government of Conservative prime minister Boris Johnson. Murdoch and his employees were the media representatives ministers from the Cabinet and Treasury most frequently held meetings during the first two years of Johnson&#x27;s government. However, newspaper circulation in general including among subsidiaries of News International fell sharply in the United Kingdom during the early 21st century, leading some commentators to suggest that Murdoch was not as influential in British political debate by the early 2020s as he had once been.

== News International phone hacking scandal ==
In July 2011, Murdoch, along with his youngest son James, provided testimony before a British parliamentary committee regarding phone hacking. In the UK, his media empire came under fire, as investigators probed reports of 2011 phone hacking.

On 14 July 2011 the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the House of Commons served a summons on Murdoch, his son James, and his former CEO Rebekah Brooks to testify before a committee five days later. After an initial refusal, the Murdochs confirmed they would attend, after the committee issued them a summons to Parliament. The day before the committee, the website of the News Corporation publication &quot;The Sun&quot; was hacked, and a false story was posted on the front page claiming that Murdoch had died. Murdoch described the day of the committee &quot;the most humble day of my life&quot;. He argued that since he ran a global business of 53,000 employees and that &quot;News of the World&quot; was &quot;just 1%&quot; of this, he was not ultimately responsible for what went on at the tabloid. He added that he had not considered resigning, and that he and the other top executives had been completely unaware of the hacking.

On 15 July, Murdoch attended a private meeting in London with the family of Milly Dowler, where he personally apologised for the hacking of their murdered daughter&#x27;s voicemail by a company he owns. On 16 and 17 July, News International published two full-page apologies in many of Britain&#x27;s national newspapers. The first apology took the form of a letter, signed by Murdoch, in which he said sorry for the &quot;serious wrongdoing&quot; that occurred. The second was titled &quot;Putting right what&#x27;s gone wrong&quot;, and gave more detail about the steps News International was taking to address the public&#x27;s concerns. In the wake of the allegations, Murdoch accepted the resignations of Brooks and Les Hinton, head of Dow Jones who was chairman of Murdoch&#x27;s British newspaper division when some of the abuses happened. They both deny any knowledge of any wrongdoing under their command.

On 27 February 2012, the day after the first issue of &quot;The Sun on Sunday&quot; was published, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Sue Akers informed the Leveson Inquiry that police are investigating a &quot;network of corrupt officials&quot; as part of their inquiries into phone hacking and police corruption. She said that evidence suggested a &quot;culture of illegal payments&quot; at &quot;The Sun&quot; and that these payments allegedly made by &quot;The Sun&quot; were authorised at a senior level.

In testimony on 25 April, Murdoch did not deny the quote attributed to him by his former editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Harold Evans: &quot;I give instructions to my editors all round the world, why shouldn&#x27;t I in London?&quot; On 1 May 2012, the Culture, Media and Sport Committee issued a report stating that Murdoch was &quot;not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company&quot;.

On 3 July 2013, the Exaro website and &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; broke the story of a secret recording. This was recorded by &quot;The Sun&quot; journalists, and in it Murdoch can be heard telling them that the whole investigation was one big fuss over nothing, and that he, or his successors, would take care of any journalists who went to prison. He said: &quot;Why are the police behaving in this way? It&#x27;s the biggest inquiry ever, over next to nothing.&quot;

== Activities in the United States ==

Murdoch made his first acquisition in the United States in 1973, when he purchased the &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;. In 1974, Murdoch moved to New York City, to expand into the US market; however, he retained interests in Australia and Britain. Soon afterwards, he founded &quot;Star&quot;, a supermarket tabloid, and in 1976, he purchased the &quot;New York Post&quot;. On 4 September 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only US citizens were permitted to own US television stations.

In March 1984, Marvin Davis sold Marc Rich&#x27;s interest in 20th Century Fox to Murdoch for $250 million due to Rich&#x27;s trade deals with Iran, which were sanctioned by the US at the time. Davis later backed out of a deal with Murdoch to purchase John Kluge&#x27;s Metromedia television stations. Rupert Murdoch bought the stations by himself, without Marvin Davis, and later bought out Davis&#x27;s remaining stake in Fox for $325 million. The six television stations owned by Metromedia formed the nucleus of the Fox Broadcasting Company, founded on 9 October 1986, which later had great success with programs including &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;.

In 1986, Murdoch bought Misty Mountain, a Wallace Neff designed house on Angelo Drive in Beverly Hills. The house was the former residence of Jules C. Stein. Murdoch sold the house to his son James in 2018.

In 1987, Murdoch created his global television special, the World Music Video Awards, a special music ceremony award where winners were chosen by viewers in eight countries. In Australia, during 1987, he bought The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd., the company that his father had once managed.
Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s 20th Century Fox bought out the remaining assets of Four Star Television from Ronald Perelman&#x27;s Compact Video in 1996. Most of Four Star Television&#x27;s library of programs are controlled by 20th Century Fox Television today. After Murdoch&#x27;s numerous buyouts during the buyout era of the eighties, News Corporation had built up financial debts of $7 billion (much from Sky TV in the UK), despite the many assets that were held by NewsCorp. The high levels of debt caused Murdoch to sell many of the American magazine interests he had acquired in the mid-1980s.

In 1993, Murdoch&#x27;s Fox Network took exclusive coverage of the National Football Conference (NFC) of the National Football League (NFL) from CBS and increased programming to seven days a week. In 1995, Fox became the object of scrutiny from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), when it was alleged that News Ltd.&#x27;s Australian base made Murdoch&#x27;s ownership of Fox illegal. However, the FCC ruled in Murdoch&#x27;s favour, stating that his ownership of Fox was in the best interests of the public. That same year, Murdoch announced a deal with MCI Communications to develop a major news website and magazine, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;. Also that year, News Corporation launched the Foxtel pay television network in Australia in partnership with Telstra. In 1996, Murdoch decided to enter the cable news market with the Fox News Channel, a 24-hour cable news station. Ratings studies released in 2009 showed that the network was responsible for nine of the top ten programs in the &quot;Cable News&quot; category at that time. Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner (founder and former owner of CNN) are long-standing rivals. In late 2003, Murdoch acquired a 34% stake in Hughes Electronics, the operator of the largest American satellite TV system, DirecTV, from General Motors for $6 billion (USD). His Fox movie studio had global hits with &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;Avatar&quot;.

In 2004, Murdoch announced that he was moving News Corporation headquarters from Adelaide, Australia to the United States. Choosing a US domicile was designed to ensure that American fund managers could purchase shares in the company, since many were deciding not to buy shares in non-US companies.
On 20 July 2005, News Corporation bought Intermix Media Inc., which held Myspace, Imagine Games Network and other social networking-themed websites, for US$580 million, making Murdoch a major player in online media concerns. In June 2011, it sold off Myspace for US$35 million. On 11 September 2005, News Corporation announced that it would buy IGN Entertainment for $650 million (USD).

In May 2007, Murdoch made a $5 billion offer to purchase Dow Jones &amp; Company. At the time, the Bancroft family, who had owned Dow Jones &amp; Company for 105 years and controlled 64% of the shares at the time, declined the offer. Later, the Bancroft family confirmed a willingness to consider a sale. Besides Murdoch, the Associated Press reported that supermarket magnate Ron Burkle and Internet entrepreneur Brad Greenspan were among the other interested parties. In 2007, Murdoch acquired Dow Jones &amp; Company, which gave him such publications as &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Barron&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; (based in Hong Kong) and &quot;SmartMoney&quot;.

In June 2014, Murdoch&#x27;s 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner&#x27;s board of directors turned down in July. Warner&#x27;s CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase. On 5 August 2014 the company announced it had withdrawn its offer for Time Warner, and said it would spend $6 billion buying back its own shares over the following 12 months.

Murdoch left his post as CEO of 21st Century Fox in 2015 but continued to own the company until it was purchased by Disney in 2019. A number of television broadcasting assets were spun off into the Fox Corporation before the acquisition and are still owned by Murdoch. This includes Fox News, of which Murdoch was acting CEO from 2016 until 2019, following the resignation of Roger Ailes due to accusations of sexual harassment.

Murdoch considered merging News Corp and Fox Corporation, but in January 2023 announced to the board that he had withdrawn the idea, stating the that he and his son Lachlan had &quot;determined that a combination [was] not optimal for shareholders of News Corp and FOX&quot; at that time. The Special Committee of the Board of Directors of News Corp that had been set up to investigate the matter was dissolved. In September 2023, Rupert Murdoch retired, and handed over the leadership of his businesses to his eldest son Lachlan.

=== Political activities in the United States ===
McKnight (2010) identifies four characteristics of his media operations: free market ideology; unified positions on matters of public policy; global editorial meetings; and opposition to liberal bias in other public media.

In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Ken Auletta writes that Murdoch&#x27;s support for Edward I. Koch while he was running for mayor of New York &quot;spilled over onto the news pages of the Post, with the paper regularly publishing glowing stories about Koch and sometimes savage accounts of his four primary opponents.&quot;

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Ronald Reagan&#x27;s campaign team credited Murdoch and the Post for his victory in New York in the 1980 United States presidential election. Reagan later &quot;waived a prohibition against owning a television station and a newspaper in the same market,&quot; allowing Murdoch to continue to control &quot;The New York Post&quot; and &quot;The Boston Herald&quot; while expanding into television.

On 8 May 2006, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Murdoch would be hosting a fund-raiser for Senator Hillary Clinton&#x27;s (D-New York) Senate re-election campaign. In a 2008 interview with Walt Mossberg, Murdoch was asked whether he had &quot;anything to do with the &quot;New York Post&quot;″s endorsement of Barack Obama in the democratic primaries&quot;. Without hesitating, Murdoch replied, &quot;Yeah. He is a rock star. It&#x27;s fantastic. I love what he is saying about education. I don&#x27;t think he will win Florida [...] but he will win in Ohio and the election. I am anxious to meet him. I want to see if he will walk the walk.&quot;

In 2010, News Corporation gave US$1 million to the Republican Governors Association and $1 million to the US Chamber of Commerce. Murdoch also served on the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute. Murdoch is also a supporter of the Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act.

Murdoch was reported in 2011 as advocating more open immigration policies in western nations generally. In the United States, Murdoch and chief executives from several major corporations, including Hewlett-Packard, Boeing and Disney joined New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg to form the Partnership for a New American Economy to advocate &quot;for immigration reform – including a path to legal status for all illegal aliens now in the United States&quot;. The coalition, reflecting Murdoch and Bloomberg&#x27;s own views, also advocates significant increases in legal immigration to the United States as a means of boosting America&#x27;s sluggish economy and lowering unemployment. The Partnership&#x27;s immigration policy prescriptions are notably similar to those of the Cato Institute and the US Chamber of Commerce — both of which Murdoch has supported in the past.

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial page has similarly advocated for increased legal immigration, in contrast to the staunch anti-immigration stance of Murdoch&#x27;s British newspaper, &quot;The Sun&quot;. On 5 September 2010, Murdoch testified before the House Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Membership on the &quot;Role of Immigration in Strengthening America&#x27;s Economy&quot;. In his testimony, Murdoch called for ending mass deportations and endorsed a &quot;comprehensive immigration reform&quot; plan that would include a pathway to citizenship for all illegal immigrants.

In the 2012 US presidential election, Murdoch was critical of the competence of Mitt Romney&#x27;s team but was nonetheless strongly supportive of a Republican victory, tweeting: &quot;Of course I want him [Romney] to win, save us from socialism, etc.&quot;

In October 2015, Murdoch stirred controversy when he praised Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson and referenced President Barack Obama, tweeting, &quot;Ben and Candy Carson terrific. What about a real black President who can properly address the racial divide? And much else.&quot; After which he apologised, tweeting, &quot;Apologies! No offence meant. Personally find both men charming.&quot;

During Donald Trump&#x27;s term as US President Murdoch showed support for him through the news stories broadcast in his media empire, including on Fox News. In early 2018, Mohammad bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, had an intimate dinner at Murdoch&#x27;s Bel Air estate in Los Angeles.

Murdoch is a strong supporter of Israel and its domestic policies. In October 2010, the Anti-Defamation League in New York City presented Murdoch with its International Leadership Award &quot;for his stalwart support of Israel and his commitment to promoting respect and speaking out against antisemitism&quot;. However, in April 2021, in a letter to Lachlan Murdoch, ADL director Jonathan Greenblatt wrote that it would no longer make such an award to his father. This was in the immediate context of accusations made by the ADL against Fox News presenter Tucker Carlson and his apparent espousal of the White replacement theory.

In 2023, during a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems against Fox News, Murdoch acknowledged that some Fox News commentators were endorsing election fraud claims they knew were false.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matza_2/27/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters_Robertson_2/27/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April 2023, Fox and Dominion settled for $787.5 million.

== Activities in Europe ==
Murdoch owns a controlling interest in Sky Italia, a satellite television provider in Italy. Murdoch&#x27;s business interests in Italy have been a source of contention since they began. In 2009 Murdoch won a media dispute with then Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. A judge ruled the then prime minister&#x27;s media arm Mediaset prevented News Corporation&#x27;s Italian unit, Sky Italia, from buying advertisements on its television networks.

== Activities in Asia ==
In November 1986, News Corporation purchased a 35% stake in the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; group for about . At that time, SCMP group was a stock-listed company, and was owned by HSBC, Hutchison Whampoa and Dow Jones &amp; Company. In December 1986, Dow Jones &amp; Company offered News Corporation to sell about 19% of share it owned of SCMP for , and, by 1987, News Corporation completed the full takeover. In September 1993, News Corporation have agreed to sell a 34.9% share in SCMP to Robert Kuok&#x27;s Kerry Media for . In 1994, News Corporation sold the remaining 15.1% share in SCMP to MUI Group, disposing the Hong Kong newspaper.

In June 1993, News Corporation attempted to acquire a 22% share in TVB, a terrestrial television broadcaster in Hong Kong, for about $237million, but Murdoch&#x27;s company gave up, as the Hong Kong government would not relax the regulation regarding foreign ownership of broadcasting companies.

In 1993, News Corporation acquired Star TV (renamed as Star in 2001), a Hong Kong company headed by Richard Li, from Hutchison Whampoa for $1 billion (Souchou, 2000:28), and subsequently set up offices for it throughout Asia. The deal enabled News International to broadcast from Hong Kong to India, China, Japan, and over thirty other countries in Asia, becoming one of the biggest satellite television networks in the east; however, the deal did not work out as Murdoch had planned because the Chinese government placed restrictions on it that prevented it from reaching most of China.

In 2009, News Corporation reorganised Star; a few of these arrangements were that the original company&#x27;s operations in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Middle East were integrated into Fox International Channels, and Star India was spun-off (but still within News Corporation).

==Succession court case (2024)==

, the whole Murdoch family is involved in a court case in Reno, Nevada, in which James, his sister Elisabeth and half-sister Prudence are challenging their father&#x27;s bid to amend the family trust to ensure that his eldest son, Lachlan, retains control of News Corp and Fox Corp, rather than benefiting all of his six children, as is specified in the &quot;irrevocable&quot; terms of the trust. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Murdoch Snr wants his companies to remain politically conservative, and sees his other children as too politically liberal. 

The irrevocable family trust was set up after Rupert and Anna Murdoch&#x27;s divorce in 1999, to hold the family&#x27;s 28.5% stake in News Corp. It relates only to the children born before then, giving them equal say in the fate of the business after Rupert&#x27;s death. Chloe and Grace Murdoch, Rupert&#x27;s children with third wife Wendi Deng, will have no say in the business, although will share the stock proceeds. The case follows Rupert&#x27;s attempt to change the trust in 2023, and the Nevada probate commissioner&#x27;s finding that he was allowed to amend the trust &quot;if he is able to show he is acting in good faith and for the sole benefit of his heirs&quot;. Rupert Murdoch is arguing interference by the other siblings would cause a financial loss to Fox, and therefore &quot;in their own best interests if they have their votes taken away from them&quot;. He argues that preserving the outlet&#x27;s conservative editorial stance against interference by the more politically moderate siblings would better protect its commercial value.

The case has led to the three children becoming estranged from their father, with none of them attending his wedding to his fifth wife, Elena Zhukova, in June 2024.

== Personal life ==

=== Residence ===
In 2003, Murdoch bought &quot;Rosehearty&quot;, an 11 bedroom home on a 5-acre waterfront estate in Centre Island, New York. In May 2013, he purchased the Moraga Estate, an estate, vineyard and winery in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California. In 2019, Murdoch and his new wife Jerry Hall purchased Holmwood, an 18th-century house and estate in the English village of Binfield Heath, some north-east of Reading.

In late 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was reported that Murdoch and Hall had been isolating in their Binfield Heath home for much of the year. He received his first COVID-19 vaccine in nearby Henley-on-Thames on 16 December.

=== Marriages ===

In 1956, Murdoch married Patricia Booker, a former shop assistant and flight attendant from Melbourne; the couple had their only child, Prudence, in 1958. They divorced in 1967.

In 1967, Murdoch married Anna Torv, a Scottish-born cadet journalist working for his Sydney newspaper &quot;The Daily Mirror&quot;. In January 1998, three months before the announcement of his separation from Anna, a Roman Catholic, Murdoch was made a Knight Commander of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great (KSG), a papal honour awarded by Pope John Paul II. While Murdoch would often attend Mass with Torv, he never converted to Catholicism. Torv and Murdoch had three children: Elisabeth Murdoch (born in Sydney, Australia on 22 August 1968), Lachlan Murdoch (born in London, UK on 8 September 1971), and James Murdoch, (born in London on 13 December 1972). Murdoch&#x27;s companies published two novels by his wife: &quot;Family Business&quot; (1988) and &quot;Coming to Terms&quot; (1991). They divorced in June 1999. Anna Murdoch received a settlement of US$1.2 billion in assets.

On 25 June 1999, 17 days after divorcing his second wife, Murdoch, then aged 68, married Chinese-born Wendi Deng. She was 30, a recent Yale School of Management graduate, and a newly appointed vice-president of his STAR TV. Murdoch had two daughters with her: Grace (born 2001) and Chloe (born 2003). Murdoch has six children, and is grandfather to thirteen grandchildren. Near the end of his marriage to Wendi, hearsay concerning a link with Chinese intelligence (which was later proven to be unfounded) became problematic to their relationship. On 13 June 2013, a News Corporation spokesperson confirmed that Murdoch filed for divorce from Deng in New York City, US. According to the spokesman, the marriage had been irretrievably broken for more than six months. Murdoch also ended his long-standing friendship with Tony Blair after suspecting him of having an affair with Deng while they were still married.
On 11 January 2016, Murdoch announced his engagement to former model Jerry Hall in a notice in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper. On 4 March 2016, Murdoch, a week short of his 85th birthday, and 59-year-old Hall were married in London, at St Bride&#x27;s, Fleet Street with a reception at Spencer House; this was Murdoch&#x27;s fourth marriage. In June 2022, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Murdoch and Hall were set to divorce, citing two anonymous sources. Hall filed for divorce on 1 July 2022 citing irreconcilable differences; the divorce was finalised in August 2022.

During Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations in 2023, Murdoch, who is quarter Irish, proposed to his partner, Ann Lesley Smith. The engaged couple first met at an event in September 2022. In April 2023, two weeks after the couple were engaged, Murdoch suddenly called off the engagement. The split was said to be caused by Murdoch&#x27;s discomfort with Smith&#x27;s religious views and her infatuation with Fox News host Tucker Carlson, reportedly referring to him as &quot;a messenger from God&quot;. Carlson was fired from Fox News three weeks later.

Murdoch became engaged again in March 2024, to retired Russian molecular biologist Elena Zhukova, who is also the ex-wife of Russian businessman Alexander Zhukov. Their wedding was held in June 2024 at Murdoch&#x27;s estate in California. Murdoch was 93 and Zhukova 67 years old. Through the marriage he became stepfather to Dasha Zhukova, ex-wife of Roman Abramovich.

=== Children ===
Murdoch has six children. His eldest child, Prudence MacLeod, was appointed on 28 January 2011 to the board of Times Newspapers Ltd, part of News International, which publishes &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. Murdoch&#x27;s elder son Lachlan, formerly the Deputy Chief Operating Officer at the News Corporation and publisher of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, was Murdoch&#x27;s heir apparent before resigning from his executive posts at the global media company at the end of July 2005. Lachlan&#x27;s departure left James Murdoch, Chief Executive of the satellite television service British Sky Broadcasting since November 2003 as the only Murdoch son still directly involved with the company&#x27;s operations, though Lachlan has agreed to remain on the News Corporation&#x27;s board.

After graduating from Vassar College and marrying classmate Elkin Kwesi Pianim (the son of Ghanaian financial and political mogul Kwame Pianim) in 1993, Murdoch&#x27;s daughter Elisabeth and her husband purchased a pair of NBC-affiliate television stations in California, KSBW and KSBY, with a $35 million loan provided by her father. By quickly re-organising and re-selling them at a $12 million profit in 1995, Elisabeth emerged as an unexpected rival to her brothers for the eventual leadership of the publishing dynasty. But, after divorcing Pianim in 1998 and quarrelling publicly with her assigned mentor Sam Chisholm at BSkyB, she struck out on her own as a television and film producer in London. She has since enjoyed independent success, in conjunction with her second husband, Matthew Freud, the great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, whom she met in 1997 and married in 2001.

Until September 2023, it was not known how long Murdoch would remain as News Corporation&#x27;s CEO. For a while the American cable television entrepreneur John Malone was the second-largest voting shareholder in News Corporation after Murdoch himself, potentially undermining the family&#x27;s control. In 2007, the company announced that it would sell certain assets and give cash to Malone&#x27;s company in exchange for its stock. In 2007, the company issued Murdoch&#x27;s older children voting stock.

Murdoch has two children with Wendi Deng: Grace (b. New York, November 2001) and Chloe (b. New York, July 2003). It was revealed in September 2011 that Tony Blair is Grace&#x27;s godfather. There is reported to be tension between Murdoch and his oldest children over the terms of a trust holding the family&#x27;s 28.5% stake in News Corporation, estimated in 2005 to be worth about $6.1 billion. Under the trust, his children by Wendi Deng share in the proceeds of the stock but have no voting privileges or control of the stock. Voting rights in the stock are divided 50/50 between Murdoch on the one side and his children of his first two marriages. Murdoch&#x27;s voting privileges are not transferable but will expire upon his death and the stock will then be controlled solely by his children from the prior marriages, although their half-siblings will continue to derive their share of income from it. It is Murdoch&#x27;s stated desire to have his children by Deng given a measure of control over the stock proportional to their financial interest in it. It does not appear that he has any strong legal grounds to contest the present arrangement, and both ex-wife Anna and their three children are said to be strongly resistant to any such change.

== In the arts and media ==
===Film and television===
In 1999, the Ted Turner-owned TBS channel aired an original sitcom, &quot;The Chimp Channel&quot;. This featured an all-simian cast and the role of an Australian TV veteran named Harry Waller. The character is described as &quot;a self-made gazillionaire with business interests in all sorts of fields. He owns newspapers, hotel chains, sports franchises and genetic technologies, as well as everyone&#x27;s favourite cable TV channel, The Chimp Channel&quot;. Waller is thought to be a parody of Murdoch, a long-time rival of Turner.

In 2004, the movie &quot;&quot; included many interviews accusing Fox News of pressuring reporters to report only one side of news stories, in order to influence viewers&#x27; political opinions.

In 2012, the satirical telemovie &quot;Hacks&quot; broadcast on the UK&#x27;s Channel 4, made obvious comparisons with Murdoch using the fictional character &quot;Stanhope Feast&quot;, portrayed by Michael Kitchen, as well as other central figures in the phone hacking scandal.

The 2013 film &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; features an Australian character inspired by Rupert Murdoch who owns a cable news television channel.

Murdoch was part of the inspiration for Logan Roy, the protagonist of TV show &quot;Succession&quot; (2018–2023), who is portrayed by Brian Cox.

Murdoch has also been played by the following people in films and TV series:
* Barry Humphries in the TV mini-series &quot;Selling Hitler&quot; (1991)
* Hugh Laurie in a parody of &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot; in the TV show &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot; (1990s)
* Paul Elder in the telemovie &quot;The Late Shift&quot; (1996)
* Ben Mendelsohn in the film &quot;Black and White&quot; (2002)
* Himself on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, first in &quot;Sunday, Cruddy Sunday&quot; and later in &quot;Judge Me Tender&quot; (2010)
* Patrick Brammall in the TV mini-series &quot;Power Games: The Packer–Murdoch War&quot; (2013)
* Ben Miller in two UK comedy TV series: &quot;Tracey Ullman&#x27;s Show&quot; (2016) and &quot;Tracey Breaks the News&quot; (2017)
* Simon McBurney in the mini-series &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot; (2019)
* Malcolm McDowell in &quot;Bombshell&quot; (2019)

===Books===
Murdoch and rival newspaper and publishing magnate Robert Maxwell are thinly fictionalised as &quot;Keith Townsend&quot; and &quot;Richard Armstrong&quot; in &quot;The Fourth Estate&quot; (1996) by British novelist and former MP Jeffrey Archer.

In the novel &quot;Dunbar&quot; (2017) by Edward St Aubyn the eponymous lead character is at least partly inspired by Murdoch.

&quot;Young Rupert: The Making of the Murdoch Empire&quot; (2023), by Walter Marsh, has been praised for the high quality of its research. It focuses on Murdoch as a child and young man, in particular his early career at &quot;The News&quot; in Adelaide and his relationship with the editor-in-chief Rohan Rivett. Several commenters on the book remarked on Murdoch&#x27;s embrace of socialism in his early years.

===Music===
Towards the end of his touring career, Eagles drummer and lead singer Don Henley would often dedicate his 1982 hit &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot; to Murdoch and Bill O&#x27;Reilly.

Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard wrote the track &quot;Evilest Man&quot; about Murdoch, for their 2022 album &quot;Omnium Gatherum&quot;.

== Influence, wealth, and reputation ==
===Forbes rankings===
In 2014, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s wealth at USD 13.7 billion.

In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked &quot;Rupert Murdoch &amp; Family&quot; as the 35th most powerful person in the world.

According to &quot;Forbes&#x27;&quot; 2017 real-time list of world&#x27;s billionaires, Murdoch was the 34th richest person in the US and the 96th richest person in the world, with a net worth of US$13.1 billion 

In 2019, the Murdoch family were ranked 52nd in the &quot;Forbes&quot;″ annual list of the world&#x27;s billionaires.

As per Forbes list of The Richest People In The World, dated 8 March 2024, Murdoch and family were ranked #100 with a net worth of $19.5 Billion.

===Other assessments and investigations===
In August 2013, Terry Flew, Professor of Media and Communications at Queensland University of Technology, wrote an article for the &quot;Conversation&quot; publication in which he investigated a claim by former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd that Murdoch owned 70% of Australian newspapers in 2011. Flew&#x27;s article showed that News Corp Australia owned 23% of the nation&#x27;s newspapers in 2011, according to the Finkelstein Review of Media and Media Regulation, but, at the time of the article, the corporation&#x27;s titles accounted for 59% of the sales of all daily newspapers, with weekly sales of 17.3 million copies.

In connection with Murdoch&#x27;s testimony to the Leveson Inquiry &quot;into the ethics of the British press&quot;, editor of &quot;Newsweek International&quot;, Tunku Varadarajan, referred to him as &quot;the man whose name is synonymous with unethical newspapers&quot;.

News Corp papers were accused of supporting the campaign of the Australian Liberal government and influencing public opinion during the 2013 federal election. Following the announcement of the Liberal Party victory at the polls, Murdoch tweeted &quot;Aust. election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy. Other nations to follow in time.&quot;

In November 2015, former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott said that Murdoch &quot;arguably has had more impact on the wider world than any other living Australian&quot;.

In late 2015, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; journalist John Carreyrou began a series of investigative articles on Theranos, the blood-testing start-up founded by Elizabeth Holmes, that questioned its claim to be able to run a wide range of lab tests from a tiny sample of blood from a finger prick. Holmes had turned to Murdoch, whose media empire includes Carreyrou&#x27;s employer, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, to kill the story. Murdoch, who became the biggest investor in Theranos in 2015 as a result of his $125 million injection, refused the request from Holmes saying that &quot;he trusted the paper&#x27;s editors to handle the matter fairly.&quot;

In November 2021, Murdoch accused, without providing evidence, Google and Facebook of stifling conservative viewpoints on its platforms, and called for &quot;substantial reform&quot; and openness in the digital ad supply chain.

<doc id="26092" wikidata="Q574456" url="?curid=26092" title="Historical negationism">
<text>Historical negationism, also called historical denialism, is falsification or distortion of the historical record. This is not the same as &quot;historical revisionism&quot;, a broader term that extends to newly evidenced, fairly reasoned academic reinterpretations of history. In attempting to revise and influence the past, historical negationism acts as illegitimate historical revisionism by using techniques inadmissible in proper historical discourse, such as presenting known forged documents as genuine, inventing ingenious but implausible reasons for distrusting genuine documents, attributing conclusions to books and sources that report the opposite, manipulating statistical series to support the given point of view, and deliberately mistranslating traditional or modern texts.

Some countries, such as Germany, have criminalized the negationist revision of certain historical events, while others take a more cautious position for various reasons, such as protection of free speech. Others have in the past mandated negationist views, such as the US state of California, where it is claimed that some schoolchildren have been explicitly prevented from learning about the California genocide. Notable examples of negationism include denials of the Holocaust, Nakba, Holodomor, Armenian genocide, the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, and the clean &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; myth. In literature, it has been imaginatively depicted in some works of fiction, such as &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, by George Orwell. In modern times, negationism may spread via political, religious agendas through state media, mainstream media, and new media, such as the Internet.
==Origin of the term==
The term &quot;negationism&quot; (&quot;négationnisme&quot;) was first coined by the French historian Henry Rousso in his 1987 book &quot;The Vichy Syndrome&quot; which looked at the French popular memory of Vichy France and the French Resistance. Rousso posited that it was necessary to distinguish between legitimate historical revisionism in Holocaust studies and politically motivated denial of the Holocaust, which he termed negationism.

==Purposes==
Usually, the purpose of historical negation is to achieve a national, political aim, by transferring war guilt, demonizing an enemy, providing an illusion of victory, or preserving a friendship.

===Ideological influence===

The principal functions of negationist history are the abilities to control ideological and political influence.

History is a social resource that contributes to shaping national identity, culture, and the public memory. Through the study of history, people are imbued with a particular cultural identity; therefore, by negatively revising history, the negationist can craft a specific, ideological identity. Because historians are credited as people who single-mindedly pursue truth, by way of fact, negationist historians capitalize on the historian&#x27;s professional credibility, and present their pseudohistory as true scholarship. By adding a measure of credibility to the work of revised history, the ideas of the negationist historian are more readily accepted in the public mind. As such, professional historians recognize the revisionist practice of historical negationism as the work of &quot;truth-seekers&quot; finding different truths in the historical record to fit their political, social, and ideological contexts.

===Political influence===
History provides insight into past political policies and consequences, and thus assists people in extrapolating political implications for contemporary society. Historical negationism is applied to cultivate a specific political myth, sometimes with official consent from the government, whereby self-taught, amateur, and dissident academic historians either manipulate or misrepresent historical accounts to achieve political ends. For example, after the late 1930s in the Soviet Union, the ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and historiography in the Soviet Union treated reality and the party line as the same intellectual entity, especially in regards to the Russian Civil War and peasant rebellions; Soviet historical negationism advanced a specific, political, and ideological agenda about Russia and its place in world history.

==Techniques==

Historical negationism applies the techniques of research, quotation, and presentation for deception of the reader and denial of the historical record. In support of the &quot;revised history&quot; perspective, the negationist historian uses false documents as genuine sources, presents specious reasons to distrust genuine documents, exploits published opinions by quoting out of historical context, manipulates statistics, and mistranslates texts in other languages. The revision techniques of historical negationism operate in the intellectual space of public debate for the advancement of a given interpretation of history and the cultural perspective of the &quot;revised history&quot;. As a document, the revised history is used to negate the validity of the factual, documentary record, and so reframe explanations and perceptions of the discussed historical event, to deceive the reader, the listener, and the viewer; therefore, historical negationism functions as a technique of propaganda. Rather than submit their works for peer review, negationist historians rewrite history and use logical fallacies to construct arguments that will obtain the desired results, a &quot;revised history&quot; that supports an agenda – political, ideological, religious, etc.

In the practice of historiography, the British historian Richard J. Evans describes the technical differences, between professional historians and negationist historians, commenting: &quot;Reputable and professional historians do not suppress parts of quotations from documents that go against their own case, but take them into account, and, if necessary, amend their own case, accordingly. They do not present, as genuine, documents which they know to be forged, just because these forgeries happen to back up what they are saying. They do not invent ingenious, but implausible, and utterly unsupported reasons for distrusting genuine documents, because these documents run counter to their arguments; again, they amend their arguments, if this is the case, or, indeed, abandon them altogether. They do not consciously attribute their own conclusions to books and other sources, which, in fact, on closer inspection, actually say the opposite. They do not eagerly seek out the highest possible figures in a series of statistics, independently of their reliability, or otherwise, simply because they want, for whatever reason, to maximize the figure in question, but rather, they assess all the available figures, as impartially as possible, to arrive at a number that will withstand the critical scrutiny of others. They do not knowingly mistranslate sources in foreign languages to make them more serviceable to themselves. They do not willfully invent words, phrases, quotations, incidents and events, for which there is no historical evidence, to make their arguments more plausible.&quot;

===Deception===

Deception includes falsifying information, obscuring the truth, and lying to manipulate public opinion about the historical event discussed in the revised history. The negationist historian applies the techniques of deception to achieve either a political or an ideological goal, or both. The field of history distinguishes among history books based upon credible, verifiable sources, which were peer-reviewed before publication; and deceptive history books, based upon unreliable sources, which were not submitted for peer review. The distinction among types of history books rests upon the research techniques used in writing a history. Verifiability, accuracy, and openness to criticism are central tenets of historical scholarship. When these techniques are sidestepped, the presented historical information might be deliberately deceptive, a &quot;revised history&quot;.

===Denial===
Denial is defensively protecting information from being shared with other historians, and claiming that facts are untrue, especially denial of the war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated in the course of the World War II (1939–1945) and the Holocaust (1933–1945). The negationist historian protects the historical-revisionism project by blame shifting, censorship, distraction, and media manipulation; occasionally, denial by protection includes risk management for the physical security of revisionist sources.

===Relativization and trivialization===

Comparing certain historical atrocities to other crimes is the practice of relativization, interpretation by moral judgements, to alter public perception of the first historical atrocity. Although such comparisons often occur in negationist history, their pronouncement is not usually part of revisionist intentions upon the historical facts, but an opinion of moral judgement.
* The Holocaust and Nazism: The historian Deborah Lipstadt says that the concept of &quot;comparable Allied wrongs&quot;, such as the expulsion of Germans after World War II from Nazi-colonized lands and the formal Allied war crimes, is at the centre of, and is a continually repeated theme of, contemporary Holocaust denial, and that such relativization presents &quot;immoral equivalencies&quot;.
* Some proponents of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy use certain historical examples of non-chattel slavery in discussions on the role of the slave system of the South, however insofar as it is to further this ideological point it obscures and downplays the specificities of the American slave system- both its place in history, and comparison to other such systems overall. For example, court decisions and statutes mandated multi-generational slavery unlike many other slave systems, and further beyond that stated that a freedman could never become a citizen of the United States. These measures, related to perpetuation and racist characterization besides further restrictions on life even outside slavery in support of it distinguished the system compared to all, or an overwhelming amount of historical systems
* Connected to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy is the Irish slaves myth, a pseudo-historical narrative which conflates the experiences of Irish indentured servants and enslaved Africans in the Americas. This distortion, which was historically promoted by Irish nationalists such as John Mitchel, has in the modern-day been promoted by white supremacists in the United States to negate the mistreatment experienced by African Americans (such as racism and segregation), also opposing slavery reparations.

==Examples==
===Book burning===

Repositories of literature have been targeted throughout history (e.g., the Grand Library of Baghdad, the burning of liturgical and historical books of the St. Thomas Christians by the archbishop of Goa Aleixo de Menezes) including recently, such as the 1981 Burning of Jaffna library and the destruction of Iraqi libraries by ISIS during the fall of Mosul in 2014. Similarly, British officials destroyed documents in Operation Legacy to avoid records on colonial rule falling into the hands of countries declaring independence from Britain and any scrutiny of the British state.

====Chinese book burning====

The &quot;Burning of books and burying of scholars&quot; (), or &quot;Fires of Qin&quot;, refers to the burning of writings and slaughter of scholars during the Qin dynasty of ancient China, between the period of 213 and 210 BC. &quot;Books&quot; at this point refers to writings on bamboo strips, which were then bound together. The exact extent of the damage is hard to assess; technological books were to be spared and even the &quot;objectionable&quot; books, poetry and philosophy in particular, were preserved in imperial archives and allowed to be kept by the official scholar.

===United States history===

====Confederate revisionism====
The historical negationism of American Civil War revisionists and Neo-Confederates claims that the Confederate States (1861–1865) were the defenders rather than the instigators of the American Civil War, and that the Confederacy&#x27;s motivation for secession from the United States was the maintenance of the Southern states&#x27; rights and limited government, rather than the preservation and expansion of chattel slavery.

Regarding Neo-Confederate revisionism of the U.S. Civil War, the historian Brooks D. Simpson says: &quot;This is an active attempt to reshape historical memory, an effort by white Southerners to find historical justifications for present-day actions. The neo–Confederate movement&#x27;s ideologues have grasped that if they control how people remember the past, they&#x27;ll control how people approach the present and the future. Ultimately, this is a very conscious war for memory and heritage. It&#x27;s a quest for , the eternal quest for justification.&quot;

In the early 20th century, Mildred Rutherford, the historian general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), led the attack against American history textbooks that did not present the &quot;Lost Cause of the Confederacy&quot; version of the history of the U.S. Civil War. To that pedagogical end, Rutherford assembled a &quot;massive collection&quot; of documents that included &quot;essay contests on the glory of the Ku Klux Klan and personal tributes to faithful slaves&quot;. About the historical negationism of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, the historian David Blight says: &quot;All UDC members and leaders were not as virulently racist as Rutherford, but all, in the name of a reconciled nation, participated in an enterprise that deeply influenced the white supremacist vision of Civil War memory.&quot;
====California genocide====
Between 1846 and 1873, following the conquest of California by the United States, the region&#x27;s Indigenous Californian population plummeted from around 150,000 to around 30,000 due to disease, famine, forced removals, slavery, and massacres. Many historians refer to the massacres as the California genocide. Between 9,500 and 16,000 California Natives were killed by both government forces and white settlers in massacres during this period. Despite the well documented evidence of the widespread massacres and atrocities, the public school curriculum and history textbooks approved by the California Department of Education ignore the history of this genocide.

According to author Clifford Trafzer, although many historians have pushed for recognition of the genocide in public school curricula, government-approved textbooks omit mention of the genocide because of the dominance of conservative publishing companies with an ideological impetus to deny the genocide, the fear of publishing companies being branded as un-American for discussing it, and the unwillingness of state and federal government officials to acknowledge the genocide due to the possibility of having to pay reparations to indigenous communities affected by it.
===War crimes===

====Japanese war crimes====
The post-war minimization of the war crimes of Japanese imperialism is an example of &quot;illegitimate&quot; historical revisionism; some contemporary Japanese revisionists, such as Yūko Iwanami (granddaughter of General Hideki Tojo), propose that Japan&#x27;s invasion of China, and World War II, itself, were justified reactions to the Western imperialism of the time. On 2 March 2007, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe denied that the military had forced women into sexual slavery during the war, saying, &quot;The fact is, there is no evidence to prove there was coercion&quot;. Before he spoke, some Liberal Democratic Party legislators also sought to revise Yōhei Kōno&#x27;s apology to former comfort women in 1993; likewise, there was the controversial negation of the six-week Nanking Massacre in 1937–1938.

Shinzō Abe was general secretary of a group of parliament members concerned with history education () that is associated with the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, and was a special advisor to Nippon Kaigi, which are two openly revisionist groups denying, downplaying, or justifying various Japanese war crimes. Editor-in-chief of the conservative &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; Tsuneo Watanabe criticized the Yasukuni Shrine as a bastion of revisionism: &quot;The Yasukuni Shrine runs a museum where they show items in order to encourage and worship militarism. It&#x27;s wrong for the prime minister to visit such a place&quot;. Other critics note that men, who would contemporarily be perceived as &quot;Korean&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot;, are enshrined for the military actions they effected as Japanese Imperial subjects.

====Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings====
The &quot;Hibakusha&quot; (&quot;explosion-affected people&quot;) of Hiroshima and Nagasaki seek compensation from their government and criticize it for failing to &quot;accept responsibility for having instigated and then prolonged an aggressive war long after Japan&#x27;s defeat was apparent, resulting in a heavy toll in Japanese, Asian and American lives&quot;. EB Sledge expressed concern that such revisionism, in his words &quot;mellowing&quot;, would allow the harsh facts of the history that led to the bombings to be forgotten. Historians Hill and Koshiro have stated that attempts to minimize the importance of the bombings as &quot;righteous revenge and salvation&quot; would be revisionism, and that while the Japanese should recognize their atrocities led the bombing, Americans also have to accept the fact that their own actions &quot;caused massive destruction and suffering that has lasted for fifty years&quot;.

====Croatian war crimes in World War II====
Some Croats, including some high-ranked officials and political leaders during the 1990s and far-right organization members, have attempted to minimize the magnitude of the genocide perpetrated against Serbs and other ethnic minorities in the World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany, the Independent State of Croatia. By 1989, the future President of Croatia Franjo Tuđman (who had been a Partisan during World War II), had embraced Croatian nationalism and published &quot;Horrors of War: Historical Reality and Philosophy&quot;, in which he questioned the official number of victims killed by the Ustaše during the Second World War, particularly at the Jasenovac concentration camp. Yugoslav and Serbian historiography had long exaggerated the number of victims at the camp. Tuđman criticized the long-standing figures, but also described the camp as a &quot;work camp&quot;, giving an estimate of between 30,000 and 40,000 deaths. Tuđman&#x27;s government&#x27;s toleration of Ustaša symbols and their crimes often dismissed in public, frequently strained relations with Israel.

Croatia&#x27;s far-right often advocates the false theory that Jasenovac was a &quot;labour camp&quot; where mass murder did not take place. In 2017, two videos of former Croatian president Stjepan Mesić from 1992 were made public in which he stated that Jasenovac was not a death camp. The far-right NGO &quot;The Society for Research of the Threefold Jasenovac Camp&quot; also advocates this disproven theory, in addition to claiming that the camp was used by the Yugoslav authorities following the war to imprison Ustasha members and regular Home Guard army troops until 1948, then alleged Stalinists until 1951. Its members include journalist Igor Vukić, who wrote his own book advocating the theory, Catholic priest Stjepan Razum and academic Josip Pečarić. The ideas promoted by its members have been amplified by mainstream media interviews and book tours. The last book, &quot;The Jasenovac Lie Revealed&quot; written by Vukić, prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to urge Croatian authorities to ban such works, noting that they &quot;would immediately be banned in Germany and Austria and rightfully so&quot;. In 2016, Croatian filmmaker Jakov Sedlar released a documentary &quot;Jasenovac – The Truth&quot; which advocated the same theories, labelling the camp as a &quot;collection and labour camp&quot;. The film contained alleged falsifications and forgeries, in addition to denial of crimes and hate speech towards politicians and journalists.

====Serbian war crimes in World War II====

Among far-right and nationalist groups, denial and revisionism of Serbian war crimes are carried out through the downplaying of Milan Nedić and Dimitrije Ljotić&#x27;s roles in the extermination of Serbia&#x27;s Jews in concentration camps, in the German-occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia by a number of Serbian historians. Serbian collaborationist armed forces were involved, either directly or indirectly, in the mass killings of Jews as well as Roma and those Serbs who sided with any anti-German resistance and the killing of many Croats and Muslims. Since the end of the war, Serbian collaboration in the Holocaust has been the subject of historical revisionism by Serbian leaders. In 1993, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts listed Nedić among &quot;The 100 most prominent Serbs&quot;. There is also the denial of Chetnik collaboration with Axis forces and crimes committed during World War II. Serbian historian Jelena Djureinovic states in her book &quot;The Politics of Memory of the Second World War in Contemporary Serbia: Collaboration, Resistance and Retribution&quot; that &quot;during those years, the WWII nationalist Chetniks have been recast as an anti-fascist movement equivalent to Tito&#x27;s Partisans, and as victims of communism&quot;. The glorification of the Chetnik movement has now become the central theme of Serbia&#x27;s WWII memory politics. Chetnik leaders convicted under communist rule of collaboration with the Nazis have been rehabilitated by Serbian courts, and television programmes have contributed to spreading a positive image of the movement, &quot;distorting the real picture of what happened during WWII&quot;.

====Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars====

There have been a number of far-right and nationalist authors and political activists who have publicly disagreed with mainstream views of Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav wars of 1991–1999. Some high-ranked Serbian officials and political leaders who categorically claimed that no genocide against Bosnian Muslims took place at all, include former president of Serbia Tomislav Nikolić, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, Serbian Minister of Defence Aleksandar Vulin and Serbian far-right leader Vojislav Šešelj. Among the points of contention are whether the victims of massacres such as the Račak massacre and Srebrenica massacre were unarmed civilians or armed resistance fighters, whether death and rape tolls were inflated, and whether prison camps such as Sremska Mitrovica camp were sites of mass war crimes. These authors are called &quot;revisionists&quot; by scholars and organizations, such as ICTY.

The &quot;Report about Case Srebrenica&quot; by Darko Trifunovic, commissioned by the government of the Republika Srpska, was described by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia as &quot;one of the worst examples of revisionism in relation to the mass executions of Bosnian Muslims committed in Srebrenica in July 1995&quot;. Outrage and condemnation by a wide variety of Balkan and international figures eventually forced the Republika Srpska to disown the report. In 2017 legislation that banned the teaching of the Srebrenica genocide and Sarajevo siege in schools was introduced in Republika Srpska, initiated by President Milorad Dodik and his SNSD party, who stated that it was &quot;impossible to use here the textbooks ... which say the Serbs have committed genocide and kept Sarajevo under siege. This is not correct and this will not be taught here&quot;. In 2019 Republika Srpska authorities appointed Israeli historian Gideon Greif – who has worked at Yad Vashem for more than three decades – to head its own revisionist commission to &quot;determine the truth&quot; about Srebrenica.

====Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia====
The issue of the Volyn massacres was largely non-existent in Ukrainian scholarly literature for many years, and until very recently, Ukrainian historiography did not undertake any objective research of the events in Volyn. Until 1991 any independent Ukrainian historic research was only possible abroad, mainly in the US and the Canadian diaspora. Despite publishing a number of works devoted to the history of UPA, the Ukrainian emigration researchers (with only few exceptions) remained completely mute about the Volyn events for many years. Until very recently much of the remaining documentation was closed in Ukrainian state archives, unavailable to researchers. As a result, Ukrainian historiography lacks broader reliable research of the events and the presence of the issue in Ukrainian publications is still very limited. The young generation of Ukrainian historians is often infected with Ukrainocentrism, and often borrows the stereotypes and myths about Poland and Poles from the biased publications of the Ukrainian diaspora.

In September 2016, after Poland&#x27;s Sejm had passed a resolution declaring 11 July a National Day of Remembrance of the victims of the Genocide of the Citizens of the Polish Republic committed by Ukrainian Nationalists and formally called the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia a genocide, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine passed a resolution condemning &quot;the one-sided political assessment of the historical events in Poland&quot;, rejecting the term &quot;genocide&quot;.

==== Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66 ====

Discussion of the killings was taboo in Indonesia and, if mentioned at all, usually called &quot;peristiwa enam lima&quot;, the incident of &#x27;65. Inside and outside Indonesia, public discussion of the killings increased during the 1990s and especially after 1998 when the New Order government collapsed. Jailed and exiled members of the Sukarno regime, as well as ordinary people, told their stories in increasing numbers. Foreign researchers began to publish increasingly more on the topic, with the end of the military regime and its doctrine of coercing such research attempts into futility.

The killings are skipped over in most Indonesian histories and have been scarcely examined by Indonesians, and has received comparatively little international attention. Indonesian textbooks typically depict the killings as a &quot;patriotic campaign&quot; that resulted in less than 80,000 deaths. In 2004, the textbooks were briefly changed to include the events, but this new curriculum discontinued in 2006 following protests from the military and Islamic groups. The textbooks which mentioned the mass killings were subsequently burnt by order of Indonesia&#x27;s Attorney General. John Roosa&#x27;s &quot;Pretext for Mass Murder&quot; (2006) was initially banned by the Attorney General&#x27;s Office. The Indonesian parliament set up a truth and reconciliation commission to analyse the killings, but it was suspended by the Indonesian High Court. An academic conference regarding the killings was held in Singapore in 2009. A hesitant search for mass graves by survivors and family members began after 1998, although little has been found. Over three decades later, great enmity remains in Indonesian society over the events.

====Turkey and the Armenian genocide====

Turkish laws such as Article 301, that state &quot;a person who publicly insults Turkishness, or the Republic or [the] Turkish Grand National Assembly of Turkey, shall be punishable by imprisonment&quot;, were used to criminally charge the writer Orhan Pamuk with disrespecting Turkey, for saying that &quot;Thirty thousand Kurds, and a million Armenians, were killed in these lands, and nobody, but me, dares to talk about it&quot;. The controversy occurred as Turkey was first vying for membership in the European Union (EU) where the suppression of dissenters is looked down upon. Article 301 originally was part of penal-law reforms meant to modernize Turkey to European Union standards, as part of negotiating Turkey&#x27;s accession to the EU. In 2006, the charges were dropped due to pressure from the European Union and United States on the Turkish government.

On 7 February 2006, five journalists were tried for insulting the judicial institutions of the State, and for aiming to prejudice a court case (per Article 288 of the Turkish penal code). The reporters were on trial for criticizing the court-ordered closing of a conference in Istanbul regarding the Armenian genocide during the time of the Ottoman Empire. The conference continued elsewhere, transferring locations from a state to a private university. The trial continued until 11 April 2006, when four of the reporters were acquitted. The case against the fifth journalist, Murat Belge, proceeded until 8 June 2006, when he was also acquitted. The purpose of the conference was to critically analyse the official Turkish view of the Armenian genocide in 1915; a taboo subject in Turkey. The trial proved to be a test case between Turkey and the European Union; the EU insisted that Turkey should allow increased freedom of expression rights, as a condition to membership.

====South Korean war crimes in Vietnam====

At the request of the United States, South Korea under Park Chung Hee sent approximately 320,000 South Korean troops to fight alongside the United States and South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Various civilian groups have accused the South Korean military of many &quot;My Lai-style massacres&quot;, while the Korean Ministry of Defense has denied all such accusations. Korean forces are alleged to have perpetrated the Binh Tai, Bình An/Tây Vinh, Bình Hòa, and Hà My massacres and several other massacres across Vietnam, killing as many as 9000 Vietnamese civilians.

In 2023, a South Korean court ruled in favour of a Vietnamese victim of South Korean atrocities during the war and ordered that the South Korean government compensate the surviving victim. In response, the South Korean government repeated its earlier denials of the atrocities, and later announced its appeal of the decision. This strained relations with Vietnam, as a spokesperson for Vietnam&#x27;s fording ministry called the decision &quot;extremely regrettable&quot;.

===Iran===
The Islamic Republic of Iran uses historical negationism against religious minorities in order to maintain legitimacy and relevancy of the regime. One example is the regime&#x27;s approach to the Baháʼí community. In 2008, an erroneous and misleading biography of Báb was presented to all primary school children.

In his official 2013 Nowruz address, Supreme Leader of Iran Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei questioned the veracity of the Holocaust, remarking that &quot;The Holocaust is an event whose reality is uncertain and if it has happened, it&#x27;s uncertain how it has happened.&quot; This was consistent with Khamenei&#x27;s previous comments regarding the Holocaust.

===Soviet and Russian history===

In his book, &quot;The Stalin School of Falsification&quot;, Leon Trotsky cited a range of historical documents such as private letters, telegrams, party speeches, meeting minutes, and suppressed texts such as Lenin&#x27;s Testament, to argue that the Stalinist faction routinely distorted political events, forged a theoretical basis for irreconcilable concepts such as the notion of &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot; and misrepresented the views of opponents. He also argued that the Stalinist regime employed an array of professional historians as well as economists to justify policy manoeuvering and safeguarding its own set of material interests.

During the existence of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1917–1991) and the Soviet Union (1922–1991), the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) attempted to ideologically and politically control the writing of both academic and popular history. These attempts were most successful in the 1934–1952 period. According to Klaus Mehnert, writing in 1952, the Soviet government attempted to control academic historiography (the writing of history by academic historians) to promote ideological and ethno-racial imperialism by Russians. During the 1928–1956 period, modern and contemporary history was generally composed according to the wishes of the CPSU, not the requirements of accepted historiographic method.

During and after the rule of Nikita Khrushchev (1956–1964), Soviet historiographic practice was more complicated. In this period, Soviet historiography was characterized by complex competition between Stalinist and anti-Stalinist Marxist historians. To avoid the professional hazard of politicized history, some historians chose pre-modern, medieval history or classical history, where ideological demands were relatively relaxed and conversation with other historians in the field could be fostered. Prescribed ideology could still introduce biases in historians&#x27; work, but not all of Soviet historiography was affected. Control over party history and the legal status of individual ex-party members played a large role in dictating the ideological diversity and thus the faction in power within the CPSU. The official &quot;History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)&quot; was revised to delete references to leaders purged from the party, especially during the rule of Joseph Stalin (1922–1953).

In the historiography of the Cold War, a controversy over negationist historical revisionism exists, where numerous revisionist scholars in the West have been accused of whitewashing the crimes of Stalinism, overlooking the Katyn massacre in Poland, disregarding the validity of the Venona Project messages with regards to Soviet espionage in the United States, as well as the denial of the Holodomor of 1932–1933.
In 2009, Russia established the Presidential Commission of the Russian Federation to Counter Attempts to Falsify History to the Detriment of Russia&#x27;s Interests to &quot;defend Russia against falsifiers of history&quot;. Some critics, like Heorhiy Kasyanov from the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said the Kremlin was trying to whitewash Soviet history in order to justify its denial of human rights: &quot;It&#x27;s part of the Russian Federation&#x27;s policy to create an ideological foundation for what is happening in Russia right now.&quot; Historian and author Orlando Figes, a professor at the University of London, who views the new commission is part of a clampdown on historical scholarship, stated: &quot;They&#x27;re idiots if they think they can change the discussion of Soviet history internationally, but they can make it hard for Russian historians to teach and publish. It&#x27;s like we&#x27;re back to the old days.&quot; The commission was disestablished in 2012.

===Azerbaijan===
====In relation to Armenia====
Many scholars, among them Victor Schnirelmann, Willem Floor, Robert Hewsen, George Bournoutian and others state that in Soviet and post-Soviet Azerbaijan since the 1960s there is a practice of revising primary sources on the South Caucasus in which any mention about Armenians is removed. In the revised texts, &quot;Armenian&quot; is either simply removed or is replaced by &quot;Albanian&quot;; there are many other examples of such falsifications, all of which have the purpose of creating an impression that historically Armenians were not present in this territory. Willem M. Floor and Hasan Javadi in the English edition of &quot;The Heavenly Rose-Garden: A History of Shirvan &amp; Daghestan&quot; by Abbasgulu Bakikhanov specifically point out to the instances of distortions and falsifications made by Ziya Bunyadov in his Russian translation of this book. According to Bournoutian and Hewsen these distortions are widespread in these works; they thus advise the readers in general to avoid the books produced in Azerbaijan in Soviet and post-Soviet times if these books do not contain the facsimile copy of original sources. Shnirelman thinks that this practice is being realized in Azerbaijan according to state order. Philip L. Kohl brings an example of a theory advanced by Azerbaijani archaeologist Akhundov about Albanian origin of Khachkars as an example of patently false cultural origin myths.

The Armenian cemetery in Julfa, a cemetery near the town of Julfa, in the Nakhchivan exclave of Azerbaijan originally housed around 10,000 funerary monuments. The tombstones consisted mainly of thousands of &quot;khachkars&quot;, uniquely decorated cross-stones characteristic of medieval Christian Armenian art. The cemetery was still standing in the late 1990s, when the government of Azerbaijan began a systematic campaign to destroy the monuments. After studying and comparing satellite photos of Julfa taken in 2003 and 2009, the American Association for the Advancement of Science came to the conclusion in December 2010 that the cemetery was demolished and levelled. After the director of the Hermitage Museum Mikhail Piotrovsky expressed his protest about the destruction of Armenian khachkars in Julfa, he was accused by Azerbaijanis of supporting the &quot;total falsification of the history and culture of Azerbaijan&quot;. Several appeals were filed by both Armenian and international organizations, condemning the Azerbaijani government and calling on it to desist from such activity. In 2006, Azerbaijan barred European Parliament members from investigating the claims, charging them with a &quot;biased and hysterical approach&quot; to the issue and stating that it would only accept a delegation if it visited Armenian-occupied territory as well. In the spring of 2006, a journalist from the Institute for War and Peace Reporting who visited the area reported that no visible traces of the cemetery remained. In the same year, photographs taken from Iran showed that the cemetery site had been turned into a military shooting range. The destruction of the cemetery has been widely described by Armenian sources, and some non-Armenian sources, as an act of &quot;cultural genocide.&quot;

In Azerbaijan, the Armenian genocide is officially denied and is considered a hoax. According to the state ideology of Azerbaijan, a genocide of Azerbaijanis, carried out by Armenians and Russians, took place starting from 1813. Mahmudov has claimed that Armenians first appeared in Karabakh in 1828. Azerbaijani academics and politicians have claimed that foreign historians falsify the history of Azerbaijan and criticism was directed towards a Russian documentary about the regions of Karabakh and Nakhchivan and the historical Armenian presence in these areas. According to the institute director of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences Yagub Mahmudov, prior to 1918 &quot;there was never an Armenian state in the South Caucasus&quot;. According to Mahmudov, Ilham Aliyev&#x27;s statement in which he said that &quot;Irevan is our [Azerbaijan&#x27;s] historic land, and we, Azerbaijanis must return to these historic lands&quot;, was based &quot;historical facts&quot; and &quot;historical reality&quot;. Mahmudov also stated that the claim that Armenian&#x27;s are the most ancient people in the region is based on propaganda, and said that Armenians are non-natives of the region, having only arrived in the area after Russian victories over Iran and the Ottoman Empire in the first half of the 19th century. The institute director also said: &quot;The Azerbaijani soldier should know that the land under the feet of provocative Armenians is Azerbaijani land. The enemy can never defeat Azerbaijanis on Azerbaijani soil. Those who rule the Armenian state today must fundamentally change their political course. The Armenians cannot defeat us by sitting in our historic city of Irevan.&quot;

====In relation to Iran====
Historic falsifications in Azerbaijan, in relation to Iran and its history, are &quot;backed by state and state backed non-governmental organizational bodies&quot;, ranging &quot;from elementary school all the way to the highest level of universities&quot;. As a result of the two Russo-Iranian Wars of the 19th century, the border between what is present-day Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan was formed. Although there had not been a historical Azerbaijani state to speak of in history, the demarcation, set at the Aras river, left significant numbers of what were later coined &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot; to the north of the Aras river. During the existence of the Azerbaijan SSR, as a result of Soviet-era historical revionism and myth-building, the notion of a &quot;northern&quot; and &quot;southern&quot; Azerbaijan was formulated and spread throughout the Soviet Union. During the Soviet nation building campaign, any event, both past and present, that had ever occurred in what is the present-day Azerbaijan Republic and Iranian Azerbaijan were rebranded as phenomenons of &quot;Azerbaijani culture&quot;. Any Iranian ruler or poet that had lived in the area was assigned to the newly rebranded identity of the Transcaucasian Turkophones, in other words &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot;.
According to Michael P. Croissant: &quot;It was charged that the &quot;two Azerbaijans&quot;, once united, were separated artificially by a conspiracy between imperial Russia and Iran&quot;. This notion based on illegitimate historic revisionism suited Soviet political purposes well (based on &quot;anti-imperialism&quot;), and became the basis for irredentism among Azerbaijani nationalists in the last years of the Soviet Union, shortly prior to the establishment of the Azerbaijan Republic in 1991.

In Azerbaijan, periods and aspects of Iranian history are usually claimed as being an &quot;Azerbaijani&quot; product in a distortion of history, and historic Iranian figures, such as the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi are called &quot;Azerbaijanis&quot;, contrary to universally acknowledged fact. In the Azerbaijan SSR, forgeries such as an alleged &quot;Turkish &quot;divan&quot;&quot; and falsified verses were published in order to &quot;Turkify&quot; Nizami Ganjavi. Although this type of irredentism was initially the result of the nation building policy of the Soviets, it became an instrument for &quot;biased, pseudo-academic approaches and political speculations&quot; in the nationalistic aspirations of the young Azerbaijan Republic. In the modern Azerbaijan Republic, historiography is written with the aim of retroactively Turkifying many of the peoples and kingdoms that existed prior to the arrival of Turks in the region, including the Iranian Medes. According to professor of history George Bournoutian:
Bournoutian adds:
===North Korea and the Korean War===
Since the start of the Korean War (1950–1953), the government of North Korea has consistently denied that the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) launched the attack with which it began the war for the Communist unification of Korea. The historiography of the DPRK maintains that the war was provoked by South Korea, at the instigation of the United States: &quot;On June 17, Juche 39 [1950] the then U.S. President [Harry S.] Truman sent [John Foster] Dulles as his special envoy to South Korea to examine the anti-North war scenario and give an order to start the attack. On June 18, Dulles inspected the 38th parallel and the war preparations of the &#x27;ROK Army&#x27; units. That day he told Syngman Rhee to start the attack on North Korea with the counter-propaganda that North Korea first &#x27;invaded&#x27; the south.&quot;

Further North Korean pronouncements included the claim that the U.S. needed the peninsula of Korea as &quot;a bridgehead, for invading the Asian continent, and as a strategic base, from which to fight against national-liberation movements and socialism, and, ultimately, to attain world supremacy.&quot; Likewise, the DPRK denied the war crimes committed by the Korean People&#x27;s Army in the course of the war; nonetheless, in the 1951–1952 period, the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea (WPK) privately admitted to the &quot;excesses&quot; of their earlier campaign against North Korean citizens who had collaborated with the enemy – either actually or allegedly – during the US–South Korean occupation of North Korea. Later, the WPK blamed every wartime atrocity upon the U.S. Armed Forces, e.g. the Sinchon Massacre (17 October – 7 December 1950) occurred during the retreat of the DPRK government from Hwanghae Province, in the south-west of North Korea.

The campaign against &quot;collaborators&quot; was attributed to political and ideological manipulations by the U.S.; the high-ranking leader Pak Chang-ok said that the American enemy had &quot;started to use a new method, namely, it donned a leftist garb, which considerably influenced the inexperienced cadres of the Party and government organs.&quot; Kathryn Weathersby&#x27;s &quot;Soviet Aims in Korea and the Origins of the Korean War, 1945–1950: New Evidence from Russian Archives&quot; (1993) confirmed that the Korean War was launched by order of Kim Il Sung (1912–1994); and also refuted the DPRK&#x27;s allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War. The Korean Central News Agency dismissed the historical record of Soviet documents as &quot;sheer forgery&quot;.

===Holocaust denial===
Holocaust deniers usually reject the term &quot;Holocaust denier&quot; as an inaccurate description of their historical point of view, instead preferring the term &quot;Holocaust revisionist&quot;; nonetheless, scholars prefer &quot;Holocaust denier&quot; to differentiate deniers from legitimate historical revisionists, whose goal is to accurately analyse historical evidence with established methods. Historian Alan Berger reports that Holocaust deniers argue in support of a preconceived theory – that the Holocaust either did not occur or was mostly a hoax – by ignoring extensive historical evidence to the contrary.

When the author David Irving lost his English libel case against Deborah Lipstadt, and her publisher, Penguin Books, and thus was publicly discredited and identified as a Holocaust denier, the trial judge, Justice Charles Gray, concluded that &quot;Irving has, for his own ideological reasons, persistently and deliberately misrepresented and manipulated historical evidence; that, for the same reasons, he has portrayed Hitler in an unwarrantedly favorable light, principally in relation to his attitude towards, and responsibility for, the treatment of the Jews; that he is an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-semitic and racist, and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism.&quot;

On 20 February 2006, Irving was found guilty, and sentenced to three years imprisonment for Holocaust denial, under Austria&#x27;s 1947 law banning Nazi revivalism and criminalizing the &quot;public denial, belittling or justification of National Socialist crimes&quot;. Besides Austria, eleven other countries – including Belgium, France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, and Switzerland – have criminalized Holocaust denial as punishable with imprisonment.

===North Macedonia===
According to Eugene N. Borza, the Macedonians are in search of their past to legitimize their unsure present, in the disorder of the Balkan politics. Ivaylo Dichev claims that the Macedonian historiography has the impossible task of filling the huge gaps between the ancient kingdom of Macedon, that collapsed in 2nd century BC, the 10th–11th century state of the Cometopuls, and the Yugoslav Macedonia established in the middle of the 20th century.
According to Ulf Brunnbauer, modern Macedonian historiography is highly politicized, because the Macedonian nation-building process is still in development. The recent nation-building project imposes the idea of a &quot;Macedonian nation&quot; with unbroken continuity from the antiquity (Ancient Macedonians) to the modern times, which has been criticized by some domestic and foreign scholars for ahistorically projecting modern ethnic distinctions into the past. In this way generations of students were educated in pseudohistory.

===Historiography in Africa===
Rwandan genocide denial has proliferated in multiple contexts despite the fact that the mass killings took place amidst widespread news coverage and additionally later received detailed study during the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Perpetrators of violent attacks against civilians in Rwanda, known as the &quot;génocidaires&quot;, have been an element of this controversy. Concentrated details involving the planning, financing, and progress of war crimes have gotten unearthed, yet campaigns of denial endure given the influences of extremist ideologies surrounding ethnicity and race.

In May 2020, the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot; interviewed legal advocate and writer Linda Melvern on the topic, with her having assisted with ICTR related prosecutions. She concluded that the &quot;pernicious influence&quot; of the Hutu Power faction that enacted the widespread murders &quot;lives on in rumor, stereotype, lies, and propaganda.&quot; She also remarked that said &quot;movement&#x27;s campaign of genocide denial has confused many, recruited some, and shielded others&quot; such that with &quot;the use of seemingly sound research methods, the génocidaires pose a threat, especially to those who might not be aware of the historical facts.&quot;

In terms of the 21st Century, increased international debate and discussion have partially failed to prevent efforts obfuscating the facts surrounding the Sudanese genocide. In March 2010, Omer Ismail and John Prendergast wrote for the Christian Science Monitor warning of multiple distortions of reality with lasting implications given the actions of the then Khartoum-based government. Specifically, they alleged that the state had &quot;systematically denied access to the United Nations/African Union observer mission [personnel] to investigate attacks on civilians, so many of these attacks go unreported and the culpability remains mysterious.&quot;

Historical negationism within the territories of multiple African nations constitutes a crime from a de jure legal perspective. For example, denying the Rwandan genocide has led to prosecutions in that country. However, the negative social affects from disinformation and misinformation have expanded in some cases using modern media.

===In textbooks===
====Japan====
The history textbook controversy centres upon the secondary school history textbook &quot;Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho&quot; (&quot;New History Textbook&quot;) said to minimize the nature of Japanese militarism in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), in annexing Korea in 1910, in the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), and in the Pacific Theater of World War II (1941–1945). The conservative Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform commissioned the &quot;Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho&quot; textbook with the purpose of traditional national and international view of that Japanese historical period. The Ministry of Education vets all history textbooks, especially those containing references to imperialist atrocities due to a special provision in the textbook examination rules to avoid inflaming controversy with neighbouring countries; however, the &quot;Atarashii Rekishi Kyōkasho&quot; de-emphasizes aggressive Japanese Imperial wartime behaviour and the matter of Chinese and Korean comfort women. When it comes to the Nanking massacre, the textbook only refers to it as the Nanking Incident, mentioning there were civilian casualties without delving into specifics, and mentioning it again in relation to the Tokyo tribunal, stating that there are multiple opinions about the topic with controversies continuing to this day (see Nanking massacre denial). In 2007, the Ministry of Education attempted to revise textbooks regarding the Battle of Okinawa, lessening the involvement of the Imperial Japanese Army in Okinawan civilian mass suicides.

====Pakistan====

Allegations of historical revisionism have been made regarding Pakistani textbooks in that they are laced with Indophobic, Hindu-hating and Islamist bias. Pakistan&#x27;s use of officially published textbooks has been criticized for using schools to more subtly foster religious extremism, whitewashing Muslim conquests on the Indian subcontinent and promoting &quot;expansive pan-Islamic imaginings&quot; that &quot;detect the beginnings of Pakistan in the birth of Islam on the Arabian peninsula&quot;. Since 2001, the Pakistani government has stated that curriculum reforms have been underway by the Ministry of Education.

====South Korea====
12 October 2015, South Korea&#x27;s government has announced controversial plans to control the history textbooks used in secondary schools despite oppositional concerns of people and academics that the decision is made to glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government (Chinilpa). Section and the authoritarian dictatorships in South Korea during 1960s–1980s.The Ministry of Education announced that it would put the secondary-school history textbook under state control; &quot;This was an inevitable choice in order to straighten out historical errors and end the social dispute caused by ideological bias in the textbooks,&quot; Hwang Woo-yea, education minister said on 12 October 2015. According to the government&#x27;s plan, the current history textbooks of South Korea will be replaced by a single textbook written by a panel of government-appointed historians and the new series of publications would be issued under the title &quot;The Correct Textbook of History&quot; and are to be issued to the public and private primary and secondary schools in 2017 onwards.

The move has sparked fierce criticism from academics who argue that the system can be used to distort the history and glorify the history of those who served the Imperial Japanese government (Chinilpa) and of the authoritarian dictatorships. Moreover, 466 organizations including Korean Teachers and Education Workers Union formed History Act Network in solidarity and have staged protests: &quot;The government&#x27;s decision allows the state too much control and power and, therefore, it is against political neutrality that is certainly the fundamental principle of education.&quot; Many South Korean historians condemned Kyohaksa for their text glorifying those who served the Imperial Japanese government (Chinilpa) and the authoritarian dictatorship with a far-right political perspective. On the other hand, New Right supporters welcomed the textbook, saying that &quot;the new textbook finally describes historical truths contrary to the history textbooks published by left-wing publishers&quot;, and the textbook issue became intensified as a case of ideological conflict. In Korean history, the history textbook was once put under state control during the authoritarian regime under Park Chung Hee (1963–1979), who is a father of Park Geun-hye, former President of South Korea, and was used as a means to keep the Yushin Regime, also known as the Yushin Dictatorship; however, there had been continuous criticisms about the system especially from the 1980s when Korea experienced a dramatic democratic development. In 2003, reformation of textbook began when the textbooks on Korean modern and contemporary history were published though the Textbook Screening System, which allows textbooks to be published not by a single government body but by many different companies, for the first time.

====Turkey====

Education in Turkey is centralized, and its policy, administration, and content are each determined by the Turkish government. Textbooks taught in schools are either prepared directly by the Ministry of National Education (MEB) or must be approved by its Instruction and Education Board. In practice, this means that the Turkish government is directly responsible for what textbooks are taught in schools across Turkey. In 2014, Taner Akçam, writing for the &quot;Armenian Weekly&quot;, discussed 2014–2015 Turkish elementary and middle school textbooks that the MEB had made available on the internet. He found that Turkish history textbooks describe Armenians as people &quot;who are incited by foreigners, who aim to break apart the state and the country, and who murdered Turks and Muslims.&quot; The Armenian genocide is referred to as the &quot;Armenian matter&quot;, and is described as a lie perpetrated to further the perceived hidden agenda of Armenians. Recognition of the Armenian genocide is defined as the &quot;biggest threat to Turkish national security&quot;.

Akçam summarized one textbook that claims the Armenians had sided with the Russians during the war. The 1909 Adana massacre, in which as many as 20,000–30,000 Armenians were massacred, is identified as &quot;The Rebellion of Armenians of Adana&quot;. According to the book, the Armenian Hnchak and Dashnak organizations instituted rebellions in many parts of Anatolia, and &quot;didn&#x27;t hesitate to kill Armenians who would not join them,&quot; issuing instructions that &quot;if you want to survive you have to kill your neighbor first.&quot; Claims highlighted by Akçam: &quot;[The Armenians murdered] many people living in villages, even children, by attacking Turkish villages, which had become defenseless because all the Turkish men were fighting on the war fronts. ... They stabbed the Ottoman forces in the back. They created obstacles for the operations of the Ottoman units by cutting off their supply routes and destroying bridges and roads. ... They spied for Russia and by rebelling in the cities where they were located, they eased the way for the Russian invasion. ... Since the Armenians who engaged in massacres in collaboration with the Russians created a dangerous situation, this law required the migration of [Armenian people] from the towns they were living in to Syria, a safe Ottoman territory. ... Despite being in the midst of war, the Ottoman state took precautions and measures when it came to the Armenians who were migrating. Their tax payments were postponed, they were permitted to take any personal property they wished, government officials were assigned to ensure that they were protected from attacks during the journey and that their needs were met, police stations were established to ensure that their lives and properties were secure.&quot;

Similar revisionist claims found in other textbooks by Akçam included that Armenian &quot;back-stabbing&quot; was the reason the Ottomans lost the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 (similar to the post-War German stab-in-the-back myth), that the Hamidian massacres never happened, that the Armenians were armed by the Russians during late World War I to fight the Ottomans (in reality they had already been nearly annihilated from the area by this point), that Armenians killed 600,000 Turks during said war, that the deportation were to save Armenians from other violent Armenian gangs, and that deported Armenians were later allowed to retrieve their possessions and return to Turkey unharmed. As of 2015, Turkish textbooks continue to refer to Armenians as &quot;traitors,&quot; deny the genocide, and assert that the Ottoman Turks &quot;took necessary measures to counter Armenian separatism&quot;. Students are taught that Armenians were forcibly relocated to defend Turkish nationals from attacks, and Armenians are described as &quot;dishonorable and treacherous&quot;.

====Yugoslavia====
Throughout the post war era, though Tito denounced nationalist sentiments in historiography, those trends continued with Croat and Serbian academics at times accusing each other of misrepresenting each other&#x27;s histories, especially in relation to the Croat-Nazi alliance. Communist historiography was challenged in the 1980s and a rehabilitation of Serbian nationalism by Serbian historians began. Historians and other members of the intelligentsia belonging to the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU) and the Writers Association played a significant role in the explanation of the new historical narrative. The process of writing a &quot;new Serbian history&quot; paralleled alongside the emerging ethno-nationalist mobilization of Serbs with the objective of reorganizing the Yugoslav federation. Using ideas and concepts from Holocaust historiography, Serbian historians alongside church leaders applied it to World War Two Yugoslavia and equated the Serbs with Jews and Croats with Nazi Germans.

Chetniks along with the Ustashe were vilified by Tito era historiography within Yugoslavia. In the 1980s, Serbian historians initiated the process of re-examining the narrative of how World War Two was told in Yugoslavia which was accompanied by the rehabilitation of Četnik leader Draža Mihailović. Monographs relating to Mihailović and the Četnik movement were produced by some younger historians who were ideologically close to it towards the end of the 1990s. Being preoccupied with the era, Serbian historians have looked to vindicate the history of the Chetniks by portraying them as righteous freedom fighters battling the Nazis while removing from history books the ambiguous alliances with the Italians and Germans. Whereas the crimes committed by Chetniks against Croats and Muslims in Serbian historiography are overall &quot;cloaked in silence&quot;. During the Milošević era, Serbian history was falsified to obscure the role Serbian collaborators Milan Nedić and Dimitrije Ljotić played in cleansing Serbia&#x27;s Jewish community, killing them in the country or deporting them to Eastern European concentration camps.

In the 1990s following a massive Western media coverage of the Yugoslav Wars, there was a rise of the publications considering the matter on historical revisionism of former Yugoslavia. One of the most prominent authors on the field of historical revisionism in the 1990s considering the newly emerged republics is Noel Malcolm and his works &quot;Bosnia: A Short History (1994)&quot; and &quot;Kosovo: A Short History (1998)&quot;, that have seen a robust debate among historians following their release; following the release of the latter, the merits of the book were the subject of an extended debate in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. Critics said that the book was &quot;marred by his sympathies for its ethnic Albanian separatists, anti-Serbian bias, and illusions about the Balkans&quot;. In late 1999, Thomas Emmert of the history faculty of Gustavus Adolphus College in Minnesota reviewed the book in &quot;Journal of Southern Europe and the Balkans Online&quot; and while praising aspects of the book also asserted that it was &quot;shaped by the author&#x27;s overriding determination to challenge Serbian myths&quot;, that Malcolm was &quot;partisan&quot;, and also complained that the book made a &quot;transparent attempt to prove that the main Serbian myths are false&quot;. In 2006, a study by Frederick Anscombe looked at issues surrounding scholarship on Kosovo such as Noel Malcolm&#x27;s work &quot;Kosovo: A Short History&quot;. Anscombe noted that Malcolm offered a &quot;detailed critique of the competing versions of Kosovo&#x27;s history&quot; and that his work marked a &quot;remarkable reversal&quot; of previous acceptance by Western historians of the &quot;Serbian account&quot; regarding the migration of the Serbs (1690) from Kosovo. Malcolm has been criticized for being &quot;anti-Serbian&quot; and selective like the Serbs with the sources, while other more restrained critics note that &quot;his arguments are unconvincing&quot;. Anscombe noted that Malcolm, like Serbian and Yugoslav historians who have ignored his conclusions, sidelines and is unwilling to consider indigenous evidence such as that from the Ottoman archive when composing national history.

===French law recognizing colonialism&#x27;s positive value===

On 23 February 2005, the Union for a Popular Movement conservative majority at the French National Assembly voted a law compelling history textbooks and teachers to &quot;acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa&quot;. It was criticized by historians and teachers, among them Pierre Vidal-Naquet, who refused to recognize the French Parliament&#x27;s right to influence the way history is written (despite the French Holocaust denial laws, see &quot;Loi Gayssot&quot;). That law was also challenged by left-wing parties and the former French colonies; critics argued that the law was tantamount to refusing to acknowledge the racism inherent to French colonialism, and that the law proper is a form of historical revisionism.

===Marcos martial law negationism in the Philippines===
In the Philippines, the biggest examples of historical negationism are linked to the Marcos family dynasty, usually Imelda Marcos, Bongbong Marcos, and Imee Marcos specifically. They have been accused of denying or trivializing the human rights violations during martial law and the plunder of the Philippines&#x27; coffers while Ferdinand Marcos was president.

===Denial of the Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula===

A spin-off of the vision of history espoused by the &quot;inclusive Spanish nationalism&quot; built in opposition to the National-Catholic brand of Spanish nationalism, it was first coined by Ignacio Olagüe (a dilettante historian connected to the early Spanish fascism) particularly in the former&#x27;s 1974 work &quot;La revolución islámica en Occidente&quot; (&quot;The Islamic revolution in the West&quot;). Olagüe argued that it was impossible for Arabs to have invaded Hispania in 711 since they had not yet established their dominance over the neighbouring part of North Africa. Instead, Olagüe held that the events of 711 could be explained as skirmishes involving allied North African troops within the context of a civil war pitting Catholic Goths led by Roderic against Goths adhering to some form of Arianism and a largely-nontrinitarian Spanish population, including Nestorians, Gnostics and Manichaeans. The negationist postulates of Olagüe were later adopted by certain sectors within Andalusian nationalism. These ideas were resurrected in the early 21st century by the Arabist Emilio González Ferrín.

===Australia===

The Indigenous Australian population plummeted in the Australian frontier wars. The aboriginal people were regarded as lacking any concept of property or land rights: consequently, Australia was considered terra nullius. Massacres and mass poisonings were carried out against indigenous people. Indigenous children were removed from their families in what is known as the Stolen Generations.

===Nakba===

Nakba denial is a form of historical denialism pertaining to the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight and its accompanying effects, which Palestinians refer to collectively as the &quot;Nakba&quot; (). Underlying assumptions of Nakba denial cited by scholars can include the denial of historically documented violence against Palestinians, the denial of a distinct Palestinian identity, the idea that Palestine was barren land, and the notion that Palestinian dispossession were part of mutual transfers between Arabs and Jews justified by war.

==Ramifications and judicature==
16 European countries as well as Canada and Israel have criminalized historical negationism of the Holocaust. The Council of Europe defines it as the &quot;denial, gross minimisation, approval or justification of genocide or crimes against humanity&quot; (article 6, &quot;Additional Protocol to the Convention on cybercrime&quot;).

===International law===

Some council-member states proposed an additional protocol to the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention, addressing materials and &quot;acts of racist or xenophobic nature committed through computer networks&quot;; it was negotiated from late 2001 to early 2002, and, on 7 November 2002, the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted the protocol&#x27;s final text titled &quot;Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cyber-crime, Concerning the Criminalization of Acts of a Racist and Xenophobic Nature Committed through Computer Systems&quot;, (&quot;Protocol&quot;). It opened on 28 January 2003, and became current on 1 March 2006; as of 30 November 2011, 20 States have signed and ratified the Protocol, and 15 others have signed, but not yet ratified it (including Canada and South Africa).

The Protocol requires participant States to criminalize the dissemination of racist and xenophobic material, and of racist and xenophobic threats and insults through computer networks, such as the Internet. Article 6, Section 1 of the Protocol specifically covers Holocaust Denial, and other genocides recognized as such by international courts, established since 1945, by relevant international legal instruments. Section 2 of Article 6 allows a Party to the Protocol, at their discretion, only to prosecute the violator if the crime is committed with the intent to incite hatred or discrimination or violence; or to use a reservation, by allowing a Party not to apply Article 6 – either partly or entirely. The Council of Europe&#x27;s &quot;Explanatory Report&quot; of the Protocol says that the &quot;European Court of Human Rights has made it clear that the denial or revision of &#x27;clearly established historical facts – such as the Holocaust  –  ... would be removed from the protection of Article 10 by Article 17&#x27; of the European Convention on Human Rights&quot; (see the &quot;Lehideux and Isorni&quot; judgement of 23 September 1998);

Two of the English-speaking states in Europe, Ireland and the United Kingdom, have not signed the additional protocol, (the third, Malta, signed on 28 January 2003, but has not yet ratified it). On 8 July 2005 Canada became the only non-European state to sign the convention. They were joined by South Africa in April 2008. The United States government does not believe that the final version of the Protocol is consistent with the United States&#x27; First Amendment Constitutional rights and has informed the Council of Europe that the United States will not become a Party to the protocol.

===Domestic law===
There are domestic laws against negationism and hate speech (which may encompass negationism) in several countries, including:

* Austria (Article I §3 Verbotsgesetz 1947 with its 1992 updates and added paragraph §3h).
* Belgium (Belgian Holocaust denial law).
* Czech Republic.
* France (Gayssot Act).
* Germany (§130(3) of the penal code).
* Hungary.
* Israel.
* Lithuania.
* Luxembourg.
* Poland (Article 55 of the law establishing the Institute of National Remembrance 1998).
* Portugal.
* Romania.
* Slovakia.
* Switzerland (Article 261bis of the Penal Code).

Additionally, the Netherlands considers denying the Holocaust as a hate crime – which is a punishable offence. Wider use of domestic laws include the 1990 French &quot;Gayssot Act&quot; that prohibits any &quot;racist, anti-Semitic or xenophobic&quot; speech, and the Czech Republic and Ukraine have criminalized the denial and the minimization of Communist-era crimes.

==In fiction==
In the novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1949) by George Orwell, the government of Oceania continually revises historical records to concord with the contemporary political explanations of The Party. When Oceania is at war with Eurasia, the public records (newspapers, cinema, television) indicate that Oceania has been always at war with Eurasia; yet, when Eurasia and Oceania are no longer fighting each other, the historical records are subjected to negationism; thus, the populace are brainwashed to believe that Oceania and Eurasia always have been allies against Eastasia. The protagonist of the story, Winston Smith, is an editor in the Ministry of Truth, responsible for effecting the continual historical revisionism that will negate the contradictions of the past upon the contemporary world of Oceania.
To cope with the psychological stresses of life during wartime, Smith begins a diary, in which he observes that &quot;He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future&quot;, and so illustrates the principal, ideological purpose of historical negationism.

Franz Kurowski was an extremely prolific right-wing German writer who dedicated his entire career to the production of Nazi military propaganda, followed by post-war military pulp fiction and revisionist histories of World War II, claiming the humane behaviour and innocence of war crimes of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, glorifying war as a desirable state, while fabricating eyewitness reports of atrocities allegedly committed by the Allies, especially Bomber Command and the air raids on Cologne and Dresden as a planned genocide of the civilian population.
