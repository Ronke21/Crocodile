<text>Skis are runners, attached to the user&#x27;s feet, designed to glide over snow. Typically employed in pairs, skis are attached to ski boots with ski bindings, with either a free, lockable, or partially secured heel. For climbing slopes, ski skins can be affixed to the base of each ski to prevent them from sliding backwards. Originally used as a means of travel over snow, skis have become specialized for recreational and competitive alpine and cross-country skiing.

==Etymology and usage==
The word &quot;ski&quot; comes from the Old Norse word which means &quot;cleft wood,&quot; &quot;stick of wood,&quot; or &quot;ski&quot;. In Old Norse common phrases describing skiing were &quot;fara á skíðum&quot; (to travel, move fast on skis), &quot;renna&quot; (to move swiftly) and &quot;skríða á skíðum&quot; (to stride on skis). In Norwegian this word is usually pronounced . In Swedish, another language evolved from Old Norse, the word is (plural, ; singular: ). The modern Norwegian word &quot;ski&quot; and the Swedish word &quot;skid&quot; have largely retained the Old Norse meaning in words for split firewood, wood building materials (such as bargeboards) and roundpole fence.

English and French use the original Norwegian spelling , and modify the pronunciation. Before 1920, English often called them &quot;skee&quot; and &quot;snow-shoe&quot;. In Italian, it is pronounced similarly to Norwegian, but the spelling is modified accordingly: . Portuguese and Spanish adapt the word to their linguistic rules: and . In German, spellings &quot;Ski&quot; and &quot;Schi&quot; are in use, both pronounced . In Dutch, the word is and the pronunciation was originally as in Norwegian, but since approximately the 1960s changed to . In Welsh the word is spelled &quot;sgi&quot;. Many languages make a verb form out of the noun, such as &quot;to ski&quot; in English, in French, in Spanish and Portuguese, in Italian, in Dutch, or or (as above also or ) in German. Norwegian and Swedish do not form a verb from the noun.

Finnish has its own ancient words for skis and skiing: &quot;ski&quot; is and &quot;skiing&quot; is . The word &quot;suksi&quot; goes back to the Proto-Uralic period, with cognates such as Erzya &quot;soks&quot;, Mansi &quot;tåut&quot; and Nganasan &quot;tuta.&quot; The Sami also have their own words for &quot;skis&quot; and &quot;skiing&quot;: for example, the Lule Sami word for &quot;ski&quot; is and skis are called . The Sami use for the verb &quot;to ski&quot;.

==History==

Skis appeared before the wheel, with the oldest wooden skis found in Russia (c. 6300–5000 BCE), Sweden (c. 5200 BCE) and Norway (c. 3200 BCE) respectively.

These early skis were not designed for recreation or speed; their sole purpose was to keep the user on top of the snow, as when hunting or at war. Early skis were generally accompanied by a walking stick to help the user maintain balance.

Nordic ski technology was adapted during the early 20th century to enable skiers to turn at higher speeds. New ski and ski binding designs, coupled with the introduction of ski lifts to carry skiers up slopes, enabled the development of alpine skis. Meanwhile, advances in technology in the Nordic camp allowed for the development of special skis for skating and ski jumping.

===Asymmetrical skis===

This type of ski was used at least in northern Finland and Sweden until the 1930s. On one leg, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and on the other a shorter ski for kicking. The bottom of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in similar manner to modern ski waxing. Early record of this type of skis survives in works of Olaus Magnus. He associates them to Sami people and gives Sami names of &quot;savek&quot; and &quot;golos&quot; for the plain and skinned short ski. Finnish names for these are &quot;lyly&quot; and &quot;kalhu&quot; for the long and short ski.

===Single long ski===
The seal hunters at the Gulf of Bothnia had developed a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals&#x27; breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made specially long, 3–4 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is called &quot;skredstång&quot; in Swedish.

===Modern skis===
Around 1850, artisans in Telemark, Norway, invented the cambered ski. This ski arches up in the middle, under the binding, which distributes the skier&#x27;s weight more evenly across the length of the ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier&#x27;s weight. This new design made it possible to build a thinner lighter ski, that flexed more easily to absorb the shock of bumps, and that maneuvered and ran faster and more easily. The design also included a sidecut that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily.

Skis traditionally were hand-carved out of a single piece of hardwood such as hickory or birch or ash. These woods were used because of their density and ability to handle speed and shock-resistance factors associated with ski racing. Because Europe&#x27;s forests were dwindling, finding quality plank hardwood became difficult, which led to the invention of the laminated ski. Beginning in 1891, skimakers in Norway began laminating two or more layers of wood together to make lighter cross country running skis. These evolved into the multi-laminated high-performance skis of the mid-1930s.

A laminated ski is made of two types of wood glued together. A top layer of soft wood is glued to a thin layer under a surface of hardwood. This combination created skis which were much lighter and more maneuverable than the heavy hardwood skis made before. Although lighter and stronger, laminated skis did not wear well. The water-soluble glues used at the time failed; they warped and split along the glue edges (delaminating) frequently and rapidly. In 1922, a Norwegian skier, Thorbjorn Nordby, developed strong waterproof glue which stopped the problem of splitting, therefore developing a much tougher laminated ski. Research and design of laminated skis rapidly progressed. In 1933, a new design technology was introduced with an outer hardwood shell completely encasing an inner layer of lighter wood, successfully eliminating spontaneously splitting glue lines. This early design eventually evolved into an advanced laminating technique which is referred to today as single-shell casing technology.
In 1950, Howard Head introduced the Head Standard, constructed by sandwiching aluminium alloy around a plywood core. The design included steel edges (invented in 1928 in Austria,) and the exterior surfaces were made of phenol formaldehyde resin which could hold wax. This hugely successful ski was unique at the time, having been designed for the recreational market rather than for racing. 
1962: a fibreglass ski, Kneissl&#x27;s White Star, was used by Karl Schranz to win two gold medals at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. By the late &#x27;60s fibreglass had mostly replaced aluminum.

In 1974, Magne Myrmo became the last world champion (Falun, 15 km cross-country) using wooden skis.

In 1975, the torsion box ski construction design is patented. The patent is referenced by Kästle, Salomon, Rottefella, and Madshus. In 1993 Elan introduced the Elan SCX model, skis with a much wider tip and tail than waist. When tipped onto their edges, they bend into a curved shape and carve a turn. Cross-country techniques use different styles of turns; edging is not as important, and skis have little sidecut. For many years, alpine skis were shaped similarly to cross-country, simply shorter and wider, but the Elan SCX introduced a radial sidecut design that dramatically improved performance. Other companies quickly followed suit, one Austrian ski designer admitting, &quot;It turns out that everything we thought we knew for forty years was wrong.&quot; Line Skis, the first free-ski focused ski company inspired the newschool freeskiing movement with its twin-tip ski boards in 1995. The first company to successfully market and mass-produce a twin-tip ski to ski switch (skiing backwards) was the Salomon Group, with its 1080 ski in 1998.

==Geometry==

Described in the direction of travel, the front of the ski, typically pointed or rounded, is the tip, the middle is the waist and the rear is the tail. Skis have four aspects that define their basic performance: length, width, sidecut and camber. Skis also differ in more minor ways to address certain niche roles. For instance, &quot;mogul skis&quot; are softer to absorb shocks, &quot;powder skis&quot; are wider to provide more float and &quot;rocker skis&quot; bent upwards (&quot;reverse camber&quot;) at the tip and tail to make it easier to turn in deep and heavy snow.

==Construction==
Skis have evolved from being made of solid wood to using a variety of materials including carbon-Kevlar to make skis stronger, stiffer in twisting, lighter, and more durable. Ski manufacturing techniques allow skis to be made in one or a combination of three designs:

===Laminate or sandwich===

Laminated skis are built in layers. Materials such as fiberglass, steel, aluminum alloy, or plastic are layered and compressed above and below the core. Laminated construction is the most widely used manufacturing process in the ski industry today. The first successful laminate ski, and arguably the first modern ski was the Head Standard, introduced in 1950, which sandwiched aluminum alloy around a plywood core.

===Torsion box===
The Dynamic VR7 introduced a new construction method in which a smaller wooden core was wrapped in wet fibreglass, as opposed to pre-dried sheets of fibreglass being glued to the core (essentially replacing metal sheets). The result was a torsion box, which made the ski much stronger. The VR7, and its more famous follow-on VR17, was the first fibreglass ski that could be used for men&#x27;s racing, and quickly took over that market. Over time, materials for both the core and torsion box have changed, with wood, various plastic foams, fibreglass, kevlar and carbon fiber all being used in different designs. Torsion box designs continue to dominate cross-country ski designs, but is less common for alpine and ski touring.

===Monocoque or cap===
During the 1980s, Bucky Kashiwa developed a new construction technique using a rolled stainless steel sheet forming three sides of a torsion box over a wooden core, with the base of the ski forming the bottom. Introduced in 1989, the Volant skis proved expensive to produce, and in spite of numerous positive reviews, the company never became profitable. In 1990, the Salomon S9000 took the same basic concept but replaced the steel with plastics, producing a design they called &quot;monocoque&quot;. Now referred to as the &quot;cap ski&quot; design, the concept eliminates the need to wrap the core and replaces this with a single-step process that is much less expensive to produce. Cap ski construction dominates alpine ski construction today.

===Historical===
The classical wooden ski consists of a single long piece of suitable wood that is hand-carved to the required shape. Early designs were generally rectangular in cross-section, with the tip bent up through application of steam. Over time the designs changed, and skis were thinned out to the sides, or had prominent ridges down the center.

===Notable manufacturers===

* K2 is a major US-based ski manufacturing company. In 1961 they were one of the first companies to begin producing and distributing fiberglass skis. Today K2 is primarily renowned for its wide variety of torsion-box ski designs. They sponsor several professional skiers and ski teams.
* Rossignol is a French company established in 1907. Rossignol introduced its first fiberglass ski in 1964. Today the company offers a wide range of ski designs and produces over 500,000 pairs of skis per year. Rossignol also manufactures boots, bindings, and poles.
* Elan is a Slovenian company, located in Begunje, notable in ski manufacturing for inventing shaped skis, also called parabolic skis, which made carve turns possible at low speeds and with short turn radius.

==Types==

In the history of skiing many types of skis have been developed, designed for different needs, of which the following is a selection.

===Alpine===
Alpine skis, also called downhill skis, are skis designed specifically for lift-assisted resort runs.
Ski design has evolved enormously since the beginnings of the modern sport in mid-19th-century Norway. Modern skis typically have steel edges, camber, side cut, and possibly reverse camber. During the 1990s side cut became more pronounced to make it easier to carve turns. Alpine skis typically have fixed-heel bindings. Specialised types of alpine skis exist for certain uses, including twin-tip skis for freestyle skiing, slalom skis, GS Skis, powder skis, telemark skis and monoskis.

The following table shows different kinds of alpine ski types and their uses within a downhill skiing context.
===Backcountry===
Backcountry skiing, also known as off-piste skiing, is any form of skiing done outside of ski area boundaries. Most of the time this type of skiing is done with alpine touring skis, or telemark gear, where skiers take advantage of climbing skins and a detachable heel, to ski uphill. When the skier reaches the top of the area they want to ski down, they take off the climbing skins and make the necessary preparations to ski back down. Backcountry terrain can also be accessed with standard alpine equipment by riding a lift uphill at a ski resort and then leaving the resort boundary. However, this is more commonly known as sidecountry because of its immediate access from a ski lift.

===Nordic===
In Nordic skiing the skier is not reliant on ski lifts to get up hills, and so skis and boots tend to be lighter, with a free heel to facilitate walking. Styles of Nordic skiing equipment include:
* Cross-country skis are light and narrow, with a slight sidecut. Three binding systems are popular: Rottefella&#x27;s NNN, Salomon&#x27;s SNS profil, and SNS pilot. Ski bases are waxed to reduce friction during forward motion, and kick wax can also be applied for grip. Some waxless models have patterns on the bottom to avoid the necessity of grip waxing for classic technique.
* Skating skis are shorter than classic skis and do not need grip wax. The skating technique is used in biathlons.
* Ski jumping skis are long and wide.
* Roller skis have wheels for use on dry pavement, in the absence of snow.

== Poles ==
Ski poles are commonly used in tandem with skis in a variety of types of skiing. They typically give additional maneuverability and support turning, walking, and getting up after falling.

==Ski maintenance==

Ski maintenance encompasses four facets: binding adjustments, waxing, edge shaping, and base repair.

&quot;Binding adjustment&quot;: Safety-release ski bindings require adjustment to fit the weight and height of the skier. Annual maintenance assures that settings continue to be correct. For rental skis, such an adjustment is required for each change of customers.

&quot;Waxing&quot;: Most ski wax minimizes gliding friction on snow. &quot;Grip wax&quot; promotes grip on snow for cross-country skis. Wax may be applied in three ways, melting on, rubbing on and as a paste.
* Hot wax is applied with heat by ironing the melted wax on the ski base and allowing it to penetrate the pore structure, it is then scraped off and burnished.
* Hard wax may be rubbed on and smoothed, mechanically from a bar or canister of the material. This technique is the rule for grip waxes. 
* Paste wax allows reducing friction with a rapid adjustment to snow conditions at the expense of durability. 
&quot;Edge shaping&quot;: Edges engage the snow, especially during icy conditions. The angle from the plane of the bottom of the ski is set, depending on the type of skiing anticipated, as follows:

* Slalom skiers: 0° to 0.5°
* Intermediate skiers and giant-slalom skiers: 0.5° to 1°
* Beginners and down-hill racers: 2°

Edge shaping may be done daily with carborundum or diamond stone to remove imperfections. Tuning the edges requires a series of applications of sharpening tools and stones, working at approximately right angles along the metal edge.

&quot;Base repair&quot;: Ski base repair has three levels: cleaning, filling imperfections, and surface preparation.

* Cleaning promotes the removal of dirt and wax, allowing repair material to bond to the ski. 
* Repair of gouges may be accomplished with a drip-candle of paraffin and polyethylene blend or a harder, more durable stick of pure polyethylene. Both are melted into the imperfections and then scraped even with the surface of the ski.
* Surface preparation involves blending of repairs into the base and then texturing to befit the snow conditions with a gritty material, using successively finer grits, depending on the snow temperature. Other treatments include &quot;rilling&quot; installing miniature grooves along the ski or a steel brush.

<doc id="28490" wikidata="Q35623" url="?curid=28490" title="Swedish cuisine">
<text>Swedish cuisine () is the traditional food of Sweden. Due to Sweden&#x27;s large north-to-south expanse, there are regional differences between the cuisine of North and South Sweden.

Historically, in the far north, meats such as reindeer, and other game dishes were eaten, some of which have their roots in the Sami culture, while fresh vegetables have played a larger role in the South. Many traditional dishes employ simple, contrasting flavours, such as the traditional dish of meatballs and brown cream sauce with tart, pungent lingonberry jam.

== General features ==
Swedish cuisine could be described as centered around cultured dairy products, crisp and soft breads, berries and stone fruits, beef, chicken, lamb, pork, eggs, and seafood. Potatoes are often served as a side dish, often boiled. Swedish cuisine has a wide variety of breads of different shapes and sizes, made of rye, wheat, oat, white, dark, sourdough, and whole grain, and including flatbreads and crispbreads. There are many sweetened bread types and some use spices. Many meat dishes, especially meatballs, are served with lingonberry jam. Fruit soups with high viscosity, like rose hip soup (&quot;nyponsoppa&quot;) and bilberry soup (&quot;blåbärssoppa&quot;) served hot or cold, are typical of Swedish cuisine. Butter and margarine are the primary fat sources, although olive oil is becoming more popular. Sweden&#x27;s pastry tradition features a variety of tortes, yeast buns, cookies, biscuits and cakes; many of them are in a very sugary style and often eaten with coffee (&quot;fika&quot;).

== History ==
The importance of fish has governed Swedish population and trade patterns far back in history. For preservation, fish were salted and cured. Salt became a major trade item at the dawn of the Scandinavian Middle Ages, which began 1000 AD. Cabbage preserved as sauerkraut and various kinds of preserved berries, apples, and other fruit were used once as a source of vitamin C during the winter (today sauerkraut is very seldom used in Swedish cuisine). Lingonberry jam, still a favourite, may be the most traditional and typical Swedish way to add freshness to sometimes rather heavy food, such as steaks and stews. Black currant jelly is often served with wild game such as venison, elk or moose.

Both before and after this period, some new Germanic dishes were also brought in by immigrants, such as people related to the Hanseatic League, settling in Stockholm, Visby, and Kalmar. Swedish traders and aristocrats naturally also picked up some food traditions in foreign countries; cabbage rolls (&quot;kåldolmar&quot;) being one example. An early version of &quot;kåldolmar&quot; was first published in 1765 in the fourth edition of &quot;Hjelpreda i Hushållningen för Unga Fruentimber&quot; by Cajsa Warg.

=== Husmanskost ===
Swedish &quot;husmanskost&quot; denotes traditional Swedish dishes with local ingredients, the classical everyday Swedish cuisine. The word &quot;husmanskost&quot; stems from &quot;husman&quot;, meaning &#x27;house owner&#x27;, and the term was originally used for most kinds of simple countryside food outside of towns. Genuine Swedish &quot;husmanskost&quot; used predominantly local ingredients such as pork in all forms, fish, cereals, milk, potato, root vegetables, cabbage, onions, apples, berries etc.; beef and lamb were used more sparingly. Beside berries and pears, apples are the most used traditional fruit, eaten fresh or served as apple pie, apple sauce, or apple cake. Time-consuming cooking methods such as &quot;redningar&quot; (roux) and &quot;långkok&quot; (literally &#x27;long boil&#x27;) are commonly employed and spices are sparingly used. Examples of Swedish husmanskost are pea soup (&quot;ärtsoppa&quot;), boiled and mashed carrots, potato and rutabaga served with pork (&quot;rotmos med fläsk&quot;), many varieties of salmon (such as &quot;gravlax&quot;, &quot;inkokt lax&quot;, fried, pickled), varieties of herring (most commonly pickled, but also fried, &quot;au gratin&quot;, etc.), fishballs (&quot;fiskbullar&quot;), meatballs (&quot;köttbullar&quot;), potato dumplings with meat or other ingredients (&quot;palt&quot;), potato pancake (&quot;raggmunk&quot;), varieties of porridge (&quot;gröt&quot;), a fried mix of pieces of potato, different kind of meats, sausages, bacon and onion (&quot;pytt i panna&quot;), meat stew with onion (&quot;kalops&quot;), and potato dumplings with a filling of onions and pork (&quot;kroppkakor&quot;). Many of the dishes would be considered comfort food for the nostalgic value.

Dishes akin to Swedish &quot;husmanskost&quot; and food traditions are found also in other Scandinavian countries; details may vary.

Sweden is part of the vodka belt and historically distilled beverages, such as &quot;brännvin&quot; and snaps, have been a traditional daily complement to food.
Consumption of wine in Sweden has increased during the last fifty years, partly at the expense of beer and stronger alcoholic beverages.

&quot;Husmanskost&quot; has undergone a renaissance during the last decades as well known (or famous) Swedish chefs, such as Tore Wretman, have presented modernised variants of classical Swedish dishes. In this &quot;nouvel husman&quot; the amount of fat (which was needed to sustain hard manual labour in the old days) is reduced and some new ingredients are introduced. The cooking methods are tinkered with as well, in order to speed up the cooking process or enhance the nutritional value or flavour of the dishes. Many Swedish restaurateurs mix traditional &quot;husmanskost&quot; with a modern, gourmet approach.

== Dishes ==

Swedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, others perhaps a century or less, are still a very important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes.

Internationally, the most renowned Swedish culinary tradition is the &quot;smörgåsbord&quot; and, at Christmas, the &quot;julbord&quot;, including well-known Swedish dishes such as &quot;gravlax&quot; and meatballs.
In Sweden, traditionally, Thursday has been &quot;soup day&quot; because the maids had half the day off and soup was easy to prepare in advance. One of the most traditional Swedish soups, &quot;ärtsoppa&quot;, is still served in many restaurants and households every Thursday, a tradition since the Middle Ages. &quot;Ärtsoppa&quot; is a yellow pea soup, commonly served with pancakes as dessert. This is a simple meal, a very thick soup, basically consisting of boiled yellow peas, a little onion, salt and small pieces of pork. It is often served with mustard and followed by a dessert of thin pancakes (&quot;pannkakor&quot;). The Swedish Armed Forces also serve their conscripts pea soup and pancakes every Thursday.

Potatoes are eaten year-round as the main source of carbohydrates, and are a staple in many traditional dishes. Not until the last 50 years have pasta or rice become common on the dinner table.
There are several different kinds of potatoes; the most appreciated is the &quot;new potato&quot;, a potato which ripens in early summer and is enjoyed at the traditional midsummer feast. New potatoes at midsummer are served with pickled herring, chives, and sour cream, and the first strawberries of the year are traditionally served as dessert.

The most highly regarded mushroom in Sweden is the chanterelle, which is considered a delicacy. The chanterelle is usually served as a side dish together with steaks, or fried with onions and sauce served on an open sandwich. Second to the chanterelle, and considered almost as delicious, is the porcini mushroom, or &quot;karljohansvamp&quot;, named after Charles XIV John (Karl XIV Johan) who introduced its use as food.

In August, at the traditional feast known as &quot;kräftskiva&quot;, crayfish party, Swedes eat large amounts of crayfish, boiled and then marinated in a broth with salt, a little bit of sugar, and a large amount of dill umbels (&quot;krondill&quot;, lit. &quot;crown dill&quot;).

=== Meals ===
Meals consists of breakfast in the early morning (&quot;frukost&quot;), a light lunch before noon (&quot;lunch&quot;), and a heavy dinner (&quot;middag&quot;) around six or seven in the evening. It is also common to have a snack, often a sandwich or fruit, in between meals (&quot;mellanmål&quot;). Most Swedes also have a coffee break in the afternoon, often together with a pastry (&quot;fika&quot;). In all primary schools, and most, but not all secondary schools, a hot meal is served at lunch as part of Sweden&#x27;s welfare state. According to Swedish school law, this meal has to be nutrient-dense.

=== Breakfast ===

Breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches (&quot;smörgås&quot;), possibly on crisp bread (&quot;knäckebröd&quot;). The sandwich is most often buttered, with toppings such as hard cheese, cold cuts, caviar, &quot;messmör&quot; (a Norwegian sweet spread made from butter and whey), ham (&quot;skinka&quot;), and tomatoes or cucumber. &quot;Filmjölk&quot; (fermented milk/buttermilk), or sometimes yogurt, is also traditional breakfast food, usually served in a bowl with cereals such as cornflakes. Muesli, or porridge (&quot;gröt&quot;) is sometimes eaten at breakfast, made of oatmeal or cream of wheat, eaten with milk and jam or cinnamon with sugar. Common drinks for breakfast are milk, juice, tea, or coffee. Swedes are among the most avid milk and coffee drinkers in the world.

Swedes sometimes have sweet toppings on their breads, such as jam (like the French and Americans), or chocolate (like the Danes), although many older Swedes choose not to use these sweet toppings. However, orange marmalade on white bread is common, usually with morning coffee or tea.

Many traditional kinds of Swedish bread, such as &quot;sirapslimpa&quot; (less fashionable today, but still very popular) are somewhat sweetened in themselves, baked with small amounts of syrup. Like in many other European countries, there are also many non-sweetened breads, often made with sourdough (&quot;surdeg&quot;). Swedish breads may be made from wholegrain, fine grain, or anything in between, and there are white, brown, and very dark (like in Finland) varieties which are all common. &quot;Barkis&quot; or &quot;bergis&quot; is a localised version of &quot;challah&quot; usually made without eggs and at first only available in Stockholm and Göteborg where Jews first settled but now available elsewhere.

=== Main courses ===
=== Seafood ===
Fish and other seafood are an important part of Swedish cuisine. Farmed salmon from Norway has become increasingly popular. Pickled, sweetened herring, &quot;inlagd sill&quot;, is a traditional Swedish appetizer. Shrimp and lobster are specialties of the Skagerrak coast. &quot;Surströmming&quot; is a fermented Baltic herring famous for its pungent aroma, both loved and hated. Crayfish, boiled in salted water with dill, are a late summer Swedish delicacy.

=== Desserts ===

Common desserts include:

== Pastries and treats ==
=== Kaffebröd (coffee bread) ===
&quot;Bakelser&quot; and other types of &quot;kaffebröd&quot; (or more colloquially &quot;fikabröd&quot;) are various forms of pastries, cake, cookies, and buns that are usually consumed with coffee (see &quot;fika&quot;). Popular kinds of &quot;kaffebröd&quot; available in a traditional Swedish &quot;konditori&quot; (coffee shop / pâtisserie) include:

=== Treats ===
During the winter holidays, traditional candy and pastries include:

Other typical Swedish candy includes:
== Drinks ==
Sweden is in second place among the heaviest coffee-drinking countries in the world. Milk consumption in Sweden is also very high, second only to Finland. Milk is bought in milk cartons; Tetra Pak, the world&#x27;s largest maker of milk cartons, was founded in Sweden. Milk is considered the standard drink to have with meals during weekdays in many families, for both children and adults. Cordial is very common in Sweden. In the early summer elder flower cordial, and less commonly lilac cordial, are made. In the late summer other cordials, such as black currant cordial, are made.

=== Christmas beverages ===

=== Sweet drinks ===

=== Liquor ===

The production of liquor has a tradition dating back to the 18th century and was at a high in the 1840s. Since the 1880s, the state-owned has a monopoly on selling spirits with more than 3.5% ABV, limiting access. &quot;Hembränt&quot; (moonshine) used to be made in rural Sweden, but production has lessened in recent years due to more liberal rules for the import of alcohol as well as increased smuggling.

&quot;Punsch&quot; is a traditional liqueur in Sweden that was immensely popular during the 19th century. It was adopted as the drink of choice by university students, and many traditional songs from that time are about the consumption of &quot;punsch&quot; or are meant to be sung during the collective festivities that were part of the cultural life in the universities&#x27; student associations at the time and still is.

=== Beer ===

Beer is also widely consumed in Sweden and the typical Swedish beer is lager of a bright and malty kind. The brands Pripps Blå and Norrlands Guld are common examples. In the last few decades, many small breweries (&quot;microbreweries&quot;) have emerged all over Sweden offering a wide range of styles and brands. Nils Oscar Brewery, Dugges Ale och Porterbryggeri and Närke Kulturbryggeri are examples of these young Swedish microbreweries. Many microbreweries in Sweden are inspired by the US craft beer movement, brewing American styles or styles commonly associated with American craft breweries, e.g. American Pale Ale and American IPA.

== Food and society ==
Brödinstitutet (&#x27;The Bread Institute&#x27;) once campaigned with a quotation from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, recommending eating six to eight slices of bread daily. Drinking milk has also been recommended and campaigned for by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare; it is often recommended to drink two to three glasses of milk per day. A survey conducted on behalf of Mjölkfrämjandet, an organisation promoting consumption of Swedish milk, concluded that 52% of Swedes surveyed drink milk at least once a day, usually one glass with lunch and another glass or two in the evening or morning.

Low-fat products, wholemeal bread and other alternatives are common; grocery stores usually sell milk in four or five different fat levels, from 3% to 0.1%.

According to various personal accounts, many Swedish families previously considered it inappropriate to feed children from another family. Visiting children could be asked to leave at dinnertime or to wait in another room, or the host family would call the visitor&#x27;s parents and ask for permission. However, this norm seems to have faded by the 1990s.

<text>A submachine gun (SMG) is a magazine-fed automatic carbine designed to fire handgun cartridges. The term &quot;submachine gun&quot; was coined by John T. Thompson, the inventor of the Thompson submachine gun, to describe its design concept as an automatic firearm with notably less firepower than a machine gun (hence the prefix &quot;&quot;). As a machine gun must fire rifle cartridges to be classified as such, submachine guns are not considered machine guns.

The submachine gun was developed during World War I (1914–1918) as a close quarter offensive weapon, mainly for trench raiding. At its peak during World War II (1939–1945), millions of submachine guns were made for assault troops and auxiliaries whose doctrines emphasized close-quarter suppressive fire. New submachine gun designs appeared frequently during the Cold War, especially among special forces, covert operation commandos and mechanized infantrymen. Submachine gun usage for frontline combat decreased in the 1980s and 1990s, and by the early 21st century, submachine guns have largely been replaced by assault rifles, which have a longer effective range, have increased stopping power, and can better penetrate the helmets and body armor used by modern soldiers. However, they are still used by security forces, police tactical units, paramilitary and bodyguards for close-quarters combat because they are &quot;a pistol-caliber weapon that&#x27;s easy to control, and less likely to overpenetrate the target&quot;.

== Name ==
There are some inconsistencies in the classification of submachine guns. British Commonwealth sources often refer to SMGs as &quot;machine carbines&quot;. Other sources refer to SMGs as &quot;machine pistols&quot; because they fire pistol-caliber ammunition, for example, the MP-40 and MP5, where &quot;MP&quot; stands for &quot;Maschinenpistole&quot; (&quot;submachine gun&quot; in German, but cognate with the English term &quot;machine pistol&quot;). However, the term &quot;machine pistol&quot; is also used to describe a handgun-style firearm capable of fully automatic or burst fire, such as the Stechkin, Beretta 93R, Glock 18, and the H&amp;K VP70. Furthermore, personal defense weapons such as the FN P90 and H&amp;K MP7 are often called submachine guns.

==History==
In 1895, Hiram Maxim produced the &#x27;miniature Maxim&#x27; which was a pistol-calibre Maxim machinegun weighing that was sold in small quantities to various countries and tested by the US military but not adopted. In 1896, a select-fire pistol was patented by the British inventor Hugh Gabbett-Fairfax.

In April 1914, Abiel Bethel Revelli, an Italian military officer patented a twin-barreled, magazine-fed automatic gun in a pistol caliber, lighter than a machine gun and shorter than a rifle. A common myth is that this weapon was originally designed as an aircraft gun. In reality ground use was taken into consideration from the very beginning, particularly for the Bersaglieri&#x27;s cyclist battalions.

===World War I===
Stocked pistols were common at the beginning of the 20th century, the Germans initially used heavier versions of the P08 pistol equipped with a detachable stock, larger-capacity snail-drum magazine and a longer barrel. 
In 1915, the Kingdom of Italy adopted Revelli&#x27;s design as the FIAT Mod. 1915. It fired pistol-caliber 9mm Glisenti ammunition, but was not a true submachine gun, as it was originally designed as a mounted weapon.In late 1915, the first submachine gun with a buttstock was built: the Austro-Hungarian Standschütze Hellriegel M1915 although the weapon was never used in combat.

In February 1916, the Austro-Hungarian first fielded the M.12/P16 machine pistol. This was the first machine pistol to be adopted by any military, being issued to Tyrolean units fighting in the alps

In 1916, Heinrich Senn of Bern designed a modification of the Swiss Luger pistol to fire in single shots or in full-automatic. Around the same time Georg Luger demonstrated a similar Luger machine pistol which inspired the German Army to develop submachine guns.

Colonel Bethel-Abiel Revelli had already conceived the principles of the submachine gun in September 1915, when he wrote that his gun could be converted to a single-barreled version that &quot;may be mounted in the manner of a rifle so that it may be fired from the shoulder&quot;. The FIAT Mod. 1915 would be later modified into the OVP 1918 automatic carbine. The OVP 1918 had a traditional wooden stock, a 25-round top-fed box magazine, and had a cyclic rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute.

By 1918, Bergmann Waffenfabrik had developed the 9x19mm Parabellum MP 18, the first practical submachine gun. This weapon used the same 32-round snail-drum magazine as the Luger P-08. The MP 18 was used in significant numbers by German stormtroopers employing infiltration tactics, achieving some notable successes in the final year of the war. However, these were not enough to prevent Germany&#x27;s collapse in November 1918. After World War I, the MP 18 evolved into the MP28/II SMG, which incorporated a simple 32-round box magazine, selective fire, and other minor improvements. Though the MP18 had a rather short service life, it was influential in the design of later submachine guns, such as the Lanchester, Sten and PPD-40.
The .45 ACP Thompson submachine gun had been in development at approximately the same time as the Bergmann and the Beretta. However, the war ended before prototypes could be shipped to Europe. Although it had missed its chance to be the first purpose-designed submachine gun to enter service, it became the basis for later weapons, and was much more successful than the submachine guns produced during World War I.

===Interwar period===
The Thompson entered production as the M1921. It was available to civilians, but, because of the weapon&#x27;s high price, initially saw poor sales. The Thompson (with one Type XX 20 round &quot;stick&quot; magazine) had been priced at $200 in 1921 (roughly ). The Thompson was used in combat that same year:

West Virginia state police bought 37 guns and used them during the Battle of Blair Mountain. Some of the first batches of Thompsons were bought by agents of the Irish Republican Army. They purchased a total of 653 units, though U.S. customs authorities in New York seized 495 of the units in June 1921.

The Thompson, nicknamed &quot;Tommy Gun&quot; or &quot;Chicago Typewriter&quot; became notorious in the U.S. due to its employment by the Mafia: the image of pinstripe-suited James Cagney types wielding drum-magazine Thompsons caused some military planners to shun the weapon. However, the FBI and other U.S. police forces themselves showed no reluctance to use and prominently display these weapons. Eventually, the submachine gun was gradually accepted by many military organizations, especially as World War II loomed, with many countries developing their own designs. The U.S. Marine Corps adopted the Thompson during this period, they used them during the Banana Wars in Central America and it was also used by the China Marines.

During the 1924 uprising the Soviets supplied four Thompsons to Estonian Communist militants; those were used against Estonian soldiers in a failed attempt to storm the Tallinn barracks. Some of the defenders were armed with the MP18s; and this was possibly the first engagement where submachine guns were used on both sides.

Germany transferred its MP 18s to the German police forces after World War I. They also saw use in the hands of various paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot; during the aftermath of the German Revolution. In the 1920s a new, more reliable box magazine was developed for the MP 18 to replace the older snail-drum magazines. In 1928 a new version of the MP 18, the MP 28, saw the light of day, it featured the new box magazine as standard, a bayonet lug and a single shot mode. The MP 28 was manufactured in Belgium and Spain and was widely exported from there, including to China and South America. Another variant based on the MP 18 was the MP 34 that was manufactured by the Germans through the Swiss front company Solothurn. The MP 34 was manufactured from the very best materials available and finished to the highest possible standard. Consequently, its production costs were extremely high. It was adopted by the Austrian police and army in the 1930s, and they were taken over by the Germans after German annexation of Austria in 1938. The MP35 was another interwar German submachine gun, designed by the Bergmann brothers. It was exported to Sweden and Ethiopia and also saw extensive use in the Spanish Civil War. About 40,000 of the type were manufactured until 1944, with many going into the hands of the Waffen SS. The Erma EMP was yet another submachine gun from this period, based on a design by Heinrich Vollmer, about 10,000 were manufactured. It was exported to Spain, Mexico, China and Yugoslavia, but also used domestically by the SS, as well as being produced under license in Francoist Spain.

===World War II===
Changes in design accelerated during the war, with one major trend being the abandonment of complex and finely made pre-war designs like the Thompson submachine gun to weapons designed for cheap mass production and easy replacement like the M3 Grease Gun.

While the Italians were among the first to develop submachine guns during World War I, they were slow to produce them under Mussolini; the 9mm Parabellum Beretta Model 38 (MAB 38) was not available in large numbers until 1943. The MAB 38 was made in a series of improved and simplified models all sharing the same basic layout. The MAB 38 has two triggers, the front for semi-auto and rear for full-auto. Most models use standard wooden stocks, although some models were fitted with an MP40-style under-folding stock and are commonly mistaken for it. The MAB 38 series was extremely robust and proved very popular with both Axis and Allied troops (who used captured MAB 38s). It is considered the most successful and effective Italian small arm of World War II. During the later years of the war, the TZ-45 submachine gun was manufactured in small numbers in the Italian Social Republic. A cheaper alternative to the MAB 38, it also sported an unusual grip safety.
In 1939, the Germans introduced the 9mm Parabellum MP38 which was first used during the invasion of Poland of September that year. The MP38 production was still just starting and only a few thousand were in service at the time. It proved to be far more practical and effective in close-quarters combat than the standard-issue German Karabiner 98k bolt-action rifle. From this experience, the simplified and modernized MP40 (commonly and erroneously referred to as the Schmeisser) was developed and made in large numbers; about a million were made during World War II. The MP40 was lighter than the MP38. It also used more stamped parts, making it faster and cheaper to produce. The MP38 and MP40 were the first SMGs to use plastic furniture and a practical folding stock, which became standard for all future SMG designs. The Germans used a large number of captured Soviet PPSh-41 submachine guns, some were converted to fire 9mm Parabellum while others were used unmodified (the German 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge had identical dimensions to the 7.62×25mm Tokarev, albeit slightly less powerful).

During the Winter War, the badly outnumbered Finnish used the Suomi KP/-31 in large numbers against the Russians with devastating effect. Finnish ski troops became known for appearing out of the woods on one side of a road, raking Soviet columns with SMG fire and disappearing back into the woods on the other side. During the Continuation War, the Finnish Sissi patrols often equipped every soldier with KP/-31s. The Suomi fired 9mm Parabellum ammunition from a 71-round drum magazine (although often loaded with 74 rounds). &quot;This SMG showed the world the importance of the submachine gun in modern warfare&quot;, prompting the development, adoption and mass production of submachine guns by most of the world&#x27;s armies. The Suomi was used in combat until the end of the Lapland war, was widely exported and remained in service to the late 1970s. Inspired by captured examples of the Soviet PPS submachine gun, a gun that was cheaper and quicker to manufacture than the Suomi, the Finns introduced the KP m/44 submachine gun in 1944.

In 1940, the Soviets introduced the 7.62×25mm PPD-40 and later the more easily manufactured PPSh-41 in response to their experience during the Winter War against Finland. The PPSh&#x27;s 71-round drum magazine is a copy of the Suomi&#x27;s. Later in the war they developed the even more readily mass-produced PPS submachine gun - all firing the same small-caliber but high-powered Tokarev cartridges. The USSR went on to make over 6 million PPSh-41s and 2 million PPS-43s by the end of World War II. Thus, the Soviet Union could field huge numbers of submachine guns against the Wehrmacht, with whole infantry battalions being armed with little else. Even in the hands of conscripts with minimal training, the volume of fire produced by massed submachine guns could be overwhelming.
Britain entered the war with no domestic submachine gun design but instead imported the expensive US M1928 Thompson. After evaluating their battlefield experience in the Battle of France and losing many weapons in the Dunkirk evacuation, the Royal Navy adopted the 9mm Parabellum Lanchester submachine gun. With no time for the usual research and development for a new weapon, it was decided to make a direct copy of the German MP 28. Like other early submachine guns it was difficult and expensive to manufacture. Shortly thereafter, the simpler Sten submachine gun was developed for general use by the British armed forces, it was much cheaper and faster to make. Over 4 million Sten guns were made during World War II. The Sten was so cheap and easy to produce that towards the end of the war as their economic base approached crisis, Germany started manufacturing their own copy, the MP 3008. After the war, the British replaced the Sten with the Sterling submachine gun.

The United States and its allies used the Thompson submachine gun, especially the simplified M1. The Thompson was still expensive and slow to produce. Therefore, the U.S. developed the M3 submachine gun or &quot;Grease Gun&quot; in 1942, followed by the improved M3A1 in 1944. While the M3 was no more effective than the Tommy Gun, it was made primarily of stamped parts and welded together and could be produced much faster and at a fraction of the cost of a Thompson; its much lower rate of fire made it a lot more controllable. It could be configured to fire either .45 ACP or 9mm Luger ammunition. The M3A1 was among the longest-serving submachine gun designs, being produced into the 1960s and serving in US forces into the 1990s.
France produced only about 2,000 of the MAS-38 submachine gun (chambered in 7.65×20mm Longue) before the Fall of France in June 1940. Production was taken over by the occupying Germans, who used them for themselves and also put them into the hands of the Vichy French.

The Owen Gun is a 9mm Parabellum Australian submachine gun designed by Evelyn Owen in 1939. The Owen is a simple, highly reliable, open bolt, blowback SMG. It was designed to be fired either from the shoulder or the hip. It is easily recognisable, owing to its unconventional appearance, including a quick-release barrel and butt-stock, double pistol grips, top-mounted magazine, and unusual offset right-side-mounted sights. The Owen was the only entirely Australian-designed and constructed service submachine gun of World War II and was used by the Australian Army from 1943 until the mid-1960s, when it was replaced by the F1 submachine gun. Only about 45,000 Owens were produced during the war for a unit cost of about A$30.
While most other countries during World War II developed submachine guns, the Empire of Japan had only produced one, the Type 100 submachine gun, based heavily on the German MP28. Like most other small arms created in Imperial Japan, the Type 100 could be fitted with the Type 30 bayonet. It used the 8×22mm Nambu cartridge, which was about half as powerful as a standard Western 9mm Parabellum round. Production of the gun was even more inadequate: by the war&#x27;s end, Japan had only manufactured about 7,500 of the Type 100, whereas Germany, America, and other countries in the war had produced well over a million of their own SMG designs.

The German military concluded that most firefights took place at ranges of no more than ~. They therefore sought to develop a new class of weapon that would combine the high volume of fire of the submachine gun with an intermediate cartridge that enabled the shooter to place accurate shots at medium ranges (beyond that of the range of the typical submachine gun). After a false start with the FG 42, this led to the development of the select-fire assault rifle (assault rifle or storm rifle is a translation of the German ). In the years following the war, this new format began to replace the submachine gun in military use to a large extent. Based on the StG44, the Soviet Union created the AK-47, which is to date the world&#x27;s most produced firearm, with over 100 million made.

===Post–World War II===
After World War II, &quot;new submachine gun designs appeared almost every week to replace the admittedly rough and ready designs which had appeared during the war. Some (the better ones) survived, most rarely got past the glossy brochure stage.&quot; Most of these survivors were cheaper, easier, and faster to make than their predecessors. As such, they were widely distributed.

In 1945, Sweden introduced the 9 mm Parabellum Carl Gustaf m/45 with a design borrowing from and improving on many design elements of earlier submachine-gun designs. It has a tubular stamped steel receiver with a side folding stock. The m/45 was widely exported and especially popular with CIA operatives and U.S. special forces during the Vietnam War. In U.S. service it was known as the &quot;Swedish-K&quot;. In 1966, the Swedish government blocked the sale of firearms to the United States because it opposed the Vietnam War. As a result, in the following year Smith &amp; Wesson began to manufacture an m/45 clone called the M76. The m/45 was used in combat by Swedish troops as part of the United Nations Operation in the Congo, during the Congo Crisis during the early 1960s. Battlefield reports of the lack of penetrative power of the 9mm Parabellum during this operation led to Sweden developing a more powerful 9 mm round designated &quot;9mm m/39B&quot;.

In 1946, Denmark introduced the Madsen M-46 and, in 1950, an improved model, the Madsen M-50. These 9 mm Parabellum stamped steel SMGs featured a unique clamshell type design, a side-folding stock, and a grip safety on the magazine housing. The Madsen was widely exported and especially popular in Latin America, with variants made by several countries.

In 1948, Czechoslovakia introduced the Sa vz. 23 series. This 9 mm Parabellum SMG introduced several innovations: a progressive trigger for selecting between semi-automatic and full auto fire, a telescoping bolt that extends forward wrapping around the barrel, and a vertical handgrip housing the magazine and trigger mechanism. The vz. 23 series was widely exported and especially popular in Africa and the Middle East with variants made by several countries. The vz. 23 inspired the development of the Uzi submachine gun.
In 1949, France introduced the MAT-49 to replace the hodgepodge of French, American, British, German, and Italian SMGs in French service after World War II. The 9 mm Parabellum MAT-49 is an inexpensive stamped-steel SMG with a telescoping wire stock, a pronounced folding magazine housing, and a grip safety. This &quot;wildebeast-like design&quot; proved to be an extremely reliable and effective SMG and was used by the French well into the 1980s. It was also widely exported to Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

===1950s===
In 1954, Israel introduced a 9mm Parabellum open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine gun called the Uzi (after its designer Uziel Gal). The Uzi was one of the first weapons to use a telescoping bolt design with the magazine housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon. The Uzi has become the most popular submachine gun in the world, with over 10 million units sold, more than any other submachine gun.

In 1959, Beretta introduced the Model 12. This 9mm Parabellum submachine gun was a complete break with previous Beretta designs. It is a small, compact, very well made SMG and among the first to use a telescoping bolt design. The M12 was designed for mass production and was made largely of stamped steel and welded together. It is identified by its tubular shape receiver, double pistol grips, a side folding stock and the magazine housed in front of the trigger guard. The M12 uses the same magazines as the Model 38 series.

====Submachine guns in the Korean War====
Submachine guns again proved to be an important weapon system in the Korean War (25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953). The Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) and the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) fighting in Korea received massive numbers of the PPSh-41, in addition to the North Korean Type 49 and the Chinese Type 50, which were both licensed copies of the PPSh-41 with small mechanical revisions. While lacking the accuracy of the U.S. M1 Garand and M1 carbine, it provided more firepower at short distances and was well-suited to the close-range firefights that typically occurred in that conflict, especially at night. United Nations Command forces in defensive outposts or on patrol often had trouble returning a sufficient volume of fire when attacked by companies of infantry armed with the PPSh. As infantry Captain (later General) Hal Moore stated: &quot;on full automatic it sprayed a lot of bullets and most of the killing in Korea was done at very close ranges and it was done quickly—a matter of who responded faster. In situations like that it outclassed and outgunned what we had. A close-in patrol fight was over very quickly and usually we lost because of it.&quot; U.S. servicemen, however, felt that their M2 carbines were superior to the PPSh-41 at the typical engagement range of 100–150 meters.

Other older designs also saw use in the Korean War. The Thompson had seen much use by the U.S. and South Korean militaries, even though the Thompson had been replaced as standard-issue by the M3/M3A1. With huge numbers of guns available in army ordnance arsenals, the Thompson remained classed as &quot;limited standard&quot; or &quot;substitute standard&quot; long after the standardization of the M3/M3A1. Many Thompsons were distributed to the US-backed Nationalist Chinese armed forces as military aid before the fall of Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s government to Mao Zedong&#x27;s communist forces at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. (Thompsons had already been widely used throughout China since the 1920s, at a time when several Chinese warlords and their military factions running various parts of the fragmented country made purchases of the weapon and then subsequently produced many local copies.) US troops were surprised to encounter communist Chinese troops armed with Thompsons (among other captured US-made Nationalist Chinese and American firearms), especially during unexpected night assaults, which became a prominent Chinese combat tactic in the conflict. The gun&#x27;s ability to deliver large quantities of short-range automatic assault fire proved very useful in both defense and assault during the early part of the war when it was constantly mobile and shifting back and forth. Many Chinese Thompsons were captured and placed into service with American soldiers and marines for the remaining period of the war.

===1960s===
In the 1960s, Heckler &amp; Koch developed the 9mm Parabellum MP5 submachine gun. The MP5 is based on the G3 rifle and uses the same closed-bolt roller-delayed blowback operation system. This makes the MP5 more accurate than open-bolt SMGs, such as the Uzi. The MP5 is one of the most widely used submachine guns in the world, having been adopted by over 40 nations and numerous military, law enforcement, and security organizations.

In 1969, Steyr introduced the MPi 69, which is similar in appearance to the Uzi SMG. The MPi 69&#x27;s receiver is a squared stamped steel tube that partly nestles inside a large plastic molding (resembling a lower receiver) which contains the forward hand-grip, vertical pistol-grip and the fire control group, making the MPi 69 one of the first firearms to use plastic construction in this way.

===1970s===

In the 1970s, extremely compact submachine guns, such as the .45ACP Mac-10 and .380 ACP Mac-11, were developed to be used with silencers or suppressors. While these SMGs received enormous publicity, and were prominently displayed in films and television, they were not widely adopted by military or law enforcement agencies. 

===1980s===
By the 1980s, the demand for new submachine guns was very low and could be easily met by existing makers with existing designs. However, following H&amp;K&#x27;s lead, other manufacturers began designing submachine guns based on their existing assault rifle patterns. These new SMGs offered a high degree of parts commonality with parent weapons, thereby easing logistical concerns.

In 1982, Colt introduced the Colt 9mm SMG based on the M16 rifle. The Colt SMG is a closed bolt, blowback operated SMG and the overall aesthetics are identical to most M16 type rifles. The magazine well is modified using a special adapter to allow the use of the smaller 9mm magazines. The magazines themselves are a copy of the Israeli UZI SMG magazine, modified to fit the Colt and lock the bolt back after the last shot. The Colt was widely used by US law enforcement and the USMC.

===1990s===

In 1999, H&amp;K introduced the UMP &quot;Universal Machine Pistol&quot;. The UMP is a 9mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W, or .45 ACP, closed-bolt blowback-operated SMG, based on the H&amp;K G36 assault rifle. It features a predominantly polymer construction and was designed to be a more cost effective, lighter weight, and less complex design alternative to the MP5. The UMP has a side-folding stock and is available with four different trigger group configurations. It was also designed to use a wide range of Picatinny rail mounted accessories 

===2000s===

In 2004, Izhmash introduced the Vityaz-SN a 9mm Parabellum, closed bolt straight blowback operated submachine gun. It is based on the AK-74 rifle and offers a high degree of parts commonality with the AK-74. It is the standard submachine gun for all branches of Russian military and police forces.

In 2009, KRISS USA introduced the KRISS Vector family of submachine guns. Futuristic in appearance, the KRISS uses an unconventional delayed blowback system combined with in-line design to reduce perceived recoil and muzzle climb. The KRISS comes in 9mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W, .45 ACP, 9×21mm, 10mm Auto, and .357 SIG. It also uses standard Glock pistol magazines.

===2010s===
By the early 2010s, compact assault rifles and personal defense weapons had replaced submachine guns in most roles. Factors such as the increasing use of body armor and logistical concerns have combined to limit the appeal of submachine guns. However, SMGs are still used by police (especially SWAT teams) for dealing with heavily armed suspects and by military special forces units for close-quarters combat, due to their reduced size, recoil and muzzle blast, and capability for sound suppression. Submachine gun designs adopted during this period include the Brügger &amp; Thomet APC and SIG MPX.

==Land defence pistol==
During the Apartheid era of South Africa and the Rhodesian Bush War/South African Border War, a semi-automatic only pistol calibre carbine based on submachine guns existed for civilian personal protection as &quot;Land Defence Pistol&quot;s (LDP). Known examples were the Bell &amp; White 84, BHS Rhogun, Cobra Mk1, GM-16, Kommando LDP, Northwood R-76, Paramax, Sanna 77 and TS III.

==Personal defense weapons==

First developed during the 1980s, personal defense weapons (PDWs) were created in response to a NATO request for a replacement for 9×19mm Parabellum submachine guns. PDWs are compact automatic weapons that are sufficiently light to be issued to non-combat arms or support troops, particularly those in vehicles, while being capable of greater range and terminal ballistics than a handgun. As a result of these characteristics, most PDWs can be used as close quarters battle weapons for special forces and counter-terrorist groups. 

Introduced in 1991, the FN P90 features an unusual appearance, having a 50-round magazine housed horizontally above the barrel, an integrated reflex sight and fully ambidextrous controls. A simple blowback automatic weapon, it was designed to fire the proprietary FN 5.7×28mm cartridge which can penetrate soft body armor. The FN P90 was designed to have a length no greater than an average-sized man&#x27;s shoulder width, to allow it to be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an infantry fighting vehicle. The FN P90 is currently in service with military and police forces in over 40 nations.

<text>Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae (), a family that includes small or medium-sized rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels (including chipmunks and prairie dogs, among others), and flying squirrels. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia, and Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia. The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from the Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most closely related to the mountain beaver and dormice.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;squirrel&quot;, first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman which is from the Old French , the reflex of a Latin word , which was taken from the Ancient Greek word (; from ) &#x27;shadow-tailed&#x27;, referring to the long bushy tail which many of its members have. &quot;Sciurus&quot; is also the name of one of its genuses.

The native Old English word for the squirrel, , only survived into Middle English (as ) before being replaced. The Old English word is of Common Germanic origin, cognates of which are still used in other Germanic languages, including the German (diminutive of , which is not as frequently used); the Norwegian /; the Dutch ; the Swedish and the Danish .

A group of squirrels is called a &quot;dray&quot; or a &quot;scurry&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

Squirrels are generally small animals, ranging in size from the African pygmy squirrel and least pygmy squirrel at in total length and just in weight, to the Bhutan giant flying squirrel at up to in total length, and several marmot species, which can weigh or more. Squirrels typically have slender bodies with very long very bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is soft and silky, though much thicker in some species than others. The coat color of squirrels is highly variable between—and often even within—species.

In most squirrel species, the hind limbs are longer than the forelimbs, while all species have either four or five toes on each foot. The feet, which include an often poorly developed thumb, have soft pads on the undersides and versatile, sturdy claws for grasping and climbing. Tree squirrels, unlike most mammals, can descend a tree headfirst. They do so by rotating their ankles 180 degrees, enabling the hind feet to point backward and thus grip the tree bark from the opposite direction.

=== Head ===
As their large eyes indicate, squirrels have excellent vision, which is especially important for the tree-dwelling species. Many also have a good sense of touch, with vibrissae on their limbs as well as their heads.

The teeth of sciurids follow the typical rodent pattern, with large incisors (for gnawing) that grow throughout life, and cheek teeth (for grinding) that are set back behind a wide gap, or diastema. The typical dental formula for sciurids is .

=== Tail ===
The purposes of squirrels&#x27; tails, to benefit the squirrel, include:

* To keep rain, wind, or cold off itself.
* To cool off when hot, by pumping more blood through its tail.
* As a counterbalance when jumping about in trees
* As a parachute when jumping.
* To signal with.

The hairs from squirrel tails are prized in fly fishing when tying fishing flies. Squirrel hair is very fine, making it better for tying fishing flies.

When the squirrel sits upright, its tail folded up its back may stop predators looking from behind from seeing the characteristic shape of a small mammal.

== Lifetime ==
Squirrels live in almost every habitat, from tropical rainforest to semiarid desert, avoiding only the high polar regions and the driest of deserts. They are predominantly herbivorous, subsisting on seeds and nuts, but many will eat insects and even small vertebrates.

Many juvenile squirrels die in the first year of life. Adult squirrels can have a lifespan of 5 to 10 years in the wild. Some can survive 10 to 20 years in captivity. Premature death may occur when a nest falls from the tree, in which case the mother may abandon her young if their body temperature is not correct. Many such baby squirrels have been rescued and fostered by a professional wildlife rehabilitator until they could be safely returned to the wild, although the density of squirrel populations in many places and the constant care required by premature squirrels means that few rehabilitators are willing to spend their time doing this and such animals are routinely euthanized instead.

== Behavior ==

Squirrels mate either once or twice a year and, following a gestation period of three to six weeks, give birth to a number of offspring that varies by species. The young are altricial, being born naked, toothless, and blind. In most species of squirrel, the female alone looks after the young, which are weaned at six to ten weeks and become sexually mature by the end of their first year. In general, the ground-dwelling squirrel species are social, often living in well-developed colonies, while the tree-dwelling species are more solitary.

Ground squirrels and tree squirrels are usually either diurnal or crepuscular, while the flying squirrels tend to be nocturnal—except for lactating flying squirrels and their young, which have a period of diurnality during the summer.

During hot periods, squirrels have been documented to sploot, or lay their stomachs down on cool surfaces.

Squirrels, like other rodents, employ species-specific strategies to store food, buffering against periods of scarcity. In temperate regions, squirrels commonly cache nuts beneath leaf litter, inside hollow trees, or underground. However, in subtropical and humid environments, traditional caching can lead to mold growth, decomposition, or premature germination. To counteract these challenges, some squirrels, particularly in subtropical zones, hang nuts or mushrooms on tree branches. This behavior, believed to minimize fungal infections and reduce the risk of food loss, also inadvertently aids certain trees, like Cyclobalanopsis, in expanding their range, with forgotten or dislodged nuts sprouting in new locations, influencing forest ecology. Two species of flying squirrel, the particolored flying squirrel and Hainan flying squirrel aid such cacheing by carving grooves into the nuts to fix the nuts tightly between small intersecting twigs, akin to the mortise-tenon joint in carpentry.

=== Feeding ===


Because squirrels cannot digest cellulose, they must rely on foods rich in protein, carbohydrates, and fats. In temperate regions, early spring is the hardest time of year for squirrels because the nuts they buried are beginning to sprout (and thus are no longer available to eat), while many of the usual food sources are not yet available. During these times, squirrels rely heavily on tree buds. Squirrels, being primarily herbivores, eat a wide variety of plants, as well as nuts, seeds, conifer cones, fruits, fungi, and green vegetation. Some squirrels, however, also consume meat, especially when faced with hunger. Squirrels have been known to eat small birds, young snakes, and smaller rodents, as well as bird eggs and insects. Some tropical squirrel species have shifted almost entirely to a diet of insects.

Squirrels, like pigeons and other fauna, are synanthropes, in that they benefit and thrive from their interaction in human environments. This gradual process of successful interaction is called synurbanization, wherein squirrels lose their inherent fear of humans in an urban environment. When squirrels were almost completely eradicated during the Industrial Revolution in New York, they were later re-introduced to &quot;entertain and remind&quot; humans of nature. The squirrel blended into the urban environment so efficiently that when synanthropic behavior stops (i.e. people do not leave trash outside during particularly cold winters), they can become aggressive in their search for food.

Aggression and predatory behavior has been observed in various species of ground squirrels, in particular the thirteen-lined ground squirrel. For example, Bernard Bailey, a scientist in the 1920s, observed a thirteen-lined ground squirrel preying upon a young chicken. Wistrand reported seeing this same species eating a freshly killed snake. There has also been at least one report of squirrels preying on atypical animals, such as an incident in 2005 where a pack of black squirrels killed and ate a large stray dog in Lazo, Russia. Squirrel attacks on humans are exceedingly rare, but do occur.

Whitaker examined the stomachs of 139 thirteen-lined ground squirrels and found bird flesh in four of the specimens and the remains of a short-tailed shrew in one; Bradley, examining the stomachs of white-tailed antelope squirrels, found at least 10% of his 609 specimens&#x27; stomachs contained some type of vertebrate, mostly lizards and rodents. Morgart observed a white-tailed antelope squirrel capturing and eating a silky pocket mouse.

== Taxonomy ==

The living squirrels are divided into five subfamilies, with about 58 genera and some 285 species. The oldest squirrel fossil, &quot;Hesperopetes&quot;, dates back to the Chadronian (late Eocene, about 40–35 million years ago) and is similar to modern flying squirrels.

A variety of fossil squirrels, from the latest Eocene to the Miocene, have not been assigned with certainty to any living lineage. At least some of these probably were variants of the oldest basal &quot;protosquirrels&quot; (in the sense that they lacked the full range of living squirrels&#x27; autapomorphies). The distribution and diversity of such ancient and ancestral forms suggest the squirrels as a group may have originated in North America.

Apart from these sometimes little-known fossil forms, the phylogeny of the living squirrels is fairly straightforward. The three main lineages are the Ratufinae (Oriental giant squirrels), Sciurillinae and all other subfamilies. The Ratufinae contain a mere handful of living species in tropical Asia. The neotropical pygmy squirrel of tropical South America is the sole living member of the Sciurillinae. The third lineage, by far the largest, has a near-cosmopolitan distribution. This further supports the hypothesis that the common ancestor of all squirrels, living and fossil, lived in North America, as these three most ancient lineages seem to have radiated from there; if squirrels had originated in Eurasia, for example, one would expect quite ancient lineages in Africa, but African squirrels seem to be of more recent origin.

The main group of squirrels can be split into five subfamilies: the Callosciurinae, 60 species mostly found in South East Asia; the Ratufinae, 4 cat-sized species found in south and southeast Asia; the Sciurinae, which contains the flying squirrels (Pteromyini) and the tree squirrels, 83 species found worldwide; Sciurillinae, a single South American species; and Xerinae, which includes three tribes of mostly terrestrial squirrels, including the Marmotini (marmots, chipmunks, prairie dogs, and other Holarctic ground squirrels), Xerini (African and some Eurasian ground squirrels), and Protoxerini (African tree squirrels).

<text>Shooting is the act or process of discharging a projectile from a ranged weapon (such as a gun, bow, crossbow, slingshot, or blowpipe). Even the acts of launching flame, artillery, darts, harpoons, grenades, rockets, and guided missiles can be considered acts of shooting. When using a firearm, the act of shooting is often called firing as it involves initiating a combustion (deflagration) of chemical propellants.

Shooting can take place in a shooting range or in the field, in shooting sports, hunting, or in combat. The person involved in the shooting activity is called a shooter. A skilled, accurate shooter is a &quot;marksman&quot; or &quot;sharpshooter&quot;, and a person&#x27;s level of shooting proficiency is referred to as their &quot;marksmanship&quot;.

==Competitive shooting==
Shooting has inspired competition, and in several countries rifle clubs started to form in the 19th century. Soon international shooting events evolved, including shooting at the Summer and Winter Olympics (from 1896) and World Championships (from 1897). The International Shooting Sport Federation still administers Olympic and non-Olympic rifle, pistol, shotgun, and running target shooting competitions, although there is also a large number of national and international shooting sports controlled by unrelated organizations.

Shooting technique differs depending on factors like the type of firearm used (from a handgun to a precision rifle); the distance to and nature of the target; the required precision; and the available time. Breathing and position play an important role when handling a handgun or a rifle. Some shooting sports, such as IPSC shooting and biathlon also include movement. The prone position, kneeling position, and standing position offer different amounts of support for the shooter.

== Hunting with guns ==
In the United Kingdom shooting often refers to the activity of hunting game birds such as grouse or pheasants, or small game such as rabbits, with guns. A shooter is sometimes referred to as a &quot;gun&quot;. Shooting may also refer to the culling of vermin with guns. Clay pigeon shooting is meant to simulate shooting pigeons released from traps after live birds were banned in the United Kingdom in 1921.

==Weapons==
Shooting most often refers to the use of a gun (firearm or air gun), although it can also be used to describe discharging of any ranged weapons like a bow, crossbow, slingshot, or even blowpipe. The term &quot;weapon&quot; does not necessarily mean it is used as a combat tool, but as a piece of equipment to help the user best achieve the hit on their intended targets.

Shooting is also used in warfare, self-defense, crime, and law enforcement. Duels were sometimes held using guns. Shooting without a target has applications such as celebratory gunfire, 21-gun salute, or firing starting pistols, incapable of releasing bullets.

==Restrictions==

In many countries, there are restrictions on what kind of firearm can be bought and by whom, leading to debate about how effective such measures are and the extent to which they should be applied. For example, attitudes towards guns and shooting in the United States are very different from those in the United Kingdom and Australia.

==Shooting positions==

The National Rifle Association of America defines four basic &quot;competition&quot; or &quot;field&quot; shooting positions. In order of steadiness/stability (the closer you get to the ground, the steadier you are), they are prone, sitting, kneeling, and standing (also called &quot;offhand&quot;).

Hythe positions (Hythe School of Musketry was formed in 1853 to teach the army how to use the rifle in kneeling and standing positions), American and French positions were known variations of the kneeling and standing positions utilised by their respective armies.

Another common, but aided, shooting position is the bench shooting position. There are also numerous shooting aids from monopods to tripods to sandbags and complete gun cradles.

===Prone===

* The steadiest and by far the easiest to master. Done correctly. it can be as steady as shooting from a bench rest.
* Probably the least used in the field because, all too often, vegetation gets in the way and obscures the view.
* Variations:
** classic – with the body at an angle (left for right-handed people, right for left-handed)
** modern – with the body more directly behind the rifle with the shooter&#x27;s strong side leg slightly bent.
* Test for correct body position: wrap your arm into the hasty sling and drop down into prone, sighting at the target. Close your eyes. When you open them you should still be aiming at the target. If you are not, then your position is off. Also, if the shooter&#x27;s sight picture returns after the firm kicks to each muzzle, then body alignment is good. If not, adjustment is needed.
* Usual advice is to use a sling for this position
* Aided prone position – prone with pack or bipod

===Sitting===

* This position is relatively easy to get into, but more difficult to get out of quickly and provides clearance for low to medium-height obstacles that would interfere with the prone position.
* Proper sitting position is extremely difficult to master.
* Variations:
** open leg
** cross leg (aka pretzel style) – the steadiest sitting position.
** cross ankle
* The test for correct body position is the same as prone.
* Usual advice is to use a sling for this position.
* Aided sitting position – sitting with tripod

===Kneeling===

* There were numerous variations of the position throughout history.
* Best for times when shooter needs to shoot quickly, but it is a bit too far (or he is breathing a bit too hard) to risk a shot from the standing position.
* Considerably steadier than standing position.
* For most people it is not nearly as steady as sitting but it is much faster to get in and out of.
** For some people this position can be almost as steady as the prone position.
* Strong-side knee is on the ground, weak-side knee and foot are pointing at the target while weak-side knee is supporting the elbow (It is important that the bony tip of the elbow not be planted on top of the knee cap – bone-on-bone contact allows for too much movement or it can slip.) 
* Variations:
** sitting on strong-side foot
** with strong-side foot flat
** sitting on the strong-side foot&#x27;s heel with the toes grounded
* Usual advice is to use a sling for this position.
*Aided kneeling position – kneeling with crossed sticks or tripod

===Standing (or offhand)===
* The quickest position to assume and is useful for quick shots and for shooting over objects.
* By far is the least steadiest of all positions. A common trait is a bit of sway in this position. The trick is learning to control the sway and fire when the shooter is at his steadiest. Breathing exercises help in maintaining the balance of the body in this position.
* The most difficult position to shoot from and to master. Mostly common among both air pistol and air rifle shooters shooting from different ranges (10m,25m,50m).
* Stock fit is essential in standing – perhaps more than in any other position. Shooter needs to have his cheek firmly welded to the stock.
* Variations:
** squared toward the target – advantages of this technique are that it allows the shooter to absorb the rifle&#x27;s recoil much more effectively, to run the bolt and get back on target quickly. It also places the shooter in a more aggressive stance that allows him to move, in just about any direction, as his target requires.
** bladed stance of the rifle marksman
* Usual advice is not to use the sling for support in this position.
*Aided standing position
**Standing with sticks and stones
*** Three-legged shooting sticks are almost universal in Africa.
*** Whatever shooter&#x27;s comfortable range is for offhand shooting, sticks should double it.

=== Rice paddy squat in rifle shooting ===

The rice paddy squat (or rice paddy prone) position is a moderate-stability position that supports both elbows, making it more stable than kneeling yet keeping a high level of mobility. Its higher center of gravity will still be less stable than sitting or prone. It was a traditionally taught marksmanship position but lost popularity after the Korean conflict.

===Back (or supine)===
It was sometimes referred to as the Creedmoor position. There are a number of variations of the position. It was known in the latter half of the 18th century, and later revived by a small number of shooters in the 1860s with the introduction of competitive long range shooting at the NRA rifle meetings and continued in use into the 20th century amongst match riflemen. The position was really developed during the 1870s as a consequence of great interest in long range shooting associated with the international matches. Back position provided the most stable platform for the rifle in those competitions where no artificial support, including slings, was permitted. It was even superior to shooting prone unsupported.

===Lying on one&#x27;s side===
Lying on one&#x27;s side is not a normally chosen position, but may be a position fallen into when reacting to a threat. In this scenario, it may be used behind a barricade to present a very small target since normally only the gun hand and a piece of one&#x27;s face is exposed, with the rest covered by the barricade.

===Leaning===
When a shooter is leaning on something like a wall, a tree or post. The rifle barrel should not be rested against it because it is steadier to lean the body. It&#x27;s usually combined with standing and kneeling positions.

==Slings==
;Shooting sling

The sling is used to create isometric pressure to increase steadiness. While the use of a sling is of questionable value when shooting from the standing position, it is very much worth using from kneeling, sitting or prone. It was also used in back position in which case the sling is looped around the foot and it is this that takes the recoil. Proper use of the sling locks the rifle into the body and enhances that solid foundation so critical to delivering an accurate shot. 
;;Hasty sling
A type of shooting sling. All positions are strengthened through the use of a &quot;hasty sling&quot;. The formal &quot;tight sling&quot; is detached from the rear sling swivel and tightened above the bicep of the supporting arm. Almost any carrying strap can be used in the &quot;hasty sling&quot; mode. There is often a compromise between the most comfortable &quot;carry&quot; length for shooter&#x27;s sling and the ideal tension for a &quot;hasty sling&quot;. The steadiness achieved is almost as good as a &quot;tight competition sling&quot; and it is a lot faster.

==Competitions==
In ISSF shooting events, 3 out of 7 shooting positions are used. Positions not used are supine, sitting, rice paddy squat and side position.

WBSF governs benchrest shooting.

IPSC shooting events use prone, offhand and supported shooting positions.

There are some competitions, such as felthurtigskyting, in which shooting position is freestyle. That means that the shooter decides which one of the four positions they&#x27;ll use.

<text>Shooting sports is a group of competitive and recreational sporting activities involving proficiency tests of accuracy, precision and speed in shooting — the art of using ranged weapons, mainly small arms (firearms and airguns, in forms such as handguns, rifles and shotguns) and bows/crossbows.

Shooting sports can be categorized by equipment, shooting distances, targets, time limits and degrees of athleticism involved. Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition, and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members. Due to the noise of shooting and the high (and often lethal) impact energy of the projectiles, shooting sports are typically conducted at either designated permanent shooting ranges or temporary shooting fields in the area away from settlements.

== History ==
===Great Britain===
The National Rifle Association (NRA) was founded in 1859 to raise the funds for an annual national rifle meeting &quot;for the encouragement of Volunteer Rifle Corps and the promotion of Rifle-shooting throughout Great Britain&quot;.

===United States===
Target shooting was a favorite sport in colonial America, with the New England Puritans regularly testing their shooting skills for recreation and at militia training days. The Scotch Irish settlers on the frontier favored shooting matches sponsored by Tavern keepers. Turkey shoots were popular after harvest time. Contestants would pay an entry fee, and everyone who killed a tethered turkey at 110 yards for muskets or 165 yards for rifles could keep the bird. German gunsmiths in Pennsylvania began to manufacture Flintlock rifles in the 1720s, which became especially popular among hunters because of its long-range accuracy. It could be accurate to 200 yards. Along about 1820, percussion caps, and the locks that ignited them, became available, and nearly all new firearms began to be constructed using this ignition system. Many flintlock firearms were also subsequently converted to the percussion system, which was a relatively simple procedure that could be accomplished by local gunsmiths. Although percussion ignition did not add to the accuracy of the firearm, the time between when the firearm firing mechanism (or &quot;lock&quot;) started the sequence that lead to the ignition of the propellant in the barrel, was shortened drastically. This made getting smaller shot groups on the target more attainable as the possibility of the firearm moving off the aiming point after the shooter pressed the trigger was lessened. This shortened ignition time, which is referred to as &quot;lock time&quot; was (and still is) a very important factor in target shooting. The closed design of the percussion system materially improved reliability of the firearm, especially in rainy or damp conditions. The faster &quot;lock time&quot; also made hitting fast-moving aerial targets with a cloud of tiny lead pellets (&quot;shot&quot;) fired from a smooth-bore firearm a real possibility. Practicing for game hunting by shooting at artificial aerial targets launched from spring-powered launching devices (&quot;traps&quot;) became highly popular and led to the development of the modern Trap, Skeet, and Sporting Clays shooting sports.

In 1831 a sportsman club in Cincinnati Ohio held a competitive shoot at pigeons and quail released from ground traps. German ethnic communities set up athletic clubs and shooting clubs, especially in the Midwestern states In the 1850–1917. period Breach loading shotguns introduced in the 1860s, and the knowledge of rifles by Civil War soldiers, made trap shooting popular. However, there was human humanitarian opposition to killing live birds—and the passenger pigeon was dying out—so glass or clay targets were used instead.

Concerned over poor marksmanship during the American Civil War, veteran Union officers Col. William C. Church and Gen. George Wingate formed the National Rifle Association of America in 1871 for the purpose of promoting and encouraging rifle shooting on a &quot;scientific&quot; basis. In 1872, with financial help from New York state, a site on Long Island, the Creed Farm, was purchased for the purpose of building a rifle range. Named Creedmoor, the range opened in 1872, and became the site of the first National Matches until New York politics forced the NRAoA to move the matches to Sea Girt, New Jersey. The popularity of the National Matches soon forced the event to be moved to its present, much larger location: Camp Perry. In 1903, the U.S. Congress created the National Board for the Promotion of Rifle Practice (NBPRP), an advisory board to the Secretary of the Army, with a nearly identical charter to the NRAoA. The NBPRP (now known as the Civilian Marksmanship Program) also participates in the National Matches at Camp Perry.

In 1903, the NRA of America began to establish rifle clubs at all major colleges, universities, and military academies. By 1906, youth programs were in full swing with more than 200 boys competing in the National Matches. Today, more than one million youth participate in shooting sports events and affiliated programs through groups such as 4-H, the Boy Scouts of America, the American Legion, U.S. Jaycees, NCAA, The USA High School Clay Target League, the Scholastic Clay Target Program, National Guard Bureau, ROTC, and JROTC.

===Olympics===
French pistol champion and founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin, participated in many of these early competitions. This fact certainly contributed to the inclusion of five shooting events in the 1896 Olympics. Over the years, the events have been changed a number of times in order to keep up with technology and social standards. The targets that formerly resembled humans or animals in their shape and size have are now a circular shape in order to avoid associating the sport with any form of violence. At the same time, some events have been dropped and new ones have been added. The 2004 Olympics featured three shooting disciplines (rifle, pistol, and shotgun) where athletes competed for 51 medals in 10 men&#x27;s and 7 women&#x27;s events—slightly fewer than the previous Olympic schedule.

In the Olympic Games, the shooting sport has always enjoyed the distinction of awarding the first medals of the Games. Internationally, the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) has oversight of all Olympic shooting events worldwide, while National Governing Bodies (NGBs) administer the sport within each country.

==Competition disciplines==
Shooting at the Summer Olympics includes fifteen medal events, covering seven disciplines. Medal events are evenly distributed between rifle, pistol and shotgun with five events each. Three Mixed Pairs events were introduced to ensure gender equity between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events. They replaced 50m Prone Rifle, 50m Free Pistol and Double Trap which were all men-only events.

;Rifle
*50 meter rifle three positions (individual - men and women)
*10 meter air rifle (individual - men and women)
*10 meter air rifle (mixed pairs)
;Pistol
*25 meter rapid fire pistol (individual - men)
*25 meter sport pistol (individual - women)
*10 meter air pistol (individual - men and women)
*10 meter air pistol (mixed pairs)
;Shotgun
*Trap (men and women)
*Skeet (individual - men and women)
*Skeet (mixed pairs)

== Gun shooting sports ==

Gun shooting sports are shot with either firearms or air guns, which can be handguns, rifles or shotguns.

Handguns are handheld small arms designed to be shot off-hand without needing a shoulder stock. The two main subtypes of handguns are pistols and revolvers. They are much more convenient to carry in general, but usually have a shorter effective range and less accuracy compared to long guns such as rifles. In shooting sports, revolvers and semi-automatic pistols are the most commonly used.

A rifle is a long gun with a rifled barrel, and requires the use of both hands to hold and brace against the shoulder via a stock in order to shoot steadily. They generally have a longer range and greater accuracy than handguns, and are popular for hunting. In shooting sports, bolt-action or semi-automatic rifles are the most commonly used.

A shotgun is similar to a rifle but often smoothbore and larger in caliber, and typically fires either a shell containing many smaller scattering sub-projectiles called shots, or a single large projectile called a slug. In shooting sports, shotguns are more often over/under-type break action or semi-automatic shotguns, and the majority of shotgun events are included in clay pigeon shooting.

=== Bullseye shooting ===

&quot;Bullseye shooting&quot; is a category of pistol and rifle shooting disciplines where the objective is to achieve as many points as possible by hitting a round shooting target as close to the middle as possible with slow precision fire. These disciplines place a large emphasis on precision and accuracy through sight picture, breath and trigger control. Fixed and relatively long time limits give the competitors time to concentrate for a perfect shot. An example of bullseye shooting is the ISSF pistol and rifle disciplines, but there are also many other national and international disciplines which can be classified as bullseye shooting. The shooting distances are typically given in round numbers, such as 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 meters depending on firearm type and discipline. Competitions are usually shot from permanent shooting ranges and with the same target arrangement and distance from match to match. Usually the competitors each have their own shooting target and shoot beside each other simultaneously. Because of the relatively simple match format, beginners are often recommended bullseye shooting in order to learn the fundamentals of marksmanship. Bullseye shooting is part of the Summer Olympic Games, and a considerable amount of training is needed to become proficient.

==== Bullseye shooting with handguns ====
* There are six ISSF shooting events with pistols. These include three Olympic events, plus three events not included in the Olympic program but contested at World Championships. Their roots date back to the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, consisting of both precision slow-fire and rapid-fire target shooting from distances of 10, 25, and 50 meters. The specialised pistols offer anatomic grips, with competitors shooting one-handed. In the UK (except for Northern Ireland), it is no longer possible to practice for some of the Olympic events following the Firearms (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1997, legislation brought in after the Dunblane Massacre.
* The CISM Rapid Fire match is similar to the ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol event.
* NRA Precision Pistol is a bullseye shooting event where up to 3 handguns of differing calibers are used. Its history is almost as old as ISSF events. Shooters must fire the pistol one-handed at 6- and 8-inch bullseye targets placed 25 and 50 yards downrange respectively.
* Precision Pistol Competition (PPC), was originally a police shooting program started in 1960 by the National Rifle Association of America.

==== Bullseye shooting with rifles ====
* The six rifle ISSF shooting events (including two Olympic events: 10 meter air rifle and 50 meter rifle three positions) consist of slow-fire target shooting from distances of .
* Fullbore target rifle involves prone shooting with single-shot rifles at distances of 300yds to 1200yds. It is particularly popular in Britain and within the Commonwealth of Nations (mostly former constituents of the British Empire).
* Gallery rifle shooting is popular in the UK, using carbine rifles chambered in pistol calibres. Gallery Rifle was introduced as a substitute for many pistol shooting disciplines following the 1997 handgun ban.
* High Power Rifle (also known as &quot;Across the Course&quot; or &#x27;traditional&#x27; High power) in the United States is a format that shoots 3-position (standing, kneeling, or sitting, and prone) at 200, 300, and 600 yards. The term &quot;Across the Course&quot; is used because the match format requires the competitors to shoot at different distances to complete the course of fire.
* Military Service Rifle shooting is a shooting discipline that involves the use of rifles that are used by military forces and law-enforcement agencies, both past and present use. Ex-military rifles, sniper rifles (both past and present) and civilian versions of current use service rifles are commonly used in the Military Service Rifle shooting competitions. It is popular in the United States and culminates each year with the National Matches being held at Camp Perry, Ohio. Some countries have outlawed civilian shooting at human-silhouette targets; silhouette targets are not used in the National Match Course of Fire. Bullseye targets are used. High Power Rifle competition often is held at the same events as Service Rifle, such as the U.S. national championships each year at Camp Perry. High Power competitors generally are civilians using whatever rifles they prefer within the rules, whereas Service Rifle entrants are limited to current or previous U.S. armed forces weapons. Under NRA of America rules only certain matches allow optical sights, normally those conducted at ranges over 600 yards.
* Project Appleseed is a rifle marksmanship program by The Revolutionary War Veterans Association that teaches both rifle marksmanship and oral history regarding the American Revolutionary War. It shoots 3-position (standing, sitting, and prone) at 25 meters at reduced scale targets, simulating shooting at 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards. The techniques taught easily apply to transitioning to High Power Rifle.
* Full bore and small bore rifle shooting in the United Kingdom.
* Three position airgun competitions, popular in the United States.
* Four position small bore is a popular sport in the U.S, which adds Sitting to the Three positions used internationally.

=== Field shooting ===
Field-Shooting or Terrain-Shooting refer to a set of pistol and rifle shooting disciplines that usually are shot from temporary shooting ranges in outdoor terrain at varying (and sometimes unknown) distances, rather than at permanent shooting ranges at fixed distances.

==== Field shooting with handguns ====
* Nordic Handgun Field-Shooting competitions are shot with pistol and revolver in different classes depending on equipment, with classes up from small-bore .22 LR to large-bore .500 S&amp;W Magnum. Matches are held outdoor throughout the year with varied shooting targets and distances, and are arranged by the Norwegian Shooting Association (NSF), the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI Shooting) and the Swedish Pistol Shooting Association (SPSF).
* Swiss field shooting with handguns is a discipline under the Swiss Shooting Sport Federation arranged under a common Swiss ruleset, and has been part of the annual field shooting championship since 1919 alongside field shooting with rifles, which have been arranged since 1899.

==== Field shooting with rifles ====
* Nordic Rifle Field-Shooting are shot with either small-bore .22 LR cartridge at 100 meters, or intermediate (such as .223 Remington or 6mm BR) or battle rifle cartridges (such as the 6.5×55mm, .308 Winchester or the .30-06 Springfield) at distances from 100 to 650 meters. With 200 and 300 meters being ordinary shooting distance in Nordic Bullseye Rifle-Shooting, those targets placed well beyond 300 meters in Rifle Field-Shooting means that the competition format also can be classified as a long range shooting discipline. Matches are usually held in the winter season with varied targets, and are arranged by the National Rifle Association of Norway (DFS), the Danish Gymnastics and Sports Associations (DGI Shooting) and the Swedish Shooting Sport Association (SvSF). 
* Swiss field shooting with rifles is a discipline under the Swiss Shooting Sport Federation arranged under a common Swiss ruleset. The annual Swiss Field Shooting Championship has been held since 1899. From 1919, Swiss field shooting with handguns has also been av part of the Swiss Field Shooting Championship.
* Precision rifle competitions, like the Precision Rifle Series (PRS), is both a field and long range shooting discipline where rifles with intermediate or battle rifle cartridges are shot in the terrain at varying distances from about 10 to 1000 meters.
* Field Target is an outdoor air gun discipline originating in the United Kingdom, but gaining popularity worldwide. Hunter field target is a variation of field target.

=== Rapid fire ===
==== Rapid fire with handguns ====
* The ISSF 25 meter pistol and ISSF 25 meter rapid fire pistol events are contested at the Olympic Games.
* The Bianchi Cup, a fusion of IPSC (without the &quot;run and gun&quot; element) and bullseye shooting (except shot with two hands and going prone whenever rules allow it) where accuracy under tight time limits in four simulated scenarios, known as the &quot;Event(s)&quot;, is the basis of this competition. Shooters must start with gun in the holster on every strings of fire and distances range from 10 to 50 yards.
* Fast draw, also known as quick draw, a form of pistol action shooting from North America, based on the romanticized art of the gunslingers in the American Old West, using traditional single action revolvers. But unlike Cowboy action shooting, Fast Draw is done with special blanks or wax bullets. While some competitions are strictly against the clock, with the fastest time winning, many are set up as head-to-head single or double elimination matches.

==== Rapid fire with rifles ====
* The CISM Rapid Fire match is a sped-up version of the ISSF 300 m Standard Rifle event.
* Felthurtigskyting (literally Field Rapid Shooting) and Stangskyting are a type of variable rapid-fire rifle competitions popular in Scandinavia.

=== Clay target ===

Clay pigeon shooting are shotgun disciplines shot at flying clay pigeon targets.

* The three Shotgun ISSF/ Olympic shooting events are all are based on quick reaction to clay targets thrown by machines called &quot;Traps&quot;.
** Skeet: Targets are either thrown in singles or doubles from two throwers called &quot;traps&quot; placed 40 meters apart.
** Trap and Double Trap: Either one (trap) or two targets (double trap) are thrown from 15 meters in front of the shooter.
* The Fédération Internationale de Tir aux Armes Sportives de Chasse (FITASC) Compak Sporting is a type of shotgun sport shooting similar to sporting clays, trap and skeet.
* Other shotgun sports with (at least partial) international recognition include Sporting Clays, Down-The-Line/ATA and Five stand.

=== Running target ===
Running target shooting refers to a number of disciplines involving a shooting target—sometimes called a boar, moose, or deer—that is made to move as if it is a running animal. Events of this type include:

* ISSF 10 meter running target
* ISSF 10 meter running target mixed
* ISSF 50 meter running target
* ISSF 50 meter running target mixed
* 100 m running moose, popular in Scandinavia both as a sport and hunting exercise. Competitions in Sweden are held at 80 meters.
* 100 meter running deer, also somewhat popular in Scandinavia and Great Britain

====Moving target====
Shooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men&#x27;s moving target small-bore rifle

====Disappearing target====
Shooting at the 1908 Summer Olympics – Men&#x27;s disappearing target small-bore rifle

=== Practical shooting ===
Practical shooting, also known as action shooting or dynamic shooting, is a generic term applicable to shooting sports where speed is of equal importance as precision. Many of the disciplines involve movement, and when using handguns they are often drawn from a holster.
* The International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC) is the oldest and largest sanctioning body within practical shooting. IPSC is sometimes considered the &quot;Formula One&quot; of shooting sports, and is shot with handguns, rifles and shotguns. While the United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA) is the U.S. regional affiliate of IPSC, many of USPSA&#x27;s rules differ slightly from those used internationally. IPSC was developed by former police and civilian marksmen and later used as a basis for modern military and police exercises. It is a variation where the shooter often moves during shooting, and hits scored and shooting time are equally important. Stage procedure is generally not dictated (freestyle) and the shooter is allowed to determine the order and manner in which he or she engages the targets.
* International Defensive Pistol Association (IDPA) is an action shooting sport that uses semi-automatic handguns and revolvers with a strong emphasis on concealed shooting. Many aspects of stage engagement are dictated to competitors and penalties are given to competitors whom the safety officer determines attempted to gain a competitive advantage or engaged in a forbidden action with a &quot;guilty mind&quot; - that he knowingly failed to do right.
* Multigun are practical shooting events where each of the stages generally require the competitor to use and transition between a combination of rifles, handguns, and/ or shotguns or other types of firearms. 3-Gun has a lot in common with ordinary IPSC/USPSA matches, having courses of fire where the shooter must move through different stages and engage targets in a variety of different positions.
* Steel Challenge is a speed shooting championship solely about shooting steel targets as fast as possible, and is governed by the Steel Challenge Shooting Association (SCSA). There are eight standardized courses of fire, and a special &quot;stop plate&quot; must be shot last to stop the timer.
* International Confederation of Revolver Enthusiasts (ICORE) is an international community that promotes action shooting competitions with revolvers. Founded in 1991, the sport has elements from the Bianchi Cup, IPSC, and the Steel Challenge.
* IPSC Action Air follows the same principle of IPSC, using airsoft instead of real firearms. The ranges, paper targets and poppers are scaled down to suit airsoft, and the sport enjoys popularity in countries such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan where civilian ownership of real firearms are either illegal or extremely difficult to obtain.
* Bowling pin shooting (primarily shot with handguns) has the competitors race against one another to knock standard bowling pins from a table in the shortest elapsed time.

=== Long range ===
Long range shooting is shooting held at such distances that sight adjustment based from judging atmospherical conditions become critical.

* Fullbore target shooting is concerned with shooting at targets at ranges of 300–1200 yards. The sport is internationally governed by ICFRA, and is popular in the UK, US, Germany and Commonwealth countries. Similar disciplines called bullseye and field shooting are popular in Scandinavia, although fired at shorter distances.
** &quot;Target Rifle&quot; (also known as Palma rifle) is an ICFRA fullbore competition format that dates from 1876, featuring long-range rifle shooting out to 1,000 yards. The first Palma match was contested by teams from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Scotland and Ireland (with muzzle loaded rifles at that time). The matches continued to the late 1920s, and the Palma trophy was eventually lost in Washington DC around the outbreak of WW2. The match was revived in the modern era in 1966 in Canada, and continues between teams from around the world. Regulations stipulate bolt-action rifles chambered in 7.62mm NATO caliber (Winchester .308) and firing Match Grade ammunition using a 155 grain bullet using micrometer aperture (iron) sights, or a 5.56mm NATO (.223 Remington) with a max bullet weight of 90 grains, and iron sights. Due to developments in modern bullet technology, an 85.5 grain bullet out of a .223 can out shoot a .308, with the right load. The last two International Long-range Target Rifle Matches were held in Australia in 2011 and the U.S. in 2015, were won by Great Britain.
** F-Class is another ICFRA fullbore competition format shot with Fullbore Target Rifles at ranges up to 1000 yards, the rifles being fitted with telescopic sights and the use of fore-end and butt rests being permitted. This is a fast-growing variant of Fullbore Target Rifle. The &#x27;F&#x27; honours George Farquharson, the Canadian inventor of F-Class.
*Precision Rifle Competitions, a relatively new long range competition format which seeks to find a balance between speed and precision, often involving movement and shooting from unusual positions with a time limit, at both known and unknown distances.
**National Rifle League (NRL) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to the growth and education of precision rifle shooting in the United States. Their match format allows any caliber between .224 to .308 and not to exceed , involving at least 50 shooters with each firing minimum 140 rounds in at least 12 individual stages, over the course of at least two days. Since its debut in 2017, currently 11 clubs from eight states are involved in the league.
**National Rifle League 22 (NRL22) is a sub-league under the National Rifle League dedicated to .22 Long Rifle rimfire rifles. It was established to address the fact that most localities do not have access to 1000 yard ranges, but nearly all localities have 100-yard ranges and most shooters own .22 rifles. Their championship match consist of minimum 170 rounds fired in at least 15 individual stages. Currently 68 clubs from 31 states in the US participate in NRL22 matches, with addition to two overseas clubs from UK and Australia.
* T-Class Shooting Sport Competitions. Practical sniping with precision rifle systems is a shooting sport, which gains tremendous popularity worldwide over a short period of time. It concentrates on shooting onto static or dynamic targets of various distances (known and unknown), from different positions, under artificially created, but realistic stressful circumstances. It proves to be extremely interesting both for implementation and observation, due to its demanding level of difficulty. The International T-Class Confederation (ITCC) is a non-profit organization, which is founded in 2014 for the purpose of promotion of the T-Class shooting sport internationally, with headquarters residing in Bulgaria. It offers a Set of Rules for designing and managing T-Class Competitions.

=== Benchrest ===
Benchrest shooting is concerned with shooting small groups with the rifleman sitting on a chair (bench) and the rifle supported from a table. Of all shooting disciplines, this is the most demanding equipment-wise. Depending on equipment class, international benchrest competitions are governed by either the World Benchrest Shooting Federation or World Rimfire and Air Rifle Benchrest Federation.

=== Metallic silhouette ===
Metallic silhouette competitors shoot at animal-shaped steel silhouettes (chickens, pigs, turkeys and rams) that must be knocked down to score. Banks of 5 targets are placed at up to 500 meters, with distance and size of target determined by firearm class. Classes include Handguns, Small Bore Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), High Power Rifle (Hunter, Silhouette), air rifle and black powder rifle. Handguns used in the Unlimited Categories are rifle-like in appearance; Thompson Contender, Remington XP-100, and other pistols are chambered in rifle calibers with the power, aerodynamic efficiency, and external ballistics required for precise shooting at 200 meters. There are silhouette categories appropriate for virtually all types of adjustable sight pistols and rifles, only excluding high-velocity armor-piercing rounds that would damage targets. Targets for open sighted guns are placed between 25 and 200 meters, and are designed to provide a usable size of the hit zone of about 1.5 milliradians (or 5 minutes of arc).

=== Western ===
* Cowboy action shooting (CAS) is almost identical to USPSA and IDPA stage design but with Western cowboy-themed props. Competitors shoot with historical long guns and revolvers, and are required to use a themed alias and authentic dress.
* Cowboy mounted shooting, also called Western Mounted Shooting or simply Mounted Shooting, is a competitive equestrian sport involving the riding of a horse to negotiate a shooting pattern. Rule sets vary between shooting sport organizations, it can be based on the historical reenactment of historic shooting events held at Wild West shows in the late 19th century. Modern events use blank ammunition instead of live rounds, certified to break a target balloon within twenty feet.

=== Muzzleloading ===
Muzzleloading are concerned with shooting replica (or antique) guns.

=== Para shooting ===
Paralympic shooting, also known as &quot;shooting Para sport&quot;, is an adaptation of shooting sports for competitors with disabilities. Paralympic shooting first appeared in the Summer Paralympics at the 1976 Toronto Games. Para shooting is internationally governed by the International Paralympic Committee. To help establish fair competition, a shooting classification called Para-shooting classification is in place for the Paralympic Games.

The events mirror to some extent the shooting events at the Olympic Games. Air Pistol is typically shot from a seated position with the pistol unsupported. The amount of back-support permitted is determined by the athlete&#x27;s level of disability. The Air Rifle events include Rifle &quot;Standing&quot;, which is shot seated like Air Pistol, with variable levels of back support. &quot;Prone&quot; Rifle uses the basic prone shooting position utilising a sling for the supporting arm, but is shot rested on a table with the athlete seated either in a chair or wheelchair.

=== Competitions using factory and service firearms ===
Shooting competitions for factory and service firearms, usually called Service Rifle, Service Pistol, Production, Factory or Stock, describe a set of disciplines or equipment classes where the types of permitted firearms are subject to type approval and few aftermarket modifications are permitted. Thus the terms refer to permitted equipment and modifications rather than the type of shooting format itself. The names Service Rifle and Service Pistol stem from that the equipment permitted for these types of competitions traditionally were based on standard issue firearms used by one or several armed forces and civilian versions of these, while the terms Production, Factory and Stock often are applied to more modern disciplines with similar restrictions on equipment classes. Factory and service classes are often &quot;restrictive&quot; in nature, and the types of firearms permitted are usually rugged, versatile and affordable. In comparison, more expensive custom competition equipment are popular in more &quot;permissive&quot; equipment classes. Both types of equipment classes can be found within many disciplines, such as bullseye, field, practical and long range shooting.

=== Plinking ===
Plinking refers to informal target shooting done for pleasure or practice typically at non-standard targets such as tin cans, logs, cartons, fruits, or any other homemade or naturally occurring objects like rocks (however, it is unsafe to shoot at rocks) or tree branches. The primary appeals of plinking as a sport are the broad variety of easily available locations, minimal costs, freedom in practice styles, and more relaxing and less restrictive shooting experience.

The flexibility of target choice is also why plinking is popular. A small, three-dimensional target in an outdoors setting is much more akin to a real-world hunting and varminting scenario, presenting a better simulated opportunity to practice shooting skills. A plinking target will also often react much more positively to a hit than a paper target used in formal competitions, either audibly with a sharp impact sound (hence the name &quot;plink&quot;) or visually by bouncing, splattering or falling over. Steel targets used for formal action and long range shooting competitions are also popular for plinking due to the ease of setting up and confirming good hits.

==Athletic shooting sports==
Athletic shooting sports are hybrid events of normally stationary shooting sport competitions and the sport of athletics or other physically demanding non-shooting sports. Many were borne from military exercises and emphasize physical endurance.

* IBU Biathlon is a Winter Olympic sport combining cross-country skiing (normally freestyle skate skiing) and shooting with .22 LR rifles. In Scandinavia the discipline is simply known as &quot;Ski Shooting&quot; (Swedish: &quot;skidskytte&quot;, Danish: &quot;skiskydning&quot;, Norwegian: &quot;skiskyting&quot;).
* Bike biathlon or &quot;velo biathlon&quot; (Russian &quot;Велобиатлон&quot;) combines cycling (road or mountain bike) and shooting (handgun or rifle).
* ISSF Target Sprint combines medium-range run (3 × 400 m) and airgun shooting.
* Modern pentathlon is a Summer Olympic sport includes a combined event called Laser-run that consists of 4 laps of 800 metres combined with 4 rounds of timed shooting with a laser air pistol as one of its original five parts.
* Nordic Ski Field Shooting (Norwegian: &quot;skifeltskyting&quot;, Swedish: &quot;skidfältskytte&quot;) is a Nordic discipline organised by the National Rifle Association of Norway and the Swedish Shooting Sport Association which is based on the origins of modern biathlon. It is normally held using classic (in-track) skiing, but competitions can also be held in a freestyle skate skiing format. Furthermore, shooting is done with fullbore calibers and usually in the field from temporary shooting ranges. The discipline is considered as a near precursor to modern biathlon.
* Nordic shooting with cross-country running (Norwegian: &quot;skogsløp&quot;, Swedish: &quot;springfältskytte&quot;) is a Nordic discipline arranged by the National Rifle Association of Norway and the Swedish Shooting Sport Association which combines running with shooting. It is considered the summer edition of Ski Field Shooting. Running distances are usually between 2 and 3 kilometers with 2 to 3 shooting series.
* Military patrol was a team winter sport in which athletes competed in cross-country skiing, ski mountaineering and rifle shooting. It was usually contested between countries or military units. 
* Moose biathlon (Finnish &quot;Hirvenhiihto&quot;) is a variation of biathlon comprising cross-country skiing, range estimation and rifle shooting at paper targets of moose. Moose shooting with cross-country running (Finnish &quot;Hirvenjuoksu&quot;) is a summer variant where the skiing part is replaced with running.
* Orienteering shooting (Finnish &quot;ampumasuunnistus&quot;) combines shooting with orienteering, and competitions are organised in Denmark by DMSA, in Sweden by the civilian Swedish Multisport Association and in Finland by the FRSF.
* Pistol shooting with cross-country running (&quot;maastokilpailu&quot;), organized in Finland by the FRSF.
* Pistol skiing (Norwegian &quot;pistollangren&quot;, Swedish &quot;pistolskidskytte&quot;, Finnish &quot;pistooliammuntahiihto&quot;) is biathlon with pistols and revolvers, and is organised in Norway by NROF, in Sweden by SPSA and in Finland by the FRSF.
* Summer biathlon, with skiing replaced by either running or rollerskis, is popular in Germany.
* Ski Archery is a variation of biathlon combining archery marksmanship with cross country skiing.
* Underwater target shooting is a combined underwater and shooting sport that tests a competitors&#x27; ability to accurately use a speargun via a set of individual and team events conducted in a swimming pool using free diving or Apnoea technique.

== Bow shooting sports ==
=== Archery ===
Modern competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy from a set distance or distances. A person who participates in archery is typically called an archer or a bowman, and a person who is fond of or an expert at archery is sometimes called a toxophilite. The most popular competitions worldwide are called target archery. Another form, particularly popular in Europe and America, is field archery, which generally is shot at targets set at various distances in a wooded setting. 3D archery, which differs from field archery in that the targets are animal models, is also quite popular in the same regions. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games. The tournament rules vary from organization to organization. World Archery Federation rules are often considered normative, but large non-WA-affiliated archery organizations do exist with different rules. Competitive archery in the United States is governed by USA Archery and National Field Archery Association (NFAA), which also certifies instructors. Run archery is a shooting discipline connecting archery with running.

=== Crossbow ===

The International Crossbow Shooting Union (&quot;Internationale Armbrustschützen Union&quot; or IAU) was founded in Landshut, Germany on June 24, 1956, as the world governing body for crossbow target shooting. The IAU supervises World, Continental and International crossbow shooting championships in 3 disciplines; 30 m Match-crossbow, 10 m Match-crossbow and Field-crossbow shooting. IAU World Championships take place every two years with Continental Championships on intervening years. Other International and IAU-Cup events take place annually. World Crossbow Shooting Association (WCSA) organises competitions in 7 disciplines: Target, Target match play, Forest, Forest match play, 3D, Bench &amp; prone target and Indoor target.

==Dart shooting sports==
===Sport blowgun===
There are several competition styles of sport blowgun practised around the world. A standardization of competition style is based upon fukiya, and governed by the International Fukiyado Association. It is a 10-metre target shooting, using a standardized barrel caliber and length, and a standardized dart length and weight as outlined by IFA. 
There are two more styles, both based upon the Cherokee Annual Gathering Blowgun Competition. The Field Style competition is similar to the winter Biathlon, where the shooter runs from a starting line to a target lane, shoots and retrieves the darts, and continues to the next station. The course length varies from 400 to 800 m with from 9 to 16 targets at various heights and shooting distances. The final style is the Long Distance target shoot. The target is a circle of 24 cm diameter, and the firing line is 20 m away. Three darts are fired by each shooter, at least one of which must stick in the target. All successful shooters move to the next round, moving back 2 m each time.

==Confrontational shooting sports==
Confrontational shooting sports is a set of relatively new team sports using non-lethal ranged weapons that are safe enough to shoot at other people. Previously such games were not possible due to safety concerns since bows and guns are generally too lethal and dangerous for human targets, but the development of newer airgun and infrared technologies allowed for the development of safe confrontational disciplines. While initially only for sport and recreations, professional sport competitions are now held. These type of games are also used for tactical gunfight training by military and law enforcement agencies to some extent.

===Olympic dueling===
Olympic dueling is an archaic individual sport that sought to safely emulate the deadly practice of pistol duelling, akin to fencing emulating sword fighting. It involved the use of specially built primer-fired pistols to propel wax bullets. Two versions of the sport were demonstration events at the 1906 Olympics and 1908 Olympics. It was also a popular sport in France.

===Paintball===
Paintball is a competitive sport in which players from opposing teams eliminate opponents out of play by hitting them with round, breakable, dye-filled oil and gelatin pellets (&quot;paintballs&quot;), shot from HPA/-powered air guns called paintball markers. It can be played on indoor or outdoor fields scattered with natural or artificial terrain, which players use for tactical cover. Paintball game types vary, but can include capture the flag, elimination, ammunition limits, defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from seconds to hours, or even days in scenario play. The game was developed in the 1980s and is now regularly played at a formal sporting level with organized competition involving major tournaments, professional teams and players.
* National Xball League is the United States&#x27; professional paintball circuit. The league consists of a Professional Division, consisting of the best players the sport has to offer, that extends down to the beginner ranks of &quot;Division 5&quot; for those newer to the tournament atmosphere. The league hosts five national events across the country in places such as Las Vegas, Dallas, Nashville, Cleveland, Chicago, Atlantic City and Orlando throughout the year, starting in March and ending their season in early November. The league&#x27;s largest event each year is the season finale known as the World Cup, with the 2016 World Cup hosted 3,554 players from 35 countries.
* National Collegiate Paintball Association is an all-volunteer, non-profit organization created by United States college players. The goal of the NCPA is to promote the positive aspects of the sport in an intercollegiate manner. The NCPA consists of two distinct classes which competes separately — Class AA is an open-class division where any college may enter and compete in regional and national tournaments. Class A is a closed-class division where only certain colleges may compete after securing a bid in the previous season, and represents the best talent of college paintball and includes universities such as Drexel University, University of Maryland, Illinois State University, Purdue University, University of Connecticut, Penn State University and 10 other teams across three conferences all fighting for a national title. The association&#x27;s 2007 playoff tournament was aired on Fox Sports Net&#x27;s digital cable college sports network, Fox College Sports.

===Airsoft===
Airsoft is a competitive sport similar in concept to paintball, in which participants from opposing teams eliminate opponents by hitting each other with solid round plastic pellets launched from low-powered smoothbore air guns called airsoft guns. It is different from paintball in that airsoft pellets do not visibly mark the targets like paintballs, and thus the sport relies heavily on an honor system where a hit player has the ethical duty to call himself out of play, regardless of whether anyone else sees it happen. Most airsoft guns are also magazine-fed (unlike the commonly top-mounting pellet loader of paintball markers) with mounting platforms compatible with real firearm accessories, and tend to more closely resemble real guns in appearance, making them more popular for military simulation and historical reenactments. The greater toughness of airsoft pellets also allows the use of better powerplants and apparatus such as hop-up device for improved external ballistics, making the gameplay more accurately resemble real gunfights. They are also much cheaper for casual players to participate than paintball.

Airsoft gameplay varies in style and composition just like paintball and is played in both indoor and outdoor courses. Situations on the field frequently involve the use of real-life military tactics to achieve objectives, and it is not uncommon for participants to emulate the uniforms and equipment of real military and police organizations for a sense of realism. Games are normally supervised (and sometimes umpired) by trained on-site administrators, and players&#x27; airsoft guns are usually checked through a chronograph to enforce power output restrictions.

There are currently no formal national or international governing bodies for the airsoft sport. Competitive tournaments are usually organized by private clubs or among enthusiasts and professional/semi-professional teams (often referred to as &quot;clans&quot;), with rules and restrictions varying from event to event.

===Laser tag===
Laser tag (despite the name, laser is actually not used due to safety concerns) is a tag game played with infrared light guns and sensors worn on the body of the players. Since its birth in 1979, laser tag has evolved in both indoor and outdoor games, each with gameplay styles such as annihilation, capture the flag, domination, VIP protection, (usually sci-fi) role playing, etc. When compared to paintball and airsoft, laser tag is painless and very safe because it involves no projectile impacts, and indoor games may be considered less physically demanding because most indoor venues prohibit running or roughhousing.
* Zone Laser Tag World Championships were international tournaments among professional/semi-professional teams from North American, Europe and Australia, hosted every few years since 2003.
* Bi-lateral international championships have included USA vs. Australia and Australia vs. South Africa.
* National tournaments in various countries including Australia, US, Sweden, Finland, UK, etc.
* Private club-level events such as TagCon (annual in UK and US), Tagfest (annual in US), Dropzone (annual in UK), LaserStorm (annual in Australia), etc.
More sophisticated forms of laser tag, such as MILES, are used (in conjunction with blanks) by militaries to allow for non-lethal combat training.

===Archery Tag===
Archery Tag is a form of combat archery sport where participants shoot one another using a bow with arrows with large foam tips. The game&#x27;s rules closely resemble dodgeball. The game begins with a number of arrows in the center of the arena. At the whistle, players race to collect them, before firing them at one another across the playing field. A player is eliminated if struck by an arrow, and a player can bring an eliminated teammate back into play by catching an arrow. To avoid injury, participants wear protective facemasks and use bows with less than draw weight. It was invented in 2011 by John Jackson of Ashley, Indiana, and experienced a boost in popularity from the &quot;Hunger Games&quot; books and film series, which feature a bow-wielding protagonist Katniss Everdeen. Jackson staged Archery Tag games at local premieres of the films. By 2014, Jackson had licensed the game to 170 locations, mostly in the United States, but also in Russia, Peru and Saudi Arabia.

Battle gaming variants of Archery Tag also exist, such as Dagorhir, Amtgard, Belegarth and Darkon, where archers are pitted among melee players welding foam weapons to simulate medieval battles. 
===Esports===
Esports is the competitive playing of video games, often referring to play at the professional level. While the term esports includes many types of video games unrelated to shooting sports, a major subset of esports are the shooters, namely first-person shooters and third-person shooters. Matches of these games can take a variety of forms but traditionally take formats similar to paintball, involving teams of players whose objective is to eliminate the opposing team in simulated combat, often while also focusing other key objectives. Major games of these styles currently in professional play include (among others) &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, &quot;Overwatch&quot;, &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, &quot;Valorant&quot;, and &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;. Organized play is done both online or in-person. While there has been serious interest to include esports in the Olympics and similar events, the inclusion of shooters has been less welcomed due to their often violent visual content.

<text>Sake, , or saki, also referred to as Japanese rice wine, is an alcoholic beverage of Japanese origin made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. Despite the name &quot;Japanese rice wine&quot;, sake, and indeed any East Asian rice wine (such as huangjiu and cheongju), is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars that ferment into alcohol, whereas in wine, alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, typically grapes.

The brewing process for sake differs from the process for beer, where the conversion from starch to sugar and then from sugar to alcohol occurs in two distinct steps. Like other rice wines, when sake is brewed, these conversions occur simultaneously. The alcohol content differs between sake, wine, and beer; while most beer contains 3–9% ABV, wine generally contains 9–16% ABV, and undiluted sake contains 18–20% ABV (although this is often lowered to about 15% by diluting with water before bottling).

In Japanese, the character (kanji: , ) can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called sake in English is usually termed . Under Japanese liquor laws, sake is labeled with the word , a synonym not commonly used in conversation.

In Japan, where it is the national beverage, sake is often served with special ceremony, where it is gently warmed in a small earthenware or porcelain bottle and sipped from a small porcelain cup called a &quot;sakazuki&quot;. As with wine, the recommended serving temperature of sake varies greatly by type.

==History==
=== Until the Kamakura period ===
The origin of sake is unclear; however, the method of fermenting rice into alcohol spread to Japan from China around 500BCE. The earliest reference to the use of alcohol in Japan is recorded in the &quot;Book of Wei&quot; in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. This 3rd-century Chinese text speaks of Japanese drinking and dancing.

 are mentioned several times in the , Japan&#x27;s first written history, which was compiled in 712. Bamforth (2005) places the probable origin of true sake (which is made from rice, water, and ) in the Nara period (710–794). The fermented food fungi traditionally used for making alcoholic beverages in China and Korea for a long time were fungi belonging to &quot;Rhizopus&quot; and &quot;Mucor&quot;, whereas in Japan, except in the early days, the fermented food fungus used for sake brewing was &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;. Some scholars believe the Japanese domesticated the mutated, detoxified &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot; to give rise to &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;.

In the Heian period (794–1185), sake was used for religious ceremonies, court festivals, and drinking games. Sake production was a government monopoly for a long time, but in the 10th century, Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines began to brew sake, and they became the main centers of production for the next 500 years.

=== Muromachi period ===
Before the 1440s in the Muromachi period (1333–1573), the Buddhist temple Shōryaku-ji invented various innovative methods for making sake. Because these production methods are the origin of the basic production methods for sake brewing today, Shoryakuji is often said to be the birthplace of . Until then, most sake had been  with a different process from today&#x27;s, but after that, clear was established. The main production methods established by Shōryaku-ji are the use of , , , and . This method of producing starter mash is called , which is the origin of . These innovations made it possible to produce sake with more stable quality than before, even in temperate regions. These things are described in , the oldest known technical book on sake brewing written in 1355 or 1489, and , a diary written between 1478 and 1618 by monks of Kōfuku-ji Temple in the Muromachi period.

A large tub with a capacity of 10 &quot;koku&quot; (1,800 liters) was invented at the end of the Muromachi period, making it possible to mass-produce sake more efficiently than before. Until then, sake had been made in jars with a capacity of 1, 2, or 3 &quot;koku&quot; at the most, and some sake brewers used to make sake by arranging 100 jars.

In the 16th century, the technique of distillation was introduced into the Kyushu district from Ryukyu. The brewing of shōchū, called &quot;Imo–sake&quot; started and was sold at the central market in Kyoto.

=== Edo period ===
By the Genroku era (1688–1704) of the Edo period (1603–1867), a brewing method called was developed in which a small amount of distilled alcohol (shōchū) was added to the mash to make it more aromatic and lighter in taste, while at the same preventing deterioration in quality. This originates from the distilled alcohol addition used in modern sake brewing.

The Nada-Gogō area in Hyōgo Prefecture, the largest producer of modern sake, was formed during this period. When the population of Edo, modern-day Tokyo, began to grow rapidly in the early 1600s, brewers who made sake in inland areas such as Fushimi, Itami, and Ikeda moved to the Nada-Gogō area on the coast, where the weather and water quality were perfect for brewing sake and convenient for shipping it to Edo. In the Genroku era, when the culture of the &quot;chōnin&quot; class, the common people, prospered, the consumption of sake increased rapidly, and large quantities of were shipped to Edo. 80% of the sake drunk in Edo during this period was from Nada-Gogō. Many of today&#x27;s major sake producers, including Hakutsuru, Ōzeki, Nihonsakari, Kikumasamune, Kenbishi and Sawanotsuru, are breweries in Nada-Gogō.

During this period, frequent natural disasters and bad weather caused rice shortages, and the Tokugawa shogunate issued sake brewing restrictions 61 times. In the early Edo period, there was a sake brewing technique called that was optimized for each season. In 1667, the technique of for making sake in winter was improved, and in 1673, when the Tokugawa shogunate banned brewing other than &quot;kanzukuri&quot; because of a shortage of rice, the technique of sake brewing in the four seasons ceased, and it became common to make sake only in winter until industrial technology began to develop in the 20th century. During this period, aged for three, five, or nine years, was a luxury, but its deliciousness was known to the common people.
In the 18th century, Engelbert Kaempfer and Isaac Titsingh published accounts identifying sake as a popular alcoholic beverage in Japan, but Titsingh was the first to try to explain and describe the process of sake brewing. The work of both writers was widely disseminated throughout Europe at the beginning of the 19th century.

=== From the Meiji era to the early Shōwa era ===
Starting around the beginning of the Meiji era (1868–1912), the technique for making sake began to develop rapidly. Breeding was actively carried out in various parts of Japan to produce sake rice optimized for sake brewing. &quot;Ise Nishiki&quot; developed in 1860, &quot;Omachi&quot; developed in 1866 and &quot;Shinriki&quot; developed in 1877 are the earliest representative varieties. In 1923, Yamada Nishiki, later called the &quot;king of sake rice,&quot; was produced. Among more than 123 varieties of sake rice as of 2019, Yamada Nishiki ranks first in production and &quot;Omachi&quot; fourth. The government opened the sake-brewing research institute in 1904, and in 1907 the first government-run sake-tasting competition was held. In 1904, the National Brewing Laboratory developed &quot;yamahai&quot;, a new method of making starter mash, and in 1910, a further improvement, &quot;sokujō&quot;, was developed. Sake yeast strains specifically selected for their brewing properties were isolated, and enamel-coated steel tanks arrived. The government started hailing the use of enamel tanks as easy to clean, lasting forever, and devoid of bacterial problems. (The government considered wooden tubs to be unhygienic because of the potential bacteria living in the wood.) Although these things are true, the government also wanted more tax money from breweries, as using wooden tubs means a significant amount of sake is lost to evaporation (approximately 3%), which could have otherwise been taxed. This was the temporary end of the wooden-tubs age of sake, and the use of wooden tubs in brewing was temporarily eliminated.

In Japan, sake has long been taxed by the national government. In 1878, the liquor tax accounted for 12.3% of the national tax revenue, excluding local taxes, and in 1888 it was 26.4%, and in 1899 it was 38.8%, finally surpassing the land tax of 35.6%. In 1899, the government banned home brewing in anticipation of financial pressure from the First Sino-Japanese War and in preparation for the Russo-Japanese War. Since home-brewed sake is tax-free, the logic was that by banning the home-brewing of sake, sales would increase, and more tax revenue would be collected. This was the end of home-brewed sake. The Meiji government adopted a system in which taxes were collected when sake was finished, instead of levying taxes on the amount and price of sake at the time of sale to ensure more revenue from liquor taxes. The liquor tax for the sake produced in a given year had to be paid to the government during that fiscal year, so the breweries tried to make money by selling the sake as soon as possible. This destroyed the market for aged , which had been popular until then, and it was only in 1955 that sake breweries began to make again.

When World War II brought rice shortages, the sake-brewing industry was hampered as the government discouraged the use of rice for brewing. As early as the late 17th century, it had been discovered that small amounts of distilled alcohol could be added to sake before pressing to extract aromas and flavors from the rice solids. During the war, large amounts of distilled alcohol and glucose were added to small quantities of rice mash, increasing the yield by as much as four times. A few breweries were producing &quot;sake&quot; that contained no rice. The quality of sake during this time varied considerably. Incidentally, as of 2022, so much distilled alcohol is not allowed to be added, and under the provisions of the Liquor Tax Act, 50% of the weight of rice is the upper limit for the most inexpensive sake classified as &quot;futsū-shu&quot;.

=== Since the mid-Showa era ===
After the war, the breweries gradually recovered and the quality of sake steadily improved, and there were various innovations in sake brewing. The term , which means carefully brewed sake, first appeared at the end of the Edo period, and the term , which has the same meaning, first appeared in 1894. However, , which is popular in the world today, was created by the development of various sake production techniques from the 1930s to around 1975. From 1930 to 1931, a new type of rice milling machine was invented, which made it possible to make rice with a polishing ratio of about 50%, removing the miscellaneous taste derived from the surface part of the rice grain to make sake with a more aromatic and refreshing taste than before. In 1936, Yamada Nishiki, the most suitable sake rice for brewing &quot;ginjō-shu&quot;, became the recommended variety of Hyogo Prefecture. Around 1953, the , was invented, which produced fruit-like aromas like apples and bananas but also excelled in fermentation. From around 1965, more and more manufacturers began to work on the research and development of &quot;ginjō-shu&quot;, and by about 1968, the Kyokai yeast No. 9 began to be used throughout Japan. In the 1970s, temperature control technology in the mash production process improved dramatically. And by slowly fermenting rice at low temperatures using high-milled rice and a newly developed sake yeast, &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; with a fruity flavor was created. At that time, &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; was a special sake exhibited at competitive exhibitions and was not on the market. From around 1975, &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; began to be marketed and was widely distributed in the 1980s, and in 1990, with the definition of what can be labeled as &quot;ginjō-shu&quot;, more and more brewers began to sell &quot;ginjō-shu&quot;. The growing popularity of &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; has prompted research into yeast, and many yeasts with various aromas optimized for &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; have been developed.

In 1973, the National Tax Agency&#x27;s brewing research institute developed .

New players on the scene—beer, wine, and spirits—became popular in Japan, and in the 1960s, beer consumption surpassed sake for the first time. Sake consumption continued to decrease while the quality of sake steadily improved. While the rest of the world may be drinking more sake and the quality of sake has been increasing, sake production in Japan has been declining since the mid-1970s. The number of sake breweries is also declining. While there were 3,229 breweries nationwide in fiscal 1975, the number had fallen to 1,845 in 2007. In recent years, exports have rapidly increased due to the growing popularity of sake worldwide. The value of sake exports in 2022 was more than six times that of 2009. As of 2022, the value of Japan&#x27;s alcoholic beverage exports was approximately 139.2 billion yen, with Japanese whisky in first place at 56.1 billion yen and sake in second place at 47.5 billion yen. Today, sake has become a world beverage with a few breweries in China, Southeast Asia, South America, North America, and Australia.

In addition to &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; (yellow &quot;kōji&quot;), &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot; (white &quot;kōji&quot;) and &quot;Aspergillus luchuensis&quot; (black &quot;kōji&quot;), which are used to brew &quot;shōchū&quot; and &quot;awamori&quot;, have been used to brew sake since the 21st century.

In 2018, Satake Corporation developed a new type of rice milling machine that allows dramatically faster and more focused milling of the long axis portion of rice, which has a high mineral content and adds a miscellaneous taste to the flavor. This has made it possible to achieve the same flavor in a &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; with a 60% polishing ratio as in a conventional &quot;daiginjō-shu&quot; with a 40% polishing ratio, and many breweries now sell sake made from flat-milled rice.

More breweries are also turning to older methods of production. For example, since the 21st century, the use of wooden tubs has increased again due to the development of sanitary techniques. The use of wooden tubs for fermentation has the advantage of allowing various microorganisms living in the wood to affect sake, allowing more complex fermentation and producing sake with different characteristics. It is also known that the antioxidants contained in wood have a positive effect on sake.

In December 2024, sake was recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage.

===Oldest sake brewery===
The oldest sake brewing company still in operation, as confirmed by historical documents, is the Sudo Honke in Kasama, Ibaraki, founded in 1141 during the Heian period (794–1185). &quot;Sudō Honke&quot; was also the first sake brewery to sell both &quot;namazake&quot; and &quot;hiyaoroshi&quot;. &quot;Hiyaoroshi&quot; refers to sake that is finished in winter, pasteurized once in early spring, stored and aged for a little while during the summer, and shipped in the fall without being pasteurized a second time.

In terms of excavated archaeological evidence, the oldest known sake brewery is from the 15th century near an area that was owned by Tenryū-ji, in Ukyō-ku, Kyoto. Unrefined sake was squeezed out at the brewery, and there are about 180 holes (60 cm wide, 20 cm deep) for holding storage jars. A hollow (1.8 meter wide, 1 meter deep) for a pot to collect drops of pressed sake and 14th-century Bizen ware jars were also found. It is estimated to be utilized until the Ōnin War (1467–1477). Sake was brewed at Tenryū-ji during the Muromachi period (1336–1573).

==Production==

===Rice===

The rice used for brewing sake is called , or officially . There are at least 123 types of sake rice in Japan. Among these, Yamada Nishiki, Gohyakumangoku, Miyama Nishiki and Omachi rice are popular. The grain is larger, stronger (if a grain is small or weak, it will break in the process of polishing), and contains less protein and lipid than ordinary table rice. Because of the cost, ordinary table rice, which is cheaper than sake rice, is sometimes used for sake brewing, but because sake rice has been improved and optimized for sake brewing, few people eat it.

Premium sake is mostly made from sake rice. However, non-premium sake is mostly made from table rice. According to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, premium sake makes up 25% of total sake production, and non-premium sake () makes up 75% of sake production. In 2008, a total of 180,000 tons of polished rice were used in sake brewing, of which sake rice accounted for 44,000 tons (24%), and table rice accounted for 136,000 tons (76%).

Sake rice is usually polished to a much higher degree than ordinary table rice. The reason for polishing is a result of the composition and structure of the rice grain itself. The core of the rice grain is rich in starch, while the outer layers of the grain contain higher concentrations of fats, vitamins, and proteins. Since a higher concentration of fat and protein in the sake would lead to off-flavors and contribute rough elements to the sake, the outer layers of the sake rice grain is milled away in a polishing process, leaving only the starchy part of the grain (some sake brewers remove over 60% of the rice grain in the polishing process). That desirable pocket of starch in the center of the grain is called the . It usually takes two to three days to polish rice down to less than half its original size. The rice powder by-product of polishing is often used for making rice crackers, Japanese sweets (i.e. Dango), and other food stuffs.

If the sake is made with rice with a higher percentage of its husk and the outer portion of the core milled off, then more rice will be required to make that particular sake, which will take longer to produce. Thus, sake made with rice that has been highly milled is usually more expensive than sake that has been made with less-polished rice. This does not always mean that sake made with highly milled rice is of better quality than sake made with rice milled less. Sake made with highly milled rice has a strong aroma and a light taste without miscellaneous taste. It maximizes the fruity flavor of &quot;ginjō&quot;. On the other hand, sake made with less milled rice but with attention to various factors tends to have a rich sweetness and flavor derived from rice.

&quot;Rice polishing ratio&quot;, called (see Glossary of sake terms) measures the degree of rice polishing. For example, a rice polishing ratio of 70% means that 70% of the original rice grain remains and 30% has been polished away. As of 2023, the most polished sake has a polishing ratio of 0.85% or less, with at least 99.15% of its rice grains polished away. This sake is , released by , priced at 1,375,000 yen for 720 ml.

===Water===
Water is involved in almost every major sake brewing process, from washing the rice to diluting the final product before bottling. The mineral content of the water can be important in the final product. Iron will bond with an amino acid produced by the to produce off flavors and a yellowish color. Manganese, when exposed to ultraviolet light, will also contribute to discoloration. Conversely, potassium, magnesium, and phosphoric acid serve as nutrients for sake yeast during fermentation and are considered desirable. The yeast will use those nutrients to work faster and multiply resulting in more sugar being converted into alcohol. While soft water will typically yield sweeter sake, hard water with a higher mineral content is known for producing drier-style sake.

The first region known for having great water was the Nada-Gogō in Hyōgo Prefecture. A particular water source called was found to produce high-quality sake and attracted many producers to the region.

Typically breweries obtain water from wells, though surface water can be used. Breweries may use tap water and filter and adjust components.

=== &quot;Kōji-kin&quot; ===
==== &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; (yellow &quot;kōji&quot;) ====
&quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; spores are another important component of sake. &quot;A. oryzae&quot; is an enzyme-secreting fungus. In Japan, &quot;A. oryzae&quot; is used to make various fermented foods, including &quot;miso&quot; (a paste made from soybeans) and (soy sauce). It is also used to make alcoholic beverages, notably sake. During sake brewing, spores of &quot;A. oryzae&quot; are scattered over steamed rice to produce (rice in which &quot;A. oryzae&quot; spores are cultivated). Under warm and moist conditions, the &quot;A. oryzae&quot; spores germinate and release amylases (enzymes that convert the rice starches into maltose and glucose). This conversion of starch into simple sugars (e.g., glucose or maltose) is called saccharification. Yeast then ferment the glucose and other sugar into alcohol. Saccharification also occurs in beer brewing, where mashing is used to convert starches from barley into maltose. However, whereas fermentation occurs &quot;after&quot; saccharification in beer brewing, saccharification (via &quot;A. oryzae&quot;) and fermentation (via yeast) occur &quot;simultaneously&quot; in sake brewing (see &quot;Fermentation&quot; below).

As &quot;A. oryzae&quot; is a microorganism used to manufacture food, its safety profile concerning humans and the environment in sake brewing and other food-making processes must be considered. Various health authorities, including Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), consider &quot;A. oryzae&quot; generally safe for use in food fermentation, including sake brewing. When assessing its safety, it is important to note that &quot;A.&quot; &quot;oryzae&quot; lacks the ability to produce toxins, unlike the closely related &quot;Aspergillus flavus&quot;. To date, there have been several reported cases of animals (e.g. parrots, a horse) being infected with &quot;A. oryzae&quot;. In these cases the animals infected with &quot;A. oryzae&quot; were already weakened due to predisposing conditions such as recent injury, illness or stress, hence were susceptible to infections in general. Aside from these cases, there is no evidence to indicate &quot;A. oryzae&quot; is a harmful pathogen to either plants or animals in the scientific literature. Therefore, Health Canada considers &quot;A. oryzae&quot; &quot;unlikely to be a serious hazard to livestock or to other organisms,&quot; including &quot;healthy or debilitated humans.&quot; Given its safety record in the scientific literature and extensive history of safe use (spanning several hundred years) in the Japanese food industry, the FDA and World Health Organization (WHO) also support the safety of &quot;A. oryzae&quot; for use in the production of foods like sake. In the US, the FDA classifies &quot;A.oryzae&quot; as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) organism.

==== &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot; (white &quot;kōji&quot;) ====
In addition to &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot; (yellow &quot;kōji&quot;), &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot; (white &quot;kōji&quot;) and &quot;Aspergillus luchuensis&quot; (black &quot;kōji&quot;), which are used to brew &quot;shōchū&quot; and &quot;awamori&quot;, have been used to brew sake since the 21st century.

From the 1980s, research was conducted to brew sake using &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot; (white &quot;kōji&quot;), which is used to make &quot;shōchū&quot;, and sake made with &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot; became popular when Aramasa Co, Ltd. released &quot;Amaneko&quot; using &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot; in 2009. &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot; produces about 10 times more citric acid than &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;, and thus has a strong ability to suppress the growth of bacteria that damage the flavor of sake. It also imparts a sour, citrus-like flavor to sake. Because it produces so much citric acid, older sake-making methods such as &quot;kimoto&quot; or &quot;yamahai&quot; can produce a starter mash as quickly as modern &quot;sokujō&quot;. &quot;Kimoto&quot; and &quot;yamahai&quot; do not add artificial lactic acid, which allows them to be labeled &quot;additive-free,&quot; giving them a marketing advantage when exporting.

==== &quot;Aspergillus luchuensis&quot; (black &quot;kōji&quot;) ====
As of 2022, sake made with &quot;Aspergillus luchuensis&quot; (black &quot;kōji&quot;) is not as popular as sake made with &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot;. It produces more citric acid than &quot;Aspergillus kawachii&quot;. However, it produces less amino acids, which produce complex flavors such as umami, bitterness, and sweetness. &quot;Aspergillus luchuensis&quot; also produces more peptides, which results in a bitter taste. This combines with a strong sour taste from the citric acid, which is sometimes compared to strawberry or red wine.

=== Sake yeast ===

Sake yeast is so important in sake brewing that it is said to affect the flavor of sake more than rice. In sake brewing, &quot;kōji&quot; breaks down rice starch into glucose, and yeast is responsible for the fermentation process that converts the glucose into alcohol. Yeast has a significant impact on the flavor of sake by producing ethyl caproate, isoamyl acetate, and other flavor compounds and acids as well as alcohol during the fermentation process.

The various types of yeast used in sake brewing belong to the species &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, and a large number of yeasts have been developed in Japan. For example, the laboratory of the has 400 types of yeast.

Before the modernization of Japan, breweries used yeasts that were native to each brewery. The yeasts evolved uniquely in each brewery as they competed for survival by mixing with microorganisms that became airborne and attached to the human body during the sake brewing process. Because some of these yeasts were not suitable for brewing sake, the quality of sake varied from brewery to brewery and from period to period.

In 1895, Dr. Kikuji Yabe isolated the first &quot;Saccharomyces sake&quot; yeast suitable for brewing sake. In 1904, the government established the National Brewing Laboratory and began detailed studies of yeast.
In 1906, the Brewing Society of Japan was founded, and a system was established whereby any superior yeast discovered was registered as &quot;Kyokai-kōbo&quot; (&quot;Kyokai yeast&quot;, &quot;Association yeast&quot;) and distributed to breweries throughout Japan. Kyokai yeast No. 7 and No. 9 are particularly popular. In response to the popularity of &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; since the 1980s, various aromatic yeasts have been developed. Today, the Brewing Society of Japan, research institutes in each prefecture, and breweries continue to develop a variety of yeasts, and an increasing number of breweries are making sake from yeasts found in flowers.

Some sake yeasts can also color sake. For example, Kyokai yeast &quot;Akairo kōbo&quot;, isolated in 1984, can produce pink &quot;nigori&quot; or &quot;origarami&quot; sake by producing a red pigment during fermentation. This yeast is not fertile and temperature control is difficult, but it adds a sweet strawberry flavor to the sake.

=== Fermentation ===
Sake fermentation is a three-step process called . The first step, called , involves steamed rice, water, and being added to the yeast starter called : a mixture of steamed rice, water, kōji, and yeast. This mixture becomes known as the (the main mash during sake fermentation). The high yeast content of the promotes the fermentation of the &quot;.&quot;

On the second day, the mixture stands for a day to let the yeast multiply.

The second step (the third day of the process), called , involves the addition of a second batch of , steamed rice, and water to the mixture. On the fourth day of the fermentation, the third step of the process, called , takes place. Here, the third and final batch of kōji, steamed rice, and water is added to the mixture, followed by up to ten days or so of additional fermentation to complete the three-step process.

The multiple parallel fermentation process of sake brewing, where starch is converted into glucose followed by immediate conversion into alcohol, is unique to it. This distinguishes sake from other brewed alcoholic beverages like beer because it occurs in a single vat, whereas with beer, for instance, starch-to-glucose conversion and glucose-to-alcohol conversion occur in separate vats. The breakdown of starch into glucose is caused by the fungus, while the conversion of glucose into alcohol is caused by yeast. Due to the yeast being available as soon as the glucose is produced, the conversion of glucose to alcohol is very efficient in sake brewing. This results in sake having a generally higher alcohol content than other types of beer or wine.

After the fermentation process is complete, the fermented is pressed to remove the sake lees and then pasteurized and filtered for color. The sake is then stored in bottles under cold conditions (see &quot;Maturation&quot; below).

The process of making sake can range from 60 to 90 days (2–3 months), while the fermentation alone can take two weeks. On the other hand, &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; takes about 30 days for fermentation alone.

=== Maturation ===
Like other brewed beverages, sake tends to benefit from a period of storage. Nine to twelve months are required for the sake to mature. Maturation is caused by physical and chemical factors such as oxygen supply, the broad application of external heat, nitrogen oxides, aldehydes, and amino acids, among other unknown factors.

===&quot;Tōji&quot;===
 is the job title of the sake brewer. There are various theories about the origin of the word, but the most popular is that it is a corruption of the word , which was used for housewives and elderly women who supervised &quot;miko&quot; (shrine maidens). This is because sake brewing was the work of housewives at home and &quot;miko&quot; at Shinto shrines. It is a highly respected job in the Japanese society, with being regarded like musicians or painters. The title of was historically passed from father to son. Today new are either veteran brewery workers or are trained at universities. While modern breweries with cooling tanks operate year-round, most old-fashioned sake breweries are seasonal, operating only in the cool winter months. During the summer and fall, most work elsewhere, commonly on farms, only periodically returning to the brewery to supervise storage conditions or bottling operations.

==Varieties==
===Special-designation sake===
There are two basic types of sake: and . is the equivalent of table wine and accounts for 57% of sake production as of 2020. refers to premium sake distinguished by the degree to which the rice has been polished and the added percentage of brewer&#x27;s alcohol or the absence of such additives. There are eight varieties of special-designation sake.

 is sake made using a special method called , in which rice is slowly fermented for about 30 days at a low temperature of 5 to 10 degrees Celsius (41 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit). Sake made in &quot;ginjō-zukuri&quot; is characterized by fruity flavors like apples, bananas, melons, grapes, peaches, pineapples, citrus, etc. In general, the flavor of sake tends to deteriorate when it is affected by ultraviolet rays or high temperatures, especially for sake made in &quot;ginjō-zukuri&quot; and unpasteurized &quot;namazake&quot;. Therefore, it is recommended that sake with the name &quot;ginjō&quot; be transported and stored in cold storage. It is also recommended to drink chilled to maximize its fruity flavor.

 is a term used for the sake that is made of pure rice wine without any additional distilled alcohol. Special-designation sake which is not labeled has an appropriate amount of distilled alcohol added. The maximum amount of distilled alcohol added to is 50% of the rice weight, mainly to increase the volume, while the maximum amount of distilled alcohol added to special-designation sake is 10% of the rice weight, to make the sake more aromatic and light in taste, and to prevent the growth of lactic acid bacteria, which deteriorate the flavor of the sake. It is often misunderstood that the added distilled alcohol is of poor quality, but that is not the case with the addition of distilled alcohol to special-designation sake. Specifically, 78.3% of the sake entered in the , the largest sake contest, had distilled alcohol added, and 91.1% of the winning sake had it added. However, the most important aspect of the contest is the brewing technique, not whether it tastes good or not.

Sake made with highly milled rice has a strong aroma and a light taste without miscellaneous taste. It maximizes the fruity flavor of &quot;ginjō&quot;. On the other hand, sake made with less milled rice but with attention to various factors tends to have a rich sweetness and flavor derived from rice.

In 2018, Satake Corporation developed a new type of rice milling machine that allows dramatically faster and more focused milling of the long axis portion of rice, which has a high mineral content and adds a miscellaneous taste to the flavor. This has made it possible to achieve the same flavor in a &quot;ginjō-shu&quot; with a 60% polishing ratio as in a conventional &quot;daiginjō-shu&quot; with a 40% polishing ratio.

The certification requirements for special-designation sake must meet the conditions listed below, as well as the superior aroma and color specified by the National Tax Agency. The listing below often has the highest price at the top:


===Methods of preparing the starter mash===
* is a method used by Shōryaku-ji in Nara to make starter mash during the Muromachi period (1336–1573). In recent years, some sake breweries have begun to revive this method based on documents from the Muromachi period.
* is the traditional orthodox method for preparing the starter mash, which includes the laborious process of using poles to mix it into a paste, known as . This method was the standard for 300 years.
* is a simplified version of the method, introduced in the early 1900s. skips the step of making a paste out of the starter mash. That step of the method is known as , and the full name for is , meaning &#x27;discontinuation of . While the method was originally developed to speed production time compared to the method, it is slower than the modern method and is now used only in specialty brews for the earthy flavors it produces.
* , is the modern method of preparing the starter mash. Lactic acid, produced naturally in the two slower traditional methods, is added to the starter to inhibit unwanted bacteria. sake tends to have a lighter flavor than or .

===Different handling after fermentation===
The characteristics of sake listed below are generally described on the label attached to the sake bottle. For example, indicates that all the conditions of , , and below are satisfied.
* is sake that has not been pasteurized. It requires refrigerated storage and has a shorter shelf-life than pasteurized sake. Since is not pasteurized, it is generally characterized by a strong, fresh, sweet, and fruity flavor that is easy for beginners to enjoy. Also, because fermentation continues in the bottle, the change in flavor can be enjoyed over time, and some are effervescent due to the production of gases during fermentation.
* is undiluted sake. Most sake is diluted with water after brewing to lower the alcohol content from 18 to 20% down to 14–16%, but is not.
* means unfiltered. It refers to sake that has not been carbon filtered but that &quot;has&quot; been pressed and separated from the lees and thus is clear, not cloudy. Carbon filtration can remove desirable flavors and odors as well as bad ones, thus sake has stronger flavors than filtered varieties.
* is sake made by squeezing mash and putting the freshly made sake directly into a bottle without transferring it to a tank. It is generally effervescent and has a strong flavor because it is filled in the bottle with as little exposure to the air as possible to the freshest liquor that continues to ferment. It is a sake that maximizes the advantages of or .
* is cloudy sake. The sake is passed through a loose mesh to separate it from the mash. In the production process of , rough cloth or colander is used to separate mash. It is not filtered after that, and there is much rice sediment in the bottle. It is generally characterized by its rich sweetness derived from rice. &quot;Nigorizake&quot; is sometimes unpasteurized &quot;namazake&quot;, which means that it is still fermenting and has an effervescent quality. Therefore, shaking the bottle or exposing it to high temperatures may cause the sake to spurt out of the bottle, so care should be taken when opening the bottle. When first opening the bottle, the cap should be slightly opened and then closed repeatedly to release the gas that has filled the bottle little by little. To maximize the flavor of &quot;nigorizake&quot;, there are some tips on how to drink it. First drink only the clear supernatant, then close the cap and slowly turn the bottle upside down to mix the sediment with the clear sake to enjoy the change in flavor.
* is a sake with less turbidity than . is filtered differently from and is filtered in the same way as ordinary sake. The reason mash lees are precipitated in the bottle is that the process of making ordinary sake, in which lees are precipitated and the supernatant is scooped up and bottled to complete the product, is omitted. Sake that is lightly cloudy like is also called or .
* is the Japanese legal definition of sake and refers to sake in which the solids have been strained out, leaving clear liquid. Thus (see below) is not and therefore are not actually sake under Japanese law. Although is cloudy, it is legally classified as because it goes through the process of filtering through a mesh.
* is &#x27;aged sake&#x27;. Most sake does not age well, but this specially made type can age for decades, turning yellow and acquiring a honeyed flavor.
* is sake aged in wooden barrels or bottled in wooden casks. The wood used is , which is also known as Japanese cedar. Sake casks are often tapped ceremonially to open buildings, businesses, parties, etc. Because the wood imparts a strong flavor, premium sake is rarely used for this type.
* refers to sake that has been shipped without the traditional six-month aging/maturation period. The result is usually a more acidic, &quot;greener&quot; sake.
* is a method of separating sake from the lees without external pressure by hanging the mash in bags and allowing the liquid to drip out under its weight. Sake produced this way is sometimes called .
* is sake pressed into bottles () with the brewer selecting the best sake of the batch for shipping.

===Others===
* is a traditional sweet, low- or non-alcoholic Japanese drink made from fermented rice.
* is the classic home-brew style of sake (although home brewing is illegal in Japan). It is created by simply adding mold to steamed rice and water and letting the mixture ferment. It is sake made without separating mash. The resulting sake is somewhat like a chunkier version of .
* () is locally brewed sake, the equivalent of microbrewing beer.
* is sake made using sake instead of water. A typical sake is made using 130 liters of water for every 100 kilograms of rice, while &quot;kijōshu&quot; is made using 70 liters of water and 60 liters of sake for every 100 kilograms of rice. &quot;Kijōshu&quot; is characterized by its unique rich sweetness, aroma and thickness, which can be best brought out when aged to an amber color. &quot;kijōshu&quot; is often more expensive than ordinary sake because it was developed in 1973 by the National Tax Agency&#x27;s brewing research institute for the purpose of making expensive sake that can be served at government banquets for state guests. The method of making sake using sake instead of water is similar to the sake brewing method called &quot;shiori&quot; described in the &quot;Engishiki&quot; compiled in 927. Because the term &quot;kijōshu&quot; is trademarked, sake makers not affiliated with the cannot use the name. Therefore, when non-member sake manufacturers sell &quot;kijōshu&quot;, they use terms such as to describe the process.
* is sake made from unpolished rice (i.e., brown rice), and is more like &quot;huangjiu&quot;.
* is sake with a deliberately high rice-polishing ratio. It is generally held that the lower the rice polishing ratio (the percent weight after polishing), the better the potential of the sake. Circa 2005, has been produced as a specialty sake made with high rice-polishing ratios, usually around 80%, to produce sake with the characteristic flavor of rice itself.
* , literally &quot;red sake&quot;, is produced by using red yeast rice , giving the sake a pink-tinted appearance similar to rosé wine.

Some other terms commonly used in connection with sake:
* , also called the Sake Meter Value or SMV
::formula_1
:Specific gravity is measured on a scale weighing the same volume of water at and sake at . The sweeter the sake, the lower the number (or more negative); the drier the sake, the higher the number. When the SMV was first used, 0 was the point between sweet and dry sake. Now +3 is considered neutral.
* is the rice polishing ratio (or milling rate), the percentage of weight remaining after polishing. Generally, the lower the number, the higher the sake&#x27;s complexity. A lower percentage usually results in a fruitier and more complex sake, whereas a higher percentage will taste more like rice.
* are pressed sake lees, the solids left after pressing and filtering. These are used for making pickles, livestock feed, and shōchū, and as an ingredient in dishes like kasu soup.

==Craft sake==

In Japan, is sake that is brewed based on sake production techniques, but produced in a manner that differs from the traditional sake production process as defined by the . It is classified as rather than under the Liquor Tax Law, but is generally recognized as sake.
The Liquor Tax Law definition does not allow sake to be made with secondary ingredients, but since craft sake is not bound by the Liquor Tax Law definition, fruits and herbs are often used as secondary ingredients. It can achieve a different flavor from conventional sake by using secondary ingredients, and can use local products from the brewery&#x27;s area as secondary ingredients. For example, the Ine to Agave Brewery uses agave, hops, apples, grapes, matcha, honey, coffee, etc. as secondary ingredients.

In Japan, the Liquor Tax Law prohibits new entrants from obtaining a new sake brewing license to sell sake in Japan. If a new entrant wants to start brewing sake, it must either take over an existing brewery or produce sake for export only. Therefore, young entrepreneurs who want to make sake tend to start making craft sake, which is easier to enter. The Japan Craft Sake Breweries Association was founded in 2022 under the leadership of Shuhei Okazumi of Ine to Agave Brewery. The association hopes to appeal to young people and women who have not been frequent sake drinkers, and due to the high added value, many craft sake are priced at about twice the price of traditional sake.

==Taste and flavor==
The label on a bottle of sake gives a rough indication of its taste. Terms found on the label may include , , and .

 or Sake Meter Value (SMV) is calculated from the specific gravity of the sake and indicates the sugar and alcohol content of the sake on an arbitrary scale. Typical values are between −3 (sweet) and +10 (dry), equivalent to specific gravities ranging between 1.007 and 0.998, though the maximum range of can go much beyond that. The must be considered together with to determine the overall perception of dryness-sweetness, richness-lightness characteristics of a sake (for example, a higher level of acidity can make a sweet sake taste drier than it actually is).

 indicates the concentration of acid, which is determined by titration with sodium hydroxide solution. This number equals the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the acid in of sake.

 indicates a taste of umami or savoriness. As the proportion of amino acids rises, the sake tastes more savory. This number is determined by titration of the sake with a mixture of sodium hydroxide solution and formaldehyde and is equal to the milliliters of titrant required to neutralize the amino acids in 10 mL of sake.

Sake can have many flavor notes, such as fruits, flowers, herbs, and spices. Many types of sake have notes of apple from ethyl caproate and banana from isoamyl acetate, particularly . In addition to apples and bananas, other fruits mentioned as flavor notes for fruity sake, especially &quot;ginjō-shu&quot;, include melons, grapes, peaches, pineapples, citrus, etc.

==Serving sake==


In Japan, sake is served , at , or , depending on the preference of the drinker, the characteristics of the sake, and the season. Typically, hot sake is a winter drink, and high-grade sake is not usually drunk hot because the flavors and aromas may be lost. Most lower-quality sake is served hot because that is the traditional way, and it often tastes better that way, not so that flaws are covered up. There are gradations of temperature both for chilling and heating, about every , with hot sake generally served around , and chilled sake around , like white wine. may be reheated.

Sake is traditionally drunk from small cups called or and poured into the from ceramic flasks called . This is very common for hot sake, where the flask is heated in hot water, and the small cups ensure that the sake does not get cold in the cup, but it may also be used for chilled sake. Traditionally one does not pour one&#x27;s own drink, which is known as , but instead members of a party pour for each other, which is known as . This has relaxed in recent years but is generally observed on more formal occasions, such as business meals, and is still often observed for the first drink.

Another traditional cup is the &quot;masu&quot;, a box usually made of &quot;hinoki&quot; or &quot;sugi&quot;, which was originally used for measuring rice. The holds exactly one &quot;gō&quot;, , so the sake is served by filling the to the brim; this is done for chilled or room temperature sake. In some Japanese restaurants, as a show of generosity, the server may put a glass inside the or put the on a saucer and pour until sake overflows and fills both containers.

Sake is traditionally served in units of , and this is still common, but other sizes are sometimes also available.

Saucer-like cups called are also used, most commonly at weddings and other ceremonial occasions, such as the start of the year or the beginning of a kaiseki meal. In cheap bars, sake is often served at room temperature in glass tumblers and called . In more modern restaurants, wine glasses are also used, and recently footed glasses made specifically for premium sake have also come into use.

Traditionally sake is heated immediately before serving, but today restaurants may buy sake in boxes that can be heated in a specialized hot sake dispenser, thus allowing hot sake to be served immediately. However, this is detrimental to the flavor. There are also a variety of devices for heating sake and keeping it warm beyond the traditional .

Aside from being served straight, sake can be used as a mixer for cocktails, such as tamagozake, saketinis, or nogasake. Outside of Japan, the sake bomb, the origins of which are unclear, has become a popular drink in bars and Asia-themed karaoke clubs.

The Japanese Sake Association encourages people to drink chaser water for their health, and the water is called Yawaragi-mizu.

==Seasonality==

Because the cooler temperatures make it more difficult for bacteria to grow, sake brewing traditionally took place mainly in winter, and this was especially true from 1673 during the Edo period until the early 20th century during the Showa era. While it can now be brewed year-round, seasonality is still associated with sake, particularly artisanal ones. The most visible symbol of this is the , a globe of cedar leaves traditionally hung outside a brewery when the new sake is brewed. The leaves start green but turn brown over time, reflecting the maturation of the sake. These are now hung outside many restaurants serving sake. The new year&#x27;s sake is called , and when initially released in late winter or early spring, many brewers have a celebration known as . Traditionally sake was best transported in the cool spring to avoid spoilage in the summer heat, with a secondary transport in autumn, once the weather had cooled, known as —this autumn sake has matured over the summer.

==Storage==
Sake is sold in volume units divisible by (one &quot;gō&quot;), the traditional Japanese unit for cup size. Sake is traditionally sold by the -sized cup, or in a (one &quot;shō&quot; or ten )-sized flask (called an , or &#x27;one shō-measure bottle&#x27;). Today sake is also often sold in bottles, which are divisible into four . Note that this is almost the same as the standard for wine bottles, which is divisible into four quarter bottles (187ml). Particularly in convenience stores, sake (generally of cheap quality) may be sold in a small bottle or a single serving (one gō) .

Generally, it is best to keep sake refrigerated in a cool or dark room, as prolonged exposure to heat or direct light will lead to spoilage. Sake stored at a relatively high temperature can lead to the formation of diketopiperazine, a cyclo (Pro-Leu) that makes it bitter as it ages Sake has high microbiological stability due to its high content of ethanol, but instances of spoilage have occurred. One of the microorganisms implicated in this spoilage is lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that has grown tolerant to ethanol and is referred to as -bacteria. Sake stored at room temperature is best consumed within a few months after purchase.

Sake can be stored for a long time due to its high alcohol content and has no use-by dates written on the bottle or label. However, there is a best before date for good drinking, and it depends on the type of sake, with the typical twice-pasteurized sake having a relatively long best before date. According to major sake brewer Gekkeikan, the best before date when unopened and stored in a dark place at about 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit) is one year after production for &quot;futsū-shu&quot; and &quot;honjōzō-shu&quot;, 10 months for &quot;ginjō-shu&quot;, &quot;junmai-shu&quot;, and sake pasteurized only once, and up to eight months for special &quot;namazake&quot; that can be distributed at room temperature. According to Sawanotsuru, once pasteurized sake and unpasteurized &quot;namazake&quot; have a best before date of nine months after production. Some sources also state that the best before date for unpasteurized &quot;namazake&quot; is three to six months after production. &quot;Namazake&quot; generally requires refrigeration at all times. However, there are exceptions to these storage conditions, in which case the conditions are stated on the label. For example, sake under the brand name must be kept refrigerated at all times, even if it is &quot;junmai-shu&quot;, which has been pasteurized.

Once the sake is opened, it should be kept refrigerated, as the flavor deteriorates more quickly than before opening. Best before date after opening the bottle varies depending on the source. According to sake media outlet Sake no shizuku, which interviewed several major sake production companies, the responses from all companies were nearly identical. According to the responses, &quot;junmai&quot; type sake without added distilled alcohol has a best before date of 10 days after opening, while other types of sake with added distilled alcohol has a best before date of one month after opening. According to the international sommelier of sake certified by SSI International, &quot;ginjō&quot; type sake, which is fermented at low temperature for a long time, has little flavor degradation for two to three days after opening and has a best before date of one week after opening. Other special designation sake and &quot;futsū-shu&quot; have little flavor degradation for 10 to 14 days after opening the bottle and have a best before date of one month after opening. Unpasteurized &quot;namazake&quot; deteriorates the fastest and should be drunk as soon as possible.

These best before dates are shortened when stored at high temperatures or in bright places, especially under sunlight or fluorescent lights that emit ultraviolet rays. On the other hand, the optimal temperature to minimize flavor degradation is minus 5 degrees Celsius (23 degrees Fahrenheit). It is also recommended that sake bottles be stored vertically. This is because if the bottle is placed horizontally, the sake is exposed to more air inside the bottle, which speeds up oxidation and may change the flavor when it comes in contact with the cap.

If these types of sake, which were clear or white at first, turn yellow or brown, it is a sign that the flavor has deteriorated. The exception is aged &quot;koshu&quot;, which is amber in color from the time of shipment because it has been aged for several years to optimize its flavor.

==Ceremonial use==

Sake is often consumed as part of Shinto purification rituals. Sake served to gods as offerings before drinking are called or .

In a ceremony called &quot;kagami biraki&quot;, wooden sake casks are opened with mallets during Shinto festivals, weddings, store openings, sports and election victories, and other celebrations. This sake, called (&#x27;celebration sake&#x27;), is served freely to all to spread good fortune.

At the New Year, many Japanese people drink a special sake called &quot;toso&quot;. is a sort of made by soaking , a &quot;kampo&quot; (traditional Japanese medicine), overnight in sake. Even children sip a portion. In some regions, the first sips of are taken in order of age, from the youngest to the eldest.

On Children&#x27;s Day, May 5, there is a custom of drinking , which is made by cutting iris roots and leaves into thin slices and soaking them in sake, a tradition inherited from . It is believed that iris has the power to ward off evil spirits and has medicinal properties.

==Global growth==
Sake has seen a significant rise in global popularity. Sake exports have increased by 70% since 2021, reaching 41.1 billion yen ($270.4 million) in 2023. The United States is the largest market for exported sake, importing 6,500 kiloliters.

Despite this growth, sake remains a niche product in the United States, accounting for only 0.2% of the total alcohol market as of 2020. This suggests there is potential for further expansion, mainly as American consumers develop a taste for Japanese culture and cuisine.

==Events==
* October 1 is the official of Japan. It is also called &quot;World Sake Day&quot;. It was designated by the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association in 1978.

<doc id="28502" wikidata="Q2079255" url="?curid=28502" title="Scuba set">
<text>A scuba set, originally just scuba, is any breathing apparatus that is entirely carried by an underwater diver and provides the diver with breathing gas at the ambient pressure. &quot;Scuba&quot; is an anacronym for self-contained underwater breathing apparatus. Although strictly speaking the scuba set is only the diving equipment that is required for providing breathing gas to the diver, general usage includes the harness or rigging by which it is carried and those accessories which are integral parts of the harness and breathing apparatus assembly, such as a jacket or wing style buoyancy compensator and instruments mounted in a combined housing with the pressure gauge. In the looser sense, scuba set has been used to refer to all the diving equipment used by the scuba diver, though this would more commonly and accurately be termed scuba equipment or scuba gear. Scuba is overwhelmingly the most common underwater breathing system used by recreational divers and is also used in professional diving when it provides advantages, usually of mobility and range, over surface-supplied diving systems and is allowed by the relevant legislation and code of practice.

Two basic functional variations of scuba are in general use: open-circuit-demand, and rebreather. In open-circuit demand scuba, the diver expels exhaled breathing gas to the environment, and each breath is delivered at ambient pressure, on demand, by a diving regulator which reduces the pressure from the storage cylinder. The breathing gas is supplied through a demand valve; when the diver inhales, they reduce the pressure in the demand valve housing, thus drawing in fresh gas.
In rebreather scuba, the system recycles the exhaled gas, removes carbon dioxide, and compensates for the used oxygen before the diver is supplied with gas from the breathing circuit. The amount of gas lost from the circuit during each breathing cycle depends on the design of the rebreather and depth change during the breathing cycle. Gas in the breathing circuit is at ambient pressure, and stored gas is provided through regulators or injectors, depending on the design.

Within these systems, various mounting configurations may be used to carry the scuba set, depending on application and preference. These include: back mount, which is generally used for recreational scuba and for bailout sets for surface supplied diving; side-mount, which is popular for tight cave penetrations; sling mount, used for stage-drop sets; decompression gas and bailout sets where the main gas supply is back-mounted; and various non-standard carry systems for special circumstances.

The most immediate risk associated with scuba diving is drowning due to a failure of the breathing gas supply. This may be managed by diligent monitoring of remaining gas, adequate planning and provision of an emergency gas supply carried by the diver in a bailout cylinder or supplied by the diver&#x27;s buddy, and the skills required to manage the gas sources during the emergency.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;SCUBA&quot; was coined in 1952 by Major Christian Lambertsen who served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps from 1944 to 1946 as a physician. Lambertsen first called the closed-circuit rebreather apparatus he had invented &quot;Laru&quot;, an (acronym for Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit) but, in 1952, rejected the term &quot;Laru&quot; for &quot;SCUBA&quot; (&quot;Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus&quot;). Lambertsen&#x27;s invention, for which he held several patents registered from 1940 to 1989, was a rebreather and is different from the open-circuit diving regulator and diving cylinder assemblies also commonly referred to as scuba.

Open-circuit-demand scuba is a 1943 invention by the Frenchmen Émile Gagnan and Jacques-Yves Cousteau, but in the English language Lambertsen&#x27;s acronym has become common usage and the name &quot;Aqua-Lung&quot; (often spelled &quot;aqualung&quot;), coined by Cousteau for use in English-speaking countries, has fallen into secondary use. As with radar, the acronym &quot;scuba&quot; has become so familiar that it is generally not capitalized and is treated as an ordinary noun. For example, it has been translated into the Welsh language as &quot;sgwba&quot;.

Although the term was originally an acronym, &quot;scuba&quot; is currently used to refer to the apparatus or the practice of diving using the apparatus, either alone as a common noun, or as an adjective in &quot;scuba set&quot; and &quot;scuba diving&quot; respectively. It is also used as an adjective referring to equipment or activity relating to diving using self-contained breathing apparatus.

==Application==
A diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) to breathe underwater. Scuba provides the diver with the advantages of mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE).

Unlike other modes of diving, which rely either on breath-hold or on breathing gas supplied under pressure from the surface, scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually filtered compressed air, allowing them greater freedom of movement than with an air line or diver&#x27;s umbilical and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold. Scuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment for the main gas supply when this is practicable. Surface supplied divers may be required to carry scuba as an emergency breathing gas supply to get them to safety in the event of a failure of surface gas supply.

There are divers who work, full or part-time, in the recreational diving community as instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters and dive guides. In some jurisdictions the professional nature, with particular reference to responsibility for health and safety of the clients, of recreational diver instruction, dive leadership for reward and dive guiding is recognised and regulated by national legislation.

Other specialist areas of scuba diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. Their roles include direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines or using a manned torpedo, bomb disposal or engineering operations. In civilian operations, many police forces operate police diving teams to perform &quot;search and recovery&quot; or &quot;search and rescue&quot; operations and to assist with the detection of crime which may involve bodies of water. In some cases search and rescue diving teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, and may be classed as public safety diving.

There are also professional divers involved with the underwater environment, such as underwater photographers or underwater videographers, who document the underwater world, or scientific diving, including marine biology, geology, hydrology, oceanography and underwater archaeology.

The choice between scuba and surface supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly in commercial diving, may be restricted to surface supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.

===Alternatives to scuba for diving===
There are alternative methods that a person can use to survive and function while underwater, currently including:
* free-diving – swimming underwater on a single breath of air.
* snorkeling – a form of free-diving where the diver&#x27;s mouth and nose can remain underwater when breathing, because the diver is able to breathe at the surface through a short tube known as a snorkel.
* surface-supplied diving – originally, and still used in professional diving for long or deep dives, where an umbilical cable provides breathing gas, voice communication and sometimes warm water to heat the diving suit from the surface. Some tourist resorts offer a surface-supplied air line diving system, trademarked as Snuba, as an introduction to diving for the inexperienced. Using the same type of demand valve as scuba diving, the diver breathes from a compressed air cylinder carried on a free-floating raft at the surface, through a simple hose limiting the diver to a depth of 20–30 feet (6–9 m).
* atmospheric diving suit – a rigid articulated pressure resistant suit that isolates the diver from the surrounding water pressure.

===Operation===
Breathing from scuba is mostly a straightforward matter. Under most circumstances it differs very little from normal surface breathing. In the case of a full-face mask, the diver may usually breathe through the nose or mouth as preferred, and in the case of a mouth held demand valve, the diver will have to hold the mouthpiece between the teeth and maintain a seal around it with the lips. Over a long dive this can induce jaw fatigue, and for some people, a gag reflex. Various styles of mouthpiece are available off the shelf or as customised items, and one of them may work better if either of these problems occur.

The frequently quoted warning against holding one&#x27;s breath on scuba is a gross oversimplification of the actual hazard. The purpose of the admonition is to ensure that inexperienced divers do not accidentally hold their breath while surfacing, as the expansion of gas in the lungs could over-expand the lung air spaces and rupture the alveoli and their capillaries, allowing lung gases to get into the pulmonary return circulation, the pleura, or the interstitial areas near the injury, where it could cause dangerous medical conditions. Holding the breath at constant depth for short periods with a normal lung volume is generally harmless, providing there is sufficient ventilation on average to prevent carbon dioxide buildup, and is done as a standard practice by underwater photographers to avoid startling their subjects. Holding the breath during descent can eventually cause lung squeeze, and may allow the diver to miss warning signs of a gas supply malfunction until it is too late to remedy.

Skilled open circuit divers can and will make small adjustments to buoyancy by adjusting their average lung volume during the breathing cycle. This adjustment is generally in the order of a kilogram (corresponding to a litre of gas), and can be maintained for a moderate period, but it is more comfortable to adjust the volume of the buoyancy compensator over the longer term.

The practice of shallow breathing or skip breathing in an attempt to conserve breathing gas should be avoided as it tends to cause a carbon dioxide buildup, which can result in headaches and a reduced capacity to recover from a breathing gas supply emergency. The breathing apparatus will generally increase dead space by a small but significant amount, and cracking pressure and flow resistance in the demand valve will cause a net work of breathing increase, which will reduce the diver&#x27;s capacity for other work. Work of breathing and the effect of dead space can be minimised by breathing relatively deeply and slowly. These effects increase with depth, as density and friction increase in proportion to the increase in pressure, with the limiting case where all the diver&#x27;s available energy may be expended on simply breathing, with none left for other purposes. This would be followed by a buildup in carbon dioxide, causing an urgent feeling of a need to breathe, and if this cycle is not broken, panic and drowning are likely to follow. The use of a low density inert gas, typically helium, in the breathing mixture can reduce this problem, as well as diluting the narcotic effects of the other gases.

Breathing from a rebreather is much the same, except that the work of breathing is affected mainly by flow resistance in the breathing loop. This is partly due to the carbon dioxide absorbent in the scrubber, and is related to the distance the gas passes through the absorbent material, and the size of the gaps between the grains, as well as the gas composition and ambient pressure. Water in the loop can greatly increase the resistance to gas flow through the scrubber. There is even less point in shallow or skip breathing on a rebreather as this does not even conserve gas, and the effect on buoyancy is negligible when the sum of loop volume and lung volume remains constant.

===Breathing gases for scuba===

Until Nitrox, which contains more oxygen than air, was widely accepted in the late 1990s, almost all recreational scuba used simple compressed and filtered air. Other gas mixtures, typically used for deeper dives by technical divers, may substitute helium for some or all of the nitrogen (called Trimix, or Heliox if there is no nitrogen), or use lower proportions of oxygen than air. In these situations divers often carry additional scuba sets, called stages, with gas mixtures with higher levels of oxygen that are primarily used to reduce decompression time in staged decompression diving. These gas mixes allow longer dives, better management of the risks of decompression sickness, oxygen toxicity or lack of oxygen (hypoxia), and the severity of nitrogen narcosis. Closed circuit scuba sets (rebreathers) provide a gas mix that is controlled to optimise the mix for the actual depth at the time.

==Types==
Scuba sets are of two types:
* In open-circuit scuba the diver inhales from the equipment and all the exhaled gas is exhausted to the surrounding water. This type of equipment is relatively simple, economical and reliable.
* In closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit, also referred to as a rebreather, the diver inhales from the set, and exhales back into the set, where the exhaled gas is processed to make it fit to breathe again. This equipment is efficient and quiet.

Both types of scuba set include a means of supplying air or other breathing gas, nearly always from a high pressure diving cylinder, and a harness to attach it to the diver. Most open-circuit scuba sets have a demand regulator to control the supply of breathing gas, and most rebreathers have a constant-flow injector, or an electronically controlled injector to supply fresh gas, but also usually have an automatic diluent valve (ADV), which functions in the same way as a demand valve, to maintain the loop volume during descent.

===Open-circuit===

Open-circuit-demand scuba exhausts exhaled air to the environment, and requires each breath to be delivered to the diver on demand by a diving regulator, which reduces the pressure from the storage cylinder and supplies it through the demand valve when the diver reduces the pressure in the demand valve slightly during inhalation.

The essential subsystems of an open-circuit scuba set are;
* diving cylinders, with cylinder valves, which may be interconnected by a manifold,
* a regulator mechanism to control gas pressure,
* a demand valve with mouthpiece, full-face mask or helmet, with supply hose, to control flow and deliver gas to the diver.
* an exhaust valve system to dispose of used gas,
* A harness or other method to attach the set to the diver.
Additional components which when present are considered part of the scuba set are;
* external reserve valves and their control rods or levers, (currently uncommon)
* submersible pressure gauges, (almost ubiquitous) and
* secondary (backup) demand valves (common).
The buoyancy compensator is generally assembled as an integrated part of the set, but is not technically part of the breathing apparatus.

The cylinder is usually worn on the back. &quot;Twin sets&quot; with two low capacity back-mounted cylinders connected by a high pressure manifold were more common in the 1960s than now for recreational diving, although larger capacity twin cylinders (&quot;doubles&quot;) are commonly used by technical divers for increased dive duration and redundancy. At one time a firm called Submarine Products sold a sport air scuba set with three manifolded back-mounted cylinders. Cave and wreck penetration divers sometimes carry cylinders attached at their sides instead, allowing them to swim through more confined spaces.

====Constant flow scuba====

Constant flow scuba sets do not have a demand regulator; the breathing gas flows at a constant rate, unless the diver switches it on and off by hand. They use more air than demand regulated scuba. There were attempts at designing and using these for diving and for industrial use before the Cousteau-type aqualung became commonly available circa 1950. Examples were Charles Condert&#x27;s dress in the US (as of 1831), and Yves le Prieur&#x27;s hand-controlled supply valve in France (as of 1926); see Timeline of diving technology. These systems are obsolete as they waste most of the gas or require manual control of each breath, and more efficient demand regulators are available. &quot;Ohgushi&#x27;s Peerless Respirator&quot; from Japan as of 1918 had a bite-controlled breathing gas supply valve, which could be considered a form of demand valve, and was successfully used for several years.

====Open circuit demand scuba====

This system consists of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure, typically , connected to a diving regulator. The demand regulator automatically supplies the diver with as much gas as is needed at the ambient pressure.

This type of breathing set is sometimes called an &quot;aqualung&quot;. The word &quot;Aqua-Lung&quot;, which first appeared in the Cousteau-Gagnan patent, is a trademark, currently owned by Aqua Lung/La Spirotechnique.

=====Twin-hose demand regulator=====
This is the first type of diving demand valve to come into general use, and the one that can be seen in classic 1960s television scuba adventures, such as Sea Hunt. They were often use with manifolded twin cylinders.

All the stages of this type of regulator are in a large valve assembly mounted directly to the cylinder valve or manifold, behind the diver&#x27;s neck. Two large bore corrugated rubber breathing hoses connect the regulator with the mouthpiece, one for supply and one for exhaust. The exhaust hose is used to return the exhaled air to the regulator, to avoid pressure differences due to depth variation between the exhaust valve and final stage diaphragm, which would cause a free-flow of gas, or extra resistance to breathing, depending on the diver&#x27;s orientation in the water. In modern single-hose sets this problem is avoided by moving the second-stage regulator to the diver&#x27;s mouthpiece. The twin-hose regulators came with a mouthpiece as standard, but a full-face diving mask was an option.

=====Single-hose regulator=====
Most modern open-circuit scuba sets have a diving regulator consisting of a first-stage pressure-reducing valve connected to the diving cylinder&#x27;s output valve or manifold. This regulator reduces the pressure from the cylinder, which may be up to , to a lower pressure, generally between about 9 and 11 bar above the ambient pressure. A low-pressure hose links this with the second-stage regulator, or &quot;demand valve&quot;, which is mounted on the mouthpiece. Exhalation occurs through a rubber one-way mushroom valve in the chamber of the demand valve, directly into the water quite close to the diver&#x27;s mouth. Some early single hose scuba sets used full-face masks instead of a mouthpiece, such as those made by Desco and Scott Aviation (who continue to make breathing units of this configuration for use by firefighters).

Modern regulators typically feature high-pressure ports for pressure sensors of dive-computers and submersible pressure gauges, and additional low-pressure ports for hoses for inflation of dry suits and BC devices.

=====Primary demand valve=====

The primary demand valve is the one the diver usually breathes from. There may be a secondary demand valve on the same regulator, or on a different first stage connected to the same scuba set. Additional scuba sets used for bailout, stages, decompression, or sidemount diving usually only have one second stage, which for that set is the primary by default.

=====Secondary demand valve =====

Most recreational scuba sets have a backup second-stage demand valve on a separate hose, a configuration called a &quot;secondary&quot;, or &quot;octopus&quot; demand valve, &quot;alternate air source&quot;, &quot;safe secondary&quot; or &quot;safe-second&quot;. This arrangement was intended to reduce the problems of buddy breathing from a single demand valve and has become the standard in recreational diving. By providing a second demand valve the need to alternately breathe off the same mouthpiece when sharing air is eliminated. This reduces the stress on divers who are already in a stressful situation, and this in turn reduces air consumption during the rescue and frees the donor&#x27;s hand.

Some diver training agencies recommend that a diver routinely offer their primary demand valve to a diver requesting to share air, and then switch to their own secondary demand valve. The idea behind this technique is that the primary demand valve is known to be working, and the diver donating the gas is less likely to be stressed or have a high carbon dioxide level, so has more time to sort out their own equipment after temporarily suspending the ability to breathe. In many instances, panicked divers have grabbed the primary regulators out of the mouths of other divers, so changing to the backup as a routine reduces stress when it is necessary in an emergency.

In technical diving donation of the primary demand valve is commonly the standard procedure, and the primary is connected to the first stage by a long hose, typically around 2 m, to allow gas sharing while swimming in single file in a narrow space as might be required in a cave or wreck. In this configuration the secondary is generally held under the chin by a loose bungee loop around the neck, supplied by a shorter hose, and is intended for backup use by the diver donating gas. The backup regulator is usually carried in the diver&#x27;s chest area where it can be easily seen and accessed for emergency use. It may be worn secured by a breakaway clip on the buoyancy compensator, plugged into a soft friction socket attached to the harness, secured by sliding a loop of the hose into the shoulder strap cover of a jacket style BC, or suspended under the chin on a break-away bungee loop known as a necklace. These methods also keep the secondary from dangling below the diver and being contaminated by debris or snagging on the surroundings. Some divers store it in a BC pocket, but this reduces availability in an emergency.

Occasionally, the secondary second-stage is combined with the inflation and exhaust valve assembly of the buoyancy compensator device. This combination eliminates the need for a separate low pressure hose for the BC, though the low pressure hose connector for combined use must have a larger bore than for standard BC inflation hoses, because it will need to deliver a higher flow rate if it is used for breathing. This combination unit is carried in the position where the inflator unit would normally hang on the left side of the chest. With integrated DV/BC inflator designs, the secondary demand valve is at the end of the shorter BC inflation hose, and the donor must retain access to it for buoyancy control, so donation of the primary regulator to help another diver is essential with this configuration.
The secondary demand valve is often partially yellow in color, and may use a yellow hose, for high visibility, and as an indication that it is an emergency or backup device.

When a side-mount configuration is used, the usefulness of a secondary demand valve is greatly reduced, as each cylinder will have a regulator and the one not in use is available as a backup. This configuration also allows the entire cylinder to be handed off to the receiver, so a long hose is also less likely to be needed.

Some diving instructors continue to teach buddy-breathing from a single demand valve as an obsolescent but still occasionally useful technique, learned in addition to the use of the backup DV, since availability of two second stages per diver is now assumed as standard in recreational scuba.

====Cryogenic====
There have been designs for a cryogenic open-circuit scuba which has liquid-air tanks instead of cylinders. Underwater cinematographer Jordan Klein, Sr. of Florida co-designed such a scuba in 1967, called &quot;Mako&quot;, and made at least five prototypes.

The Russian &quot;Kriolang&quot; (from Greek &quot;cryo-&quot; (= &quot;frost&quot; taken to mean &quot;cold&quot;) + English &quot;lung&quot;) was copied from Jordan Klein&#x27;s &quot;Mako&quot; cryogenic open-circuit scuba. and were made until at least 1974. It would have to be filled a short time before use.

===Rebreathers===

A rebreather recirculates the breathing gas already used by the diver after replacing oxygen used by the diver and removing the carbon dioxide metabolic product. Rebreather diving is used by recreational, military and scientific divers where it can have advantages over open-circuit scuba. Since 80% or more of the oxygen remains in normal exhaled gas, and is thus wasted, rebreathers use gas very economically, making longer dives possible and special mixes cheaper to use at the cost of more complicated technology and more possible failure points. More stringent and specific training and greater experience is required to compensate for the higher risk involved. The rebreather&#x27;s economic use of gas, typically of oxygen per minute, allows dives of much longer duration for an equivalent gas supply than is possible with open-circuit equipment where gas consumption may be ten times higher.

There are two main variants of rebreather – semi-closed circuit rebreathers, and fully closed circuit rebreathers, which include the subvariant of oxygen rebreathers. Oxygen rebreathers have a maximum safe operating depth of around , but several types of fully closed circuit rebreathers, when using a helium-based diluent, can be used deeper than . The main limiting factors on rebreathers are the duration of the carbon dioxide scrubber, which is generally at least 3 hours, increased work of breathing at depth, reliability of gas mixture control, and the requirement to be able to safely bail out at any point of the dive.

Rebreathers are generally used for scuba applications, but are also occasionally used for bailout systems or gas extenders for surface supplied diving.

The possible endurance of a rebreather dive is longer than an open-circuit dive, for similar weight and bulk of the set, if the set is bigger than the practical lower limit for rebreather size, and a rebreather can be more economical when used with expensive gas mixes such as heliox and trimix, but this may require a lot of diving before the break-even point is reached, due to the high initial and running costs of most rebreathers, and this point will be reached sooner for deep dives where the gas saving is more pronounced.

==Diving cylinders==
Gas cylinders used for scuba diving come in various sizes and materials and are typically designated by material – usually aluminium or steel, and size. In the U.S. the size is designated by their nominal capacity, the volume of the gas they contain when expanded to normal atmospheric pressure. Common sizes include 80, 100, 120 cubic feet, etc., with the most common being the &quot;Aluminum 80&quot;. In most of the rest of the world the size is given as the actual internal volume of the cylinder, sometimes referred to as water capacity, as that is how it is measured and marked (WC) on the cylinder (10 liter, 12 liter, etc.).

Cylinder working pressure will vary according to the standard of manufacture, generally ranging from up to .

An aluminium cylinder is thicker and bulkier than a steel cylinder of the same capacity and working pressure, as suitable aluminium alloys have lower tensile strength than steel, and is more buoyant although actually heavier out of the water, which means the diver would need to carry more ballast weight. Steel is also more often used for high pressure cylinders, which carry more air for the same internal volume.

The common method of blending nitrox by partial pressure requires that the cylinder is in &quot;oxygen service&quot;, which means that the cylinder and cylinder valve have had any non-oxygen-compatible components replaced and any contamination by combustible materials removed by cleaning.
Diving cylinders are sometimes colloquially called &quot;tanks&quot; &quot;scuba tanks&quot;, &quot;bottles&quot; or &quot;flasks&quot;, and some of these may be equivalent to the correct term in other languages although the proper technical term for them is &quot;cylinder&quot; or &quot;scuba cylinder&quot;.

Rebreather divers and some open-circuit scuba divers carry extra diving cylinders for bailout in case the main breathing gas supply is used up or malfunctions. If the bailout cylinder is small, they may be called &quot;pony cylinders&quot;. They have their own demand regulators and mouthpieces, and are technically distinct extra scuba sets. In technical diving, the diver may carry different equipment for different phases of the dive. Some breathing gas mixes, such as trimix, may only be used at depth, and others, such as pure oxygen, may only be used during decompression stops in shallow water. The heaviest cylinders are generally carried on the back supported by a backplate while others are side slung from strong points on the harness.

==Harness configuration==


The scuba set can be carried by the diver in several ways. The two most common basic mounting configurations are back-mount and side-mount, and back-mount may be expanded to include auxiliary side-mounting, including bungee-constrained low profile side-mount, and the less compact sling-mount or stage-mount arrangement. A few diving rebreathers are chest mounted.

===Back mount===
Back mounted scuba is straightforward, popular and for a single cylinder well balanced and easy to learn to use. There are several variations on the configuration which have been developed to improve convenience, safety, or suitability for use with multiple cylinders.

====Stabilizer jacket====
The most common configuration for recreational diving is the stabilizer jacket harness, in which a single cylinder, or occasionally twins, is strapped to the jacket style buoyancy compensator which is used as the harness. Some jacket style harnesses allow a bailout or decompression cylinder to be sling mounted from D-rings on the harness. A small bailout cylinder (pony cylinder) can also be strapped to the side of the main back-mounted cylinder.

====Backplate and wing====
Another popular configuration is the backplate and wing arrangement, which uses a back inflation buoyancy compensator bladder sandwiched between a rigid backplate and the main gas cylinder or cylinders. This arrangement is particularly popular with twin or double cylinder sets, and can be used to carry larger sets of three or four cylinders and most rebreathers. Additional cylinders for decompression can be sling mounted at the diver&#x27;s sides.

====Plain backpack====
It is also possible to use a plain backpack harness to support the set, either with a horse-collar buoyancy compensator, or without any buoyancy compensator. This was the standard arrangement before the introduction of the buoyancy compensator, and is still used by some recreational and professional divers when it suits the diving operation.

====Bailout and safety harness====
Surface-supplied divers are generally required to carry an emergency gas supply, also known as a bailout set, which is usually back-mounted open circuit scuba connected into the breathing gas supply system by connecting an interstage hose to the gas switching block, (or bailout block), mounted on the side of the helmet or full-face mask, or on the diver&#x27;s harness where it can easily be reached, but is unlikely to be accidentally opened. Other mounting arrangements may be used for special circumstances.

====Integrated harness and storage/transport container====

The Mini B scuba system is an open circuit scuba set with an integral harness and soft transport/storage bag. These units consist of a rucksack with a one size fits all harness, inside which is an air cell for buoyancy control, a horizontally mounted cylinder, and a regulator with primary and octopus demand valves, and a console with submersible pressure gauge and depth gauge, which protrude from the top of the unit when in use. Some military rebreathers such as the Interspiro DCSC and the Russian IDA71 also store the breathing hoses inside the housing when not in use.

===Stage mounting===

Technical divers may need to carry several different gas mixtures, or several extra cylinders with additional gas needed for the dive. These are intended to be used for different stages of the planned dive profile, and for safety reasons it is necessary for the diver to be able to check which gas is in use at any given depth and time, and to open and close the supply valves when required, so the gases are generally carried in fully self-contained independent scuba sets, which are suspended from the harness at the diver&#x27;s sides. This arrangement is known as stage mounting, or sling mounting, the scuba sets known as stage sets or stage cylinders, and usually applies to cylinders additional to the main back mounted set or sets.

====Drop tanks====

Stage sets may be cached along a penetration guideline to be retrieved during exit for convenience. These are also called drop tanks. A drop tank is usually rigged to be carried in a sling mount, and has a regulator with a pressure gauge fitted and is deposited at a suitable place along the guideline, usually clipped to the line to ensure that it can be found again. The amount of gas in a drop tank can vary depending on how it is intended to be used. The gas mix must be suitable for the stage in which it will be used, and will be marked on a label, usually with the user&#x27;s name, to avoid confusion. The cylinder valve is closed until the time of use.

====Stage-only mounting====
Similar in basic concept to side mount and may be confused with it, but does not use bungees to control the top of the cylinder. No back mounted cylinder is carried, and all cylinders are slung at the sides like regular stage cylinders, so they do not tuck in under the arms for streamlining and low profile.

===Sidemount===
Side-mount harnesses support the cylinders by clipping them to D-rings or butt rails at the hip on either or both sides, and the cylinders hang roughly parallel to the diver&#x27;s torso when underwater. The top of the cylinder is held under the diver&#x27;s shoulder by a bungee, keeping it roughly parallel to the torso, and may also be clipped onto the harness in the shoulder area by a bolt snap for security. The harness usually includes a buoyancy compensator bladder. It is possible for a skilled diver to carry up to 3 cylinders on each side with this system.

====Monkey diving====
Recreational diving configuration with only a single side-mounted cylinder.

===No-mount diving===
For some cave diving applications where there is little or no swimming involved and tight restrictions, the diver may carry one or more cylinders simply clipped to the harness or weightbelt, which can be unclipped when necessary to pass through a restriction. This has been called no-mount diving.

==Harness construction==
Every scuba harness requires a system for supporting the cylinders on the harness, and a system for attaching the harness to the diver.

===Back mount===
The most common system has the scuba set carried on the back of the diver. This uses well developed and familiar load carrying harness systems developed for terrestrial activities, and keeps the bulky and heavy components clear of the chest area. Back mounting also tends to restrict access to the control valves for the gas supply, and puts most of the set where the diver cannot see it.

====Basic harness====
The most basic arrangement for a back-mounted set consists of a metal or webbing strap around the cylinder just below the shoulder, and another lower down the cylinder, to which webbing shoulder and waist straps are attached. Shoulder straps can be of fixed length to suit a particular diver, but are more often adjustable. Sometimes a quick release buckle is added to one or both of the shoulder straps. The waist belt has a buckle for closing and release, and the waist belt is usually adjustable for security and comfort. Various attachments have been used to attach the harness straps to the cylinder bands. A crotch strap is optional, and usually runs from the lower cylinder band to the front of the waistband. This strap prevents the set from riding upwards on the diver when in use. This arrangement is still occasionally seen in use.

====Backplate or backpack harness====

The characteristic difference between this and the basic harness, is that a rigid or flexible backplate is added between the cylinder and the harness straps. The cylinder is attached to the backplate by metal or webbing straps, and the harness straps are attached to the backplate. In other respects the system is similar to the basic harness. Methods of fixing the cylinder include metal clamping bands, secured by bolts or lever operated clamps, or webbing straps, usually secured by cam buckles.

This style of harness was originally used in this simple form, but is currently more usually used with a back inflation wing type buoyancy compensator sandwiched between the cylinder and the backplate.

=====Cam bands=====


The combination of webbing strap and cam action buckle that is used to secure the cylinder to a buoyancy compensator or backplate is known as a cam band or cam strap. They are a type of tank band, which includes the stainless steel straps used to hold twin cylinder sets together. They generally rely on an over-centre lever action to provide tensioning and locking, which may be modified by length adjustment slots and secondary security fastening such as velcro to hold the free end in place. Most cam buckles for scuba are injection moulded plastic, but some are stainless steel. Many recreational scuba harnesses rely on a single cam band to hold the cylinder to the backplate. Other models provide two cam bands for security. A cam band can also be used on a sling or sidemount scuba set to attach the lower clip to the cylinder.

=====Tank bands=====

Stainless steel tank bands are the standard method for supporting manifolded twin cylinders, as they provide good support for the cylinders, minimise loads on the manifolds and provide simple and reliable attachment points for connection to a backplate

===Front mount===
Almost exclusively used for military rebreathers and escape sets.
===Integrated harness and storage bag===

A few examples of integrating a storage and carrying bag into the harness have been made, without notable success for open circuit scuba. The most successful examples have been for military rebreathers, where there has been space in a rigid housing to fit the breathing hoses, mask or DSV, and simple harness straps inside the casing when the counterlungs are empty.
===Sidemount harness===

The most basic sidemount harness is little more than cylinders fitted with belt loops and slid onto the standard caver&#x27;s belay or battery belt along with any extra weights needed to achieve neutral buoyancy, and a caver&#x27;s belt mounted battery pack. This simple configuration is particularly low profile and suited to small cylinders.

A more complex but still minimalist system is a webbing harness with shoulder straps, waist belt and crotch strap, supporting a variety of sliders and D-rings for attachment of cylinders and accessories, with or without integrated weighting or separate weight belts, and with or without a back mounted buoyancy compensator, which may be attached to the harness, or directly to the diver. Cylinders are usually attached to a shoulder or chest D-ring and waist belt D-ring on each side.

====Sling and sidemount rigging====
The rigging of sling and sidemount cylinders is similar, but not identical. Sling rigging includes a bolt snap at the shoulder and one near the base of the cylinder, which are clipped to the main scuba harness, which may be either back or sidemount arrangement with D-rings or rails as attachment points. The sidemount cylinder rigging may omit the shoulder clip, and has a bungee loop on the harness to secure and confine the top end of the set.
==Accessories==
===Buoyancy compensator===
In most scuba sets, a buoyancy compensator (BC) or buoyancy control device (BCD), such as a back-mounted wing or stabilizer jacket (also known as a &quot;stab jacket&quot;), is built into the harness. Although strictly speaking this is not a part of the breathing apparatus, it is usually connected to the diver&#x27;s air supply, to provide easy inflation of the device. This can usually also be done manually via a mouthpiece, in order to save air while on the surface, or in case of a malfunction of the pressurized inflation system. The BCD inflates with air from the low pressure inflator hose to increase the volume of the scuba equipment and cause the diver gain buoyancy. Another button opens a valve to deflate the BCD and decrease the volume of the equipment and causes the diver to lose buoyancy. Some BCDs allow for integrated weight, meaning that the BCD has special pockets for the weights that can be dumped easily in case of an emergency. The function of the BCD, while underwater, is to keep the diver neutrally buoyant, &quot;i.e.&quot;, neither floating up nor sinking. The BCD is used to compensate for the compression of a wet suit, and to compensate for the decrease of the diver&#x27;s mass as the gas from the cylinders is used up.

===Ballast===

Ballast is used to increase the average density of the scuba diver and equipment to compensate for the buoyancy of diving equipment, particularly the diving suit, allowing the diver to fully submerge with ease by obtaining neutral or slightly negative buoyancy. Weighting systems originally consisted of solid lead blocks attached to a belt around the diver&#x27;s waist, but some diving weighting systems are incorporated into the BCD or harness. These systems may use small nylon bags of lead shot or small weights which are distributed around the BCD, allowing a diver to gain a better overall weight distribution leading to a more horizontal trim in the water. Tank weights can be attached to the cylinder or threaded on the cambands holding the cylinder into the BCD.

===Monitoring instruments===

The basic instrument for monitoring available gas is the submersible pressure gauge, which indicates the remaining pressure in a scuba cylinder, by directly measuring pressure at a high-pressure port of the regulator first stage. Recreational divers commonly mount the SPG in a rubber or plastic along with other instruments like a compass, depth gauge and/or dive computer. An alternative to the SPG is a pressure transmitter fitted to a high pressure port that wirelessly transmits the cylinder pressure to the dive computer for display, a system known as air integration.

Many closed circuit rebreathers use advanced electronics to monitor and regulate the composition of the breathing gas.

===Labelling of contents===

The composition of the gas in the scuba cylinder is analysed before use and recorded on a label on the cylinder. This is usually done directly after filling, when handing the cylinder over to the intended user, and when assembling the scuba set for use. The filler is responsible for ensuring that the mixture is within tolerance of the customer&#x27;s specification, and the user, or in some cases the instructor, is responsible for ensuring that the mixture is suitable for the planned dive. Each person who analyses the gas is responsible for ensuring that the analysis matches the label on the cylinder. The default value is air, which does not always require a specific label. If the gas is air and the cylinder is identified for air only by colour code or labeling it man not be obligatory to analyse the contents.

===Mouthpiece retaining straps===

A mouthpiece retaining strap (MRS) is an item of safety equipment which is a mandatory design feature for rebreathers sold in the EU and UK, following European rebreather standard EN14143:2013. Mouthpiece retaining straps have been shown in navy experience over several years to be effective at protecting the airway in an unconscious rebreather diver as an alternative to a full-face mask. The arrangement is required to be adjustable or self adjusting, to hold the mouthpiece firmly and comfortably in the user&#x27;s mouth, and to maintain a seal. The MRS also reduces stress on the jaw during the dive.

Mouthpiece retaining straps have also been used with open circuit scuba, both on single hose and twin hose units. They were quite common as original manufacturer&#x27;s equipment in the 1960s, when they were usually called neck straps, but at some stage lost popularity. The technical diving community later developed a similar functioning accessory generally referred to as a or bungee necklace, an aftermarket or home made elastic loop, generally used to hold the secondary demand valve in a position under the chin where it can be accessed hands-free by tilting the head. It can also be used to hold a primary demand valve in the same way, which will keep it in close proximity to the face if accidentally dropped or dislodged, making it often possible to recover hands-free. This type of retainer does not necessarily keep the mouthpiece in place in the diver&#x27;s mouth or maintain a seal if the diver loses consciousness, as the fit is not always adjustable. The bungee necklace can be pulled away from the neck with a moderate force, causing the rubber mouthpiece to pop out of the retaining loop.

===Hose swivels===
Swivel fittings between the low pressure hose and the second stage inlet connection are available which allow either a fixed angle or a variable angle between hose and demand valve housing. These allow a wider range of comfortable hose routings, particularly useful for stage and side-mount cylinders, but add another potential point of failure at the swivel joint. Swivels are also occasionally used between first stage and hose to provide better hose routing, but these usually have a fixed angle. The two types are not interchangeable, and can be recognised by the thread and O-ring arrangement.

===Second stage isolation valve===
A manually operated shut-off valve may be fitted between the low-pressure hose and the second stage, which can be used to isolate the second stage in a free-flow, or at any time when it is necessary. When this is fitted, an over-pressure relief valve us necessary on the first stage. Low profile valves operated by sliding an axial sleeve are available for this purpose and are less likely to snag than a quarter-turn ball valve, and are faster to operate than a screw-down valve, such as is standard on diving helmets for bailout.

===Adaptor for full-face mask===
Adaptors for some second stages are available to connect them to some models of full-face diving mask. The Dräger P-port system with a bayonet connector is used on Dräger Panorama masks, The Ocean Reef mask has a screw in connection, and the Kirby-Morgan 48 SuperMask uses a clip-on &quot;pod&quot; system

===Diffuser===

A diffuser is a component fitted over the exhaust outlet to break up the exhaled gas into bubbles small enough not to be seen above the surface the water, and make less noise (see acoustic signature). They are used in combat diving, to avoid detection by surface observers or by underwater hydrophones, Underwater mine disposal operations conducted by clearance divers, to make less noise, to reduce the risk of detonating acoustic mines, and in marine biology, to avoid disruption of fish behavior.

Designing an adequate diffuser for a rebreather is much easier than for open-circuit scuba, as the gas flow rate is generally much lower. An open-circuit diffuser system called the &quot;scuba muffler&quot; was prototyped by Eddie Paul in the early 1990s for underwater photographers John McKenney and Marty Snyderman; the prototype had two large filter stones mounted on the back of the cylinder with a hose connected to the exhaust ports of the second-stage regulator. The filter stones were mounted on a hinged arm to float above the diver, to set up a depth-pressure-differential suction effect to counteract the extra exhalation pressure needed to breathe out through the diffuser. The scuba muffler was claimed to cut the exhalation noise by 90%. Closed circuit rebreathers proved more useful in letting divers get near sharks.

==Gas endurance of a scuba set==


Gas endurance of a scuba set is the time that the gas supply will last during a dive. This is influenced by the type of scuba set and the circumstances in which it is used.

===Open circuit===

The gas endurance of open-circuit-demand scuba depends on factors such as the capacity (volume of gas) in the diving cylinder, the depth of the dive and the breathing rate of the diver, which is dependent on exertion, fitness, physical size of the diver, state of mind, and experience, among other factors. New divers frequently consume all the air in a standard &quot;aluminum 80&quot; cylinder in 30 minutes or less on a typical dive, while experienced divers frequently dive for 60 to 70 minutes at the same average depth, using the same capacity cylinder, as they have learned more efficient diving techniques.

An open-circuit diver whose breathing rate at the surface (atmospheric pressure) is 15 litres per minute will consume 3 × 15 = 45 litres of gas per minute at 20 metres. [(20 m/10 m per bar) + 1 bar atmospheric pressure] × 15 L/min = 45 L/min). If an 11-litre cylinder filled to 200 bar is to be used until there is a reserve of 17% there is (83% × 200 × 11) = 1826 litres available. At 45 L/min the dive at depth will be a maximum of 40.5 minutes (1826/45). These depths and times are typical of experienced recreational divers leisurely exploring a coral reef using standard 200 bar &quot;aluminum 80&quot; cylinders as may be rented from a commercial recreational diving operation in most tropical island or coastal resorts.

===Semi-closed rebreather===
A semi-closed circuit rebreather may have an endurance of about 3 to 10 times that of the equivalent open-circuit dive, and is less affected by depth; gas is recycled but fresh gas must be constantly injected to replace at least the oxygen used, and any excess gas from this must be vented. Although it uses gas more economically, the weight of the rebreather encourages the diver to carry smaller cylinders. Still, most semi-closed systems allow at least twice the duration of average sized open-circuit systems (around two hours) and are often limited by scrubber endurance.

===Closed circuit rebreathers===
An oxygen rebreather diver or a fully closed circuit rebreather diver consumes about 1 litre of oxygen corrected to atmospheric pressure per minute. Except during ascent or descent, the fully closed circuit rebreather that is operating correctly uses very little or no diluent. A diver with a 3-litre oxygen cylinder filled to 200 bar who leaves 25% in reserve will be able to do a 450-minute = 7.5 hour dive (75% × 3 litres × 200 bar × 1 litre per minute = 450 minutes). This endurance is independent of depth. The life of the soda lime scrubber is likely to be less than this and so will be the limiting factor of the dive.

In practice, dive times for rebreathers are more often influenced by other factors, such as water temperature and the need for safe ascent (see Decompression (diving)), and this is generally also true for large-capacity open-circuit sets.

==Hazards and safety==

Scuba sets contain breathing gas at high pressure. The stored energy of the gas can do considerable damage if released in an uncontrolled manner. The highest risk is during charging of cylinders, but injuries have also occurred when cylinders have been stored in excessively hot environment, which can increase the gas pressure and may occasionally result in explosive rupture of damaged cylinders, by the use of incompatible cylinder valves, which can blow out under load, or by rupture of regulator hoses in contact with the user, as a pressure of more than can rupture the skin, and inject gas into the tissues, along with possible contaminants.

Scuba is safety-critical equipment, as some modes of failure can put the user at immediate risk of death by drowning, and a catastrophic failure of a scuba cylinder can instantly kill or severely injure persons in the vicinity. Open circuit scuba is considered highly reliable if correctly assembled, tested, filled, maintained and used, and the risk of failure is fairly low, but high enough that it should be considered in dive planning, and where appropriate, precautions should be taken to allow appropriate response in case of a failure. Mitigation options depend on the circumstances and mode of failure.

==Ergonomics==

When the diver carries several diving cylinders, especially those made of steel, lack of buoyancy can be a problem, particularly at the start of a dive when they are all full, and the variation of buoyancy during the dive as the gas is used can require high-capacity buoyancy compensators to allow the diver to effectively maintain neutral buoyancy throughout the dive.

A large number of cylinders, hoses and fittings passing through the water tends to increase hydrodynamic drag, reducing swimming efficiency.
==History==


By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver&#x27;s exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver&#x27;s carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels. By the mid twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver&#x27;s exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide is removed from the diver&#x27;s exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated. Oxygen rebreathers are severely depth limited due to oxygen toxicity risk, which increases with depth, and the available systems for mixed gas rebreathers were fairly bulky and designed for use with diving helmets. The first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50–60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. This apparatus had no way of measuring the gas composition during use. During the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dräger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA, (an acronym for &quot;self-contained underwater breathing apparatus&quot;), which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity.

Although a working demand regulator system had been invented in 1864 by Auguste Denayrouze and Benoît Rouquayrol, the first open-circuit scuba system developed in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France was a manually adjusted free-flow system with a low endurance, which limited the practical usefulness of the system. In 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. This was patented in 1945. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company, and in 1948 to Siebe Gorman of England, Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. The patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver&#x27;s mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first Porpoise Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.

Early scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver&#x27;s back. Early scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid. In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit an oral inflation valve and a dump valve lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.
A backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a &quot;wing&quot; mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit. Sidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic scuba sets, each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave as, sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves, and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made wreck diving penetrations. Sidemount diving has grown in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and has become a popular specialty for recreational diving.
Technical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the generally accepted recreational limits, and may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risks of serious injury or death. These risks may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations. Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving.

The challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles and ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth. In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millennium. Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets.

<text>Subtractive synthesis is a method of sound synthesis in which overtones of an audio signal are attenuated by a filter to alter the timbre of the sound. 

==Overview==
Subtractive synthesis relies on source sounds that have overtones, such as non-sinusoidal waveforms like square and triangle waves, or white and pink noise. These overtones are then modulated to alter the source sound. This modulation can happen in a wide variety of ways, such as voltage-controlled or low-pass filters.

The technology developed in experimental electronic studios which were primarily focused on telecommunications and military applications. Early examples include Bell Labs&#x27; Voder (1937–8). Composers began applying the concept of subtractive synthesis beyond the recording studio in concert music. Henri Pousseur&#x27;s &quot;Scambi&quot; (1957) subjects white noise to filters and uses the resulting sounds to create montages. &quot;Mikrophonie I&quot; (1964) by Karlheinz Stockhausen uses a tam-tam and a microphone as the primary sound source which is then filtered extensively by two sound projectionists.

Until the advent of digital synthesizers, subtractive synthesis was the nearly universal electronic method of sound production. Its popularity was due largely to its relative simplicity. Subtractive synthesis was so prevalent in analog synthesizers that it is sometimes called &quot;analog synthesis&quot;. It was the method of sound production in instruments like the Trautonium (1930), Novachord (1939), Buchla 100 (1960s), EMS VCS 3 (1969), Minimoog (1970), ARP 2600 (1971), Oberheim OB-1 (1978), and Korg MS-20 (1978). Programmable sound generators (PSG) relied heavily on subtractive synthesis. PSGs were used in many personal computers, arcade games, and home consoles such as the Commodore 64, Atari ST, Mattel&#x27;s Intellivision, Sega&#x27;s Master System, and the ZX Spectrum.

==Nomenclature==
Subtractive synthesis has become a catchall for a method where source sounds are modulated, and it is sometimes applied inappropriately.

==Method==
The following is an example of subtractive synthesis as it might occur in an electronic instrument to emulate the sound of a plucked string. It was created with a personal computer program designed to emulate an analogue subtractive synthesizer.

===Source Sound===
First, an electronic oscillator produces a relatively complex waveform with audible overtones. Only one oscillator is necessary, and the number can vary widely. In this case, two oscillators are used:

Pulse-width modulation is applied to both waveforms to create a more complex tone with vibrato:
The pulse-width modulated sounds are now combined at equal volume. Combining them at different volumes would create different timbres. The result is a 2-second source sound, which is ready for subtractive synthesis.
===Subtractive Synthesis===
The combined wave is passed through a voltage-controlled amplifier connected to an envelope generator. The parameters of the sound&#x27;s envelope (attack, decay, sustain and release) are manipulated to change its sound. In this case, the decay is vastly increased, sustain is reduced, and the release shortened. The resulting sound is audible for half as long as the source sound:
With its new envelope, the sound is run through a low-pass filter, which reduces the volume of higher overtones:
To better emulate the sound of a plucked string, the filter&#x27;s cutoff frequency is lowered.

<text>San Diego ( , ) is a city on the Pacific coast of Southern California, adjacent to the Mexico–United States border. With a population of over 1.3 million, it is the eighth-most populous city in the United States and the second-most populous in the state of California. San Diego is the seat of San Diego County, which has a population of nearly 3.3 million. It is known for its mild year-round Mediterranean climate, extensive beaches and parks, long association with the United States Navy, and recent emergence as a healthcare and biotechnology development center.

Historically home to the Kumeyaay people, San Diego has been referred to as the &quot;Birthplace of California&quot;, as it was the first site visited and settled by Europeans on what is now the West Coast of the United States. Upon landing in San Diego Bay in 1542, Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claimed the area for Spain, forming the basis for the settlement of Alta California 200 years later. The Presidio and Mission San Diego de Alcalá, founded in 1769, formed the first European settlement in what is now California. In 1821, San Diego became part of the newly declared Mexican Empire, which reformed as the First Mexican Republic two years later. California was conquered by the U.S. in 1848 following the Mexican–American War and was admitted as the 31st state in 1850.

The largest sectors of the economy of San Diego include military and defense-related activities, tourism, international trade, research, and manufacturing. The city is home to several universities, including UC San Diego, San Diego State University, and the University of San Diego. San Diego is the economic center of the San Diego–Tijuana region, the second-most populous transborder metropolitan area in the Western Hemisphere, home to an estimated five million people as of 2022. The primary border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, the San Ysidro Port of Entry, is the busiest international land border crossing in the world outside of Asia (fourth-busiest overall). San Diego International Airport (SAN) is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States.

==Name==

San Diego&#x27;s name can be traced back to the 16th century when Spanish explorer Sebastián Vizcaíno bestowed it upon the area in 1602. He named the bay and the surrounding area &quot;San Diego de Alcalá&quot; in honor of Saint Didacus of Alcalá.

Prior to the Spanish establishment of San Diego, the Kumeyaay town was called Kosa&#x27;aay, meaning &quot;drying out place&quot; in the Kumeyaay language. After the establishment of San Diego, the Kumeyaay called town and city &quot;Tepacul Watai&quot;, meaning &quot;Stacked Big&quot;. Luiseño speakers in the North County region called it &quot;Pushuyi&quot;.

==History==

===Pre-colonial period===
What has been referred to as the San Dieguito complex was established in the area at least 9,000 years ago. The Kumeyaay may have culturally evolved from this complex or migrated into the area around 1000 C.E. Archaeologist Malcolm Rogers hypothesized that the early cultures of San Diego were separate from the Kumeyaay, but this claim is disputed. Rogers later reevaluated his claims, yet they were influential in shaping historical tellings of early San Diego history.

The Kumeyaay established villages scattered across the region, including the village of Kosa&#x27;aay which was the Kumeyaay village that the future settlement of San Diego would stem from in today&#x27;s Old Town. The village of Kosa&#x27;aay was made up of thirty to forty families living in pyramid-shaped housing structures and was supported by a freshwater spring from the hillsides.

===Spanish period===

The first European to visit the region was explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo. Sailing his flagship &quot;San Salvador&quot; from Navidad, New Spain, Cabrillo claimed the bay for the Spanish Empire in 1542, and named the site &quot;San Miguel&quot;. In November 1602, Sebastián Vizcaíno surveyed the harbor and what are now Mission Bay and Point Loma and named the area for the Catholic Saint Didacus, a Spaniard more commonly known as &quot;San Diego de Alcalá&quot;.

The permanent European colonization of both California and San Diego began in 1769 with the arrival of four contingents of Spaniards from New Spain and the Baja California peninsula. Two seaborne parties reached San Diego Bay: the &quot;San Carlos&quot;, under Vicente Vila and including as notable members the engineer and cartographer Miguel Costansó and the soldier and future governor Pedro Fages, and the &quot;San Antonio&quot;, under Juan Pérez. An initial overland expedition to San Diego from the south was led by the soldier Fernando Rivera and included the Franciscan missionary, explorer, and chronicler Juan Crespí, followed by a second party led by the designated governor Gaspar de Portolá and including the mission president Junípero Serra.

In May 1769, Portolà established the Presidio of San Diego on a hill near the San Diego River above the Kumeyaay village of Cosoy, which would later become incorporated into the Spanish settlement, making it the first settlement by Europeans in what is now the state of California. In July of the same year, Mission San Diego de Alcalá was founded by Franciscan friars under Serra. The mission became a site for a Kumeyaay revolt in 1775, which forced the mission to relocate up the San Diego River. By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper. Mission San Diego was the southern anchor in Alta California of the historic mission trail El Camino Real. Both the Presidio and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.

===Mexican period===

In 1821, Mexico won its independence from Spain, and San Diego became part of the Mexican territory of Alta California. In 1822, Mexico began its attempt to extend its authority over the coastal territory of Alta California. The fort on Presidio Hill was gradually abandoned, while the town of San Diego grew up on the level land below Presidio Hill. The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1834, and most of the Mission lands were granted to former soldiers. The 432 residents of the town petitioned the governor to form a pueblo, and Juan María Osuna was elected the first &quot;alcalde&quot; (&quot;municipal magistrate&quot;). Beyond the town, Mexican land grants expanded the number of California ranchos that modestly added to the local economy.

However, San Diego had been losing population throughout the 1830s, due to increasing tension between the settlers and the indigenous Kumeyaay and in 1838 the town lost its pueblo status because its size dropped to an estimated 100 to 150 residents. The ranchos in the San Diego region faced Kumeyaay raids in the late 1830s and the town itself faced raids in the 1840s.

Americans gained an increased awareness of California, and its commercial possibilities, from the writings of two countrymen involved in the often officially forbidden, to foreigners, but economically significant hide and tallow trade, where San Diego was a major port and the only one with an adequate harbor: William Shaler&#x27;s &quot;Journal of a Voyage Between China and the North-Western Coast of America, Made in 1804&quot; and Richard Henry Dana&#x27;s more substantial and convincing account, of his 1834–36 voyage, &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;.

In 1846, the United States went to war against Mexico and sent a naval and land expedition to conquer Alta California. At first, they had an easy time of it, capturing the major ports including San Diego, but the Californios in southern Alta California struck back. Following the successful revolt in Los Angeles, the American garrison at San Diego was driven out without firing a shot in early October 1846. Mexican partisans held San Diego for three weeks until October 24, 1846, when the Americans recaptured it. For the next several months the Americans were blockaded inside the pueblo. Skirmishes occurred daily and snipers shot into the town every night. The Californios drove cattle away from the pueblo hoping to starve the Americans and their Californio supporters out. On December 1, the American garrison learned that the dragoons of General Stephen W. Kearney were at Warner&#x27;s Ranch. Commodore Robert F. Stockton sent a mounted force of fifty under Captain Archibald Gillespie to march north to meet him. Their joint command of 150 men, returning to San Diego, encountered about 93 Californios under Andrés Pico. 

In the ensuing Battle of San Pasqual, fought in the San Pasqual Valley which is now part of the city of San Diego, the Americans suffered their worst losses in the campaign. Subsequently, a column led by Lieutenant Gray arrived from San Diego, rescuing Kearny&#x27;s command. Stockton and Kearny went on to recover Los Angeles and force the capitulation of Alta California with the &quot;Treaty of Cahuenga&quot; on January 13, 1847. As a result of the Mexican–American War of 1846–48, the territory of Alta California, including San Diego, was ceded to the United States by Mexico, under the terms of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The Mexican negotiators of that treaty tried to retain San Diego as part of Mexico, but the Americans insisted that San Diego was &quot;for every commercial purpose of nearly equal importance to us with that of San Francisco&quot;, and the Mexican–American border was eventually established to be one league south of the southernmost point of San Diego Bay.

===American period===

The state of California was admitted to the United States in 1850. That same year San Diego was designated the seat of the newly established County of San Diego and was incorporated as a city. Joshua H. Bean, the last alcalde of San Diego, was elected the first mayor. Two years later the city was bankrupt; the California legislature revoked the city&#x27;s charter and placed it under control of a board of trustees, where it remained until 1889. A city charter was reestablished in 1889, and today&#x27;s city charter was adopted in 1931.

The original town of San Diego was located at the foot of Presidio Hill, in the area which is now Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. The location was not ideal, being several miles away from navigable water at its port at La Playa. In 1850, William Heath Davis promoted a new development by the bay shore called &quot;New San Diego&quot;, several miles south of the original settlement; however, for several decades the new development consisted only of a pier, a few houses and an Army depot for the support of Fort Yuma. After 1854, the fort became supplied by sea and by steamboats on the Colorado River and the depot fell into disuse. From 1857 to 1860, San Diego became the western terminus of the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line, the earliest overland stagecoach and mail operation from the Eastern United States to California, coming from Texas through New Mexico Territory in less than 30 days.

In the late 1860s, Alonzo Horton promoted a move to the bayside area, which he called &quot;New Town&quot; and which became downtown San Diego. Horton promoted the area heavily, and people and businesses began to relocate to New Town because its location on San Diego Bay was convenient to shipping. New Town soon eclipsed the original settlement, known to this day as Old Town, and became the economic and governmental heart of the city. Still, San Diego remained a relative backwater town until the arrival of a railroad connection in 1878.

In 1912, San Diego was the site of a free speech fight between the Industrial Workers of the World and the city government who passed an ordinance forbidding the freedom of speech along an area of &quot;Soapbox Row&quot; that led to civil disobedience, vigilantism, police violence, the abduction of Emma Goldman&#x27;s husband Ben Reitman and multiple riots. San Diego&#x27;s proximity to Tijuana during the Mexican Revolution made this one of the most significant free speech fights during the Wobbly era.

In 1916, the neighborhood of Stingaree, the original home of San Diego&#x27;s first Chinatown and &quot;Soapbox Row&quot;, was demolished by anti-vice campaigners to make way for the Gaslamp Quarter.
In the early part of the 20th century, San Diego hosted the World&#x27;s Fair twice: the Panama–California Exposition in 1915 and the California Pacific International Exposition in 1935. Both expositions were held in Balboa Park, and many of the Spanish/Baroque-style buildings that were built for those expositions remain to this day as central features of the park. The menagerie of exotic animals featured at the 1915 exposition provided the basis for the San Diego Zoo. During the 1950s there was a citywide festival called Fiesta del Pacifico highlighting the area&#x27;s Spanish and Mexican past.

The southern portion of the Point Loma peninsula was set aside for military purposes as early as 1852. Over the next several decades the Army set up a series of coastal artillery batteries and named the area Fort Rosecrans. Significant U.S. Navy presence began in 1901 with the establishment of the Navy Coaling Station in Point Loma, and expanded greatly during the 1920s. By 1930, the city was host to Naval Base San Diego, Naval Training Center San Diego, San Diego Naval Hospital, Camp Matthews, and Camp Kearny (now Marine Corps Air Station Miramar). The city was also an early center for aviation: as early as World War I, San Diego was proclaiming itself &quot;The Air Capital of the West&quot;. The city was home to important airplane developers and manufacturers like Ryan Airlines (later Ryan Aeronautical), founded in 1925, and Consolidated Aircraft (later Convair), founded in 1923. Charles A. Lindbergh&#x27;s plane, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, was built in San Diego in 1927 by Ryan Airlines.

During World War II, San Diego became a major hub of military and defense activity, due to the presence of so many military installations and defense manufacturers. The city&#x27;s population grew rapidly during and after World War II, more than doubling between 1930 (147,995) and 1950 (333,865). During the final months of the war, the Japanese had a plan to target multiple U.S. cities for biological attack, starting with San Diego. The plan was called &quot;Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night&quot; and called for kamikaze planes filled with fleas infected with plague (&quot;Yersinia pestis&quot;) to crash into civilian population centers in the city, hoping to spread plague in the city and effectively kill tens of thousands of civilians. The plan was scheduled to launch on September 22, 1945, but was not carried out because Japan surrendered five weeks earlier.

After World War II, the military continued to play a major role in the local economy, but post–Cold War cutbacks took a heavy toll on the local defense and aerospace industries. The resulting downturn led San Diego leaders to seek to diversify the city&#x27;s economy by focusing on research and science, as well as tourism.

From the start of the 20th century through the 1970s, the American tuna fishing fleet and tuna canning industry were based in San Diego, &quot;the tuna capital of the world&quot;. San Diego&#x27;s first tuna cannery was founded in 1911, and by the mid-1930s the canneries employed more than 1,000 people. A large fishing fleet supported the canneries, mostly staffed by immigrant fishermen from Japan, and later from the Azores and Italy whose influence is still felt in neighborhoods like Little Italy and Point Loma. Due to rising costs and foreign competition, the last of the canneries closed in the early 1980s.

Downtown San Diego was in decline in the 1960s and 1970s, but experienced some urban renewal since the early 1980s, including the opening of Horton Plaza, the revival of the Gaslamp Quarter, and the construction of the San Diego Convention Center; Petco Park opened in 2004. Outside of downtown, San Diego annexed large swaths of land and for suburban expansion to the north and control of the San Ysidro Port of Entry.

As the Cold War ended, the military shrank and so did defense spending. San Diego has since become a center of the emerging biotech industry and is home to telecommunications giant Qualcomm. San Diego had also grown in the tourism industry with the popularity of attractions such as the San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld San Diego, and Legoland California in Carlsbad.

==Geography==

According to SDSU professor emeritus Monte Marshall, San Diego Bay is &quot;the surface expression of a north-south-trending, nested graben&quot;. The Rose Canyon and Point Loma fault zones are part of the San Andreas Fault system. About east of the bay are the Laguna Mountains in the Peninsular Ranges, which are part of the American Cordillera.

The city lies on approximately 200 deep canyons and hills separating its mesas, creating small pockets of natural open space scattered throughout the city and giving it a hilly geography. Traditionally, San Diegans have built their homes and businesses on the mesas, while leaving the urban canyons relatively wild. Thus, the canyons give parts of the city a segmented feel, creating gaps between otherwise proximate neighborhoods and contributing to a low-density, car-centered environment. The San Diego River runs through the middle of San Diego from east to west, creating a river valley that serves to divide the city into northern and southern segments. Several reservoirs and Mission Trails Regional Park also lie between and separate developed areas of the city.

Notable peaks within the city limits include Cowles Mountain, the highest point in the city at ; Black Mountain at ; and Mount Soledad at . The Cuyamaca Mountains and Laguna Mountains rise to the east of the city, and beyond the mountains are desert areas. Cleveland National Forest is a half-hour drive from downtown San Diego. Numerous farms are found in the valleys northeast and southeast of the city.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system, the San Diego area has been variously categorized as having either a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot; in the original classification and &quot;BSkn&quot; in modified Köppen classification with the n denoting summer fog) or a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;). San Diego&#x27;s climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters, with most of the annual precipitation falling between December and March. The city has a mild climate year-round, with an average of 201 days above and low rainfall ( annually).

The climate in San Diego, like most of Southern California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances, resulting in microclimates. In San Diego, this is mostly because of the city&#x27;s topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the &quot;May gray/June gloom&quot; period, a thick &quot;marine layer&quot; cloud cover keeps the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but yields to bright cloudless sunshine approximately inland. Sometimes the June gloom lasts into July, causing cloudy skies over most of San Diego for the entire day. Even in the absence of June gloom, inland areas experience much more significant temperature variations than coastal areas, where the ocean serves as a moderating influence. Thus, for example, downtown San Diego averages January lows of and August highs of . The city of El Cajon, just inland from downtown San Diego, averages January lows of and August highs of .

The average surface temperature of the water at Scripps Pier in the California Current has increased by almost since 1950, according to scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Additionally, the mean minimum is now above , putting San Diego in hardiness zone 11, with the last freeze having occurred many decades ago.

Annual rainfall along the coast averages and the median is . The months of December through March supply most of the rain, with February the only month averaging or more. The months of May through September tend to be almost completely dry. Although there are few wet days per month during the rainy period, rainfall can be heavy when it does fall. Rainfall is usually greater in the higher elevations of San Diego; some of the higher areas can receive per year. Variability from year to year can be dramatic: in the wettest years of 1883/1884 and 1940/1941, more than fell, whilst in the driest years there was as little as . The wettest month on record is December 1921 with .

Snow in the city is rare, having been observed only six times in the century and a half that records have been kept. On February 21, 2019, snow fell and accumulated in residential areas of the city, but none fell in the downtown area.


===Ecology===
Like much of Southern California, the majority of San Diego&#x27;s current area was originally occupied on the west by coastal sage scrub and on the east by chaparral, plant communities made up mostly of drought-resistant shrubs. The steep and varied topography and proximity to the ocean create a number of different habitats within the city limits, including tidal marsh and canyons. The chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats in low elevations along the coast are prone to wildfire, and the rates of fire increased in the 20th century, due primarily to fires starting near the borders of urban and wild areas.

San Diego&#x27;s broad city limits encompass a number of large nature preserves, including Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, Los Peñasquitos Canyon Preserve, and Mission Trails Regional Park. Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and a coastal strip continuing to the north constitute one of only two locations where the rare species of Torrey Pine, &quot;Pinus torreyana&quot;, is found. 
Due to the steep topography that prevents or discourages building, along with some efforts for preservation, there are also a large number of canyons within the city limits that serve as nature preserves, including Switzer Canyon, Tecolote Canyon Natural Park, and Marian Bear Memorial Park in San Clemente Canyon, as well as a number of small parks and preserves.
San Diego County has one of the highest counts of animal and plant species that appear on the endangered list of counties in the United States. Because of its diversity of habitat and its position on the Pacific Flyway, San Diego County has recorded 492 different bird species, more than any other region in the country. San Diego always scores high in the number of bird species observed in the annual Christmas Bird Count, sponsored by the Audubon Society, and it is known as one of the &quot;birdiest&quot; areas in the United States.

San Diego and its backcountry suffer from periodic wildfires. In October 2003, San Diego was the site of the Cedar Fire, at that time the largest wildfire in California over the past century. The fire burned , killed 15 people, and destroyed more than 2,200 homes. In addition to damage caused by the fire, smoke resulted in a significant increase in emergency room visits; the poor air quality caused San Diego County schools to close for a week. The October 2007 California wildfires destroyed some areas, particularly within Rancho Bernardo, as well as the nearby communities of Rancho Santa Fe and Ramona.

===Neighborhoods===

The City of San Diego recognizes 52 individual areas as Community Planning Areas. Within a given planning area there may be several distinct neighborhoods. Altogether the city contains more than 100 identified neighborhoods.

Downtown San Diego is located on San Diego Bay. Balboa Park encompasses several mesas and canyons to the northeast, surrounded by older, dense urban communities including Hillcrest and North Park. To the east and southeast lie City Heights, the College Area, and Southeast San Diego. To the north lies Mission Valley and Interstate 8. The communities north of the valley and freeway, and south of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, include Clairemont, Kearny Mesa, Tierrasanta, and Navajo. Stretching north from Miramar are the northern suburbs of Mira Mesa, Scripps Ranch, Rancho Peñasquitos, and Rancho Bernardo. The far northeast portion of the city encompasses Lake Hodges and the San Pasqual Valley, which holds an agricultural preserve. Carmel Valley and Del Mar Heights occupy the northwest corner of the city. To their south are Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve and the business center of the Golden Triangle. Further south are the beach and coastal communities of La Jolla, Pacific Beach, Mission Beach, and Ocean Beach. Point Loma occupies the peninsula across San Diego Bay from downtown. The communities of South San Diego (an Exclave), such as San Ysidro and Otay Mesa, are located next to the Mexico–United States border, and are physically separated from the rest of the city by the cities of National City and Chula Vista. A narrow strip of land at the bottom of San Diego Bay connects these southern neighborhoods with the rest of the city.

For the most part, San Diego neighborhood boundaries tend to be understood by its residents based on geographical boundaries like canyons and street patterns. The city recognized the importance of its neighborhoods when it organized its 2008 General Plan around the concept of a &quot;City of Villages&quot;.

===Cityscape===
San Diego was originally centered on the Old Town district, but by the late 1860s the focus had shifted to the bayfront, in the belief that this new location would increase trade. As the &quot;New Town&quot; – present-day Downtown – waterfront location quickly developed, it eclipsed Old Town as the center of San Diego.

The first skyscraper over in San Diego was the El Cortez Hotel, built in 1927; it was the tallest building in the city until 1963. As time went on, multiple buildings claimed the title of San Diego&#x27;s tallest skyscraper, including the 530 B Street and Symphony Towers. Currently the tallest building in San Diego is One America Plaza, standing tall, which was completed in 1991. The downtown skyline contains no supertall buildings due to a regulation put in place by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the 1970s, which set a limit on the height of buildings within a radius of San Diego International Airport. An iconic description of the skyline includes its skyscrapers being compared to the tools of a toolbox.

There are several new high-rises under construction, including two that exceed 400 feet (122 m) in height.

==Demographics==


===2020===
===2010===
The city had a population of 1,307,402 according to the 2010 census, distributed over a land area of . The urban area of San Diego had a total population of 2,956,746, making it the third-largest in the state, after those of Los Angeles and San Francisco.

The 2010 population represented an increase of just under 7% from the 1,223,400 people reported in 2000. The population density was . The racial makeup of San Diego was 58.9% White, 6.7% African American, 0.6% Native American, 15.9% Asian (5.9% Filipino, 2.7% Chinese, 2.5% Vietnamese, 1.3% Indian, 1.0% Korean, 0.7% Japanese, 0.4% Laotian, 0.3% Cambodian, 0.1% Thai). 0.5% Pacific Islander (0.2% Guamanian, 0.1% Samoan, 0.1% Native Hawaiian), 12.3% from other races, and 5.1% from two or more races. 28.8% of the population was Hispanic or Latino (of any race); 24.9% of the total population was of Mexican heritage, 1.4% Spanish and 0.6% Puerto Rican. The median age of Hispanic residents was 27.5 years, compared to 35.1 years overall and 41.6 years among non-Hispanic whites; Hispanic San Diegans were the largest group under the age of 18, while non-Hispanic whites constituted 63.1% of population 55 and older.

, the San Diego City and County had the fifth-largest homeless population among major cities in the United States, with 8,102 people experiencing homelessness. In the city of San Diego, 4,887 individuals were experiencing homelessness according to the 2020 count. A December 11, 2023, article in &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; by Blake Nelson reports a notable decline in the homeless population in downtown San Diego, specifically in the urban core. According to data from the Downtown San Diego Partnership, the number of individuals living outside or in vehicles has reached a two-year low, standing at approximately 1,200 as of last month. The decrease is attributed to the implementation of the city&#x27;s camping ban and the concerted efforts to establish new shelters. While enforcement has led to relatively few individuals being punished, the threat of legal consequences appears to have played a role in the reduction.

==Government==
===Local government===
The city is governed by a mayor and a nine-member city council. In 2006, its government changed from a council–manager government to a strong mayor government, as decided by a citywide vote in 2004. The mayor is in effect the chief executive officer of the city, while the council is the legislative body.

The mayor, city attorney, and council members are elected to four-year terms, with a two-term limit. Elections are held on a non-partisan basis per California state law; nevertheless, most officeholders do identify themselves as either Democrats or Republicans. In 2007, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about 7 to 6 in the city, and Democrats currently () hold an 8–1 majority in the city council. The current mayor, Todd Gloria, is a member of the Democratic Party.

San Diego is a member of the regional planning agency San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). Public schools within the city are managed and funded by independent school districts (see below).

After narrowly supporting Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964, San Diego provided majorities to all six Republican presidential candidates from 1968 to 1988.

San Diego was the site of the 1912 San Diego free speech fight, in which the city restricted speech, vigilantes brutalized and tortured anarchists, and the San Diego Police Department killed a member of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW).

In 1916, rainmaker Charles Hatfield was blamed for $4 million in damages and accused of causing San Diego&#x27;s worst flood, during which about 20 Japanese American farmers died.

Then-mayor Roger Hedgecock was forced to resign his post in 1985, after he was found guilty of one count of conspiracy and 12 counts of perjury, related to the alleged failure to report all campaign contributions. After a series of appeals, the 12 perjury counts were dismissed in 1990 based on claims of juror misconduct; the remaining conspiracy count was reduced to a misdemeanor and then dismissed.

A 2002 scheme to underfund pensions for city employees led to the San Diego pension scandal. This resulted in the resignation of newly re-elected Mayor Dick Murphy and the criminal indictment of six pension board members. Those charges were finally dismissed by a federal judge in 2010.

On November 28, 2005, U.S. Congressman Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham resigned after being convicted on federal bribery charges. He had represented California&#x27;s 50th congressional district, which includes much of the northern portion of the city of San Diego. In 2006, Cunningham was sentenced to a 100-month prison sentence.

In 2005 two city council members, Ralph Inzunza and Deputy Mayor Michael Zucchet, were convicted of extortion, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for taking campaign contributions from a strip club owner and his associates, allegedly in exchange for trying to repeal the city&#x27;s &quot;no touch&quot; laws at strip clubs. Both subsequently resigned. Inzunza was sentenced to 21 months in prison. In 2009, a judge acquitted Zucchet on seven out of the nine counts against him, and granted his petition for a new trial on the other two charges; the remaining charges were eventually dropped.

In July 2013, three former supporters of Mayor Bob Filner asked him to resign because of allegations of repeated sexual harassment. Over the ensuing six weeks, 18 women came forward to publicly claim that Filner had sexually harassed them, and multiple individuals and groups called for him to resign. Filner agreed to resign effective August 30, 2013, subsequently pleading guilty to one felony count of false imprisonment and two misdemeanor battery charges.

===Crime===
Like most major cities, San Diego had a declining crime rate from 1990 to 2000. 1991 would mark the city&#x27;s deadliest year, registering 179 homicides within city limits (while the region as a whole peaked at 278 homicides), capping off an unabated, eight-year climb in murders, rapes, robberies, and assault dating back to 1983. At the time, the city was ranked last among the 10 most populous U.S. cities in homicides per 1,000 population, and ninth in crimes per 1,000. From 1980 to 1994, San Diego surpassed 100 murders ten times before tapering off to 91 homicides in 1995. That number would not exceed 79 for the next 15 years. Crime in San Diego increased in the early 2000s. In 2004, San Diego had the sixth lowest crime rate of any U.S. city with over half a million residents. From 2002 to 2006, the crime rate overall dropped 0.8%, though not evenly by category. While violent crime decreased 12.4% during this period, property crime increased 1.1%. Total property crimes per 100,000 people were lower than the national average in 2008.

According to Uniform Crime Report statistics compiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 2010, there were 5,616 violent crimes and 30,753 property crimes. Of these, the violent crimes consisted of forcible rapes, 73 robberies and 170 aggravated assaults, while 6,387 burglaries, 17,977 larceny-thefts, 6,389 motor vehicle thefts and 155 acts of arson defined the property offenses. In 2013, San Diego had the lowest murder rate of the ten largest cities in the United States.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===
Public schools in San Diego are operated by independent school districts. The majority of the public schools in the city are served by San Diego Unified School District, the second-largest school district in California, which includes 11 K–8 schools, 107 elementary schools, 24 middle schools, 13 atypical and alternative schools, 28 high schools, and 45 charter schools.

Several adjacent school districts which are headquartered outside the city limits serve some schools within the city; these include Poway Unified School District, Del Mar Union School District, San Dieguito Union High School District, and Sweetwater Union High School District. In addition, there are a number of private schools in the city.

===Colleges and universities===

According to education rankings released by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2017, 44.4% of San Diegans (city, not county) ages 25 and older hold bachelor&#x27;s degrees, compared to 30.9% in the United States as a whole. The census ranks the city as the ninth-most educated city in the United States, based on these figures.

===Libraries===

The city-run San Diego Public Library system is headquartered downtown and has 36 branches throughout the city. The newest location is in Skyline Hills, which broke ground in 2015. The libraries have had reduced operating hours since 2003 due to the city&#x27;s financial problems. In 2006 the city increased spending on libraries by $2.1 million. A new nine-story Central Library on Park Boulevard at J Street opened on September 30, 2013.

In addition to the municipal public library system, there are nearly two dozen libraries open to the public run by other governmental agencies, and by schools, colleges, and universities. Noteworthy are Malcolm A. Love Library at San Diego State University, and Geisel Library at the University of California, San Diego.

==Culture==

The culture of San Diego is influenced heavily by the mixing of American and Mexican cultures, due to the city&#x27;s position on the Mexico–United States border, its large Chicano population, and its history as part of Hispanic America and Mexico. San Diego&#x27;s longtime association with the U.S. military also contributes to its culture.

Many popular museums, such as the San Diego Museum of Art, the San Diego Natural History Museum, the Museum of Us, the Museum of Photographic Arts, and the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum, are located in Balboa Park, which is also the location of the San Diego Zoo. The Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego (MCASD) is located in La Jolla and has a branch located at Santa Fe Depot downtown.

San Diego hosted the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s San Diego Chargers from 1961 to 2017, when the team relocated to the Greater Los Angeles area (now the Los Angeles Chargers). The city also hosted the National Basketball Association (NBA)&#x27;s San Diego Rockets from 1967 to 1971 (now the Houston Rockets) and San Diego Clippers from 1978 to 1984 (now the Los Angeles Clippers). San Diego has never hosted a National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, though it hosted the San Diego Mariners of the now-defunct World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1974 to 1977.

Currently, there is no NBA, NFL, or NHL team in the city. San Diego is the largest American city not to have won a championship in a &quot;Big Four&quot; major professional league. The city does have one major league title to its name: the 1963 American Football League (AFL) Championship won by the San Diego Chargers, when the AFL was an independent entity prior to the AFL–NFL merger in 1970. Some San Diego sports fans believe there is a curse on professional sports in the city.

== Media ==

Published within the city are the daily newspaper, &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; and its online portal of the same name, and the alternative newsweeklies, &quot;San Diego CityBeat&quot; and the &quot;San Diego Reader&quot;. The &quot;Times of San Diego&quot; is a free online newspaper covering news in the metropolitan area. &quot;Voice of San Diego&quot; is a non-profit online news outlet covering government, politics, education, neighborhoods, and the arts.

San Diego led U.S. local markets with 69.6 percent broadband penetration in 2004 according to Nielsen//NetRatings.

San Diego&#x27;s first television station was KFMB, which began broadcasting on May 16, 1949. Since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensed seven television stations in Los Angeles, two VHF channels were available for San Diego because of its relative proximity to the larger city. In 1952, however, the FCC began licensing UHF channels, making it possible for cities such as San Diego to acquire more stations. Stations based in Mexico (with ITU prefixes of XE and XH) also serve the San Diego market. Television stations today include XHCPDE 11 (Canal Once (Mexico)), XETV 6 (Canal 5/Nueve), KFMB 8 (CBS, with The CW/MNTV on DT2), KGTV 10 (ABC), XEWT 12 (Televisa Regional), KPBS 15 (PBS), KBNT-CD 17 (Univision), XHTIT-TDT 21 (Azteca 7), XHJK-TDT 1 (Azteca Uno), XHAS 33 (Canal 66), K35DG-D 35 (UCSD-TV), KDTF-LD 36 (Unimás), KNSD 39 (NBC), KUAN-LD 48 (Telemundo), KSKT-CD 43 (Estrella TV), XHBJ-TDT 45 (Canal 45 PSN), XHDTV 49 (Canal 6), KUSI 51 (Independent), XHUAA-TDT 57 (El Canal de las Estrellas), and KSWB-TV 69 (Fox). San Diego has an 80.6 percent cable penetration rate.

Due to the ratio of U.S. and Mexican-licensed stations, San Diego is the largest media market in the United States that is legally unable to support a television station duopoly between two full-power stations under FCC regulations, which disallow duopolies in metropolitan areas with fewer than nine full-power television stations and require that there would be eight unique station owners that remain once a duopoly is formed (there are only seven full-power stations on the California side of the San Diego-Tijuana market). As a whole, the Mexico side of the San Diego-Tijuana market has two duopolies and one triopoly (Entravision Communications owns XHDTV-TV, Azteca owns XHJK-TV and XHTIT-TV, and Grupo Televisa owns XETV-TV, XHUAA-TV and XEWT-TV. 

San Diego&#x27;s television market is limited to only San Diego County. As a result, San Diego is the largest single-county media market in the United States.

The radio stations in San Diego include nationwide broadcaster iHeartMedia, Audacy, Inc., Local Media San Diego, and many other smaller stations and networks. Stations include: KOGO AM 600, KGB AM 760, KCEO AM 1000, KCBQ AM 1170, K-Praise, KLSD AM 1360, KFSD 1450 AM, KPBS-FM 89.5, Channel 933, Star 94.1, FM 94/9, FM News and Talk 95.7, Q96 96.1, KyXy 96.5, Free Radio San Diego (AKA Pirate Radio San Diego) 96.9FM FRSD, KWFN 97.3, KXSN 98.1, Big-FM 100.7, 101.5 KGB-FM, KLVJ 102.1, KSON 103.7, Rock 105.3, and another &quot;Pirate Radio&quot; station at 106.9FM, as well as a number of local Spanish-language radio stations.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
With the automobile being the primary means of transportation for over 80 percent of residents, San Diego is served by a network of freeways and highways. This includes Interstate 5, which runs south to Tijuana and north to Los Angeles; Interstate 8, which runs east to Imperial County and the Arizona Sun Corridor; Interstate 15, which runs northeast through the Inland Empire to Las Vegas and Salt Lake City; and Interstate 805, which splits from I-5 near the Mexican border and rejoins I-5 at Sorrento Valley.

Major state highways include SR 94, which connects downtown with I-805, I-15 and East County; SR 163, which connects downtown with the northeast part of the city, intersects I-805 and merges with I-15 at Miramar; SR 52, which connects La Jolla with East County through Santee and SR 125; SR 56, which connects I-5 with I-15 through Carmel Valley and Rancho Peñasquitos; SR 75, which spans San Diego Bay as the San Diego–Coronado Bridge, and also passes through South San Diego as Palm Avenue; and SR 905, which connects I-5 and I-805 to the Otay Mesa Port of Entry.

The stretch of SR 163 that passes through Balboa Park is San Diego&#x27;s oldest freeway, dating back to 1948 when it was part of US 80 and US 395. It has been called one of America&#x27;s most beautiful parkways.

San Diego&#x27;s roadway system provides an extensive network of cycle routes. Its dry and mild climate makes cycling a convenient year-round option; however, the city&#x27;s hilly terrain and long average trip distances make cycling less practicable. Older and denser neighborhoods around the downtown tend to be oriented to utility cycling. This is partly because the grid street patterns are now absent in newer developments farther from the urban core, where suburban-style arterial roads are much more common. As a result, the majority of cycling is recreational.

San Diego is served by the San Diego Trolley light rail system, by the MTS bus system, the bus rapid transit system Rapid, private jitneys in some neighborhoods, and by Coaster and &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; commuter rail; northern San Diego County is also served by the Sprinter hybrid rail service. The trolley primarily serves downtown and surrounding urban communities, Mission Valley, east county, and coastal south bay. A mid-coast extension of the trolley operates from Old Town to University City and the University of California, San Diego along Interstate 5 since November 2021. The Amtrak and Coaster trains currently run along the coastline and connect San Diego with Los Angeles, Orange County, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura via Metrolink and the Pacific Surfliner. There are two Amtrak stations in San Diego, in Old Town and Santa Fe Depot downtown. San Diego transit information about public transportation and commuting is available on the Web and by dialing &quot;511&quot; from any phone in the area.

The city has two major commercial airports within or near its city limits. San Diego International Airport (SAN) is the busiest single-runway airport in the United States. It served over 24 million passengers in 2018 and is dealing with larger numbers every year. Tijuana International Airport has a terminal within the city limits in the Otay Mesa district connected to the rest of the airport in Tijuana, Mexico, via the Cross Border Xpress cross-border footbridge. In addition, the city has two general-aviation airports, Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport (MYF) and Brown Field Municipal Airport (SDM).

Recent regional transportation projects have sought to mitigate congestion, including improvements to local freeways, expansion of San Diego Airport, and doubling the capacity of the cruise ship terminal. Freeway projects included expansion of Interstates 5 and 805 around &quot;The Merge&quot; where these two freeways meet, as well as expansion of Interstate 15 through North County, which includes new HOV &quot;managed lanes&quot;. A tollway (the southern portion of SR 125, known as the South Bay Expressway) connects SR 54 and Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border. According to an assessment in 2007, 37 percent of city streets were in acceptable condition. However, the proposed budget fell $84.6 million short of bringing streets up to an acceptable level. Expansion at the port has included a second cruise terminal on Broadway Pier, opened in 2010. Airport projects include the expansion of Terminal Two.

===Utilities===
Water is supplied to residents by the Water Department of the City of San Diego. The city receives most of its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which brings water to the region from the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, via the state project and the Colorado River, via the Colorado Aqueduct.

Gas and electric utilities are provided by San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a division of Sempra Energy. The company provides energy service to 3.7 million people through 1.5 million electric meters and 900,000 natural gas meters in San Diego and southern Orange counties.

====Street lights====

In the mid-20th century the city had mercury vapor street lamps. In 1978, the city decided to replace them with more efficient sodium vapor lamps. This triggered an outcry from astronomers at Palomar Observatory north of the city, concerned that the new lamps would increase light pollution and hinder astronomical observation. The city altered its lighting regulations to limit light pollution within of Palomar.

In 2011, the city announced plans to upgrade 80% of its street lighting to new energy-efficient lights that use induction technology, a modified form of fluorescent lamp producing a broader spectrum than sodium vapor lamps. The new system is predicted to save $2.2 million per year in energy and maintenance. In 2014, San Diego announced plans to become the first U.S. city to install cyber-controlled street lighting.

<text>Spacecraft propulsion is any method used to accelerate spacecraft and artificial satellites. In-space propulsion exclusively deals with propulsion systems used in the vacuum of space and should not be confused with space launch or atmospheric entry.

Several methods of pragmatic spacecraft propulsion have been developed, each having its own drawbacks and advantages. Most satellites have simple reliable chemical thrusters (often monopropellant rockets) or resistojet rockets for orbital station-keeping, while a few use momentum wheels for attitude control. Russian and antecedent Soviet bloc satellites have used electric propulsion for decades, and newer Western geo-orbiting spacecraft are starting to use them for north–south station-keeping and orbit raising. Interplanetary vehicles mostly use chemical rockets as well, although a few have used electric propulsion such as ion thrusters and Hall-effect thrusters. Various technologies need to support everything from small satellites and robotic deep space exploration to space stations and human missions to Mars.

Hypothetical in-space propulsion technologies describe propulsion technologies that could meet future space science and exploration needs. These propulsion technologies are intended to provide effective exploration of the Solar System and may permit mission designers to plan missions to &quot;fly anytime, anywhere, and complete a host of science objectives at the destinations&quot; and with greater reliability and safety. With a wide range of possible missions and candidate propulsion technologies, the question of which technologies are &quot;best&quot; for future missions is a difficult one; expert opinion now holds that a portfolio of propulsion technologies should be developed to provide optimum solutions for a diverse set of missions and destinations.

==Purpose and function==

Space exploration is about reaching the destination safely (mission enabling), quickly (reduced transit times), with a large quantity of payload mass, and relatively inexpensively (lower cost). The act of reaching the destination requires an in-space propulsion system, and the other metrics are modifiers to this fundamental action. Propulsion technologies can significantly improve a number of critical aspects of the mission.

When launching a spacecraft from Earth, a propulsion method must overcome a higher gravitational pull to provide a positive net acceleration. When in space, the purpose of a propulsion system is to change the velocity, or &quot;v&quot;, of a spacecraft.

In-space propulsion begins where the upper stage of the launch vehicle leaves off, performing the functions of primary propulsion, reaction control, station keeping, precision pointing, and orbital maneuvering. The main engines used in space provide the primary propulsive force for orbit transfer, planetary trajectories, and extra planetary landing and . The reaction control and orbital maneuvering systems provide the propulsive force for orbit maintenance, position control, station keeping, and spacecraft attitude control.

In orbit, any additional impulse, even tiny, will result in a change in the orbit path, in two ways:
* Prograde/retrograde (i.e. acceleration in the tangential/opposite in tangential direction), which increases/decreases altitude of orbit.
* Perpendicular to orbital plane, which changes orbital inclination.
Earth&#x27;s surface is situated fairly deep in a gravity well; the escape velocity required to leave its orbit is 11.2 kilometers/second. Thus for destinations beyond, propulsion systems need enough propellant and to be of high enough efficiency. The same is true for other planets and moons, albeit some have lower gravity wells.

As human beings evolved in a gravitational field of &quot;one &quot;g&quot;&quot; (9.81m/s²), it would be most comfortable for a human spaceflight propulsion system to provide that acceleration continuously, (though human bodies can tolerate much larger accelerations over short periods). The occupants of a rocket or spaceship having such a propulsion system would be free from the ill effects of free fall, such as nausea, muscular weakness, reduced sense of taste, or leaching of calcium from their bones.

==Theory==
The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation shows, using the law of conservation of momentum, that for a rocket engine propulsion method to change the momentum of a spacecraft, it must change the momentum of something else in the opposite direction. In other words, the rocket must exhaust mass opposite the spacecraft&#x27;s acceleration direction, with such exhausted mass called propellant or reaction mass. For this to happen, both reaction mass and energy are needed. The impulse provided by launching a particle of reaction mass with mass &quot;m&quot; at velocity &quot;v&quot; is &quot;mv&quot;. But this particle has kinetic energy &quot;mv&quot;²/2, which must come from somewhere. In a conventional solid, liquid, or hybrid rocket, fuel is burned, providing the energy, and the reaction products are allowed to flow out of the engine nozzle, providing the reaction mass. In an ion thruster, electricity is used to accelerate ions behind the spacecraft. Here other sources must provide the electrical energy (e.g. a solar panel or a nuclear reactor), whereas the ions provide the reaction mass.

The rate of change of velocity is called acceleration and the rate of change of momentum is called force. To reach a given velocity, one can apply a small acceleration over a long period of time, or a large acceleration over a short time; similarly, one can achieve a given impulse with a large force over a short time or a small force over a long time. This means that for maneuvering in space, a propulsion method that produces tiny accelerations for a long time can often produce the same impulse as another which produces large accelerations for a short time. However, when launching from a planet, tiny accelerations cannot overcome the planet&#x27;s gravitational pull and so cannot be used.

Some designs however, operate without internal reaction mass by taking advantage of magnetic fields or light pressure to change the spacecraft&#x27;s momentum.

=== Efficiency ===
When discussing the efficiency of a propulsion system, designers often focus on the effective use of the reaction mass, which must be carried along with the rocket and is irretrievably consumed when used. Spacecraft performance can be quantified in &quot;amount of change in momentum per unit of propellant consumed,&quot; also called specific impulse. This is a measure of the amount of impulse that can be obtained from a fixed amount of reaction mass. The higher the specific impulse, the better the efficiency. Ion propulsion engines have high specific impulse (~3000 s) and low thrust whereas chemical rockets like monopropellant or bipropellant rocket engines have a low specific impulse (~300 s) but high thrust.

The impulse per unit weight-on-Earth (typically designated by formula_1) has units of seconds. Because the weight on Earth of the reaction mass is often unimportant when discussing vehicles in space, specific impulse can also be discussed in terms of impulse per unit mass, with the same units as velocity (e.g., meters per second). This measure is equivalent to the effective exhaust velocity of the engine, and is typically designated formula_2. Either the change in momentum per unit of propellant used by a spacecraft, or the velocity of the propellant exiting the spacecraft, can be used to measure its &quot;specific impulse.&quot; The two values differ by a factor of the standard acceleration due to gravity, &quot;g&quot;n, 9.80665 m/s² (formula_3).

In contrast to chemical rockets, electrodynamic rockets use
electric or magnetic fields to accelerate a charged propellant. The benefit of this method is that it can achieve exhaust velocities, and therefore formula_1, more than 10 times greater than those of a chemical engine, producing steady thrust with far less fuel. With a conventional chemical propulsion system, 2% of a rocket&#x27;s total mass might make it to the destination, with the other 98% having been consumed as fuel. With an electric propulsion system, 70% of what&#x27;s aboard in low Earth orbit can make it to a deep-space destination.

However, there is a trade-off. Chemical rockets transform propellants into most of the energy needed to propel them, but their electromagnetic equivalents must carry or produce the power required to create and accelerate propellants. Because there are currently practical limits on the amount of power available on a spacecraft, these engines are not suitable for launch vehicles or when a spacecraft needs a quick, large
impulse, such as when it brakes to enter a capture orbit. Even so, because
electrodynamic rockets offer very high formula_1, mission planners are
increasingly willing to sacrifice power and thrust (and the extra time it will
take to get a spacecraft where it needs to go) in order to save large amounts
of propellant mass.

==Operating domains==
Spacecraft operate in many areas of space. These include orbital maneuvering, interplanetary travel, and interstellar travel.

===Orbital===

Artificial satellites are first launched into the desired altitude by conventional liquid/solid propelled rockets, after which the satellite may use onboard propulsion systems for orbital stationkeeping. Once in the desired orbit, they often need some form of attitude control so that they are correctly pointed with respect to the Earth, the Sun, and possibly some astronomical object of interest. They are also subject to drag from the thin atmosphere, so that to stay in orbit for a long period of time some form of propulsion is occasionally necessary to make small corrections (orbital station-keeping). Many satellites need to be moved from one orbit to another from time to time, and this also requires propulsion. A satellite&#x27;s useful life is usually over once it has exhausted its ability to adjust its orbit.

===Interplanetary===

For interplanetary travel, a spacecraft can use its engines to leave Earth&#x27;s orbit. It is not explicitly necessary as the initial boost given by the rocket, gravity slingshot, monopropellant/bipropellent attitude control propulsion system are enough for the exploration of the solar system (see New Horizons). Once it has done so, it must make its way to its destination. Current interplanetary spacecraft do this with a series of short-term trajectory adjustments. In between these adjustments, the spacecraft typically moves along its trajectory without accelerating. The most fuel-efficient means to move from one circular orbit to another is with a Hohmann transfer orbit: the spacecraft begins in a roughly circular orbit around the Sun. A short period of thrust in the direction of motion accelerates or decelerates the spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around the Sun which is tangential to its previous orbit and also to the orbit of its destination. The spacecraft falls freely along this elliptical orbit until it reaches its destination, where another short period of thrust accelerates or decelerates it to match the orbit of its destination. Special methods such as aerobraking or aerocapture are sometimes used for this final orbital adjustment.
Some spacecraft propulsion methods such as solar sails provide very low but inexhaustible thrust; an interplanetary vehicle using one of these methods would follow a rather different trajectory, either constantly thrusting against its direction of motion in order to decrease its distance from the Sun, or constantly thrusting along its direction of motion to increase its distance from the Sun. The concept has been successfully tested by the Japanese IKAROS solar sail spacecraft.

===Interstellar===

Because interstellar distances are great, a tremendous velocity is needed to get a spacecraft to its destination in a reasonable amount of time. Acquiring such a velocity on launch and getting rid of it on arrival remains a formidable challenge for spacecraft designers. No spacecraft capable of short duration (compared to human lifetime) interstellar travel has yet been built, but many hypothetical designs have been discussed. 

==Propulsion technology==
Spacecraft propulsion technology can be of several types, such as chemical, electric or nuclear. They are distinguished based on the physics of the propulsion system and how thrust is generated. Other experimental and more theoretical types are also included, depending on their technical maturity. Additionally, there may be credible meritorious in-space propulsion concepts not foreseen or reviewed at the time of publication, and which may be shown to be beneficial to future mission applications.

Almost all types are reaction engines, which produce thrust by expelling reaction mass, in accordance with Newton&#x27;s third law of motion. Examples include jet engines, rocket engines, pump-jet, and more uncommon variations such as Hall–effect thrusters, ion drives, mass drivers, and nuclear pulse propulsion.

===Chemical propulsion===


A large fraction of rocket engines in use today are chemical rockets; that is, they obtain the energy needed to generate thrust by chemical reactions to create a hot gas that is expanded to produce thrust. Many different propellant combinations are used to obtain these chemical reactions, including, for example, hydrazine, liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, nitrous oxide, and hydrogen peroxide. They can be used as a monopropellant or in bi-propellant configurations.

Rocket engines provide essentially the highest specific powers and high specific thrusts of any engine used for spacecraft propulsion. Most rocket engines are internal combustion heat engines (although non-combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high-temperature reaction mass, as a hot gas, which is achieved by combusting a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely hot gas is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio bell-shaped nozzle, a feature that gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy, where exhaust speeds reaching as high as 10 times the speed of sound at sea level are common.

====Green chemical propulsion====
The dominant form of chemical propulsion for satellites has historically been hydrazine, however, this fuel is highly toxic and at risk of being banned across Europe. Non-toxic &#x27;green&#x27; alternatives are now being developed to replace hydrazine. Nitrous oxide-based alternatives are garnering traction and government support, with development being led by commercial companies Dawn Aerospace, Impulse Space, and Launcher. The first nitrous oxide-based system flown in space was by D-Orbit onboard their ION Satellite Carrier (space tug) in 2021, using six Dawn Aerospace B20 thrusters, launched upon a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

===Electric propulsion===


Rather than relying on high temperature and fluid dynamics to accelerate the reaction mass to high speeds, there are a variety of methods that use electrostatic or electromagnetic forces to accelerate the reaction mass directly, where the reaction mass is usually a stream of ions.

Ion propulsion rockets typically heat a plasma or charged gas inside a magnetic bottle and release it via a magnetic nozzle so that no solid matter needs to come in contact with the plasma. Such an engine uses electric power, first to ionize atoms, and then to create a voltage gradient to accelerate the ions to high exhaust velocities. For these drives, at the highest exhaust speeds, energetic efficiency and thrust are all inversely proportional to exhaust velocity. Their very high exhaust velocity means they require huge amounts of energy and thus with practical power sources provide low thrust, but use hardly any fuel.

Electric propulsion is commonly used for station keeping on commercial communications satellites and for prime propulsion on some scientific space missions because of their high specific impulse. However, they generally have very small values of thrust and therefore must be operated for long durations to provide the total impulse required by a mission.

The idea of electric propulsion dates to 1906, when Robert Goddard considered the possibility in his personal notebook. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky published the idea in 1911.

Electric propulsion methods include:
* Ion thrusters, which accelerate ions first and later neutralize the ion beam with an electron stream emitted from a cathode called a neutralizer;
**Electrostatic ion thrusters
**Field-emission electric propulsion
**MagBeam thrusters
**Hall-effect thrusters
**Colloid thrusters
* Electrothermal thrusters, wherein electromagnetic fields are used to generate a plasma to increase the heat of the bulk propellant, the thermal energy imparted to the propellant gas is then converted into kinetic energy by a nozzle of either physical material construction or by magnetic means;
**Arcjets using DC current or microwaves
**Helicon double-layer thrusters
**Resistojets
* Electromagnetic thrusters, wherein ions are accelerated either by the Lorentz Force or by the effect of electromagnetic fields where the electric field is not in the direction of the acceleration;
**Plasma propulsion engines
**Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters
**Electrodeless plasma thrusters
**Pulsed inductive thrusters
**Pulsed plasma thrusters
**Variable specific impulse magnetoplasma rockets (VASIMR)
**Vacuum arc thrusters
*Mass drivers designed for propulsion.

====Power sources====
For some missions, particularly reasonably close to the Sun, solar energy may be sufficient, and has often been used, but for others further out or at higher power, nuclear energy is necessary; engines drawing their power from a nuclear source are called nuclear electric rockets.

Current nuclear power generators are approximately half the weight of solar panels per watt of energy supplied, at terrestrial distances from the Sun. Chemical power generators are not used due to the far lower total available energy. Beamed power to the spacecraft is considered to have potential, according to NASA and the University of Colorado Boulder.

With any current source of electrical power, chemical, nuclear or solar, the maximum amount of power that can be generated limits the amount of thrust that can be produced to a small value. Power generation adds significant mass to the spacecraft, and ultimately the weight of the power source limits the performance of the vehicle.

===Nuclear propulsion===
Nuclear fuels typically have very high specific energy, much higher than chemical fuels, which means that they can generate large amounts of energy per unit mass. This makes them valuable in spaceflight, as it can enable high specific impulses, sometimes even at high thrusts. The machinery to do this is complex, but research has developed methods for their use in propulsion systems, and some have been tested in a laboratory.

Here, nuclear propulsion moreso refers to the source of propulsion being nuclear, instead of a nuclear electric rocket where a nuclear reactor would provide power (instead of solar panels) for other types of electrical propulsion.

Nuclear propulsion methods include:
*Fission-fragment rockets
*Fission sails
*Fusion rockets
*Nuclear thermal rockets (NTR)
*Nuclear pulse propulsion
*Nuclear salt-water rockets
*Radioisotope rockets

=== Without internal reaction mass ===
There are several different space drives that need little or no reaction mass to function.

==== Reaction wheels ====
Many spacecraft use reaction wheels or control moment gyroscopes to control orientation in space. A satellite or other space vehicle is subject to the law of conservation of angular momentum, which constrains a body from a net change in angular velocity. Thus, for a vehicle to change its relative orientation without expending reaction mass, another part of the vehicle may rotate in the opposite direction. Non-conservative external forces, primarily gravitational and atmospheric, can contribute up to several degrees per day to angular momentum, so such systems are designed to &quot;bleed off&quot; undesired rotational energies built up over time. 

====EM wave-based propulsion====

The law of conservation of momentum is usually taken to imply that any engine which uses no reaction mass cannot accelerate the center of mass of a spaceship (changing orientation, on the other hand, is possible). But space is not empty, especially space inside the Solar System; there are gravitation fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic waves, solar wind and solar radiation. Electromagnetic waves in particular are known to contain momentum, despite being massless; specifically the momentum flux density P of an EM wave is quantitatively 1/c2 times the Poynting vector S, i.e. P = S/c2, where c is the velocity of light. Field propulsion methods which do not rely on reaction mass thus must try to take advantage of this fact by coupling to a momentum-bearing field such as an EM wave that exists in the vicinity of the craft; however, because many of these phenomena are diffuse in nature, corresponding propulsion structures must be proportionately large.

====Solar and magnetic sails====

The concept of solar sails rely on radiation pressure from electromagnetic energy, but they require a large collection surface to function effectively. E-sails propose to use very thin and lightweight wires holding an electric charge to deflect particles, which may have more controllable directionality.

Magnetic sails deflect charged particles from the solar wind with a magnetic field, thereby imparting momentum to the spacecraft. For instance, the so-called Magsail is a large superconducting loop proposed for acceleration/deceleration in the solar wind and deceleration in the Interstellar medium. A variant is the mini-magnetospheric plasma propulsion system and its successor, the magnetoplasma sail, which inject plasma at a low rate to enhance the magnetic field to more effectively deflect charged particles in a plasma wind.

Japan launched a solar sail-powered spacecraft, IKAROS in May 2010, which successfully demonstrated propulsion and guidance (and is still active as of this date). As further proof of the solar sail concept, NanoSail-D became the first such powered satellite to orbit Earth. As of August 2017, NASA confirmed the Sunjammer solar sail project was concluded in 2014 with lessons learned for future space sail projects. The U.K. Cubesail programme will be the first mission to demonstrate solar sailing in low Earth orbit, and the first mission to demonstrate full three-axis attitude control of a solar sail.

====Other propulsion types====

The concept of a gravitational slingshot is a form of propulsion to carry a space probe onward to other destinations without the expense of reaction mass; harnessing the gravitational energy of other celestial objects allows the spacecraft to gain kinetic energy. However, more energy can be obtained from the gravity assist if rockets are used via the Oberth effect.

A tether propulsion system employs a long cable with a high tensile strength to change a spacecraft&#x27;s orbit, such as by interaction with a planet&#x27;s magnetic field or through momentum exchange with another object.

Beam-powered propulsion is another method of propulsion without reaction mass, and includes sails pushed by laser, microwave, or particle beams.

===Advanced propulsion technology===
Advanced, and in some cases theoretical, propulsion technologies may use chemical or nonchemical physics to produce thrust but are generally considered to be of lower technical maturity with challenges that have not been overcome. For both human and robotic exploration, traversing the solar system is a struggle against time and distance. The most distant planets are 4.5–6 billion kilometers from the Sun and to reach them in any reasonable time requires much more capable propulsion systems than conventional chemical rockets. Rapid inner solar system missions with flexible launch dates are difficult, requiring propulsion systems that are beyond today&#x27;s current state of the art. The logistics, and therefore the total system mass required to support sustained human exploration beyond Earth to destinations such as the Moon, Mars, or near-Earth objects, are daunting unless more efficient in-space propulsion technologies are developed and fielded.

A variety of hypothetical propulsion techniques have been considered that require a deeper understanding of the properties of space, particularly inertial frames and the vacuum state. Such methods are highly speculative and include:
*Black hole starship
*Differential sail
*Gravitational shielding
*Field propulsion
**Diametric drive
**Disjunction drive
**Pitch drive
**Bias drive
*Photon rocket
*Quantum vacuum thruster
*Nano electrokinetic thruster
*Reactionless drive
**Abraham—Minkowski drive
**Alcubierre drive
**Dean drive
**EmDrive
**Heim theory
**Woodward effect

A NASA assessment of its Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program divides such proposals into those that are non-viable for propulsion purposes, those that are of uncertain potential, and those that are not impossible according to current theories.

===Table of methods===

Below is a summary of some of the more popular, proven technologies, followed by increasingly speculative methods. Four numbers are shown. The first is the effective exhaust velocity: the equivalent speed which the propellant leaves the vehicle. This is not necessarily the most important characteristic of the propulsion method; thrust and power consumption and other factors can be. However,
* if the delta-v is much more than the exhaust velocity, then exorbitant amounts of fuel are necessary (see the section on calculations, above), and
* if it is much more than the delta-v, then, proportionally more energy is needed; if the power is limited, as with solar energy, this means that the journey takes a proportionally longer time.
The second and third are the typical amounts of thrust and the typical burn times of the method; outside a gravitational potential, small amounts of thrust applied over a long period will give the same effect as large amounts of thrust over a short period, if the object is not significantly influenced by gravity. The fourth is the maximum delta-v the technique can give without staging. For rocket-like propulsion systems, this is a function of mass fraction and exhaust velocity; mass fraction for rocket-like systems is usually limited by propulsion system weight and tankage weight. For a system to achieve this limit, the payload may need to be a negligible percentage of the vehicle, and so the practical limit on some systems can be much lower.
Table Notes

==Planetary and atmospheric propulsion==
===Launch-assist mechanisms===
There have been many ideas proposed for launch-assist mechanisms that have the potential of substantially reducing the cost of getting to orbit. Proposed non-rocket spacelaunch launch-assist mechanisms include:

*Skyhook (requires reusable suborbital launch vehicle, not feasible using presently available materials)
*Space elevator (tether from Earth&#x27;s surface to geostationary orbit, cannot be built with existing materials)
*Launch loop (a very fast enclosed rotating loop about 80 km tall)
*Space fountain (a very tall building held up by a stream of masses fired from its base)
*Orbital ring (a ring around Earth with spokes hanging down off bearings)
*Electromagnetic catapult (railgun, coilgun) (an electric gun)
*Rocket sled launch
*Space gun (Project HARP, ram accelerator) (a chemically powered gun)
*Beam-powered propulsion rockets and jets powered from the ground via a beam
*High-altitude platforms to assist initial stage

===Air-breathing engines===

Studies generally show that conventional air-breathing engines, such as ramjets or turbojets are basically too heavy (have too low a thrust/weight ratio) to give significant performance improvement when installed on a launch vehicle. However, launch vehicles can be air launched from separate lift vehicles (e.g. B-29, Pegasus Rocket and White Knight) which do use such propulsion systems. Jet engines mounted on a launch rail could also be so used.

On the other hand, very lightweight or very high-speed engines have been proposed that take advantage of the air during ascent:
* SABRE – a lightweight hydrogen fuelled turbojet with precooler
* ATREX – a lightweight hydrogen fuelled turbojet with precooler
* Liquid air cycle engine – a hydrogen-fuelled jet engine that liquifies the air before burning it in a rocket engine
* Scramjet – jet engines that use supersonic combustion
* Shcramjet – similar to a scramjet engine, however it takes advantage of shockwaves produced from the aircraft in the combustion chamber to assist in increasing overall efficiency.

Normal rocket launch vehicles fly almost vertically before rolling over at an altitude of some tens of kilometers before burning sideways for orbit; this initial vertical climb wastes propellant but is optimal as it greatly reduces airdrag. Airbreathing engines burn propellant much more efficiently and this would permit a far flatter launch trajectory. The vehicles would typically fly approximately tangentially to Earth&#x27;s surface until leaving the atmosphere then perform a rocket burn to bridge the final delta-v to orbital velocity.

For spacecraft already in very low-orbit, air-breathing electric propulsion could use residual gases in the upper atmosphere as a propellant. Air-breathing electric propulsion could make a new class of long-lived, low-orbiting missions feasible on Earth, Mars or Venus.

===Planetary arrival and landing===

When a vehicle is to enter orbit around its destination planet, or when it is to land, it must adjust its velocity. This can be done using any of the methods listed above (provided they can generate a high enough thrust), but there are methods that can take advantage of planetary atmospheres and/or surfaces.

* Aerobraking allows a spacecraft to reduce the high point of an elliptical orbit by repeated brushes with the atmosphere at the low point of the orbit. This can save a considerable amount of fuel because it takes much less delta-V to enter an elliptical orbit compared to a low circular orbit. Because the braking is done over the course of many orbits, heating is comparatively minor, and a heat shield is not required. This has been done on several Mars missions such as &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;, &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot;, and &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot;, and at least one Venus mission, &quot;Magellan&quot;.
* Aerocapture is a much more aggressive manoeuver, converting an incoming hyperbolic orbit to an elliptical orbit in one pass. This requires a heat shield and more controlled navigation because it must be completed in one pass through the atmosphere, and unlike aerobraking no preview of the atmosphere is possible. If the intent is to remain in orbit, then at least one more propulsive maneuver is required after aerocapture—otherwise the low point of the resulting orbit will remain in the atmosphere, resulting in eventual re-entry. Aerocapture has not yet been tried on a planetary mission, but the re-entry skip by Zond 6 and Zond 7 upon lunar return were aerocapture maneuvers, because they turned a hyperbolic orbit into an elliptical orbit. On these missions, because there was no attempt to raise the perigee after the aerocapture, the resulting orbit still intersected the atmosphere, and re-entry occurred at the next perigee.
* A ballute is an inflatable drag device.
* Parachutes can land a probe on a planet or moon with an atmosphere, usually after the atmosphere has scrubbed off most of the velocity, using a heat shield.
* Airbags can soften the final landing.
* Lithobraking, or stopping by impacting the surface, is usually done by accident. However, it may be done deliberately with the probe expected to survive (see, for example, the Deep Impact spacecraft), in which case very sturdy probes are required.

==Research==

Development of technologies will result in technical solutions that improve thrust levels, specific impulse, power, specific mass, (or specific power), volume, system mass, system complexity, operational complexity, commonality with other spacecraft systems, manufacturability, durability, and cost. These types of improvements will yield decreased transit times, increased payload mass, safer spacecraft, and decreased costs. In some instances, the development of technologies within this technology area will result in mission-enabling breakthroughs that will revolutionize space exploration. There is no single propulsion technology that will benefit all missions or mission types; the requirements for in-space propulsion vary widely according to their intended application.

One institution focused on developing primary propulsion technologies aimed at benefitting near and mid-term science missions by reducing cost, mass, and/or travel times is the Glenn Research Center (GRC). Electric propulsion architectures are of particular interest to the GRC, including ion and Hall thrusters. One system combines solar sails, a form of propellantless propulsion which relies on naturally-occurring starlight for propulsion energy, and Hall thrusters. Other propulsion technologies being developed include advanced chemical propulsion and aerocapture.

===Defining technologies===
The term &quot;mission pull&quot; defines a technology or a performance characteristic necessary to meet a planned NASA mission requirement. Any other relationship between a technology and a mission (an alternate propulsion system, for example) is categorized as &quot;technology push.&quot; Also, a space demonstration refers to the spaceflight of a scaled version of a particular technology or of a critical technology subsystem. On the other hand, a space validation would serve as a qualification flight for future mission implementation. A successful validation flight would not require any additional space testing of a particular technology before it can be adopted for a science or exploration mission.

===Testing===
Spacecraft propulsion systems are often first statically tested on Earth&#x27;s surface, within the atmosphere but many systems require a vacuum chamber to test fully. Rockets are usually tested at a rocket engine test facility well away from habitation and other buildings for safety reasons. Ion drives are far less dangerous and require much less stringent safety, usually only a moderately large vacuum chamber is needed. Static firing of engines are done at ground test facilities, and systems which cannot be adequately tested on the ground and require launches may be employed at a launch site.

==In fiction==
In science fiction, space ships use various means to travel, some of them scientifically plausible (like solar sails or ramjets), others, mostly or entirely fictitious (like anti-gravity, warp drive, spindizzy or hyperspace travel).

<text>In mathematical logic, a second-order predicate is a predicate that takes a first-order predicate as an argument. Compare higher-order predicate.

The idea of second order predication was introduced by the German mathematician and philosopher Frege. It is based on his idea that a predicate such as &quot;is a philosopher&quot; designates a concept, rather than an object. Sometimes a concept can itself be the subject of a proposition, such as in &quot;There are no Bosnian philosophers&quot;. In this case, we are not saying anything of any Bosnian philosophers, but of the concept &quot;is a Bosnian philosopher&quot; that it is not satisfied. Thus the predicate &quot;is not satisfied&quot; attributes something to the concept &quot;is a Bosnian philosopher&quot;, and is thus a second-level predicate.

This idea is the basis of Frege&#x27;s theory of number.

<doc id="28512" wikidata="Q3655894" url="?curid=28512" title="Beer in Sweden">
<text>Beer in Sweden has a history that can be traced to the late Iron Age.

==History==
Ale-brewing history in Sweden predates written records. Through old writings, such as Hávamál, the Norse culture produced ale and mead. Mead was preferred, and ale was the most common. The Scandinavians also had access to wine and beer. Modern reproductions of Norse brews have been known to produce ale as strong as 9 percent ABV. Up until the 19th century, brewing was mostly a matter of production for household needs. The beer was usually weak in alcoholic content. For celebrations and feasts, stronger &quot;feast-beer&quot; and potent mead were brewed. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, the Swedish brewing industry arose.

In the mid-19th century, a multitude of small breweries grew into existence in the larger cities of Sweden. In the beginning of the 20th century, a trend of consolidation with mergers and buyouts began, which culminated in the late 1970s and the beginning of 1980. This led to the formation of three large brewery conglomerates; Pripps, Spendrups and Falcon, which pushed the smaller breweries. This led to a stereotype of the Swedish beers available as easily drinkable lagers, lacking in taste and character.

In the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, a new generation of small breweries spearheaded by the likes of Stockholm&#x27;s Nils Oscar Brewery began to grow alongside the large companies. These companies offer customers many choices, and many of the beers are produced in Sweden with cultivated brewing yeasts (often imported from Germany, Belgium or Britain).

==Classification==

Swedish law defines two alcohol thresholds that govern where and to whom a given type of beer may be sold. &quot;Lättöl&quot;, i.e., beer below the lower threshold (2.25% ABV), is considered a &quot;lättdryck&quot; (light beverage) and may be sold anywhere with no age restriction. For &quot;starköl&quot;, beer above the upper threshold (3.5% ABV) may only be sold in Systembolaget stores to people aged 20 or above and in pubs to people aged 18 or above. &quot;Folköl&quot; (people&#x27;s beer), beer between the two thresholds, may be sold in grocery stores, but only to people aged 18 or older.

Since the 3.5% threshold is close to the alcohol content of an international lager beer, many international brands such as Heineken, Carlsberg and Pilsner Urquell are sold in two versions in Sweden – the internationally renowned product as a &quot;starköl&quot; at Systembolaget and a slightly watered-down version as a &quot;folköl&quot; in the grocery stores.

The modern trend is toward consumers increasingly choosing stronger beer than the 3.5% ABV brands, which are generally sold at grocery stores. Any stronger beer is sold exclusively at the government-owned retail monopoly, Systembolaget.

<doc id="28521" wikidata="Q207854" url="?curid=28521" title="Shining Path">
<text>The Shining Path (, SL), self-named the Communist Party of Peru (, abbr. PCP), is a far-left political party and guerrilla group in Peru, following Marxism–Leninism–Maoism and Gonzalo Thought. Academics often refer to the group as the Communist Party of Peru – Shining Path (, abbr. PCP-SL) to distinguish it from other communist parties in Peru.

When it first launched its &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; in 1980, the Shining Path&#x27;s goal was to overthrow the government through guerrilla warfare and replace it with a New Democracy. The Shining Path believed that by establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat, inducing a cultural revolution, and eventually sparking a world revolution, they could arrive at full communism. Their representatives stated that the then-existing socialist countries were revisionist, and the Shining Path was the vanguard of the world communist movement. The Shining Path&#x27;s ideology and tactics have influenced other Maoist insurgent groups such as the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) and other Revolutionary Internationalist Movement-affiliated organizations.

The Shining Path has been widely condemned for its excessive brutality, including violence deployed against peasants, trade union organizers, competing Marxist groups, elected officials and the general public. The Shining Path is regarded as a terrorist organization by the government of Peru, along with Japan, the United States, the European Union, and Canada, all of whom consequently prohibit funding and other financial support to the group.

Since the captures of Shining Path founder Abimael Guzmán in 1992 and his successors Óscar Ramírez (&quot;Comrade Feliciano&quot;) in 1999 and Eleuterio Flores (&quot;Comrade Artemio&quot;) in 2012, the Shining Path declined in activity. The main remaining faction of the Shining Path, the [[Militarized Communist Party of Peru]] (MPCP), is active in the VRAEM region of Peru, and it has since distanced itself from the Shining Path&#x27;s legacy in 2018 in order to maintain the support of peasants previously persecuted by the Shining Path.

In addition to the MPCP, the Communist Party of Peru – Red Mantaro Base Committee (PCP-CBMR) operates in the Mantaro Valley since 2001, while the Communist Party of Peru – Huallaga Regional Committee (PCP-CRH). was active at the Huallaga region from 2004 until Comrade Artemio&#x27;s capture in 2012.

== Name ==

The group&#x27;s official name is the &quot;Communist Party of Peru&quot; (PCP), a name seen in all of its self-produced documents, periodicals, and other materials. The acronym &quot;PCP-SL&quot; is unofficially used by organisms, such as the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, to distinguish the group from other groups who claim the original name and acronym.

The group&#x27;s common name, &quot;Shining Path&quot;, distinguishes it from several other Peruvian communist parties with similar names. The name is derived from a maxim of José Carlos Mariátegui, the founder of the original Peruvian Communist Party (from which the rest of communist parties split; now commonly known as the &quot;PCP-Unidad&quot;) in the 1920s: &quot;&quot; (&quot;Marxism–Leninism will open the shining path to revolution&quot;). This maxim was featured on the masthead of the newspaper of a Shining Path front group. The followers of this group are generally called &quot;senderistas&quot;.

== Structure ==
=== Organisation ===
The Shining Path&#x27;s remnants currently operate in the VRAEM region and primarily comprises two groups and their sub-branches; a paramilitary wing and a political wing. It was originally organised using a &quot;concentric construction&quot; model of structure with Communist Party organs as the complete center, followed by the paramilitary wing surrounding it, and lastly the political wing in the outermost circle. This ensured the political party retained control of both its armed and social branches, contrasting itself with the more frequent &quot;foquismo&quot; model that swept through Latin American insurgencies after the Cuban Revolution.

The capture of Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán in 1992 led to the eventual splintering of the group into several factions, referred to by the Peruvian government as Shining Path remnants (). Of these, the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP) is considered the group&#x27;s main successor, founded in 1999 by brothers Víctor and Jorge Quispe Palomino after the collapse of &quot;Sendero Rojo&quot;, the faction that had rejected Guzmán&#x27;s peace treaty. Also active is a faction in the Mantaro Valley since 2001. The group&#x27;s remnants reportedly obtain their revenue from cocaine trafficking, and of these, the MPCP has attempted to recharacterise and distance itself from the original group that had attacked rural communities in the area, describing Guzmán as a &quot;traitor&quot;.

==== Paramilitary wing ====

The People&#x27;s Guerrilla Army (, EGP) was officially created on 3 December 1982 for the purposes of combat, mobilisation and producing an income for the group. After 1992, it continued to operate under &quot;Sendero Rojo&quot;, the group&#x27;s armed successor until 1999, and later under the Huallaga faction that existed from 2004 to 2012. Since 2001, it has been operated by the Mantaro faction under the name of People&#x27;s Liberation Army (, EPL). In 2020, it was reported to have made money from selling cigarettes, clothes, candy, raffles and other methods.

The EGP&#x27;s structure is as follows:
* Main Force (; FP): Mainly armed with larger weapons, such as the AKM and FN FAL rifles as well as the Heckler &amp; Koch HK21 machine gun. Due to proficiency in armaments, this group is tasked with ambushing police and soldiers. They do not remain in locations, usually traveling across regions.
* Local Force (; FL): These members are local agricultural workers who are provided minor weapons and periodically assist FP members, then later return to their work. Skilled FL members are moved into the FP&#x27;s ranks.
* Base Force (; FB): Some of the peasants of territories captured by the Shining Path are grouped into the FB, typically serving as reservists armed with handheld weapons such as knives, spears and machetes. FB members occasionally serve in surveillance tasks.

Under the leadership of Víctor Quispe Palomino, it was reorganised as the Popular Revolutionary Army (; ERP) until the MPCP&#x27;s formal establishment and distancing from Guzmán&#x27;s original Shining Path in June 2018, after which it has claimed the name of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Peru ().

==== Political wing ====
The United Front () serves as the political and bureaucratic arm of the Shining Path. It has two main branches: the MOVADEF and FUDEPP. Within the United Front, the Shining Path also instrumented multiple smaller &quot;mass organizations&quot;, usually specified to a particular purpose or issue. Examples of these include:

===== MOVADEF =====
The Movement for Amnesty and Fundamental Rights (; MOVADEF) was created on 20 November 2009 when Alfredo Crespo, the defense lawyer of Abimael Guzmán, and fifteen others gathered. MOVADEF has three sub-branches; the Central Historical Committee, the Provisional Central Committee and the National Executive Committee (CEN). The branch filed to become a political party in Peru with the National Jury of Elections (JNE) in 2011, though the application was denied. The Peruvian government had accused MOVADEF of advocating terrorism, eventually ordering the dissolution of the group in 2024.

===== FUDEPP =====
the Front for Unity and Defense of the Peruvian People (; FUDEPP) was created in 2015. In association with MOVADEF, the group announced that it had 73 provincial committees and allegedly received 400,000 to 500,000 signatures for the JNE to participate in the 2016 Peruvian general election. They were ultimately prevented from participating in the elections.

=== Ideology ===
As its power grew, the Shining Path changed its official ideology from &quot;Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong thought&quot; to &quot;Marxism–Leninism–Maoism–Gonzalo thought&quot; – according to some authors, a cult of personality grew around Guzmán.

Ideologically Maoist, the Shining Path is unique because it did not completely accept orthodox Marxist doctrine, instead, it considered the teachings of Guzmán to supersede the teachings of Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao. Guzmán&#x27;s philosophy combined Marxism-Leninism, Maoism and indigenous Indian traditionalism, championing the liberation of Peru&#x27;s Quechua-speaking Incans and mestizos. The party&#x27;s name was also coined by Guzmán, who infused his communist rhetoric with Inca mythology, he described his form of Marxist-Maoist thought as a &quot;shining path&quot; towards the liberation of Peru&#x27;s natives. Because of this, the Shining Path also featured elements of Incan particularism, and it also rejected outside influences, especially non-indigenous influences.

The Shining Path declared that it was a feminist organization and in accordance with this declaration, many women acquired leadership positions. In the organisation, 40% of the fighters and 50% of the members of its Central Committee were women.

==== People&#x27;s Republic ====
The Shining Path sought to replace the Republic of Peru with a &quot;People&#x27;s Republic which would adhere to the doctrine of New Democracy&quot; (, RPND), also known by its proposed name of &quot;People&#x27;s Republic of Peru&quot; (). The RPND was first named at the third session of the first central committee, held in 1983, with its establishment meaning that the armed branch of the group would become a &quot;People&#x27;s Liberation Army,&quot; as per the group&#x27;s so-called grand plan. Additionally, the term &quot;People&#x27;s Republic&quot; was also suggested as a possible name for the upcoming state.

=== Use of violence ===
Although the reliability of reports regarding the Shining Path&#x27;s actions remains a matter of controversy in Peru, the organization&#x27;s use of violence is well documented. According to InSight Crime, Shining Path would kill their opponents &quot;with assassinations, bombings, beheadings and massacres&quot; as well as &quot;stoning victims to death.

The Shining Path rejected the concept of human rights; a Shining Path document stated:
After the collapse of the Fujimori government, interim President Valentín Paniagua established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the conflict. The Commission found in its 2003 &quot;Final Report&quot; that 69,280 people died or disappeared between 1980 and 2000 as a result of the armed conflict. The Shining Path was found to be responsible for about 54% of the deaths and disappearances reported to the commission. A statistical analysis of the available data led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to estimate that the Shining Path was responsible for the death or disappearance of 31,331 people, 46% of the total deaths and disappearances. According to a summary of the report by Human Rights Watch, &quot;Shining Path... killed about half the victims, and roughly one-third died at the hands of government security forces... The commission attributed some of the other slayings to a smaller guerrilla group and local militias. The rest remain unattributed.&quot; The MRTA was held responsible for 1.5% of the deaths. A 2019 study disputed the casualty figures from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, estimating instead &quot;a total of 48,000 killings, substantially lower than the TRC estimate&quot;, and concluding that &quot;the Peruvian State accounts for a significantly larger share than the Shining Path.&quot; The TRC later came out to respond to these statements.

==== Allegations of violence against LGBT people ====
The Shining Path has been accused of violence against LGBT people. Between 1989 and 1992, the Shining Path and the MRTA killed up to 500 &quot;non-heterosexual&quot; people. According to one woman who was kidnapped by the Shining Path in 1981, a homosexual man&#x27;s penis was cut into pieces before he was murdered. The Peruvian government did not reveal the name of the victim. The Shining Path defended its actions by saying that LGBT individuals were not killed because of their sexual identity, instead, they were killed because of their &quot;collaboration with the police.&quot;

The Shining Path has denied such allegations, stating, &quot;It is probable that the PCP has executed a homosexual, but rest assured that it was not done because of their sexual orientation but because of their position against the revolution... Our view is that homosexual orientation is not an ideological matter but one of individual preference... Party membership is open to all those who support the cause of communist revolution and the principles of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, Gonzalo Thought, regardless of what their sexual preferences may be.&quot;

==== Women in the Shining Path ====
The number of women involved in the armed struggle remained high throughout the war, participating at almost all logistical, military and strategic levels as militants, guerrilla commanders and top party leaders of the organisation. The high proportion of women was a given and desired from the outset; the success of the internal Peruvian revolution was explicitly made dependent on the participation of women. Up to forty per cent of the guerrillas were women, and there were countless &quot;ladies of death&quot; who led military commandos. In 1992, at least eight of the nineteen members of the Central Committee were women, including three of the five members of the Politburo, and in 1980 more than a third of the women arrested had a degree. In criminal proceedings against senderista in 1987, the majority were women. The Shining Path was the first guerrilla organisation to incorporate women on a completely equal military footing with its male members, actively recruiting women on a large scale and appointing them to leading positions.

The Movimiento Femenino Popular (MFP) group was officially formed in 1974 from the merger of two groups, the Centro Femenino Popular and the Frente Femenino Universitario. The &quot;MFP Manifiesto&quot; traces the origins of the group back to the mid-1960s, when female students and academics began to organise their own groups and factions in other student organisations and to reflect on revolution and &quot;the thesis of the great Lenin on the participation of women and the success of a revolution&quot; from 1968 onwards. During these years, more and more women were studying and trying to enter the labour market. The percentage of women at university in Ayacucho was particularly high: in 1968, 30% of students were women, mainly in the departments of obstetrics and social and educational services. The unequal access to work and education exacerbated the differences between classes and between rural and urban populations, especially within the female population. Women became increasingly involved and organised in various movements as an expression of their protest and frustration.So much so, that by the year 1990, women held eight of the nineteen Central Committee positions. This was more involvement from women than any of the other leftist movements in Peru. Women in Peru even acknowledge the Shining Path movement as a step-away from the male-dominated societies that are renowned in many parts of Latin America. This was far different than what has been seen before the Peruvian Truth was revealed. Many women were joining the armed forces to obtain basic rights and securities. Despite many arrests and incarcerations of women, this time period revolutionized women&#x27;s rights in Peru.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===

The Shining Path was founded in 1969 by Abimael Guzmán, a former university philosophy professor (his followers referred to him by his nom de guerre Presidente Gonzalo), and a group of 11 others. Guzmán was heavily influenced by a trip to China and admired the teachings of Mao Zedong. His teachings created the foundation of its militant Maoist doctrine. It was an offshoot of the Peruvian Communist Party – Red Flag, which itself split from the original Peruvian Communist Party founded by José Carlos Mariátegui in 1928.

Antonio Díaz Martínez, an agronomist who became a leader of the Shining Path, made several important contributions to the group&#x27;s ideology. In his books &quot;Ayacucho, Hambre y Esperanza&quot; (1969) and &quot;China, La Revolución Agraria&quot; (1978), he expressed his own conviction of the necessity that revolutionary activity in Peru follow strictly the teachings of Mao Zedong.

The Shining Path first established a foothold at San Cristóbal of Huamanga University, in Ayacucho, where Guzmán taught philosophy. The university had recently reopened after being closed for about half a century. Between 1973 and 1975, Shining Path members gained control of the student councils at the Universities of Huancayo and La Cantuta, and they also developed a significant presence at the National University of Engineering in Lima and the National University of San Marcos. Sometime later, it lost many student elections in the universities, including Guzmán&#x27;s San Cristóbal of Huamanga.

Guzmán believed that communism required a &quot;popular war&quot; and distanced himself from organizing workers. Shining Path opposed large national strikes in 1977 and 1978 because it viewed some of the participants as revisionists or tools of &quot;socio-imperialism&quot;.

Beginning on 17 March 1980, the Shining Path held a series of clandestine meetings in Ayacucho, known as the Central Committee&#x27;s second plenary. It formed a &quot;Revolutionary Directorate&quot; that was political and military in nature and ordered its militias to transfer to strategic areas in the provinces to start the &quot;armed struggle&quot;. The group also held its &quot;First Military School&quot;, where members were instructed in military tactics and the use of weapons. They also engaged in &quot;Criticism and Self-criticism&quot;, a Maoist practice intended to purge bad habits and avoid the repetition of mistakes. During the existence of the First Military School, members of the Central Committee came under heavy criticism. Guzmán did not, and he emerged from the First Military School as the clear leader of the Shining Path.

A timeline of the Peruvian Communist Party (PCP)&#x27;s splinter groups is as follows:
=== Armed conflict (1980–1993) ===
By 1980, Shining Path had about 500 members. When Peru&#x27;s military government allowed elections for the first time in twelve years in 1980, the Shining Path was one of the few leftist political groups that declined to take part. It chose instead to begin a guerrilla war in the highlands of the Ayacucho Region. On 17 May 1980, on the eve of the presidential elections, it burned ballot boxes in the town of Chuschi. It was the first &quot;act of war&quot; by the Shining Path. The perpetrators were quickly caught, and additional ballots were shipped to Chuschi. The elections proceeded without further problems, and the incident received little attention in the Peruvian press.

Throughout the 1980s, the Shining Path grew both in terms of the territory it controlled and in the number of militants in its organization, particularly in the Andean highlands. It gained support from local peasants by filling the political void left by the central government and providing what they called &quot;popular justice&quot;, public trials that disregard any legal and human rights that deliver swift and brutal sentences including public executions. This caused the peasantry of some Peruvian villages to express some sympathy for the Shining Path, especially in the impoverished and neglected regions of Ayacucho, Apurímac, and Huancavelica. At times, the civilian population of small, neglected towns participated in popular trials, especially when the victims of the trials were widely disliked.

The Shining Path&#x27;s credibility benefited from the government&#x27;s initially tepid response to the insurgency. For over a year, the government refused to declare a state of emergency in the region where the Shining Path was operating. The Interior Minister, José María de la Jara, believed the group could be easily defeated through police actions. Additionally, the president, Fernando Belaúnde Terry, who returned to power in 1980, was reluctant to cede authority to the armed forces since his first government had ended in a military coup.

On 29 December 1981, the government declared an &quot;emergency zone&quot; in the three Andean regions of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, and Apurímac and granted the military the power to arbitrarily detain any suspicious person. The military abused this power, arresting scores of innocent people, at times subjecting them to torture during interrogation as well as rape. Members of the Peruvian Armed Forces began to wear black ski-masks to hide their identities, in order to protect themselves and their families.

In some areas, the military trained peasants and organized them into anti-rebel militias, called &quot;rondas&quot;. They were generally poorly equipped, despite being provided arms by the state. The rondas would attack the Shining Path guerrillas, with the first such reported attack occurring in January 1983, near Huata. &quot;Ronderos&quot; would later kill 13 guerrilla fighters in February 1983, in Sacsamarca. In March 1983, &quot;ronderos&quot; brutally killed Olegario Curitomay, one of the commanders of the town of Lucanamarca. They took him to the town square, stoned him, stabbed him, set him on fire, and finally shot him. The Shining Path&#x27;s retaliation to this was one of the worst attacks in the entire conflict, with a group of guerrilla members entering the town and going house by house, killing dozens of villagers, including babies, with guns, hatchets, and axes. This action has come to be known as the Lucanamarca massacre. Additional massacres of civilians by the Shining Path would occur throughout the conflict.

The Shining Path&#x27;s attacks were not limited to the countryside. It executed several attacks against the infrastructure in Lima, killing civilians in the process. In 1983, it sabotaged several electrical transmission towers, causing a citywide blackout, and set fire and destroyed the Bayer industrial plant. That same year, it set off a powerful bomb in the offices of the governing party, Popular Action. Escalating its activities in Lima, in June 1985, it blew up electricity transmission towers in Lima, producing a blackout, and detonated car bombs near the government palace and the justice palace. It was believed to be responsible for bombing a shopping mall. At the time, President Fernando Belaúnde Terry was receiving the Argentine president Raúl Alfonsín.

During this period, the Shining Path assassinated specific individuals, notably leaders of other leftist groups, local political parties, labor unions, and peasant organizations, some of whom were anti-Shining Path Marxists. On 24 April 1985, in the midst of presidential elections, it tried to assassinate Domingo García Rada, the president of the Peruvian National Electoral Council, severely injuring him and mortally wounding his driver. In 1988, Constantin (Gus) Gregory, an American citizen working for the United States Agency for International Development, was assassinated. Two French aid workers were killed on 4 December that same year.

==== Level of support ====

By 1990, the Shining Path had about 3,000 armed members at its greatest extent. The group had gained control of much of the countryside of the center and south of Peru and had a large presence in the outskirts of Lima. The Shining Path began to fight against Peru&#x27;s other major guerrilla group, the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), as well as &quot;campesino&quot; self-defense groups organized by the Peruvian armed forces.

The Shining Path quickly seized control of large areas of Peru. The group had significant support among peasant communities, and it had the support of some slum dwellers in the capital and elsewhere. The Shining Path&#x27;s interpretation of Maoism did not have the support of many city dwellers. According to opinion polls, only 15 percent of the population considered subversion to be justifiable in June 1988, while only 17 percent considered it justifiable in 1991. In June 1991, &quot;the total sample disapproved of the Shining Path by an 83 to 7 percent margin, with 10 percent not answering the question. Among the poorest, however, only 58 percent stated disapproval of the Shining Path; 11 percent said they had a favorable opinion of the Shining Path, and some 31 percent would not answer the question.&quot; A September 1991 poll found that 21 percent of those polled in Lima believed that the Shining Path did not torture and kill innocent people. The same poll found that 13 percent believed that society would be more just if the Shining Path won the war and 22 percent believed society would be equally just under the Shining Path as it was under the government. Polls have never been completely accurate since Peru has several anti-terrorism laws, including &quot;apologia for terrorism&quot;, that makes it a punishable offense for anyone who does not condemn the Shining Path. In effect, the laws make it illegal to support the group in any way.

Many peasants were unhappy with the Shining Path&#x27;s rule for a variety of reasons, such as its disrespect for indigenous culture and institutions. However, they had also made agreements and alliances with some indigenous tribes. Some did not like the brutality of its &quot;popular trials&quot; that sometimes included &quot;slitting throats, strangulation, stoning, and burning.&quot; Peasants were offended by the rebels&#x27; injunction against burying the bodies of Shining Path victims.

The Shining Path followed Mao Zedong&#x27;s dictum that guerrilla warfare should start in the countryside and gradually choke off the cities.

According to multiple sources, the Shining Path received support from Gaddafi&#x27;s Libya.

==== Fujimori government ====

When President Alberto Fujimori took office in 1990, he responded to Shining Path with repressive force. His government issued a law in 1991 that gave the &quot;rondas&quot; a legal status, and from that time, they were officially called &quot;Comités de auto defensa&quot; (&quot;Committees of Self-Defense&quot;). They were officially armed, usually with 12-gauge shotguns, and trained by the Peruvian Army. According to the government, there were approximately 7,226 &quot;comités de auto defensa&quot; as of 2005; almost 4,000 are located in the central region of Peru, the stronghold of the Shining Path.

The Peruvian government also cracked down on the Shining Path in other ways. Military personnel were dispatched to areas dominated by the Shining Path, especially Ayacucho, to fight the rebels. Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Apurímac and Huánuco were declared emergency zones, allowing for some constitutional rights to be suspended in those areas.

Initial government efforts to fight the Shining Path were not very effective or promising. Military units engaged in many human rights violations, which caused the Shining Path to appear in the eyes of many as the lesser of two evils. They used excessive force, tortured individuals accused of being sympathizers and killed many innocent civilians. Government forces destroyed villages and killed &quot;campesinos&quot; suspected of supporting the Shining Path. They eventually lessened the pace at which the armed forces committed atrocities such as massacres. Additionally, the state began the widespread use of intelligence agencies in its fight against the Shining Path. However, atrocities were committed by the National Intelligence Service and the Army Intelligence Service, notably the La Cantuta massacre, the Santa massacre and the Barrios Altos massacre, which were committed by Grupo Colina.

In one of its last attacks in Lima, on 16 July 1992, Shining Path detonated a powerful bomb on Tarata Street in the Miraflores District, full of civilian adults and children, killing 25 people and injuring an additional 155.

=== Capture of Guzmán and collapse (1992–1993) ===
On 12 September 1992, the Special Intelligence Group (GEIN) captured Guzmán and several Shining Path leaders in an apartment above a dance studio in the Surquillo district of Lima. GEIN had been monitoring the apartment since a number of suspected Shining Path militants had visited it. An inspection of the garbage of the apartment produced empty tubes of a skin cream used to treat psoriasis, a condition that Guzmán was known to have. Shortly after the raid that captured Guzmán, most of the remaining Shining Path leadership fell as well.

The capture of Guzmán left a huge leadership vacuum for the Shining Path. &quot;There is no No. 2. There is only Presidente Gonzalo and then the party,&quot; a Shining Path political officer said at a birthday celebration for Guzmán in Lurigancho prison in December 1990. &quot;Without President Gonzalo, we would have nothing.&quot;

At the same time, the Shining Path suffered embarrassing military defeats to self-defense organizations of rural &quot;campesinos&quot; – supposedly its social base. When Guzmán called for peace talks with the Peruvian government, the organization fractured into splinter groups, with some Shining Path members in favor of such talks and others opposed.

=== Remnants (1993–present) ===
Guzmán&#x27;s role as the leader of the Shining Path was taken over by Óscar Ramírez (&quot;Comrade Feliciano&quot;), who established &quot;Sendero Rojo&quot; (or PCP Pro-Seguir), aiming to reorganise the party and to continue the armed struggle while breaking with Guzmán, but not with his ideology. Together with Ramírez, Florindo Eleuterio Flores Hala, who controlled the Huallaga area, formed the initial leadership of the party. Sendero Rojo was disbanded after &quot;Comrade Feliciano&#x27;s capture in 1999. After Ramírez&#x27;s capture, the group further splintered, guerrilla activity diminished sharply, and peace returned to the areas where the Shining Path had been active.

The three remaining splinter groups were a collective (and so-called &quot;regional committe&quot;) in the Huallaga Valley (PCP-CRH) led by Comrade Artemio, the People&#x27;s Guerrilla Army (ERP) led by the Víctor and Jorge Quispe Palomino brothers, and a base committee in Mantaro Valley (PCP-CBMR) led by a &quot;Comrade Netzel López&quot;.

==== Temporary resurgence (2001–2009) ====
Although the organization&#x27;s numbers had lessened by 2003, a militant faction of the Shining Path called &quot;Proseguir&quot; (&quot;Onward&quot;) continued to be active. The group had allegedly made an alliance with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in the early 2000s, learning how to use rockets against aircraft.

On Tuesday, August 9, 2001, an armed shootout between Peruvian policemen and Shining Path guerrillas took place in Satipo province. Police forces had broken through a primary line of defence as part of a special operation while underestimating the group&#x27;s numbers, who had coincidentally reunited and thus increased their numbers. This led to a shootout that lasted five hours and took the lives of four policemen and 12 &quot;senderistas&quot;.

On 20 March 2002, a car bomb exploded outside the US embassy in Lima just before a visit by President George W. Bush. Nine people were killed, and 30 were injured; the attack was suspected to be the work of the Shining Path.

On 9 June 2003, a Shining Path group attacked a camp in Ayacucho and took 68 employees of the Argentinian company Techint and three police guards as hostages. They had been working on the Camisea gas pipeline project that would take natural gas from Cusco to Lima. According to sources from Peru&#x27;s Interior Ministry, the rebels asked for a sizable ransom to free the hostages. Two days later, after a rapid military response which involved a signals intelligence aircraft from the Brazilian Air Force, the rebels abandoned the hostages; according to government sources, no ransom was paid. However, there were rumors that US$200,000 was paid to the rebels.

Government forces have captured three leading Shining Path members. In April 2000, Commander José Arcela Chiroque, called &quot;Ormeño&quot;, was captured, followed by another leader, Florentino Cerrón Cardozo, called &quot;Marcelo&quot;, in July 2003. In November of the same year, Jaime Zuñiga, called &quot;Cirilo&quot; or &quot;Dalton&quot;, was arrested after a clash in which four guerrillas were killed and an officer was wounded. Officials said he took part in planning the kidnapping of the Techint pipeline workers. He was also thought to have led an ambush against an army helicopter in 1999 in which five soldiers died.

In 2003, the Peruvian National Police broke up several Shining Path training camps and captured many members and leaders. By late October 2003, there were 96 attacks in Peru, projecting a 15% decrease from the 134 kidnappings and armed attacks in 2002. Also for the year, eight or nine people were killed by the Shining Path, and 6 &quot;senderistas&quot; were killed and 209 were captured.
In January 2004, a man known as Comrade Artemio and identifying himself as one of the Shining Path&#x27;s leaders, said in a media interview that the group would resume violent operations unless the Peruvian government granted amnesty to other top Shining Path leaders within 60 days. Peru&#x27;s Interior Minister, Fernando Rospigliosi, said that the government would respond &quot;drastically and swiftly&quot; to any violent action. In September that same year, a comprehensive sweep by police in five cities found 17 suspected members of a &quot;Huallaga Regional Committee&quot; (; CRH). According to the interior minister, eight of the arrested were school teachers and high-level school administrators.

Despite these arrests, the Shining Path continued to exist in Peru. On 22 December 2005, the Shining Path ambushed a police patrol in the Huánuco region, killing eight. Later that day, they wounded an additional two police officers. In response, then President Alejandro Toledo declared a state of emergency in Huánuco and gave the police the power to search houses and arrest suspects without a warrant. On 19 February 2006, the Peruvian police killed Héctor Aponte, believed to be the commander responsible for the ambush. In December 2006, Peruvian troops were sent to counter renewed guerrilla activity, and according to high-level government officials, the Shining Path&#x27;s strength has reached an estimated 300 members. In November 2007, police said they killed Artemio&#x27;s second-in-command, a guerrilla known as JL.

In September 2008, government forces announced the killing of five rebels in the Vizcatan region. This claim was subsequently challenged by the APRODEH, a Peruvian human rights group, which believed that those who were killed were in fact local farmers and not rebels. That same month, Artemio gave his first recorded interview since 2006. In it, he stated that the Shining Path would continue to fight despite escalating military pressure. In October 2008, in Huancavelica Region, the guerrillas engaged a military convoy with explosives and firearms, demonstrating their continued ability to strike and inflict casualties on military targets. The conflict resulted in the death of 12 soldiers and two to seven civilians. It came one day after a clash in the Vizcatan region, which left five rebels and one soldier dead.

In November 2008, the rebels utilized hand grenades and automatic weapons in an assault that claimed the lives of 4 police officers. In April 2009, the Shining Path ambushed and killed 13 government soldiers in Ayacucho. Grenades and dynamite were used in the attack. The dead included eleven soldiers and one captain, and two soldiers were also injured, with one reported missing. Poor communications were said to have made relay of the news difficult. The country&#x27;s Defense Minister, Antero Flores Aráoz, said many soldiers &quot;plunged over a cliff&quot;. His prime minister, Yehude Simon, said these attacks were &quot;desperate responses by the Shining Path in the face of advances by the armed forces&quot; and expressed his belief that the area would soon be freed of &quot;leftover terrorists&quot;. In the aftermath, a Sendero leader called this &quot;the strongest [anti-government] blow... in quite a while&quot;. In November 2009, Defense Minister Rafael Rey announced that Shining Path militants had attacked a military outpost in southern Ayacucho province. One soldier was killed and three others wounded in the assault.

==== Continued downfall ====
On 28 April 2010, Shining Path rebels in Peru ambushed and killed a police officer and two civilians who were destroying coca plantations of Aucayacu, in the central region of Haunuco, Peru. The victims were gunned down by sniper fire coming from the thick forest as more than 200 workers were destroying coca plants. Following the attack, the Shining Path faction, based in the Upper Huallaga Valley of Peru and headed by Florindo Eleuterio Flores Hala, alias Comrade Artemio, was operating in survival mode and lost 9 of their top 10 leaders to Peruvian National Police-led capture operations. Two of the eight leaders were killed by PNP personnel during the attempted captures. The nine arrested or killed Shining Path (Upper Huallaga Valley faction) leaders include Mono (Aug. 2009), Rubén (May 2010), Izula (Oct. 2010), Sergio (Dec. 2010), Yoli/Miguel/Jorge (Jun. 2011), Gato Larry (Jun. 2011), Oscar Tigre (Aug. 2011), Vicente Roger (Aug. 2011), and Dante/Delta (Jan. 2012). This loss of leadership, coupled with a sweep of Shining Path (Upper Huallaga Valley) supporters executed by the PNP in November 2010, prompted Comrade Artemio to declare in December 2011 to several international journalists that the guerrilla war against the Peruvian Government has been lost and that his only hope was to negotiate an amnesty agreement with the Government of Peru.

On 12 February 2012, Comrade Artemio was found badly wounded after a clash with troops in a remote jungle region of Peru. President Ollanta Humala said the capture of Artemio, nicknamed &quot;Operation Crepúsculo&quot;, marked the defeat of the Huallaga faction, located in a central area of cocaine production. President Humala has stated that he would now step up the fight against the remaining bands of Shining Path rebels in the Ene-Apurímac valley. Walter Diaz, the lead candidate to succeed Artemio, was captured on 3 March, further ensuring the disintegration of the Alto Huallaga valley faction. On 3 April 2012, Jaime Arenas Caviedes, a senior leader in the group&#x27;s remnants in Alto Huallaga Valley who was also regarded to be the leading candidate to succeed Artemio following Diaz&#x27;s arrest, was captured. After Caviedes, alias &quot;Braulio&quot;, was captured, Humala declared that the Shining Path was now unable to operate in the Alto Huallaga Valley. Shining Path rebels carried out an attack on three helicopters being used by an international gas pipeline consortium on 7 October, in the central region of Cusco. According to the military Joint Command spokesman, Col. Alejandro Lujan, no one was kidnapped or injured during the attack. The capture of Artemio effectively ended the war between Shining Path and the Government of Peru.

Comrade Artemio was convicted of terrorism, drug trafficking, and money laundering on 7 June 2013. He was sentenced to life in prison and a fine of $183 million. On 11 August 2013, Comrade Alipio, the Shining Path&#x27;s leader in the Ene-Apurímac Valley, was killed in a battle with government forces in Llochegua.

On 9 April 2016, on the eve of the country&#x27;s presidential elections, the Peruvian government blamed remnants of the Shining Path for a guerrilla attack that killed eight soldiers and two civilians. Shining Path snipers killed three police officers in the Ene Apurimac Valley on 18 March 2017.

In a document 400 pages in length recovered from a mid-level Shining Path commander and analyzed by the Counter-Terrorism Directorate (DIRCOTE) of the National Police, the Shining Path planned to initiate operations against the Government of Peru that included killings and surprise attacks beginning in 2021, the bicentennial of Peru&#x27;s independence. Objectives were created to first attack public officials, then regain lost territory and then finally overthrow the government.

==== VRAEM stronghold ====
Into the 2020s, Shining Path has existed in remaining splinter groups. The main remaining group, called the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (MPCP) of about 450 individuals remained in the Valle de los Ríos Apurímac, Ene y Mantaro (VRAEM) region, reportedly making revenue by escorting cocaine traffickers and are reportedly led by two brothers; Víctor and Jorge Quispe Palomino. The MPCP has attempted to recharacterize themselves to distance itself from the original Shining Path groups that had attacked rural communities in the area, describing Guzmán as a traitor. According to InSight Crime, Shining Path&#x27;s stronghold in the VRAEM, headquartered in Vizcatán, is a similar strategy as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.

Another notable splinter group called the Communist Party of Peru – Red Mantaro Base Committee (PCP-CBMR), which remains loyal to Abimael Guzman, also operates in the VRAEM region. According to the human rights organization Waynakuna Peru, the PCP-CBMR has infiltrated schools in the area setting up &quot;Popular Schools&quot; to spread the group&#x27;s propaganda. The group has in the past signed documents with the Communist Party of Ecuador – Red Sun.

Following a five-year intelligence operation that began in 2015 and was codenamed Operation Olimpo, 71 alleged members of the Shining Path&#x27;s United Front and People&#x27;s Guerrilla Army were arrested on 2 December 2020. Alfredo Crespo, the secretary general of MOVADEF and Guzmán&#x27;s former lawyer, was included among those arrested. Operation Olimpo included 752 military personnel and 98 government prosecutors that utilized evidence obtained through wiretapping, undercover agents and surveillance. Those arrested were charged with operating shell operations to initiate terrorist activities in Callao and Lima.

== In popular culture ==
American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses quotes a speech by a Shining Path officer in their 1990 song &quot;Civil War&quot;, as saying &quot;We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials, for example, to create a vacuum, then we fill that vacuum. As popular war advances, peace is closer.&quot;

American rock band Rage Against the Machine released a music video for their 1993 song &quot;Bombtrack&quot; as a response to the arrest of Abimael Guzman the previous year. The video expresses support for Guzman and the Shining Path, featuring various clips of the organization&#x27;s activities, as well as showing the band in a cage to mimic Guzman&#x27;s imprisonment.

<doc id="28523" wikidata="Q6226" url="?curid=28523" title="St Albans">
<text>St Albans () is a cathedral city in Hertfordshire, England, east of Hemel Hempstead and west of Hatfield, north-west of London, south-west of Welwyn Garden City and south-east of Luton. St Albans was the first major town on the old Roman road of Watling Street for travellers heading north and became the city of Verulamium. It is within the London commuter belt and the Greater London Built-up Area.

==Name==
St Albans takes its name from the first British saint, Alban. The most elaborate version of his story, in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, relates that he lived in Verulamium, sometime during the 3rd or 4th century, when Christians were suffering persecution. Alban met a Christian priest fleeing from his persecutors and sheltered him in his house, where he became so impressed with the priest&#x27;s piety that he converted to Christianity. When the authorities searched Alban&#x27;s house, he put on the priest&#x27;s cloak and presented himself in place of his guest. Consequently, he was sentenced to endure the punishments that were to be inflicted upon the priest, unless he renounced Christianity. Alban refused and was taken for execution. In later legends, his head rolled downhill after execution and a well sprang up where it stopped.

==History==
=== Iron Age ===
There was an Iron Age settlement known as Verlamion, or Verlamio, near the site of the present city, the centre of Tasciovanus&#x27; power and a major centre of the Catuvellauni from about 20 BC until shortly after the Roman invasion of AD 43. The name &quot;Verlamion&quot; is Celtic, meaning &quot;settlement over or by the marsh&quot;. The town was on Prae Hill, to the west of modern St Albans, now covered by the village of St Michael&#x27;s, Verulamium Park and the Gorhambury Estate. Although excavations done in 1996 produced finds which include silver coins from the Roman Republic era dating from 90/80 BC. There was evidence of trade with the republic and that a settlement already existed on the site 50 years before Julius Caesar attempted to invade Britain. However, it is believed that the tribal capital was moved to the site by Tasciovanus (around 25 to 5 BC). Cunobelinus may have constructed Beech Bottom Dyke, a defensive earthwork near the settlement whose significance is uncertain.

===Roman===

The Roman city of Verulamium, the second-largest town in Roman Britain after Londinium, developed from the Iron Age settlement and was granted the rank of &quot;municipium&quot; around AD 50, meaning that its citizens had what were known as &quot;Latin Rights&quot;, a lesser citizenship status than a possessed. It grew to a significant town, and as such received the attentions of Boudica of the Iceni in 61, when Verulamium was sacked and burnt on her orders. Excavations preceding the museum&#x27;s new entrance done in 1996–97 within the centre of the Roman town gave archaeologists the chance to date a black ash layer to 60–65 AD, thus confirming the Roman written record. It grew steadily; by the early 3rd century, it covered an area of about , behind a deep ditch and wall. Verulamium contained a forum, basilica and a theatre, much of which were damaged during two fires, one in 155 and the other in around 250. These were repaired and continued in use in the 4th century. The theatre was disused by the end of the 4th century. One of the few extant Roman inscriptions in Britain is found on the remnants of the forum (see Verulamium Forum inscription). The town was rebuilt in stone rather than timber at least twice over the next 150 years. Roman occupation ended between 400 and 450 AD.

The body of St Alban was probably buried outside the city walls in a Roman cemetery near the present cathedral. His hillside grave became a place of pilgrimage. Recent investigation has uncovered a basilica there, indicating the oldest continuous site of Christian worship in Great Britain. In 429 Germanus of Auxerre visited the church and subsequently promoted the cult of St Alban.

A few traces of the Roman city remain visible, such as parts of the city walls, a hypocaust – still &quot;in situ&quot; under a mosaic floor, and the theatre, which is on land belonging to the Earl of Verulam, as well as items in the museum. Further remains beneath nearby agricultural land have only had a few exploratory trenches, which have never been fully excavated and were seriously threatened by deep ploughing, which ceased in 2005 after compensation was agreed. Test trenches in 2003 confirmed that serious damage had occurred to buildings on the northern side of Old Watling Street by deep ploughing. Permission needs to be granted to enable the full extent of the damage to the western half of Verulamium to be investigated.

===Anglo-Saxon===
After the Roman withdrawal the town became the centre of the territory or &quot;regio&quot; of the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Waeclingas&quot; tribe.

St Albans Abbey and the associated Anglo-Saxon settlement were founded on the hill outside the Roman city where it was believed St Alban was buried. An archaeological excavation in 1978, directed by Martin Biddle, failed to find Roman remains on the site of the medieval chapter house. As late as the eighth century the Saxon inhabitants of St Albans nearby were aware of their ancient neighbour, which they knew alternatively as Verulamacæstir or, under what H. R. Loyn terms &quot;their own hybrid&quot;, Vaeclingscæstir, &quot;the fortress of the followers of Wæcla&quot;, possibly a pocket of British-speakers remaining separate in an increasingly Saxonised area.

===Medieval===
The medieval town grew on the hill to the east of Wæclingacaester where the Benedictine Abbey of St Albans was founded by Ulsinus in 793. There is some evidence that the original site was higher up the hill than the present building, which was begun in 1077. St Albans Abbey was the principal medieval abbey in England. The scribe Matthew Vickers lived there and the first draft of Magna Carta was drawn up there. It became a parish church after the dissolution of the Benedictine abbey in 1539 and was made a cathedral in 1877.

St Albans School was founded in AD 948. Matthew Paris was educated there and it is the only school in the English-speaking world to have educated a Pope (Adrian IV). Now a public school it has, since 1871, occupied a site to the west of the Abbey and includes the 14th-century Abbey Gateway. One of its buildings was a hat factory, a link with the city&#x27;s industrial past.

On Abbey Mill Lane, the road between the Abbey and the school, are the palaces of the Bishops of St Albans and Hertford and Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, claimed to be the oldest pub in England.

Between 1403 and 1412 Thomas Wolvey was engaged to build a clock tower in the Market Place. It is the only extant medieval town belfry in England. The original bell, named for the Archangel Gabriel sounds F-natural and weighs one ton. Gabriel sounded at 4 am for the Angelus and at 8 or 9 pm for the curfew. The ground floor of the tower was a shop until the 20th century. The first- and second-floor rooms were designed as living chambers. The shop and the first floor were connected by a flight of spiral stairs. Another flight rises the whole height of the tower by 93 narrow steps and gave access to the living chamber, the clock and the bell without disturbing the tenant of the shop.

Two battles of the Wars of the Roses took place in or near the town. The First Battle of St Albans was fought on 22 May 1455 within the town, and the Second Battle of St Albans was fought on 17 February 1461, just to the north.

A street market on Wednesdays and Saturdays, founded by Abbot Ulsinus, still flourishes. In 1553, Henry&#x27;s son Edward VI sold the right to hold the market to a group of local merchants and landowners via letters patent which also incorporated St Albans as a borough. The old market hall, which dated from around 1596, was replaced by the Corn Exchange in 1857.

===Modern===
Before the 20th century St Albans was a rural market town, a Christian pilgrimage site, and the first coaching stop of the route to and from London, accounting for its numerous old inns. Victorian St Albans was small and had little industry. Its population grew more slowly than London, 8–9% per decade between 1801 and 1861, compared to the 31% per decade growth of London in the same period. The railway arrived in 1858. In 1869 the extension of the city boundaries was opposed by the Earl of Verulam and many of the townsfolk, but there was rapid expansion and much building at the end of the century, and between 1891 and 1901 the population grew by 37%.

In 1877, in response to a public petition, Queen Victoria issued the second royal charter, which granted city status to the borough and Cathedral status to the former Abbey Church. The new diocese was established in the same year, in the main from parts of the large Diocese of Rochester.

In the inter-war years it became a centre for the electronics industry. In the post-World War II years it expanded rapidly as part of the post-War redistribution of population out of Greater London. It is now a popular tourist destination.

==Governance==
St Albans has two tiers of local government, at district and county level: St Albans City and District Council and Hertfordshire County Council. The main part of the urban area of St Albans (the pre-1974 borough) is an unparished area, directly administered by the city/district and county councils.

=== Past ===
The early administrative history of the town of St Albans is closely tied to St Albans Abbey. The town was effectively controlled by the abbey through the Middle Ages, but there were frequent disputes between the abbot and townspeople about the extent of the abbey&#x27;s powers in the town. Following the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, the rights previously held by it passed to the crown. On 12 May 1553 the town was granted a charter by Edward VI, incorporating it as a borough with a mayor.

The borough consisted of the ancient parish of St Albans (also known as the Abbey parish) and parts of the parishes of St Michael and St Peter. The borough was reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to become a municipal borough, and the boundary was adjusted to additionally include part of the parish of St Stephen. On 28 August 1877 the borough gained city status, following the elevation of St Albans Abbey to become a cathedral. The boundary was also adjusted in 1877 to include part of the parish of Sandridge.

The Local Government Act 1894 divided parishes that were partly within municipal boroughs. The parts of St Michael, St Peter and Sandridge within the borough became the new parishes of St Michael Urban, St Peter Urban and Sandridge Urban. The part of St Stephen within the borough was absorbed by the parish of St Albans. The parishes that were formed outside the borough, that is St Michael Rural, St Peter Rural, Sandridge Rural and the reduced St Stephen, became part of St Albans Rural District on 28 December 1894.

St Albans Town Hall was built between 1829 and 1831 and served as the council&#x27;s meeting place until the 1960s, when the council moved to new premises at the City Hall and adjoining buildings.

In 1898 the parish of St Albans absorbed St Michael Urban, St Peter Urban and Sandridge Urban so the parish and borough occupied the same area. In 1901 the population of the borough was 16,019, growing to 18,133 in 1911. St Albans expanded in 1913 by gaining parts of Sandridge Rural (241 acres), St Michael Rural (138 acres), St Peter Rural (992 acres) and St Stephen (335 acres). In 1921 the population of the enlarged borough was 25,593, growing to 28,624 in 1931. It expanded again in 1935 as part of a county review order gaining more of St Michael Rural (890 acres), St Peter Rural (436 acres) and St Stephen (712 acres). The population of the borough was 44,098 in 1951 and 50,293 in 1961.

=== Present ===
The borough was abolished on 1 April 1974 and St Albans became part of the new, larger St Albans City and District. City status was transferred to the entire district by letters patent dated 9 July 1974. Local government services are now provided by Hertfordshire County Council (strategic services) and St Albans City and District Council. Eight local parish councils (limited local services) cover the parts of St Albans City and District that were previously in St Albans Rural District and Harpenden Urban District, but the area that was St Albans Borough prior to 1974 is an unparished area. Within this area, (the Ashley, Batchwood, Clarence, Cunningham, Marshalswick South, St Peters, Sopwell and Verulam wards) a City Neighbourhood Committee of the district council was set up in June 2013 with comparable responsibilities to parish councils for small parks, playgrounds, open spaces, war memorials, allotments and public conveniences. The City and District Council built a new civic centre in 1989 adjoining the 1960s City Hall complex, which became known instead as the Alban Arena.

===Parliamentary representation===

St Albans is part of the homonymous parliamentary constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Established in 1885, it is a county constituency in Hertfordshire, and elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

Local newspaper in the town is the St Albans Observer.

===Filming location===
The mixed character of St Albans and its proximity to London have made it a popular filming location. The Abbey and Fishpool Street areas were used for the pilot episode of the 1960s ecclesiastical TV comedy &quot;All Gas and Gaiters&quot;. The area of Romeland, directly north of the Abbey Gateway and the walls of the Abbey and school grounds, can be seen masquerading as part of an Oxford college in some episodes of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; (and several local pubs also appear). Fishpool Street, running from Romeland to St Michael&#x27;s village, stood in for Hastings in some episodes of &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;. &quot;Life Begins&quot; was filmed largely in and around St Albans. The Lady Chapel in the Abbey itself was used as a location for at least one scene in Sean Connery&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;First Knight&quot;, whilst the nave of the Abbey was used during a coronation scene as a substitute for Westminster Abbey in &quot;Johnny English&quot; starring Rowan Atkinson. The 19th-century gatehouse of the former prison near the mainline station appeared in the title sequence of the TV series &quot;Porridge&quot;, starring Ronnie Barker. The 2001 film &quot;Birthday Girl&quot; starring Ben Chaplin and Nicole Kidman was also partly filmed in St Albans.

More recently, several scenes from the film &quot;Incendiary&quot;, starring Michelle Williams, Ewan McGregor and Matthew Macfadyen, were filmed in St Albans, focusing in particular on the Abbey and the Abbey Gateway. In 2018, a Gucci advert featuring Harry Styles was filmed at a Fish and Chips shop in Fleetville, St Albans. It has also been used in the setting for the fictional town &quot;Waltringham&quot;, in the TV show &quot;Humans&quot;.

===Links with other sports===
St Albans is additionally home to a community of traceurs from around Hertfordshire.

St Albans was once home to the then most prestigious steeplechase in England. The Great St Albans chase attracted the best horses and riders from across Britain and Ireland in the 1830s and was held in such high esteem that when it clashed with the 1837 Grand National the top horses and riders chose to bypass Aintree. Without warning the race was discontinued in 1839 and was quickly forgotten.

St Albans was once home to Samuel Ryder, the founder of the Ryder Cup. He ran a very successful packet seeds business in the 1890s which at one time he ran from a packing warehouse on Holywell Hill (became Café Rouge until closure in 2023). His interest in golf and sponsorship led to his donation of the now famous Ryder Cup. He is buried in Hatfield Road Cemetery, where in July 2012 the Olympic Torch Relay passed by to honour him.

==Education==

St Albans has many state primary and secondary schools, and a number of independent schools.

The law school of the University of Hertfordshire used to be based in Hatfield Road in St Albans until it moved to the university&#x27;s De Havilland campus in Hatfield in 2011. Hertfordshire County Council purchased the site. The interior of the former law school building has since been refurbished and now forms part of Alban City School, a state-funded Free School for primary aged children, which started taking reception class children in September 2012.

A campus of Oaklands College, a further education college, is also located in Smallford in St Albans.

<text>RNA splicing is a process in molecular biology where a newly-made precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) transcript is transformed into a mature messenger RNA (mRNA). It works by removing all the introns (non-coding regions of RNA) and &quot;splicing&quot; back together exons (coding regions). For nuclear-encoded genes, splicing occurs in the nucleus either during or immediately after transcription. For those eukaryotic genes that contain introns, splicing is usually needed to create an mRNA molecule that can be translated into protein. For many eukaryotic introns, splicing occurs in a series of reactions which are catalyzed by the spliceosome, a complex of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). There exist self-splicing introns, that is, ribozymes that can catalyze their own excision from their parent RNA molecule. The process of transcription, splicing and translation is called gene expression, the central dogma of molecular biology.
==Splicing pathways==
Several methods of RNA splicing occur in nature; the type of splicing depends on the structure of the spliced intron and the catalysts required for splicing to occur.

===Spliceosomal complex===

====Introns====
The word &quot;intron&quot; is derived from the terms &quot;intragenic region&quot;, and &quot;intracistron&quot;, that is, a segment of DNA that is located between two exons of a gene. The term intron refers to both the DNA sequence within a gene and the corresponding sequence in the unprocessed RNA transcript. As part of the RNA processing pathway, introns are removed by RNA splicing either shortly after or concurrent with transcription. Introns are found in the genes of most organisms and many viruses. They can be located in a wide range of genes, including those that generate proteins, ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and transfer RNA (tRNA).

Within introns, a donor site (5&#x27; end of the intron), a branch site (near the 3&#x27; end of the intron) and an acceptor site (3&#x27; end of the intron) are required for splicing. The splice donor site includes an almost invariant sequence GU at the 5&#x27; end of the intron, within a larger, less highly conserved region. The splice acceptor site at the 3&#x27; end of the intron terminates the intron with an almost invariant AG sequence. Upstream (5&#x27;-ward) from the AG there is a region high in pyrimidines (C and U), or polypyrimidine tract. Further upstream from the polypyrimidine tract is the branchpoint, which includes an adenine nucleotide involved in lariat formation. The consensus sequence for an intron (in IUPAC nucleic acid notation) is: G-G-[cut]-G-U-R-A-G-U (donor site) ... intron sequence ... Y-U-R-A-C (branch sequence 20-50 nucleotides upstream of acceptor site) ... Y-rich-N-C-A-G-[cut]-G (acceptor site). However, it is noted that the specific sequence of intronic splicing elements and the number of nucleotides between the branchpoint and the nearest 3&#x27; acceptor site affect splice site selection. Also, point mutations in the underlying DNA or errors during transcription can activate a &quot;cryptic splice site&quot; in part of the transcript that usually is not spliced. This results in a mature messenger RNA with a missing section of an exon. In this way, a point mutation, which might otherwise affect only a single amino acid, can manifest as a deletion or truncation in the final protein.
====Formation and activity====
Splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large RNA-protein complex composed of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Assembly and activity of the spliceosome occurs during transcription of the pre-mRNA. The RNA components of snRNPs interact with the intron and are involved in catalysis. Two types of spliceosomes have been identified (major and minor) which contain different snRNPs.
* The major spliceosome splices introns containing GU at the 5&#x27; splice site and AG at the 3&#x27; splice site. It is composed of the U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 snRNPs and is active in the nucleus. In addition, a number of proteins including U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF35), U2AF2 (U2AF65) and SF1 are required for the assembly of the spliceosome. The spliceosome forms different complexes during the splicing process:

:*Complex E
:**The U1 snRNP binds to the GU sequence at the 5&#x27; splice site of an intron;
:**Splicing factor 1 binds to the intron branch point sequence;
:**U2AF1 binds at the 3&#x27; splice site of the intron;
:**U2AF2 binds to the polypyrimidine tract;

:*Complex A (pre-spliceosome)
:**The U2 snRNP displaces SF1 and binds to the branch point sequence and ATP is hydrolyzed;

:*Complex B (pre-catalytic spliceosome)
:**The U5/U4/U6 snRNP trimer binds, and the U5 snRNP binds exons at the 5&#x27; site, with U6 binding to U2;

:*Complex B*
:**The U1 snRNP is released, U5 shifts from exon to intron, and the U6 binds at the 5&#x27; splice site;

:*Complex C (catalytic spliceosome)
:**U4 is released, U6/U2 catalyzes transesterification, making the 5&#x27;-end of the intron ligate to the A on intron and form a lariat, U5 binds exon at 3&#x27; splice site, and the 5&#x27; site is cleaved, resulting in the formation of the lariat;

:*Complex C* (post-spliceosomal complex)
:**U2/U5/U6 remain bound to the lariat, and the 3&#x27; site is cleaved and exons are ligated using ATP hydrolysis. The spliced RNA is released, the lariat is released and degraded, and the snRNPs are recycled.

:This type of splicing is termed &quot;canonical splicing&quot; or termed the &quot;lariat pathway&quot;, which accounts for more than 99% of splicing. By contrast, when the intronic flanking sequences do not follow the GU-AG rule, &quot;noncanonical splicing&quot; is said to occur (see &quot;minor spliceosome&quot; below).
* The minor spliceosome is very similar to the major spliceosome, but instead it splices out rare introns with different splice site sequences. While the minor and major spliceosomes contain the same U5 snRNP, the minor spliceosome has different but functionally analogous snRNPs for U1, U2, U4, and U6, which are respectively called U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac.

==== Recursive splicing ====
In most cases, splicing removes introns as single units from precursor mRNA transcripts. However, in some cases, especially in mRNAs with very long introns, splicing happens in steps, with part of an intron removed and then the remaining intron is spliced out in a following step. This has been found first in the &quot;Ultrabithorax&quot; (&quot;Ubx&quot;) gene of the fruit fly, &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, and a few other &quot;Drosophila&quot; genes, but cases in humans have been reported as well.

==== Trans-splicing ====
Trans-splicing is a form of splicing that removes introns or outrons, and joins two exons that are not within the same RNA transcript. Trans-splicing can occur between two different endogenous pre-mRNAs or between an endogenous and an exogenous (such as from viruses) or artificial RNAs.

=== Self-splicing ===
Self-splicing occurs for rare introns that form a ribozyme, performing the functions of the spliceosome by RNA alone. There are three kinds of self-splicing introns, &quot;Group I&quot;, &quot;Group II&quot; and &quot;Group III&quot;. Group I and II introns perform splicing similar to the spliceosome without requiring any protein. This similarity suggests that Group I and II introns may be evolutionarily related to the spliceosome. Self-splicing may also be very ancient, and may have existed in an RNA world present before protein.

Two transesterifications characterize the mechanism in which group I introns are spliced:
# 3&#x27;OH of a free guanine nucleoside (or one located in the intron) or a nucleotide cofactor (GMP, GDP, GTP) attacks phosphate at the 5&#x27; splice site.
# 3&#x27;OH of the 5&#x27; exon becomes a nucleophile and the second transesterification results in the joining of the two exons.

The mechanism in which group II introns are spliced (two transesterification reaction like group I introns) is as follows:
# The 2&#x27;OH of a specific adenosine in the intron attacks the 5&#x27; splice site, thereby forming the &quot;lariat&quot;
# The 3&#x27;OH of the 5&#x27; exon triggers the second transesterification at the 3&#x27; splice site, thereby joining the exons together.

===tRNA splicing===
tRNA (also tRNA-like) splicing is another rare form of splicing that usually occurs in tRNA. The splicing reaction involves a different biochemistry than the spliceosomal and self-splicing pathways.

In the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;, a yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease heterotetramer, composed of TSEN54, TSEN2, TSEN34, and TSEN15, cleaves pre-tRNA at two sites in the acceptor loop to form a 5&#x27;-half tRNA, terminating at a 2&#x27;,3&#x27;-cyclic phosphodiester group, and a 3&#x27;-half tRNA, terminating at a 5&#x27;-hydroxyl group, along with a discarded intron. Yeast tRNA kinase then phosphorylates the 5&#x27;-hydroxyl group using adenosine triphosphate. Yeast tRNA cyclic phosphodiesterase cleaves the cyclic phosphodiester group to form a 2&#x27;-phosphorylated 3&#x27; end. Yeast tRNA ligase adds an adenosine monophosphate group to the 5&#x27; end of the 3&#x27;-half and joins the two halves together. NAD-dependent 2&#x27;-phosphotransferase then removes the 2&#x27;-phosphate group.

==Evolution==
Splicing occurs in all the kingdoms or domains of life, however, the extent and types of splicing can be very different between the major divisions. Eukaryotes splice many protein-coding messenger RNAs and some non-coding RNAs. Prokaryotes, on the other hand, splice rarely and mostly non-coding RNAs. Another important difference between these two groups of organisms is that prokaryotes completely lack the spliceosomal pathway.

Because spliceosomal introns are not conserved in all species, there is debate concerning when spliceosomal splicing evolved. Two models have been proposed: the intron late and intron early models (see intron evolution).

==Biochemical mechanism==

Spliceosomal splicing and self-splicing involve a two-step biochemical process. Both steps involve transesterification reactions that occur between RNA nucleotides. tRNA splicing, however, is an exception and does not occur by transesterification.

Spliceosomal and self-splicing transesterification reactions occur via two sequential transesterification reactions. First, the 2&#x27;OH of a specific &quot;branchpoint&quot; nucleotide within the intron, defined during spliceosome assembly, performs a nucleophilic attack on the first nucleotide of the intron at the 5&#x27; splice site, forming the &quot;lariat intermediate&quot;. Second, the 3&#x27;OH of the released 5&#x27; exon then performs a nucleophilic attack at the first nucleotide following the last nucleotide of the intron at the 3&#x27; splice site, thus joining the exons and releasing the intron lariat.

==Alternative splicing==
In many cases, the splicing process can create a range of unique proteins by varying the exon composition of the same mRNA. This phenomenon is then called alternative splicing. Alternative splicing can occur in many ways. Exons can be extended or skipped, or introns can be retained. It is estimated that 95% of transcripts from multiexon genes undergo alternative splicing, some instances of which occur in a tissue-specific manner and/or under specific cellular conditions. Development of high throughput mRNA sequencing technology can help quantify the expression levels of alternatively spliced isoforms. Differential expression levels across tissues and cell lineages allowed computational approaches to be developed to predict the functions of these isoforms.
Given this complexity, alternative splicing of pre-mRNA transcripts is regulated by a system of trans-acting proteins (activators and repressors) that bind to cis-acting sites or &quot;elements&quot; (enhancers and silencers) on the pre-mRNA transcript itself. These proteins and their respective binding elements promote or reduce the usage of a particular splice site. The binding specificity comes from the sequence and structure of the cis-elements, e.g. in HIV-1 there are many donor and acceptor splice sites. Among the various splice sites, ssA7, which is 3&#x27; acceptor site, folds into three stem loop structures, i.e. Intronic splicing silencer (ISS), Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE), and Exonic splicing silencer (ESSE3). Solution structure of Intronic splicing silencer and its interaction to host protein hnRNPA1 give insight into specific recognition. However, adding to the complexity of alternative splicing, it is noted that the effects of regulatory factors are many times position-dependent. For example, a splicing factor that serves as a splicing activator when bound to an intronic enhancer element may serve as a repressor when bound to its splicing element in the context of an exon, and vice versa. In addition to the position-dependent effects of enhancer and silencer elements, the location of the branchpoint (i.e., distance upstream of the nearest 3&#x27; acceptor site) also affects splicing. The secondary structure of the pre-mRNA transcript also plays a role in regulating splicing, such as by bringing together splicing elements or by masking a sequence that would otherwise serve as a binding element for a splicing factor.

==Role of nuclear speckles in RNA splicing==

The location of pre-mRNA splicing is throughout the nucleus, and once mature mRNA is generated, it is transported to the cytoplasm for translation. In both plant and animal cells, nuclear speckles are regions with high concentrations of splicing factors. These speckles were once thought to be mere storage centers for splicing factors. However, it is now understood that nuclear speckles help concentrate splicing factors near genes that are physically located close to them. Genes located farther from speckles can still be transcribed and spliced, but their splicing is less efficient compared to those closer to speckles. Cells can vary their genomic positions of genes relative to nuclear speckles as a mechanism to modulate the expression of genes via splicing. 

==Role of splicing/alternative splicing in HIV-integration==

The process of splicing is linked with HIV integration, as HIV-1 targets highly spliced genes. 

==Splicing response to DNA damage==

DNA damage affects splicing factors by altering their post-translational modification, localization, expression and activity. Furthermore, DNA damage often disrupts splicing by interfering with its coupling to transcription. DNA damage also has an impact on the splicing and alternative splicing of genes intimately associated with DNA repair. For instance, DNA damages modulate the alternative splicing of the DNA repair genes &quot;Brca1&quot; and &quot;Ercc1&quot;.

==Experimental manipulation of splicing==
Splicing events can be experimentally altered by binding steric-blocking antisense oligos, such as Morpholinos or Peptide nucleic acids to snRNP binding sites, to the branchpoint nucleotide that closes the lariat, or to splice-regulatory element binding sites.

The use of antisense oligonucleotides to modulate splicing has shown great promise as a therapeutic strategy for a variety of genetic diseases caused by splicing defects.

Recent studies have shown that RNA splicing can be regulated by a variety of epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and histone modifications.

==Splicing errors and variation==
It has been suggested that one third of all disease-causing mutations impact on splicing. Common errors include:
* Mutation of a splice site resulting in loss of function of that site. Results in exposure of a premature stop codon, loss of an exon, or inclusion of an intron.
* Mutation of a splice site reducing specificity. May result in variation in the splice location, causing insertion or deletion of amino acids, or most likely, a disruption of the reading frame.
* Displacement of a splice site, leading to inclusion or exclusion of more RNA than expected, resulting in longer or shorter exons.
Although many splicing errors are safeguarded by a cellular quality control mechanism termed nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a number of splicing-related diseases also exist, as suggested above.

Allelic differences in mRNA splicing are likely to be a common and important source of phenotypic diversity at the molecular level, in addition to their contribution to genetic disease susceptibility. Indeed, genome-wide studies in humans have identified a range of genes that are subject to allele-specific splicing.

In plants, variation for flooding stress tolerance correlated with stress-induced alternative splicing of transcripts associated with gluconeogenesis and other processes.

==Protein splicing==

In addition to RNA, proteins can undergo splicing. Although the biomolecular mechanisms are different, the principle is the same: parts of the protein, called inteins instead of introns, are removed. The remaining parts, called exteins instead of exons, are fused together.
Protein splicing has been observed in a wide range of organisms, including bacteria, archaea, plants, yeast and humans.

== Splicing and genesis of circRNAs ==
The existence of backsplicing was first suggested in 2012. This backsplicing explains the genesis of circular RNAs resulting from the exact junction between the 3&#x27; boundary of an exon with the 5&#x27; boundary of an exon located upstream. In these exonic circular RNAs, the junction is a classic 3&#x27;-5&#x27;link.

The exclusion of intronic sequences during splicing can also leave traces, in the form of circular RNAs. In some cases, the intronic lariat is not destroyed and the circular part remains as a lariat-derived circRNA.In these lariat-derived circular RNAs, the junction is a 2&#x27;-5&#x27;link.

<text>Simon Fraser University (SFU) is a public research university in British Columbia, Canada. It maintains three campuses in Greater Vancouver, respectively located in Burnaby (main campus), Surrey, and Vancouver. The main Burnaby campus on Burnaby Mountain, located from downtown Vancouver, was established in 1965 and comprises more than 30,000 students and 160,000 alumni. The university was created in an effort to expand higher education across Canada.

SFU is a member of multiple national and international higher education associations, including the Association of Commonwealth Universities, International Association of Universities, and Universities Canada. SFU has also partnered with other universities and agencies to operate joint research facilities such as the TRIUMF, Canada&#x27;s national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics, which houses the world&#x27;s largest cyclotron, and Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre, a major centre for teaching and research in marine biology.

Undergraduate and graduate programs at SFU operate on a year-round, three-semester schedule. In 2015, SFU became the second Canadian university to receive accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

==History==

Simon Fraser University was founded upon the recommendation of a 1962 report entitled &quot;Higher Education in British Columbia and a Plan for the Future&quot; by John B. Macdonald. He recommended the creation of a new university in the Lower Mainland and the British Columbia Legislature gave formal assent on March 1, 1963, for the establishment of the university in Burnaby. The university was named after Simon Fraser, a North West Company fur trader and explorer. The original name of the school was Fraser University, but was changed because the initials &quot;FU&quot; evoked the profane phrase &quot;fuck you&quot;. In May of the same year, Gordon M. Shrum was appointed as the university&#x27;s first chancellor. From a variety of sites that were offered, Shrum recommended to the provincial government that the summit of Burnaby Mountain, 365 meters above sea level, be chosen for the new university. Architects Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey won a competition to design the university, and construction began in the spring of 1964. The campus faces northwest over Burrard Inlet. Eighteen months later, on September 9, 1965, the university began its first semester with 2,500 students.

The campus was noted in the 1960s and early 1970s as a hotbed of political activism, culminating in a crisis in the Department of Political Science, Sociology, and Anthropology in a dispute involving ideological differences among faculty. The resolution to the crisis included the dismantling of the department into today&#x27;s separate departments. During this time, Thelma Finlayson became the university&#x27;s first female faculty member in the Department of Biological Sciences. She would later become their first professor emerita upon her retirement in 1979.

===21st century===
In 2007, the university began offering dual and double degree programs by partnering with international universities, such as a dual computing-science degree through partnership with Zhejiang University in China and a double Bachelor of Arts degree in conjunction with Australia&#x27;s Monash University. It has also partnered with India&#x27;s Premiere &quot;Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay&quot;.

In 2009, SFU became the first Canadian university to be accepted into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Starting in the 2011–2012 season, SFU competed in the NCAA&#x27;s Division II Great Northwest Athletic Conference (GNAC) and has now transitioned all 19 Simon Fraser teams into the NCAA.

On September 9, 2015, SFU celebrated its 50th anniversary. Over its 50 years, the university educated over 130,000 graduates.

A breach of SFU&#x27;s systems in February 2020 exposed the records of 250,000 students. A second attack in February 2021 resulted in the exposure of 200,000 records. A class action lawsuit was filed against SFU in March 2021.

In early 2022, Burnaby City Council announced they would officially support the SFU Gondola as part of the TransLink expansion project. This is included in the Mayors’ Council’s approval of the Transport 2050 regional transportation strategy announcement.

In early 2025, SFU&#x27;s School of Interactive Arts and Technology debuted their Virtual Ambassador Program, hailed as &quot;the world&#x27;s first official university VTubers&quot;.

==Campuses==

Simon Fraser University has three campuses, each located in different parts of Greater Vancouver. SFU&#x27;s original campus is located in Burnaby, atop Burnaby Mountain. The Vancouver campus consists of multiple buildings in downtown Vancouver and the Surrey campus is located inside Central City.

The downtown campus has expanded to include several other buildings in recent years, including the Segal Graduate School of Business. In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts moved into the Woodward&#x27;s redevelopment, known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts.

SFU&#x27;s three campuses are all accessible by public transit. The Vancouver campus is a block away from the Waterfront SkyTrain station while the Surrey campus is adjacent to the Surrey Central SkyTrain station. The Burnaby campus is linked to the Production Way–University, Burquitlam, and Sperling–Burnaby Lake SkyTrain stations by frequent shuttle bus service.
===Burnaby campus===

The main campus is located atop Burnaby Mountain, on Traditional Coast Salish Lands, including the Tsleil-Waututh (səl̓ilw̓ətaɬ), Kwikwetlem (kʷikʷəƛ̓əm), Squamish (Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw) and Musqueam (xʷməθkʷəy̓əm) Nations. The campus is at an elevation of 365 metres, overlooking the Burrard inlet to the north. All major departments in the university are housed at the Burnaby campus. The library on the main campus is called the W. A. C. Bennett Library, named after the Social Credit Premier of B.C. who established it. The campus also has two gym complexes, named the Lorne-Davies Complex and Chancellor&#x27;s Gym. An international-sized swimming pool is located within the Lorne-Davies Complex. Since the School of Contemporary Arts relocation to the Woodward&#x27;s location, the Burnaby campus production theatre has been vacant. Located within the heart of the campus are the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and three art galleries. The campus has been awarded numerous architectural awards over the years, including the gold medal for Lieutenant-Governor 2009 Awards in Architecture and the 2007 Royal Architectural Institute of Canada&#x27;s Prix du XXe siècle.

The Burnaby campus is composed of a vast complex of interconnected buildings spanning across of land on Burnaby Mountain, from the eastern end of the campus to the western side, where the UniverCity urban village is located. The campus consists of the following buildings:

* West Mall Complex (WMC)
* Lorne Davies Gym Complex
* Chancellor&#x27;s Gym Complex
* Convocation Mall
* W. A. C. Bennett Library
* Halpern Centre
* Maggie Benston Centre (MBC)
* SFU Theatre
* Gym, Pool, Fitness Centre
* Robert C. Brown Hall (RCB)
* Academic Quadrangle (AQ)
* Shrum Science Centre (SSC)
** SSC Biology (B)
** SSC Biomedical Physiology and Kinesiology (K)
** SSC Chemistry (C)
** SSC Physics (P)
* South Science Building (SSB)
* Applied Sciences Building (ASB)
* Education Building (EB)
* Technology and Science Complex (TASC) I
* Technology and Science Complex (TASC) II
** 4D LABS
* Blusson Hall (BLU)
* Saywell Hall (ASSC)
* Strand Hall
* Trottier Observatory and Science Courtyard

Due to the contemporary Brutalist architecture of the Burnaby Mountain campus, many buildings, including the WAC Bennett Library and Academic Quadrangle have been used for location shots in various films and television programmes over the years.

====Library, archives, museums and galleries====
Each campus has its own library, the largest of which is the W.A.C. Bennett Library based on the SFU Burnaby campus, which holds over 2.7 million print and microform volumes.

SFU also has a Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, which holds many exhibits created by students as part of the museum studies courses offered in the Department of Archaeology. Archaeological collections arising from excavations and other research by faculty, staff and students are housed in the museum. Several large wooden sculptures (&#x27;totem&#x27;) poles from the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria represent the major art traditions of the indigenous coastal peoples of British Columbia.

==== Residences ====

The SFU Burnaby campus provides residence to 1766 SFU and FIC students in six different areas, all located on the western side of the campus.

* The Towers (officially opened in fall of 2004) are three dormitory-style buildings. One of the Towers features a 14-room hotel called &quot;The Simon Hotel&quot;.
* McTaggart-Cowan Hall (built in 1985), a traditional-style dormitory building.
* Shell House (built in 1967), traditional-style dormitory building.
* The Townhouse Complex (built in 1993) are 3-level townhouse units accommodating up to 4 students per unit. There are a total of 99 units.
* Hamilton Hall (built in 1993 and renovated in 2009) is a studio-style building for graduate students.
* Louis Riel House (built in 1969 and closed in 2015) was an apartment-style building (unfurnished) used for family and graduate housing. Although the residents tried to prevent the building&#x27;s closure, it officially closed in September 2015, due to mould problems.
==== UniverCity ====

UniverCity is an urban community located on top of Burnaby Mountain, adjacent to Simon Fraser University. It has won several awards for sustainable planning and development. Envisioned in 1963 by Arthur Erickson and Geoffrey Massey, the area adjacent to the university was not officially rezoned for development until 30 years later. Development of the community began in early 2000, when Simon Fraser University commenced construction on a new residential and commercial area occupying approximately adjacent to the campus. , approximately 3000 people live in UniverCity. The main commercial district on University High Street now houses restaurants, stores, and a 20,000 square foot Nester&#x27;s Market. A new elementary school, University Highlands Elementary, opened on September 1, 2010. Several new residential developments are currently in progress, including the construction of a 12-storey high rise in the heart of UniverCity.

=== Surrey campus ===

The Surrey campus consists of two buildings located in Whalley / City Centre, Surrey. The main building is part of Central City, an architectural complex adjacent to the Surrey Central SkyTrain station. It was established in 2002 to absorb the students and programs of the former Technical University of British Columbia, which was closed by the provincial government. It has since expanded to house the Surrey operations of other SFU programs. The Central City complex that houses the campus was designed by architect Bing Thom and opened in 2006. The Fraser Library, a branch of the SFU Library, is located at the second floor on this campus and is the only branch with a games room, where arcade games and console games are available. It also loans equipment to students in the School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) , also located on the Surrey Campus. SIAT facilities include a prototyping lab, editing suites, and a motion capture studio, the latter of which became the facility from which the Virtual Ambassador program is run.

A separate five-floor building opened on April 25, 2019, across the street from the existing Central City complex. The building is LEED Gold certified and mainly houses the Sustainability Energy Engineering (SEE) program and supports 440 full-time students with engineering labs, computer labs, classrooms, lecture halls and office spaces.

=== Vancouver campus ===

The Vancouver campus was launched in the 1980s with a storefront classroom. It was the first urban university classroom in British Columbia. A significant portion of funding for the building of the campus came from the private sector. The Vancouver campus has eight buildings spread across the downtown core: SFU Harbour Centre, the Morris J. Wosk Centre for Dialogue, the Segal Graduate School of Business, SFU Contemporary Arts at the restored Woodward&#x27;s Building, SFU Charles Chang Innovation Centre, SFU Vancity Office of Community Engagement at 312 Main, SFU VentureLabs, SFU Collection at Bill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art, and SFU Contemporary Arts at 611 Alexander Visual Arts Studio. The original campus building at Harbour Centre, a rebuilt heritage department store, officially opened on May 5, 1989. Today, the entire campus serves more than 70,000 people annually. Approximately 10,000 are graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in courses and degree programs based downtown. The Belzberg Library is based at the Vancouver campus. 

In September 2010, SFU Contemporary Arts relocated to the historic Woodward&#x27;s district in downtown Vancouver known as the Goldcorp Centre for the Arts. The SFU facility is part of the Woodward&#x27;s revitalization project. The new facility accommodates the increasing enrolment of students in the programme and new cultural facilities, including the Fei and Milton Wong Experimental theatre, screening rooms, sound studios, and art galleries.

* Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences
* Beedie School of Business
* Faculty of Communication, Art and Technology
* Faculty of Education
* Faculty of Environment
* Faculty of Health Sciences
* Faculty of Science
===Undergraduate===
In the Fall 2021 semester, SFU had 25,595 undergraduates, with 12,812 of them being full-time and 12,783 part-time. International students made up 21% of the undergraduate student body, of which over 85% came from Asia, the highest proportion being from China at 43%. SFU&#x27;s undergraduate student union is known as the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS).

===Graduate===
The university enrolled 4,701 graduate students in the Fall 2021 semester, with international students constituting 32% of the graduate student population. A Graduate Student Society supports and advocates for graduate students at the university.

===Continuing education===
SFU also offers non-credit programs and courses to adult students. , SFU Continuing Studies offers more than 300 courses and 27 certificate and diploma programs, mostly delivered either online or part-time from SFU&#x27;s downtown Vancouver or Surrey campus. Continuing Studies also manages a part-time degree completion program, called SFU NOW: Nights or Weekends, for working adults pursuing a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

===Staff unions===

Teaching assistants, tutor markers, sessional instructors, language instructors, Graduate Facilitators and Research Assistants at SFU are unionized. The union, the Teaching Support Staff Union (TSSU), is independent. Faculty and lecturers are members of the Faculty Association. Staff are members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the Administrative and Professional Staff Association (APSA), or Polyparty. A few positions at the university, such as some in Human Resources and senior administrative positions, fall outside the five associations or unions above.

Under the previous president, Andrew Petter, SFU&#x27;s administration has incurred a number of grievances and bad faith bargaining judgments. During their most recent rounds of bargaining, both the TSSU and CUPE local 3338 resorted to job action, and the BC Labour Relations Board found SFU&#x27;s administration to be bargaining in bad faith with the CUPE local. Conflicts since then include unpaid wages (in Fall 2013, 18% of TSSU members reported that they were not paid on the first payday; by the term&#x27;s third payday, some members still had not received their wages), and a health plan, redundant with the provincial health plan available to all international students after their first three months in-province and costing double a prior plan&#x27;s cost, in which international students are automatically enrolled.

===Rankings and reputation===
Simon Fraser University has placed in various international post-secondary school rankings. In the 2022 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; rankings, the university ranked 301–400 in the world and 13–17 in Canada.

In University Ranking by Academic Performance&#x27;s 2018–19 rankings, the university placed 362nd in the world, and 15th in Canada.

SFU also works with other universities and agencies to operate joint research facilities. These include Bamfield Marine Station, a major centre for teaching and research in marine biology; TRIUMF, a powerful cyclotron used in subatomic physics and chemistry research. SFU is also a partner institution in Great Northern Way Campus Ltd in Vancouver. In March 2006, SFU approved an affiliation agreement with a private college for international students to be housed adjacent to its Burnaby campus. This new college named Fraser International College, which was in the Multi Tenant Facility (now renamed as &quot;Discovery 2 Building&quot;) located in Discovery Parks Trust SFU site, is now moved into &quot;Discovery 1 Building&quot; after Discovery Parks Trust returned the building to Simon Fraser University. The MODAL Research Group, based at Simon Fraser, partners with multiple Canadian universities and arts organizations to carry out multi-disciplinary research in the arts with an emphasis on the study of artistic learning and engagement.

In 2008, SFU has the highest publication impact among Canadian comprehensive universities and the highest success rates per faculty member in competitions for federal research council funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). 

In 2017, Simon Fraser University entered into an agreement with Huawei to receive cloud computing equipment.

In 2022, Simon Fraser University announced the creation of the cross-disciplinary Institute of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology (INN) research hub to empower neuroscience-related research and collaboration across the university.

==Student life==
The student newspaper &quot;The Peak&quot; was established shortly after the university opened and is circulated throughout the university. CJSF 90.1 FM has been SFU&#x27;s campus community radio station since the early 1970s. The Simon Fraser Student Society provides funding for over 300 campus clubs.

== Athletics ==
The university&#x27;s varsity sports teams are called the Simon Fraser Red Leafs, and the mascot is a Scottish Terrier named McFogg the Dog. In sports and other competitions, there tends to be a strong rivalry between SFU and The University of British Columbia.

The team is the first and currently the only athletic program from outside of the United States that competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Before joining the NCAA, the team used to compete in both the Canadian Interuniversity Sports (CIS, now U Sports) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). In total, SFU has 15 varsity sport teams and 300 athletes. All varsity teams compete for their respective NCAA national championships, except for the Women&#x27;s Wrestling team which competes for the National Collegiate Women&#x27;s Wrestling Championship (www.ncwwc.com).

Beside the varsity teams, SFU also houses various competitive club teams, including Men&#x27;s Lacrosse, who currently competes in the Men&#x27;s Collegiate Lacrosse Association, and Men&#x27;s Hockey, who currently competes in the British Columbia Intercollegiate Hockey League. Other club teams include rugby, cheerleading, rowing, quidditch, and field hockey.

SFU has won the NAIA NACDA Director&#x27;s Cup five times, among others. On Friday, July 10, 2009, the NCAA announced that it had accepted SFU as a Division II member and would begin after a two-year transition period. SFU later competed in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference. It is the first Canadian university to be accepted as a member of the NCAA at any level. In 2012, the team was accepted as the first international full member of the NCAA.

Many former team athletes later represented Canada during the Olympic Games, including gold medalists Carol Huynh and Daniel Igali, and Olympic medalists Sue Holloway and Hugh Fisher. Other team alumni include: Jay Triano, Chris Rinke, wrestler Ari Taub, and Carolyn Murray.

==Virtual Ambassadors==
In August 2024, the university&#x27;s School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT) announced an initiative in partnership with Sawmill Studios to create its first-ever &quot;Virtual Ambassadors&quot; in order to represent and engage with the SFU community. These Virtual Ambassadors, both livestreamers, would be functionally identical to VTubers. Auditions for the talent opened that September. Composed of two virtual mascots, Mo Ayato (操斗モォ) and Faye Ayato (操斗フェイ), the duo were set to debut on March 1st, 2025, and would livestream both separately and together on the SIAT YouTube channel. Their primary activities involved giving feedback to student work from the SIAT program, as well as promoting the SFU&#x27;s values, courses, and facilities. The initiative was billed as grant-funded research, employing motion capture technology to create full 3D models of the Virtual Ambassadors and a chance for students to work in a professional motion capture studio environment. 

In promotional material, the university has referred to the duo as &quot;Canada&#x27;s first university Vtubers&quot;, or alternatively, &quot;The world&#x27;s first university Vtubers&quot;. The characters were said to have come from a magical fantasy world to SFU in order to study at SIAT. Mo Ayato was characterised as &quot;formerly a magical red panda-esque beast known as a Cappu, is now a carefree and silly human(?).&quot; . On the other hand, Faye Ayato was said to be &quot;a graduate studies student before he leapt through the portal, unfortunately, his course credits did not follow him to Earth.&quot; An animated trailer would expand on this backstory, showing Faye opening a portal to Earth and the two fleeing their homeland, where they suffered discrimination from a system that favoured those with magic powers over those without. Arriving inside of SFU Surrey&#x27;s motion capture studio, Studio SIAT, the trailer shows Mo transforming from her Cappu form into her human one, after which the two would take on the name &quot;Ayato&quot; from a mispronunciation of the &quot;IAT&quot; and &quot;o&quot; in &quot;Studi&quot;o&quot; S&quot;IAT&quot;&quot;. 

=== Promotional Campaign ===
On January 24th, 2025, an Alternate Reality Game launched on the SIAT website, with a video being embedded to the page in which the yet-to-be-revealed Faye Ayato encourages viewers to help him &quot;open a portal connecting your world to mine&quot;. Posters with QR codes linking to further videos would be shared online through Discord communities such as the SFU, UBC, and ECUAD Anime Clubs, as well as in-person, with QR codes on pawprint-shaped cutouts being posted around SFU&#x27;s Surrey Campus. Posters that were shared online would also feature an illustration of the tops of the Virtual Ambassador&#x27;s heads, giving the world its first look at the new mascots.

On February 23rd, 2025, a teaser trailer was released on the Studio SIAT YouTube channel, revealing full-body images of Mo and Faye Ayato for the first time. An &quot;Animated Lore Trailer&quot; was released on Youtube and promoted on SFU&#x27;s website two days later, on February 25th, 2025. The trailer was a collaboration between both SIAT students and university students from across Canada, with J Tseng and Trisha Wong, both staff at SFU SIAT and Narratic Labs, producing and directing respectively. Tseng stated in a Reddit post how the team was comprised of mostly junior animators, with Wong adding that the main inspiration for the trailer was the work of Makoto Shinkai. Simultaneously, the SFU website was updated with a section to prominently feature the virtual ambassadors, introducing Mo and Faye Ayato with a series of illustrations showing them interacting with various SIAT facilities. The illustrations were also created entirely by Canadian university students. Alongside the two Virtual Ambassadors, a third red panda-like character called a Cappu was also introduced. On February 27th, a third video was released on the Studio SIAT Youtube Channel, revealing key art for the characters and employing motion graphics featuring the pre-existing illustrations of Mo and Faye, introducing more of their personalities.

=== Reception ===
Reactions to the Virtual Ambassadors were mostly positive, with commenters on the Animated Lore Trailer praising the fluidity of the animation and background illustration, and affirming the comparison to Shinkai. Enthusiasm was also expressed about the personalities of the Virtual Ambassadors. SFU&#x27;s official news page praised the trailer, calling it &quot;stunning&quot;. Other reactions were mixed, with some commenters remarking that they believed the Virtual Ambassador Program was a waste of tuition money. Art director Trisha Wong corrected some of these claims, stating that the project was &quot;funded by external grants specifically for giving student artists the opportunity to work on professional client work and entrepreneurial experience&quot;.

==Notable alumni==

==Arms==
The school&#x27;s original coat of arms was used from the university&#x27;s inception until 2006, at which point the Board of Governors voted to adapt the old coat of arms and thereby register a second coat of arms. The adaptation replaced two crosslets with books after some in the university asserted the crosses had misled prospective international students into believing SFU was a private, religious institution rather than a public, secular one. In 2007, the university decided to register both the old coat of arms and the revised coat of arms featuring the books. In 2007, a new marketing logo was unveiled, consisting of white letters on block red.

<text>In Norse mythology, Skírnir (Old Norse&quot; ; &quot;bright one&quot;) is the god Freyr&#x27;s messenger and vassal. He appears in both the Poetic and Prose Eddas.

== Attestations ==

=== &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; ===
In the Eddic poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;, Skírnir is sent as a messenger to Jötunheimr to conduct lovesick Freyr&#x27;s wooing of the giantess Gerðr on condition of being given Freyr&#x27;s powerful sword as a reward. Skírnir begins by offering Gerðr 11 golden apples (or apples of eternal life, in a common emendation), which Gerðr rejects, adding that she and Freyr will never be together as long as they live. He next offers Gerðr a ring that produces eight more gold rings every ninth night. Gerðr responds that she is not interested in the ring for she shares her father Gymir&#x27;s property, and he has no lack of gold.

Skírnir then turns to a series of threats. He first threatens to cut Gerðr&#x27;s head from her neck and then threatens her father&#x27;s life. He next tells Gerðr that she will sit on an eagle&#x27;s mound, looking outward to the world, facing Hel, and that food will become hateful to her. He then says he will turn her into a spectacle, that she will experience madness, and become overwhelmed with unbearable desire. She will weep rather than feel joy, and she will live the rest of her life in misery with a three-headed thurs or otherwise be without a man altogether.

Skírnir tells Gerðr that he has been to a wood to get a &quot;gambanteinn&quot;, which he wields and declares that the gods Odin and Thor are angry with Gerðr, and that Freyr will hate her. He tells her that the thurs&#x27;s name who will own her below the gates of Nágrind is Hrímgrímnir and that there, at the roots of the world, the finest thing Gerðr will be given to drink is goat urine. He carves a series of runes perhaps symbolizing sickness, lewdness, frenzy, and unbearable desire, and comments that if he wishes he can rub them off just as he has carved them.

Gerðr responds by telling to Skírnir to take a crystal cup containing ancient mead, noting that she thought she would never love one of the Vanir, which indicates her intention to go with him. Skírnir asks her when she will meet with Freyr. She says that they will meet at a tranquil location called Barri, and that after nine nights she will there grant Freyr her love.

Skírnir rides back to Ásgarðr. Standing outside, Freyr immediately greets Skírnir and asks for news. Skírnir tells him that Gerðr will meet him at Barri. Freyr, impatient, comments that one night is long, as is two nights, and questions how he will bear three.

=== &quot;Prose Edda&quot; ===
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, Skírnir also performs favors for Oðinn, father of the gods. After the vicious wolf Fenrir evades capture, Skirnir visits the mountain dwarves, known for their mining and smithing. Together they forge the magical restraint Gleipnir for the purpose of binding the wolf. Such undertakings mark Skirnir as a crafty servant. &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; also retells the narrative of &quot;Skírnismál&quot; in prose, quoting from the poem and placing great emphasis on Freyr giving his sword to Skírnir. Later in the text, the narrator explains that Freyr&#x27;s death at Ragnarök is the result of having lost his sword.

== Modern influence ==
Skírnir appears in several works of modern literature inspired by the Eddic poem &quot;Skírnismál&quot;. This includes a major part of the Danish poet Adam Gottlob Oehlenschläger&#x27;s &quot;Nordens Guder&quot; (1819) as well as Icelandic poet Gerður Kristný&#x27;s &quot;Blóðhófnir&quot; (2010), a feminist retelling of &quot;Skírnismál&quot; that won the 2010 Icelandic Literary Prize for fiction.

The Skirnir Mountains, a group of nunataks along the King Frederick VI Coast in the Sermersooq municipality of southeast Greenland also take their name from Skírnir.

<text>&quot;Suprême&quot; sauce () is a classic and popular &quot;daughter sauce&quot; of French cuisine. It consists of velouté, a &quot;mother sauce&quot;, thickened with cream and strained.

==Recipes==
According the &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot;, a seminal work of French &quot;haute cuisine&quot;, first published in 1938, &quot;suprême&quot; sauce is made from the mother sauce &quot;velouté&quot; (white stock thickened with a white roux—in the case of &quot;suprême&quot; sauce, chicken stock is usually preferred), reduced with heavy cream or &quot;crème fraîche&quot;, and then strained through a fine sieve.

A light squeeze of lemon juice is commonly added. In many cases, chefs also choose to add finely chopped and lightly sautéed mushrooms to the dish, although this was not specifically mentioned in &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot; or by Auguste Escoffier, the &quot;Emperor of the World&#x27;s Kitchens&quot;, who was an arbiter of classic French cuisine.

&quot;The Cook&#x27;s Decameron&quot; suggests the following recipe: the sauce is made by placing three-quarters of a pint (350ml) of white sauce into a saucepan, and when it is nearly boiling, adding half a cup (120 ml) of concentrated fowl stock. It should then be reduced until the sauce is quite thick, passed through a &quot;chinois&quot; strainer into a &quot;bain-marie&quot; and have added two tablespoons (30 ml) of cream.
