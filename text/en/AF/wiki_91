<text>Short Message Service, commonly abbreviated as SMS, is a text messaging service component of most telephone, Internet and mobile device systems. It uses standardized communication protocols that let mobile phones exchange short text messages, typically transmitted over cellular networks.

Developed as part of the GSM standards, and based on the SS7 signalling protocol, SMS rolled out on digital cellular networks starting in 1993 and was originally intended for customers to receive alerts from their carrier/operator. The service allows users to send and receive text messages of up to 160 characters, originally to and from GSM phones and later also CDMA and Digital AMPS; it has since been defined and supported on newer networks, including present-day 5G ones. Using SMS gateways, messages can be transmitted over the Internet through an SMSC, allowing communication to computers, fixed landlines, and satellite. MMS was later introduced as an upgrade to SMS with &quot;picture messaging&quot; capabilities.

In addition to recreational texting between people, SMS is also used for mobile marketing (a type of direct marketing), two-factor authentication logging-in, televoting, mobile banking (see SMS banking), and for other commercial content. The SMS standard has been hugely popular worldwide as a method of text communication: by the end of 2010, it was the most widely used data application with an estimated 3.5 billion active users, or about 80% of all mobile phone subscribers. More recently, SMS has become increasingly challenged by newer proprietary instant messaging services; RCS has been designated as the potential open standard successor to SMS.

== Developmental history ==
SMS technology originated from radio telegraphy in radio memo pagers that used standardized phone protocols. These were defined in 1986 as part of the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) series of standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSM 28/85&quot;&gt;GSM Doc 28/85 &quot;Services and Facilities to be provided in the GSM System&quot; rev2, June 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The first SMS message was sent on 3 December 1992, when Neil Papworth, a test engineer for Sema Group, sent &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; to the Orbitel 901 phone of colleague Richard Jarvis.

=== Initial concept ===

Adding text messaging functionality to mobile devices began in the early 1980s. The first action plan of the CEPT Group GSM was approved in December 1982, requesting that &quot;The services and facilities offered in the public switched telephone networks and public data networks ... should be available in the mobile system.&quot; This plan included the exchange of text messages either directly between mobile stations, or transmitted via message handling systems in use at that time.

The SMS concept was developed in the Franco-German GSM cooperation in 1984 by Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert. The GSM is optimized for telephony, since this was identified as its main application. The key idea for SMS was to use this telephone-optimized system, and to transport messages on the signalling paths needed to control the telephone traffic during periods when no signalling traffic existed. In this way, unused resources in the system could be used to transport messages at minimal cost. However, it was necessary to limit the length of the messages to 128 bytes (later improved to 160 seven-bit characters) so that the messages could fit into the existing signalling formats. Based on his personal observations and on analysis of the typical lengths of postcard and Telex messages, Hillebrand argued that 160 characters was sufficient for most brief communications.

SMS could be implemented in every mobile station by updating its software. Hence, a large base of SMS-capable terminals and networks existed when people began to use SMS. A new network element required was a specialized short message service centre, and enhancements were required to the radio capacity and network transport infrastructure to accommodate growing SMS traffic.

=== Early development ===
The technical development of SMS was a multinational collaboration supporting the framework of standards bodies. Through these organizations the technology was made freely available to the whole world.

The first proposal which initiated the development of SMS was made by a contribution of Germany and France in the GSM group meeting in February 1985 in Oslo. This proposal was further elaborated in GSM subgroup WP1 Services (Chairman Martine Alvernhe, France Telecom) based on a contribution from Germany. There were also initial discussions in the subgroup WP3 network aspects chaired by Jan Audestad (Telenor). The result was approved by the main GSM group in a June 1985 document which was distributed to industry. The input documents on SMS had been prepared by Friedhelm Hillebrand of Deutsche Telekom, with contributions from Bernard Ghillebaert of France Télécom. The definition that Friedhelm Hillebrand and Bernard Ghillebaert brought into GSM called for the provision of a message transmission service of alphanumeric messages to mobile users &quot;with acknowledgement capabilities&quot;. The last three words transformed SMS into something much more useful than the electronic paging services used at the time that some in GSM might have had in mind.

SMS was considered in the main GSM group as a possible service for the new digital cellular system. In GSM document &quot;Services and Facilities to be provided in the GSM System,&quot; both mobile-originated and mobile-terminated short messages appear on the table of GSM teleservices.

The discussions on the GSM services were concluded in the recommendation GSM 02.03 &quot;TeleServices supported by a GSM PLMN.&quot; Here a rudimentary description of the three services was given:

# Short message mobile-terminated (SMS-MT)/ Point-to-Point: the ability of a network to transmit a Short Message to a mobile phone. The message can be sent by phone or by a software application.
# Short message mobile-originated (SMS-MO)/ Point-to-Point: the ability of a network to transmit a Short Message sent by a mobile phone. The message can be sent to a phone or to a software application.
# Short message cell broadcast.

The material elaborated in GSM and its WP1 subgroup was handed over in Spring 1987 to a new GSM body called IDEG (the Implementation of Data and Telematic Services Experts Group), which had its kickoff in May 1987 under the chairmanship of Friedhelm Hillebrand (German Telecom). The technical standard known today was largely created by IDEG (later WP4) as the two recommendations GSM 03.40 (the two point-to-point services merged) and GSM 03.41 (cell broadcast).

WP4 created a Drafting Group Message Handling (DGMH), which was responsible for the specification of SMS. Finn Trosby of Telenor chaired the draft group through its first three years, in which the design of SMS was established. DGMH had five to eight participants, and Finn Trosby mentions as major contributors Kevin Holley, Eija Altonen, Didier Luizard and Alan Cox. The first action plan mentions for the first time the Technical Specification 03.40 &quot;Technical Realisation of the Short Message Service&quot;. Responsible editor was Finn Trosby. The first and very rudimentary draft of the technical specification was completed in November 1987. However, drafts useful for the manufacturers followed at a later stage in the period. A comprehensive description of the work in this period is given in.

The work on the draft specification continued in the following few years, where Kevin Holley of Cellnet (now Telefónica O2 UK) played a leading role. Besides the completion of the main specification GSM 03.40, the detailed protocol specifications on the system interfaces also needed to be completed.

=== Early implementations ===
The first SMS message was sent over the Vodafone GSM network in the United Kingdom on 3 December 1992, from Neil Papworth of Sema Group (now Mavenir Systems) using a personal computer to Richard Jarvis of Vodafone using an Orbitel 901 handset. The text of the message was &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot;

The first commercial deployment of a short message service center (SMSC) was by Aldiscon part of Logica (now part of CGI) with Telia (now TeliaSonera) in Sweden in 1993, followed by Fleet Call (now Nextel) in the US, Telenor in Norway and BT Cellnet (now O2 UK) later in 1993. All first installations of SMS gateways were for network notifications sent to mobile phones, usually to inform of voice mail messages.

The first commercially sold SMS service was offered to consumers, as a person-to-person text messaging service by Radiolinja (now part of Elisa) in Finland in 1993. Most early GSM mobile phone handsets did not support the ability to send SMS text messages, and Nokia was the only handset manufacturer whose total GSM phone line in 1993 supported user-sending of SMS text messages. According to Matti Makkonen, an engineer at Nokia at the time, the Nokia 2010, which was released in January 1994, was the first mobile phone to support composing SMSes easily.

=== Growth and adoption ===
Initial growth was slow, with customers in 1995 sending on average only 0.4 messages per GSM customer per month. Initially, networks in the UK only allowed customers to send messages to other users on the same network, limiting the usefulness of the service. This restriction was lifted in 1999. Over time, this issue was eliminated by switch billing instead of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it. By the end of 2000, the average number of messages reached 35 per user per month, and on Christmas Day 2006, over 205 million messages were sent in the UK alone. SMS had become a social phenomenon in Finland among teens and youngsters by 1999. SMS traffic across Europe reached 4 billion messages as of January 2000.

It had become extremely popular in the Philippines by 2001 and the country was dubbed the &quot;texting capital of the world&quot;, partly helped by large numbers of free text messages offered by the mobile operators in monthly subscriptions. SMS adoption was limited to parts of Europe and Asia during these earlier years, with U.S. adoption being low partly due to incompatible networks and cheap voice calls relative to other countries. &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote in 2003, as noted by an analyst:

This is also backed by the fact that as of 2003, American internet users were spending on average five times more time online than Europeans, and many poorer countries in Europe and other regions around the world had significantly lower rates of internet access compared to the United States at the time (see digital divide), hence making SMS more accessible.

== Contemporary usage ==

SMS has become a large commercial industry, earning $114.6 billion globally in 2010. In the year 2002, 366 billion SMS text messages were sent globally, a number that rose to 6.1 trillion (6.1 × 1012) in 2010, which is an average of 193,000 messages per second. The global average price for an SMS message is US$0.11, while mobile networks charge each other interconnect fees of at least US$0.04 when connecting between different phone networks. In 2015, the actual cost of sending an SMS in Australia was found to be $0.00016 per SMS. The global SMS messaging business was estimated to be worth over US$240 billion in 2013, accounting for almost half of all revenue generated by mobile messaging.

The popularity of SMS also led to the spontaneous creation of the so-called &#x27;SMS language&#x27; phenomenon, where words are shortened in order to deal with the 160 character limit of SMS messages. Usage of SMS for mobile data services became increasingly prominent in the early 2000s due to its ubiquity, reliability, and cold reception of the newer WAP standard. (see &quot;Premium-rated services&quot; below). In the early and mid 2000s, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) was developed as an improved version of SMS that supports sending of pictures and video.

SMS has been increasingly challenged by Internet Protocol-based messaging services with additional features for modern mobile devices, such as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Telegram, or WeChat. These services run independently from mobile network operators and typically don&#x27;t provide cross-platform messaging capabilities like SMS or email does. For example, between 2010 and 2022, SMS telecom revenue in India dropped 94 percent, while &quot;revenue share per user from data usage...grew over 10 times.&quot;, although in some regions such as North America SMS continues to be used by over 80 percent of the population as of 2023. In order to create a modern successor to SMS that isn&#x27;t run by a single company and is fully interoperable between devices, industry figures have created the RCS &#x27;Universal Profile&#x27; initiative. It was supported by Apple when iOS 18 came out in 2024, which will mean that virtually all new mobile phones (iOS and Android platforms) will have RCS texting capabilities, though this may also depend on if the network operator supports it.

=== Premium-rated services ===
SMS may be used to provide premium rate services to subscribers of a network. Mobile-terminated short messages can be used to deliver digital content such as news alerts, financial information, logos, and ringtones. The first premium-rate media content delivered via the SMS system was the world&#x27;s first paid downloadable ringing tones, as commercially launched by Saunalahti (later Jippii Group, now part of Elisa Group), in 1998. Initially, only Nokia branded phones could handle them. By 2002 the ringtone business globally had exceeded $1 billion of service revenues, and nearly US$5 billion by 2008. Today, they are also used to pay smaller payments online—for example, for file-sharing services, in mobile application stores, or VIP section entrance. Outside the online world, one can buy a bus ticket or beverages from ATM, pay a parking ticket, order a store catalog or some goods (e.g., discount movie DVDs), make a donation to charity, and much more.

=== Other uses ===
Additionally, an intermediary service can facilitate a text-to-voice conversion to be sent to landlines.

In 2014, Caktus Group developed the world&#x27;s first SMS-based voter registration system in Libya. As of February 2015 more than 1.5 million people have registered using that system, providing Libyan voters with unprecedented access to the democratic process.

&quot;SMS enablement&quot; allows individuals to send an SMS message to a business phone number (traditional landline) and receive a SMS in return. Providing customers with the ability to text to a phone number allows organizations to offer new services that deliver value. Examples include chat bots, and text enabled customer service and call centers.

==== Flash SMS ====
A Flash SMS is a type of SMS that appears directly on the main screen without user interaction and is not automatically stored in the inbox. It can be useful in emergencies, such as a fire alarm or cases of confidentiality, as in delivering one-time passwords.

==== Silent SMS ====
In 2010, almost half a million silent SMS messages were sent by the German federal police, customs and the federal domestic intelligence service Verfassungsschutz. These silent messages, also known as silent TMS, stealth SMS, stealth ping or Short Message Type 0, are used to locate a person and thus to create a complete movement profile. They do not show up on a display, nor trigger any acoustical signal when received. Their primary purpose was to deliver special services of the network operator to any cell phone.

==== SMS bombs ====
In March 2001, Dutch police in Amsterdam attempted to fight increasing cell phone theft by sending an SMS every three minutes to a phone that has been reported stolen, with the message &quot;This handset was nicked, buying or selling is a crime. The police.&quot;

=== Text messaging outside GSM ===
SMS was originally designed as part of GSM, but is now available on a wide range of networks globally, including 3G, 4G and 5G networks. However, not all text messaging systems use SMS, and some notable alternative implementations of the concept include J-Phone&#x27;s &quot;SkyMail&quot; and NTT Docomo&#x27;s &quot;Short Mail&quot;, both in Japan. Email messaging from phones, as popularized by NTT Docomo&#x27;s i-mode and the RIM BlackBerry, also typically uses standard mail protocols such as SMTP over TCP/IP.

== Technical details ==

=== GSM ===

The &quot;Short Message Service—Point to Point (SMS-PP)&quot;—was originally defined in GSM recommendation 03.40, which is now maintained in 3GPP as TS 23.040. GSM 03.41 (now 3GPP TS 23.041) defines the &quot;Short Message Service—Cell Broadcast (SMS-CB)&quot;, which allows messages (advertising, public information, etc.) to be broadcast to all mobile users in a specified geographical area. Cell broadcast is the technology behind Wireless Emergency Alerts in the US which is used for public safety messages and AMBER alerts, and similar public safety messages in other countries. These messages are similar to SMS messages.

Messages are sent to a short message service center (SMSC), which provides a &quot;store and forward&quot; mechanism. It attempts to send messages to the SMSC&#x27;s recipients. If a recipient is not reachable, the SMSC queues the message for later retry. Some SMSCs also provide a &quot;forward and forget&quot; option where transmission is tried only once. Both mobile terminated (MT, for messages sent &quot;to&quot; a mobile handset) and mobile originating (MO, for those sent &quot;from&quot; the mobile handset) operations are supported. Message delivery is &quot;best effort&quot;, so there are no guarantees that a message will actually be delivered to its recipient, but delay or complete loss of a message is uncommon, typically affecting less than 5 percent of messages. Some providers allow users to request delivery reports, either via the SMS settings of most modern phones, or by prefixing each message with *0# or *N#. However, the exact meaning of confirmations varies from reaching the network, to being queued for sending, to being sent, to receiving a confirmation of receipt from the target device, and users are often not informed of the specific type of success being reported.

SMS is a stateless communication protocol in which every SMS message is considered entirely independent of other messages. Enterprise applications using SMS as a communication channel for stateful dialogue (where an MO reply message is paired to a specific MT message) requires that session management be maintained external to the protocol.

=== Message size ===
Transmission of short messages between the SMSC and the handset is done whenever using the Mobile Application Part (MAP) of the SS7 protocol. Messages are sent with the MAP MO- and MT-ForwardSM operations, whose payload length is limited by the constraints of the signaling protocol to precisely 140 bytes (140 bytes × 8 bits / byte = 1120 bits).

Short messages can be encoded using a variety of alphabets: the default GSM 7-bit alphabet, the 8-bit data alphabet, and the 16-bit UCS-2 or UTF-16 alphabets. Depending on which alphabet the subscriber has configured in the handset, this leads to the maximum individual short message sizes of 160 7-bit characters, 140 8-bit characters, or 70 16-bit characters. GSM 7-bit alphabet support is mandatory for GSM handsets and network elements, but characters in languages such as Hindi, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, or Cyrillic alphabet languages (e.g., Russian, Ukrainian, Serbian, Bulgarian, etc.) must be encoded using the 16-bit UCS-2 character encoding (see Unicode). Routing data and other metadata is additional to the payload size.

Larger content (concatenated SMS, multipart or segmented SMS, or &quot;long SMS&quot;) can be sent using multiple messages, in which case each message will start with a User Data Header (UDH) containing segmentation information. Since UDH is part of the payload, the number of available characters per segment is lower: 153 for 7-bit encoding, 134 for 8-bit encoding and 67 for 16-bit encoding. The receiving handset is then responsible for reassembling the message and presenting it to the user as one long message. While the standard theoretically permits up to 255 segments, 10 segments is the practical maximum with some carriers, and long messages are often billed as equivalent to multiple SMS messages. In some cases 127 segments are supported, but software limitations in some SMS applications do not permit this. Some providers have offered length-oriented pricing schemes for messages, although that type of pricing structure is rapidly disappearing.

=== Gateway providers ===
SMS gateway providers facilitate SMS traffic between businesses and mobile subscribers, including SMS for enterprises, content delivery, and entertainment services involving SMS, e.g. TV voting. Considering SMS messaging performance and cost, as well as the level of messaging services, SMS gateway providers can be classified as aggregators or SS7 providers.

The aggregator model is based on multiple agreements with mobile carriers to exchange two-way SMS traffic into and out of the operator&#x27;s SMSC, also known as &quot;local termination model&quot;. Aggregators lack direct access into the SS7 protocol, which is the protocol where the SMS messages are exchanged. SMS messages are delivered to the operator&#x27;s SMSC, but not the subscriber&#x27;s handset; the SMSC takes care of further handling of the message through the SS7 network.

Another type of SMS gateway provider is based on SS7 connectivity to route SMS messages, also known as &quot;international termination model&quot;. The advantage of this model is the ability to route data directly through SS7, which gives the provider total control and visibility of the complete path during SMS routing. This means SMS messages can be sent directly to and from recipients without having to go through the SMSCs of other mobile operators. Therefore, it is possible to avoid delays and message losses, offering full delivery guarantees of messages and optimized routing. This model is particularly efficient when used in mission-critical messaging and SMS used in corporate communications. Moreover, these SMS gateway providers are providing branded SMS services with masking but after misuse of these gateways most countries&#x27; governments have taken serious steps to block these gateways.

=== Interconnectivity with other networks ===
Message Service Centers communicate with the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) or PSTN via Interworking and Gateway MSCs.

Subscriber-originated messages are transported from a handset to a service center, and may be destined for mobile users, subscribers on a fixed network, or Value-Added Service Providers (VASPs), also known as application-terminated. Subscriber-terminated messages are transported from the service center to the destination handset, and may originate from mobile users, from fixed network subscribers, or from other sources such as VASPs.

On some carriers non-subscribers can send messages to a subscriber&#x27;s phone using an Email-to-SMS gateway. Additionally, many carriers, including AT&amp;T Mobility, T-Mobile USA, Sprint, and Verizon Wireless, offer the ability to do this through their respective websites.

For example, an AT&amp;T subscriber whose phone number was 555-555-5555 would receive emails addressed to 5555555555@txt.att.net as text messages. Subscribers can easily reply to these SMS messages, and the SMS reply is sent back to the original email address. Sending email to SMS is free for the sender, but the recipient is subject to the standard delivery charges. Only the first 160 characters of an email message can be delivered to a phone, and only 160 characters can be sent from a phone. However, longer messages may be broken up into multiple texts, depending upon the telephone service provider.

Text-enabled fixed-line handsets are required to receive messages in text format. However, messages can be delivered to non enabled phones using text-to-speech conversion.

Short messages can send binary content such as ringtones or logos, as well as Over-the-air programming (OTA) or configuration data. Such uses are a vendor-specific extension of the GSM specification and there are multiple competing standards, although Nokia&#x27;s Smart Messaging is common.

SMS is used for M2M (Machine to Machine) communication. For instance, there is an LED display machine controlled by SMS, and some vehicle tracking companies use SMS for their data transport or telemetry needs. SMS usage for these purposes is slowly being superseded by GPRS services owing to their lower overall cost. GPRS is offered by smaller telco players as a route of sending SMS text to reduce the cost of SMS texting internationally.

=== Support in other architectures ===
The Mobile Application Part (MAP) of the SS7 protocol included support for the transport of Short Messages through the Core Network from its inception. MAP Phase 2 expanded support for SMS by introducing a separate operation code for Mobile Terminated Short Message transport. Since Phase 2, there have been no changes to the Short Message operation packages in MAP, although other operation packages have been enhanced to support CAMEL SMS control.

From 3GPP Releases 99 and 4 onwards, CAMEL Phase 3 introduced the ability for the Intelligent Network (IN) to control aspects of the Mobile Originated Short Message Service, while CAMEL Phase 4, as part of 3GPP Release 5 and onwards, provides the IN with the ability to control the Mobile Terminated service. CAMEL allows the gsmSCP to block the submission (MO) or delivery (MT) of Short Messages, route messages to destinations other than that specified by the user, and perform real-time billing for the use of the service. Prior to standardized CAMEL control of the Short Message Service, IN control relied on switch vendor specific extensions to the Intelligent Network Application Part (INAP) of SS7.

=== AT commands ===
Many mobile and satellite transceiver units support the sending and receiving of SMS using an extended version of the Hayes command set. The extensions were standardised as part of the GSM Standards and extended as part of the 3GPP standards process.

The connection between the terminal equipment and the transceiver can be realized with a serial cable (e.g., USB), a Bluetooth link, an infrared link, etc. Common AT commands include AT+CMGS (send message), AT+CMSS (send message from storage), AT+CMGL (list messages) and AT+CMGR (read message).

However, not all modern devices support receiving of messages if the message storage (for instance the device&#x27;s internal memory) is not accessible using AT commands.

=== Premium-rated short messages ===
The Value-added service provider (VASP) providing premium-rate content submits the message to the mobile operator&#x27;s SMSC(s) using a TCP/IP protocol such as the short message peer-to-peer protocol (SMPP) or the External Machine Interface (EMI). The SMSC delivers the text using the normal Mobile Terminated delivery procedure. The subscribers are charged extra for receiving this premium content; the revenue is typically divided between the mobile network operator and the VASP either through revenue share or a fixed transport fee. Submission to the SMSC is usually handled by a third party.

Mobile-originated short messages may also be used in a premium-rated manner for services such as televoting. In this case, the VASP providing the service obtains a short code from the telephone network operator, and subscribers send texts to that number. The payouts to the carriers vary by carrier; percentages paid are greatest on the lowest-priced premium SMS services. Most information providers should expect to pay about 45 percent of the cost of the premium SMS up front to the carrier. The submission of the text to the SMSC is identical to a standard MO Short Message submission, but once the text is at the SMSC, the Service Center (SC) identifies the Short Code as a premium service. The SC will then direct the content of the text message to the VASP, typically using an IP protocol such as SMPP or EMI. Subscribers are charged a premium for the sending of such messages, with the revenue typically shared between the network operator and the VASP. Short codes only work within one country, they are not international.

An alternative to inbound SMS is based on long numbers (international number format, such as &quot;+44 762 480 5000&quot;), which can be used in place of short codes for SMS reception in several applications, such as TV voting, product promotions and campaigns. Long numbers work internationally, allow businesses to use their own numbers, rather than short codes, which are usually shared across many brands. Additionally, long numbers are nonpremium inbound numbers.

=== Threaded SMS ===
Threaded SMS is a visual styling orientation of SMS message history that arranges messages to and from a contact in chronological order on a single screen. It was first invented by a developer working to implement the SMS client for the BlackBerry, who was looking to make use of the blank screen left below the message on a device with a larger screen capable of displaying far more than the usual 160 characters, and was inspired by threaded Reply conversations in email.

Visually, this style of representation provides a back-and-forth chat-like history for each individual contact. Hierarchical-threading at the conversation-level (as typical in blogs and online messaging boards) is not widely supported by SMS messaging clients. This limitation is due to the fact that there is no session identifier or subject-line passed back and forth between sent and received messages in the header data (as specified by SMS protocol) from which the client device can properly thread an incoming message to a specific dialogue, or even to a specific message within a dialogue.

Most smart phone text-messaging-clients are able to create some contextual threading of &quot;group messages&quot; which narrows the context of the thread around the common interests shared by group members. On the other hand, advanced enterprise messaging applications which push messages from a remote server often display a dynamically changing reply number (multiple numbers used by the same sender), which is used along with the sender&#x27;s phone number to create session-tracking capabilities analogous to the functionality that cookies provide for web-browsing. As one pervasive example, this technique is used to extend the functionality of many Instant Messenger (IM) applications such that they are able to communicate over two-way dialogues with the much larger SMS user-base. In cases where multiple reply numbers are used by the enterprise server to maintain the dialogue, the visual conversation threading on the client may be separated into multiple threads.

=== Application-to-person (A2P) SMS ===
While SMS reached its popularity as a person-to-person messaging, another type of SMS is growing fast: application-to-person (A2P) messaging. A2P is a type of SMS sent from a subscriber to an application or sent from an application to a subscriber. It is commonly used by businesses, such as banks, e-gaming, logistic companies, e-commerce, to send SMS messages from their systems to their customers.

In the US, carriers have traditionally preferred that A2P messages be sent using a short code rather than a standard long code. In 2021, US carriers introduced a new service called A2P 10DLC, supporting the used of 10-digit long codes for A2P messages. In the United Kingdom A2P messages can be sent with a dynamic 11 character sender ID; however, short codes are used for OPTOUT commands.

=== Satellite phone networks ===
All commercial satellite phone networks except ACeS and OptusSat support SMS. While early Iridium handsets only support incoming SMS, later models can also send messages. The price per message varies for different networks. Unlike some mobile phone networks, there is no extra charge for sending international SMS or to send one to a different satellite phone network. SMS can sometimes be sent from areas where the signal is too poor to make a voice call.

Satellite phone networks usually have web-based or email-based SMS portals where one can send free SMS to phones on that particular network.

=== Unreliability ===
Unlike dedicated texting systems like the Simple Network Paging Protocol and Motorola&#x27;s ReFLEX protocol, SMS message delivery is not guaranteed, and many implementations provide no mechanism through which a sender can determine whether an SMS message has been delivered in a timely manner. SMS messages are generally treated as lower-priority traffic than voice, and various studies have shown that around 1% to 5% of messages are lost entirely, even during normal operation conditions, and others may not be delivered until long after their relevance has passed. The use of SMS as an emergency notification service in particular has been questioned.

== Vulnerabilities ==
The Global Service for Mobile communications (GSM), with the greatest worldwide number of users, succumbs to several security vulnerabilities. In the GSM, only the airway traffic between the Mobile Station (MS) and the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is optionally encrypted with a weak and broken stream cipher (A5/1 or A5/2). The authentication is unilateral and also vulnerable. There are also many other security vulnerabilities and shortcomings. Such vulnerabilities are inherent to SMS as one of the superior and well-tried services with a global availability in the GSM networks. SMS messaging has some extra security vulnerabilities due to its store-and-forward feature, and the problem of fake SMS that can be conducted via the Internet. When a user is roaming, SMS content passes through different networks, perhaps including the Internet, and is exposed to various vulnerabilities and attacks. Another concern arises when an adversary gets access to a phone and reads the previous unprotected messages.

In October 2005, researchers from Pennsylvania State University published an analysis of vulnerabilities in SMS-capable cellular networks. The researchers speculated that attackers might exploit the open functionality of these networks to disrupt them or cause them to fail, possibly on a nationwide scale.

=== SMS spoofing ===

The GSM industry has identified a number of potential fraud attacks on mobile operators that can be delivered via abuse of SMS messaging services. The most serious threat is SMS Spoofing, which occurs when a fraudster manipulates address information in order to impersonate a user that has roamed onto a foreign network and is submitting messages to the home network. Frequently, these messages are addressed to destinations outside the home network—with the home SMSC essentially being &quot;hijacked&quot; to send messages into other networks.

The only sure way of detecting and blocking spoofed messages is to screen incoming mobile-originated messages to verify that the sender is a valid subscriber and that the message is coming from a valid and correct location. This can be implemented by adding an intelligent routing function to the network that can query originating subscriber details from the home location register (HLR) before the message is submitted for delivery. This kind of intelligent routing function is beyond the capabilities of legacy messaging infrastructure.

=== Limitation ===
In an effort to limit telemarketers who had taken to bombarding users with hordes of unsolicited messages, India introduced new regulations in September 2011, including a cap of 3,000 SMS messages per subscriber per month, or an average of 100 per subscriber per day. Due to representations received from some of the service providers and consumers, TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) has raised this limit to 200 SMS messages per SIM per day in case of prepaid services, and up to 6,000 SMS messages per SIM per month in case of postpaid services with effect from November 1, 2011. However, it was ruled unconstitutional by the Delhi high court, but there are some limitations.

<text>Santa Monica (; Spanish: &quot;Santa Mónica&quot;) is a city in Los Angeles County, situated along Santa Monica Bay on California&#x27;s South Coast. Santa Monica&#x27;s 2020 U.S. Census population was 93,076. Santa Monica is a popular resort town, owing to its climate, beaches, and hospitality industry. It has a diverse economy, hosting headquarters of companies such as Hulu, Activision Blizzard, Universal Music Group, Starz Entertainment, Lionsgate Studios, Illumination and The Recording Academy.

Santa Monica traces its history to Rancho San Vicente y Santa Mónica, granted in 1839 to the Sepúlveda family of California. The rancho was later sold to John P. Jones and Robert Baker, who in 1875, along with his Californio heiress wife Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker, founded Santa Monica, which incorporated as a city in 1886. The city developed into a seaside resort during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the creation of tourist attractions such as Palisades Park, the Santa Monica Pier, Ocean Park, and the Hotel Casa del Mar.

== History ==
=== Indigenous ===
The Tongva are Indigenous to the Santa Monica area. The village of Comicranga was established in the Santa Monica area. One of the village&#x27;s notable residents was Victoria Reid, who was the daughter of the chief of the village. During the Spanish period, she was taken to Mission San Gabriel from her parents at the age of six.

===Spanish era===

The first non-indigenous group to set foot in the area was the party of explorer Gaspar de Portolá, which camped near the present-day intersection of Barrington and Ohio Avenues on August 3, 1769.

There are two different accounts of how the city&#x27;s name came to be. One says it was named in honor of the feast day of Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine), but her feast day is May 4. Another version says it was named by Juan Crespí on account of a pair of springs, the Kuruvungna Springs, that were reminiscent of the tears Saint Monica shed over her son&#x27;s early impiety.

===Mexican era===

In 1839, Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado granted Rancho San Vicente y Santa Mónica to Francisco Sepúlveda II, of the Sepúlveda family of California. As the definitions of the rancho grant were not precise, the Sepúlveda family came into conflict with the neighboring Rancho Boca de Santa Mónica, owned by Ysidro Reyes and Francisco Márquez. A small Californio community grew up on Rancho San Vicente y Santa Mónica, made up primarily of vaqueros working on the rancho and their families.

===Post-conquest era===

After the American conquest of California, Mexico signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which gave Mexicans and Californios living in state certain unalienable rights. U.S. government sovereignty in California began on February 2, 1848.

In the 1870s, the Los Angeles and Independence Railroad connected Santa Monica with Los Angeles, and a wharf out into the bay. The first town hall was an 1873 brick building, later a beer hall, and now part of the Santa Monica Hostel. By 1885, the town&#x27;s first hotel was the Santa Monica Hotel.

Amusement piers became popular in the first decades of the 20th century and the extensive Pacific Electric Railway brought people to the city&#x27;s beaches from across the Greater Los Angeles Area.

Around the start of the 20th century, a growing population of Asian Americans lived in and around Santa Monica and Venice. A Japanese fishing village was near the Long Wharf while small numbers of Chinese lived or worked in Santa Monica and Venice. The two ethnic minorities were often viewed differently by White Americans, who were often well-disposed toward the Japanese but condescending to the Chinese. The Japanese village fishermen were an integral economic part of the Santa Monica Bay community.

Donald Wills Douglas Sr. built a plant in 1922 at Clover Field (Santa Monica Airport) for the Douglas Aircraft Company. In 1924, four Douglas-built planes took off from Clover Field to attempt the first aerial circumnavigation of the world. Two planes returned after covering in 175 days, and were greeted on their return September 23, 1924, by a crowd of 200,000. The Douglas Company (later McDonnell Douglas) kept facilities in the city until the 1970s.

The Great Depression hit Santa Monica deeply. One report gives citywide employment in 1933 of just 1,000. Hotels and office building owners went bankrupt. In the 1930s, corruption infected Santa Monica (along with neighboring Los Angeles). The federal Works Project Administration helped build several buildings, most notably City Hall. The main Post Office and Barnum Hall (Santa Monica High School auditorium) were also among other WPA projects.

=== Modern era===

Douglas&#x27;s business grew with the onset of World War II, employing as many as 44,000 people in 1943. To defend against air attack, set designers from the Warner Brothers Studios prepared elaborate camouflage that disguised the factory and airfield. The RAND Corporation began as a project of the Douglas Company in 1945, and spun off into an independent think tank on May 14, 1948. RAND acquired a campus across the street from the Civic Center and is still there today.

The completion of the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in 1958 eliminated Belmar, the first African American community in the city, and the Santa Monica Freeway in 1966 decimated the Pico neighborhood that had been a leading African American enclave on the Westside.

Beach volleyball is believed to have been developed by Duke Kahanamoku in Santa Monica during the 1920s.

Santa Monica has two hospitals: Saint John&#x27;s Health Center and Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center. Its cemetery is Woodlawn Memorial.

Santa Monica has several local newspapers including &quot;Santa Monica Daily Press&quot;, &quot;Santa Monica Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Santa Monica Star&quot;.

== Geography ==
Santa Monica rests on a mostly flat slope that angles down toward Ocean Avenue and toward the south. High bluffs separate the north side of the city from the beaches. Santa Monica borders the L.A. neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades to the north and Venice to the south. To the west, Santa Monica has a 3-mile coastline fronting Santa Monica Bay, and to the east of the city are the L.A. communities of West Los Angeles and Brentwood.

=== Climate ===

Santa Monica has a coastal Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;). It receives an average of 310 days of sunshine a year. It is in USDA plant hardiness zone 11a. Because of its location, nestled on the vast and open Santa Monica Bay, morning fog is a common phenomenon in May, June, July and early August (caused by ocean temperature variations and currents). Like other inhabitants of the greater Los Angeles area, residents have a particular terminology for this phenomenon: the &quot;May Gray&quot;, the &quot;June Gloom&quot; and even &quot;Fogust&quot;. Overcast skies are common on June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon. In the late winter/early summer, daily fog is a phenomenon too. It happens suddenly and it may last some hours or past sunset time. Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area experience sunny skies and warmer temperatures. At times, the sun can be shining east of 20th Street while the beach area is overcast. As a general rule, the beach temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 6 degrees Celsius) cooler than it is inland during summer days, and 5 to 10 degrees warmer during winter nights.

It is also in September that the highest temperatures tend to be reached. It is winter, however, when the hot, dry winds of the Santa Anas are most common. In contrast, temperatures exceeding 10 degrees below average are rare.

The rainy season is from late October through late March. Winter storms usually approach from the northwest and pass quickly through the Southland. There is very little rain during the rest of the year. Yearly rainfall totals are unpredictable as rainy years are occasionally followed by droughts. There has never been any snow or frost, but there has been hail.

Santa Monica usually enjoys cool breezes blowing in from the ocean, which tend to keep the air fresh and clean. Therefore, smog is less of a problem for Santa Monica than elsewhere around Los Angeles. However, from September through November, the Santa Ana winds sometimes blow from the east, bringing smoggy and hot inland air to the beaches.

The hottest temperature ever reported in Santa Monica was on November 1, 1966, while the lowest is on March 1, 1945, and again on March 21, 1952.

=== Environment ===

The city first proposed its Sustainable City Plan in 1992 and in 1994, was one of the first cities in the nation to formally adopt a comprehensive sustainability plan, setting waste reduction and water conservation policies for both public and private sector through its Office of Sustainability and the Environment. Eighty-two percent of the city&#x27;s public works vehicles run on alternative fuels, including most of the municipal bus system, making it among the largest of such fleets in the country. Santa Monica fleet vehicles and buses source their natural gas from Redeem, a Southern California-based supplier of renewable and sustainable natural gas obtained from non-fracked methane biogas generated from organic landfill waste.

Santa Monica adopted a Community Energy Independence Initiative, with a goal of achieving complete energy independence by 2020 (vs. California&#x27;s already ambitious 33% renewables goal). The city exceeded that aspiration when, in February 2019, it switched over to electricity from the Clean Power Alliance, with a citywide default of 100% renewably sourced energy. That same year, the Santa Monica City Council adopted a Climate Action and Adaptation Plan aimed at achieving an 80% cut in carbon emissions by 2030, and reaching community-wide carbon neutrality by 2050 or sooner.

An urban runoff facility (SMURFF), the first of its kind in the US, catches and treats of water each week that would otherwise flow into the bay via storm-drains and sells it back to end-users within the city for reuse as gray-water, while bioswales throughout the city allow rainwater to percolate into and replenish the groundwater. The groundwater supply plays an important role in the city&#x27;s Sustainable Water Master Plan, whereby Santa Monica has set a goal of attaining 100% water independence by 2020. The city has numerous programs designed to promote water conservation among residents, including a rebate for those who convert lawns to drought-tolerant gardens that require less water.

Santa Monica has also instituted a green building-code whereby merely constructing to code automatically renders a building equivalent to the US Green Building Council&#x27;s LEED Silver standards. The city&#x27;s Main Library is one of many LEED certified or LEED equivalent buildings in the city. It is built over a 200,000 gallon cistern that collects filtered stormwater from the roof. The water is used for landscape irrigation.

Since 2009, Santa Monica has been developing the Zero Waste Strategic Operations Plan by which the city will set a goal of diverting at least 95% of all waste away from landfills, and toward recycling and composting, by 2030. The plan includes a food waste composting program, which diverts 3 million pounds of restaurant food waste away from landfills annually. , 77% of all solid waste produced citywide is diverted from landfills.

Environmentally focused initiatives include curbside recycling, curbside composting bins (in addition to trash, yard-waste, and recycle bins), farmers&#x27; markets, community gardens, garden-share, an urban forest initiative, a hazardous materials home-collection service, and a green business certification.

As in other coastal beach communities, coastal erosion due to coastal infrastructure and high human usage is an increasing challenge, and will become worse due to sea level rise. Starting in 2016, local environmental groups began dune and beach restoration projects.

Historical aspects of the Expo line route are noteworthy. It uses the former Los Angeles region&#x27;s electric interurban Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s right-of-way that ran from the Exposition Park area of Los Angeles to Santa Monica. This route was called the Santa Monica Air Line and provided electric-powered freight and passenger service between Los Angeles and Santa Monica beginning in the 1920s. Passenger service was discontinued in 1953, but diesel-powered freight deliveries to warehouses along the route continued until March 11, 1988. The abandonment of the line spurred future transportation considerations and concerns within the community, and the entire right-of-way was purchased from Southern Pacific by Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The line was built in 1875 as the steam-powered Los Angeles and Independence Railroad to bring mining ore to ships in Santa Monica harbor and as a passenger excursion train to the beach.

==== Airport and ports ====

Raymond Chandler&#x27;s most famous character, private detective Philip Marlowe, frequently has a portion of his adventures in a place called &quot;Bay City&quot;, which is modeled on Depression-era Santa Monica. In Marlowe&#x27;s world, Bay City is &quot;a wide-open town&quot;, where gambling and other crimes thrive due to a massively corrupt and ineffective police force.

Tennessee Williams lived (while working at MGM Studios) in a hotel on Ocean Avenue in the 1940s. At that location he wrote the play &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (which premiered in 1944). His short story &quot;The Mattress by the Tomato Patch&quot; (1954) is set near Santa Monica Beach and mentions the clock visible in much of the city, high up on The Broadway Building, on Broadway near Second Street.

<text>The shot put is a track and field event involving &quot;putting&quot; (throwing) a heavy spherical ball—the &quot;shot&quot;—as far as possible. For men, the sport has been a part of the modern Olympics since their revival (1896), and women&#x27;s competition began in 1948.

==History==

Homer mentions competitions of rock throwing by soldiers during the siege of Troy but there is no record of any weights being thrown in Greek competitions. The first evidence for stone- or weight-throwing events were in the Scottish Highlands, and date back to approximately the first century. In the 16th century King Henry VIII was noted for his prowess in court competitions of weight and hammer throwing.

The first events resembling the modern shot put likely occurred in the Middle Ages when soldiers held competitions in which they hurled cannonballs. Shot put competitions were first recorded in early 19th century Scotland, and were a part of the British Amateur Championships beginning in 1866.

Competitors take their throw from inside a marked circle in diameter, with a &quot;toe board&quot; or &quot;stop board&quot; high at the front of the circle. The distance thrown is measured from the inside of the circumference of the circle to the nearest mark made on the ground by the falling shot, with distances rounded down to the nearest centimetre under IAAF and WMA rules.

===Legal throws===
The following rules (indoor and outdoor) must be adhered to for a legal throw:
* Upon calling the athlete&#x27;s name, the athlete may choose any part of the throwing circle to enter inside. They have one minute to commence the throwing motion; otherwise it counts as a forfeit for the current round.
* The athlete may not wear gloves; IAAF rules permit the taping of individual fingers.
* The athlete must rest the shot close to the neck, and keep it tight to the neck throughout the motion.
* The shot must be released above the height of the shoulder, using only one hand.
* The athlete may touch the inside surface of the circle or toe board, but must not touch the top or outside of the circle or toe board, or the ground beyond the circle. Limbs may, however, extend over the lines of the circle in the air.
* The shot must land in the &quot;throwing sector&quot;, which is a circular sector of 34.92° centered on the throwing circle. The throwing sector has been narrowed multiple times over the years to improve safety, most recently in 2004 from 40°. The current throwing sector angle (34.92°) was chosen because it provides a sector whose bounds are easy to measure and lay out on a field (10 metres out from the center of the ring, 6 metres across).
* The athlete must leave the throwing circle from the back half.
Foul throws occur when an athlete:
* Does not pause within the circle before beginning the putting motion.
* Does not complete the putting movement initiated within thirty seconds of having their name called.
* Allows the shot to drop below their shoulder or outside the vertical plane of their shoulder during the put.
At any time if the shot loses contact with the neck then it is technically an illegal put.
* During the putting motion, touches with any part of the body (including shoes):
** the top or ends of the toe board
** the top of the iron ring
** anywhere outside the circle.
* Puts a shot which either falls outside the throwing sector or touches a sector line on the initial impact.
* Leaves the circle before the shot has landed.
* Does not leave from the rear half of the circle.

===Regulation misconceptions===
The following are either obsolete or non-existent, but commonly believed rules for professional competition:
* The athlete must enter the circle from the back (no rule books contain such a clause).
* The athlete entering the circle, then exiting and re-entering it before starting the throw results in a foul (all rule books allow athletes to leave a circle before starting a throw, but this still counts within the 30 second time limit; the allowable method of exiting the circle varies by rule book).
* Loose clothing, shoelaces, or long hair touching outside the circle during a throw, or an athlete bringing a towel into the circle and then throwing it out before the put, results in a foul.

==Competition==

Shot put competitions have been held at the modern Summer Olympic Games since their inception in 1896, and it is also included as an event in the World Athletics Championships.

Each of these competitions in the modern era have a set number of rounds of throws. Typically there are three qualification rounds to determine qualification for the final. There are then three preliminary rounds in the final with the top eight competitors receiving a further three throws. Each competitor in the final is credited with their longest throw, regardless of whether it was achieved in the preliminary or final three rounds. The competitor with the longest legal put is declared the winner.

===Weight===
In open competitions the men&#x27;s shot weighs , and the women&#x27;s shot weighs . Junior, school, and masters competitions often use different weights of shots, typically below the weights of those used in open competitions; the individual rules for each competition should be consulted in order to determine the correct weights to be used.

==Putting styles==
Two putting styles are in current general use by shot put competitors: the &quot;glide&quot; and the &quot;spin&quot;. With all putting styles, the goal is to release the shot with maximum forward velocity at an angle of slightly less than forty-five degrees.

===Glide===
The origin of this technique dates to 1951, when Parry O&#x27;Brien from the United States invented a technique that involved the putter facing backwards, rotating 180 degrees across the circle, and then tossing the shot. Unlike spin, this technique is a linear movement.

With this technique, a right-hand thrower would begin facing the rear of the circle. They would typically adopt a specific type of crouch, involving their bent right leg, in order to begin the throw from a more beneficial posture whilst also isometrically preloading their muscles. The positioning of their bodyweight over their bent leg, which pushes upwards with equal force, generates a preparatory isometric press. The force generated by this press will be channelled into the subsequent throw making it more powerful. To initiate the throw they kick to the front with the left leg, while pushing off forcefully with the right. As the thrower crosses the circle, the hips twist toward the front, the left arm is swung out then pulled back tight, followed by the shoulders, and they then strike in a putting motion with their right arm. The key is to move quickly across the circle with as little air under the feet as possible, hence the name &#x27;glide&#x27;.

===Spin===

This is also known as the rotational technique. It was first practiced in Europe in the 1950s but did not receive much attention until the 1970s. In 1972 Aleksandr Baryshnikov set his first USSR record using a new putting style, the spin (&quot;круговой мах&quot; in Russian), invented by his coach Viktor Alexeyev. The spin involves rotating like a discus thrower and using rotational momentum for power. In 1976 Baryshnikov went on to set a world record of with his spin style, and was the first shot putter to cross the 22-meter mark.

With this technique, a right-hand thrower faces the rear, and begins to spin on the ball of the left foot. The thrower comes around and faces the front of the circle and drives the right foot into the center of the circle. Finally, the thrower reaches for the front of the circle with the left foot, twisting the hips and shoulders like in the glide, and puts the shot.

When the athlete executes the spin, the upper body is twisted hard to the right, so the imaginary lines created by the shoulders and hips are no longer parallel. This action builds up torque, and stretches the muscles, creating an involuntary elasticity in the muscles, providing extra power and momentum. When the athlete prepares to release, the left foot is firmly planted, causing the momentum and energy generated to be conserved, pushing the shot in an upward and outward direction.

Another purpose of the spin is to build up a high rotational speed, by swinging the right leg initially, then to bring all the limbs in tightly, similar to a figure skater bringing in their arms while spinning to increase their speed. Once this fast speed is achieved the shot is released, transferring the energy into the shot put.

Until 2016, a woman had never made an Olympic final (top 8) using the spin technique. The first woman to enter a final and win a medal at the Olympics was Anita Márton.

Ryan Crouser, the current men&#x27;s world record holder, added an additional move, the &quot;Crouser Slide&quot;, to his spin technique. He used this technique to set the world record at the Los Angeles Grand Prix in 2023.

===Usage===
Currently, most top male shot putters use the spin. However the glide remains popular since the technique leads to greater consistency compared to the rotational technique. Almost all throwers start by using the glide. Tomasz Majewski notes that although most athletes use the spin, he and some other top shot putters achieved success using this classic method (for example he became the first to defend the Olympic title in 56 years).

The world record and the next six best male results (23.37, 23.30, 23.15, and 23.12 by Ryan Crouser, 23.23 by Joe Kovacs, and 23.12 and 23.10 by Randy Barnes) were completed with the spin technique, while the eighth-best all-time put of by Ulf Timmermann was completed with the glide technique.

The decision to glide or spin may need to be decided on an individual basis, determined by the thrower&#x27;s size and power. Short throwers may benefit from the spin and taller throwers may benefit from the glide, but many throwers do not follow this guideline.

==Types of shot==

The shot is made of different kinds of materials depending on its intended use. Materials used include sand, iron, cast iron, solid steel, stainless steel, brass, and synthetic materials like polyvinyl. Some metals are more dense than others, making the size of the shot vary. For example, different materials are used to make indoor and outdoor shot – because damage to surroundings must be taken into account – so the latter are smaller. There are various size and weight standards for the implement that depend on the age and gender of the competitors as well as the national customs of the governing body.

<text>Stanley Bootle, known as Stan Kelly-Bootle (15 September 1929 – 16 April 2014), was a British author, academic, singer-songwriter and computer scientist.

He took his stage name Stan Kelly (he was not known as Stan Kelly-Bootle in folk music circles) from the Irish folk song &quot;Kelly, the boy from Killane&quot;. His best-known song is the &quot;Liverpool Lullaby&quot; or &quot;The Mucky Kid&quot; which was recorded in 1965 on the &quot;Three City Four&quot; LP and sung by Marian McKenzie. It was also sung by the Ian Campbell Folk Group on the &quot;Contemporary Campbells&quot; LP. It was later recorded by Judy Collins in 1966 for her album &quot;In My Life&quot;. Cilla Black recorded it three years later as the B-side to her pop hit &quot;Conversations&quot;. Kelly-Bootle achieved the first postgraduate degree in computer science in 1954, from the University of Cambridge.

==Early life==
Stan Kelly-Bootle was born Stanley Bootle in Liverpool, Lancashire, on 15 September 1929 and grew up in the Wavertree area of the city. His parents were Arthur Bootle and Ada Gallagher.

==Education==
Kelly-Bootle was schooled at the Liverpool Institute. He spent 1948–1950 doing his national service in the British Army, achieving the rank of Sgt. Instructor in RADAR. He attended Downing College, Cambridge, graduating with a first class degree in Numerical Analysis and Automatic Computing in 1954, the first postgraduate degree in computer science.

==Folk singing career==
In 1954, Kelly-Bootle helped found the St. Lawrence Folk Song Society at Cambridge University. As a folk singer-songwriter, he performed under the name Stan Kelly. He wrote some of his own tunes and lyrics set to traditional tunes, made over two hundred radio and television appearances and released several recordings, as well as having his songs recorded by others.

===Discography===
Solo releases include:
*&quot;I Chose Friden – Songs for Cybernetic Lovers&quot;. Computer humour songs recorded in 1963.
*&quot;Liverpool Packet&quot;, Topic Records release TOP 27, 1958. Songs about Liverpool.
*&quot;Songs for Swinging Landlords To&quot;, Topic Records release TOP 60. Rent protest and anti-landlord songs of both varieties.
*Wrote and produced a sound and song depiction of Merseyside called &quot;Echoes of Merseyside&quot; (LPDE 101) for the Liverpool Echo newspaper.
*&quot;O Liverpool We Love You&quot;, Transatlantic Records XTRA 1076, released 1976. This album was a tribute to Liverpool F.C., prepared with the team&#x27;s cooperation. While creating the album, Kelly travelled with the team for both UK and European games for several years, and also for two seasons managed several players, including Kevin Keegan and Tommy Smith.

Other audio recordings include:
*Kelly performed the part of &quot;The Rambler&quot; in the BBC&#x27;s 1958 production &quot;The Ballad of John Axon&quot;. This broadcast won the Italia Prize, and excerpts were subsequently released on a highlights LP. This was the first BBC radio ballad.
*Two tracks (&quot;Liverpool Town&quot; and &quot;The Ould Mark II&quot;) on &quot;Revival in Britain, Vol 1&quot;, produced by Ewan MacColl, Folkways Records FW 8728, Library of Congress R62-1246.
*One track (&quot;The Young Sailor Cut Down in His Prime&quot;) on &quot;Topic Sampler No. 2&quot;, Topic Records, TPS 145, 1966
*Performing on Stan Hugill&#x27;s &quot;Shanties from the Seven Seas&quot;, HMV 1970

==Computing career==
He started his computing career programming the pioneering EDSAC computer, designed and built at Cambridge University. He worked for IBM in the United States and the UK from 1955 to 1970. From 1970 to 1973, he worked as Manager for University Systems for Sperry-UNIVAC. He also lectured at the University of Warwick.

==Writing career==
In 1973, Kelly-Bootle left Sperry-UNIVAC and became a freelance consultant, writer and programmer. He was known in the computer community for &quot;The Devil&#x27;s DP Dictionary&quot; and its second edition, &quot;The Computer Contradictionary&quot; (1995), which he authored. These works are cynical lexicographies in the vein of Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;. Kelly-Bootle authored or co-authored several serious textbooks and tutorials on subjects such as the Motorola 68000 family of CPUs, programming languages including various C compilers, and the Unix operating system. He authored the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot; column in &quot;UNIX Review&quot; from 1984 to 2000, and had columns in &quot;Computer Language&quot; (&quot;Bit by Bit&quot;, 1989–1994), &quot;OS/2 Magazine&quot; (&quot;End Notes&quot;, 1994–97) and &quot;Software Development&quot; (&quot;Seamless Quanta&quot;, October 1995 – May 1997). He contributed columns and articles to several other computer industry magazines, as well.
Kelly-Bootle&#x27;s articles for magazines such as &quot;ACM Queue&quot;, &quot;AI/Expert&quot;, and &quot;UNIX Review&quot; contain examples of word-play, criticism of silly marketing and usage (he refers often to the computer &quot;laxicon&quot;), and commentary on the industry in general. He wrote an online monthly column posted on the Internet. While most of his writing was oriented towards the computer industry, he wrote a few books relating to his other interests, including 
* &quot;Liverpool Lullabies, The Stan Kelly Songbook&quot;, SING Publications, 1960. Second edition, 1976.
* &quot;Lern Yourself Scouse – How to Talk Proper in Liverpool&quot;, Scouse Press, 1961, written with Fritz Spiegl and Frank Shaw. Sixteen editions published through 1991.
* &quot;The Terrace Muse, An Anthology of Soccer Songs and Chants&quot;, serialized in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in 1970.

==Death==
Stan Kelly-Bootle died on 16 April 2014, aged 84, in hospital in Oswestry, Shropshire.

<doc id="28212" wikidata="Q330828" url="?curid=28212" title="Skewness">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean. The skewness value can be positive, zero, negative, or undefined.

For a unimodal distribution (a distribution with a single peak), negative skew commonly indicates that the &quot;tail&quot; is on the left side of the distribution, and positive skew indicates that the tail is on the right. In cases where one tail is long but the other tail is fat, skewness does not obey a simple rule. For example, a zero value in skewness means that the tails on both sides of the mean balance out overall; this is the case for a symmetric distribution but can also be true for an asymmetric distribution where one tail is long and thin, and the other is short but fat. Thus, the judgement on the symmetry of a given distribution by using only its skewness is risky; the distribution shape must be taken into account.

== Introduction ==
Consider the two distributions in the figure just below. Within each graph, the values on the right side of the distribution taper differently from the values on the left side. These tapering sides are called &quot;tails&quot;, and they provide a visual means to determine which of the two kinds of skewness a distribution has:
# &quot;&quot;: The left tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the right of the figure. The distribution is said to be &quot;left-skewed&quot;, &quot;left-tailed&quot;, or &quot;skewed to the left&quot;, despite the fact that the curve itself appears to be skewed or leaning to the right; &quot;left&quot; instead refers to the left tail being drawn out and, often, the mean being skewed to the left of a typical center of the data. A left-skewed distribution usually appears as a &quot;right-leaning&quot; curve.
# &quot;&quot;: The right tail is longer; the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left of the figure. The distribution is said to be &quot;right-skewed&quot;, &quot;right-tailed&quot;, or &quot;skewed to the right&quot;, despite the fact that the curve itself appears to be skewed or leaning to the left; &quot;right&quot; instead refers to the right tail being drawn out and, often, the mean being skewed to the right of a typical center of the data. A right-skewed distribution usually appears as a &quot;left-leaning&quot; curve.

 Skewness in a data series may sometimes be observed not only graphically but by simple inspection of the values. For instance, consider the numeric sequence (49, 50, 51), whose values are evenly distributed around a central value of 50. We can transform this sequence into a negatively skewed distribution by adding a value far below the mean, which is probably a negative outlier, e.g. (40, 49, 50, 51). Therefore, the mean of the sequence becomes 47.5, and the median is 49.5. Based on the formula of nonparametric skew, defined as formula_1 the skew is negative. Similarly, we can make the sequence positively skewed by adding a value far above the mean, which is probably a positive outlier, e.g. (49, 50, 51, 60), where the mean is 52.5, and the median is 50.5.

As mentioned earlier, a unimodal distribution with zero value of skewness does not imply that this distribution is symmetric necessarily. However, a symmetric unimodal or multimodal distribution always has zero skewness.
== Relationship of mean and median ==
The skewness is not directly related to the relationship between the mean and median: a distribution with negative skew can have its mean greater than or less than the median, and likewise for positive skew.

In the older notion of nonparametric skew, defined as formula_1 where formula_3 is the mean, formula_4 is the median, and formula_5 is the standard deviation, the skewness is defined in terms of this relationship: positive/right nonparametric skew means the mean is greater than (to the right of) the median, while negative/left nonparametric skew means the mean is less than (to the left of) the median. However, the modern definition of skewness and the traditional nonparametric definition do not always have the same sign: while they agree for some families of distributions, they differ in some of the cases, and conflating them is misleading.

If the distribution is symmetric, then the mean is equal to the median, and the distribution has zero skewness. If the distribution is both symmetric and unimodal, then the mean = median = mode. This is the case of a coin toss or the series 1,2,3,4... Note, however, that the converse is not true in general, i.e. zero skewness (defined below) does not imply that the mean is equal to the median.

A 2005 journal article points out:Many textbooks teach a rule of thumb stating that the mean is right of the median under right skew, and left of the median under left skew. This rule fails with surprising frequency. It can fail in multimodal distributions, or in distributions where one tail is long but the other is heavy. Most commonly, though, the rule fails in discrete distributions where the areas to the left and right of the median are not equal. Such distributions not only contradict the textbook relationship between mean, median, and skew, they also contradict the textbook interpretation of the median.

For example, in the distribution of adult residents across US households, the skew is to the right. However, since the majority of cases is less than or equal to the mode, which is also the median, the mean sits in the heavier left tail. As a result, the rule of thumb that the mean is right of the median under right skew failed.

==Definition==

===Fisher&#x27;s moment coefficient of skewness===
The skewness formula_6 of a random variable &quot;X&quot; is the third standardized moment formula_7, defined as:

:formula_8
where &quot;μ&quot; is the mean, &quot;σ&quot; is the standard deviation, E is the expectation operator, &quot;μ&quot;3 is the third central moment, and &quot;κ&quot;&quot;t&quot; are the &quot;t&quot;-th cumulants. It is sometimes referred to as Pearson&#x27;s moment coefficient of skewness, or simply the moment coefficient of skewness, but should not be confused with Pearson&#x27;s other skewness statistics (see below). The last equality expresses skewness in terms of the ratio of the third cumulant &quot;κ&quot;3 to the 1.5th power of the second cumulant &quot;κ&quot;2. This is analogous to the definition of kurtosis as the fourth cumulant normalized by the square of the second cumulant. 
The skewness is also sometimes denoted Skew[&quot;X&quot;].

If &quot;σ&quot; is finite and &quot;μ&quot; is finite too, then skewness can be expressed in terms of the non-central moment E[&quot;X&quot;3] by expanding the previous formula:
:formula_9
===Examples===
Skewness can be infinite, as when
:formula_10
where the third cumulants are infinite, or as when
:formula_11
where the third cumulant is undefined.

Examples of distributions with finite skewness include the following.

* A normal distribution and any other symmetric distribution with finite third moment has a skewness of 0
* A half-normal distribution has a skewness just below 1
* An exponential distribution has a skewness of 2
* A lognormal distribution can have a skewness of any positive value, depending on its parameters

===Sample skewness===
For a sample of &quot;n&quot; values, two natural estimators of the population skewness are

: formula_12

and

: formula_13

where formula_14 is the sample mean, &quot;s&quot; is the sample standard deviation, &quot;m&quot;2 is the (biased) sample second central moment, and &quot;m&quot;3 is the (biased) sample third central moment. formula_15 is a method of moments estimator. 

Another common definition of the &quot;sample skewness&quot; is

: formula_16

where formula_17 is the unique symmetric unbiased estimator of the third cumulant and formula_18 is the symmetric unbiased estimator of the second cumulant (i.e. the sample variance). This adjusted Fisher–Pearson standardized moment coefficient formula_19 is the version found in Excel and several statistical packages including Minitab, SAS and SPSS.

Under the assumption that the underlying random variable formula_20 is normally distributed, it can be shown that all three ratios formula_21, formula_15 and formula_23 are unbiased and consistent estimators of the population skewness formula_24, with formula_25, i.e., their distributions converge to a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 6 (Fisher, 1930). The variance of the sample skewness is thus approximately formula_26 for sufficiently large samples. More precisely, in a random sample of size &quot;n&quot; from a normal distribution,

: formula_27

In normal samples, formula_21 has the smaller variance of the three estimators, with

: formula_29

For non-normal distributions, formula_21, formula_15 and formula_23 are generally biased estimators of the population skewness formula_6; their expected values can even have the opposite sign from the true skewness. For instance, a mixed distribution consisting of very thin Gaussians centred at −99, 0.5, and 2 with weights 0.01, 0.66, and 0.33 has a skewness formula_6 of about −9.77, but in a sample of 3 formula_23 has an expected value of about 0.32, since usually all three samples are in the positive-valued part of the distribution, which is skewed the other way.

==Applications==

Skewness is a descriptive statistic that can be used in conjunction with the histogram and the normal quantile plot to characterize the data or distribution.

Skewness indicates the direction and relative magnitude of a distribution&#x27;s deviation from the normal distribution.

With pronounced skewness, standard statistical inference procedures such as a confidence interval for a mean will be not only incorrect, in the sense that the true coverage level will differ from the nominal (e.g., 95%) level, but they will also result in unequal error probabilities on each side.

Skewness can be used to obtain approximate probabilities and quantiles of distributions (such as value at risk in finance) via the Cornish–Fisher expansion.

Many models assume normal distribution; i.e., data are symmetric about the mean. The normal distribution has a skewness of zero. But in reality, data points may not be perfectly symmetric. So, an understanding of the skewness of the dataset indicates whether deviations from the mean are going to be positive or negative.

D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s K-squared test is a goodness-of-fit normality test based on sample skewness and sample kurtosis.

==Other measures of skewness==
Other measures of skewness have been used, including simpler calculations suggested by Karl Pearson (not to be confused with Pearson&#x27;s moment coefficient of skewness, see above). These other measures are:

===Pearson&#x27;s first skewness coefficient (mode skewness)===
The Pearson mode skewness, or first skewness coefficient, is defined as

===Pearson&#x27;s second skewness coefficient (median skewness)===
The Pearson median skewness, or second skewness coefficient, is defined as

Which is a simple multiple of the nonparametric skew.

===Quantile-based measures===

Bowley&#x27;s measure of skewness (from 1901), also called Yule&#x27;s coefficient (from 1912) is defined as: 
:formula_36
where &quot;Q&quot; is the quantile function (i.e., the inverse of the cumulative distribution function). The numerator is difference between the average of the upper and lower quartiles (a measure of location) and the median (another measure of location), while the denominator is the semi-interquartile range formula_37, which for symmetric distributions is equal to the MAD measure of dispersion.{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

Other names for this measure are Galton&#x27;s measure of skewness, the Yule–Kendall index and the quartile skewness,

Similarly, Kelly&#x27;s measure of skewness is defined as
:formula_38

A more general formulation of a skewness function was described by Groeneveld, R. A. and Meeden, G. (1984):
:formula_39
The function &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) satisfies −1 ≤ &quot;γ&quot;(&quot;u&quot;) ≤ 1 and is well defined without requiring the existence of any moments of the distribution. Bowley&#x27;s measure of skewness is γ(&quot;u&quot;) evaluated at &quot;u&quot; = 3/4 while Kelly&#x27;s measure of skewness is γ(&quot;u&quot;) evaluated at &quot;u&quot; = 9/10. This definition leads to a corresponding overall measure of skewness defined as the supremum of this over the range 1/2 ≤ &quot;u&quot; &lt; 1. Another measure can be obtained by integrating the numerator and denominator of this expression. 

Quantile-based skewness measures are at first glance easy to interpret, but they often show significantly larger sample variations than moment-based methods. This means that often samples from a symmetric distribution (like the uniform distribution) have a large quantile-based skewness, just by chance.

===Groeneveld and Meeden&#x27;s coefficient===

Groeneveld and Meeden have suggested, as an alternative measure of skewness,

: formula_40

where &quot;μ&quot; is the mean, &quot;ν&quot; is the median, |...| is the absolute value, and E() is the expectation operator. This is closely related in form to Pearson&#x27;s second skewness coefficient.

===L-moments===

Use of L-moments in place of moments provides a measure of skewness known as the L-skewness.

===Distance skewness===

A value of skewness equal to zero does not imply that the probability distribution is symmetric. Thus there is a need for another measure of asymmetry that has this property: such a measure was introduced in 2000. It is called distance skewness and denoted by dSkew. If &quot;X&quot; is a random variable taking values in the &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, &quot;X&quot; has finite expectation, &quot;X&quot;{{&#x27;}} is an independent identically distributed copy of &quot;X&quot;, and formula_41 denotes the norm in the Euclidean space, then a simple &quot;measure of asymmetry&quot; with respect to location parameter θ is
: formula_42
and dSkew(&quot;X&quot;) := 0 for &quot;X&quot; = θ (with probability 1). Distance skewness is always between 0 and 1, equals 0 if and only if &quot;X&quot; is diagonally symmetric with respect to θ (&quot;X&quot; and 2θ−&quot;X&quot; have the same probability distribution) and equals 1 if and only if X is a constant &quot;c&quot; (formula_43) with probability one. Thus there is a simple consistent statistical test of diagonal symmetry based on the sample distance skewness:
: formula_44

===Medcouple===
The medcouple is a scale-invariant robust measure of skewness, with a breakdown point of 25%. It is the median of the values of the kernel function
: formula_45
taken over all couples formula_46 such that formula_47, where formula_48 is the median of the sample formula_49. It can be seen as the median of all possible quantile skewness measures.

<text>Serial Experiments Lain is a Japanese anime television series created and co-produced by Yasuyuki Ueda, written by Chiaki J. Konaka and directed by Ryūtarō Nakamura. Animated by Triangle Staff and featuring original character designs by Yoshitoshi Abe, the series was broadcast for 13 episodes on TV Tokyo and its affiliates from July to September 1998. The series follows Lain Iwakura, an adolescent girl in suburban Japan, and her relation to the Wired, a global communications network similar to the internet.

&quot;Lain&quot; features surreal and avant-garde imagery and explores philosophical topics such as reality, identity, and communication. The series incorporates creative influences from computer history, cyberpunk, and conspiracy theories. Critics and fans have praised &quot;Lain&quot; for its originality, visuals, atmosphere, themes, and its dark depiction of a world fraught with paranoia, social alienation, and reliance on technology considered insightful of 21st century life. It received the Excellence Prize at the Japan Media Arts Festival in 1998.

==Plot==
Lain Iwakura, a girl in her second year of middle school, lives in Setagaya City, Tokyo, Japan with her middle-class family, consisting of her inexpressive older sister Mika, emotionally distant mother Miho, and computer-obsessed father Yasuo; Lain herself is extremely introverted and socially isolated. The status-quo of her life becomes upturned by a series of bizarre incidents that take place after girls from her school receive an e-mail from a dead student, Chisa Yomoda, and she pulls out her old computer in order to check for the same message. Lain finds Chisa telling her via email that she is not dead but has merely &quot;abandoned her physical self&quot; and is alive deep within the virtual realm of the Wired itself, where she claims she has found &quot;God&quot;. From this point, Lain is caught in a series of cryptic and surreal events that see her delving deeper into the mystery of the network in a narrative that explores themes of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.

&quot;The Wired&quot; is a virtual realm that contains and supports the sum of humanity&#x27;s communication networks, created with the telegraph, television, and telephone services, and expanded with the Internet and cyberspace. The series posits that the Wired could be linked to a system that enables subconscious communication between people and machines without physical interface. Such a system is explained by the Schumann resonances, a property of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field that theoretically allows for unhindered long-distance communications. If such a link were created, the network would become equivalent to reality as the general consensus of all perceptions and knowledge, and the increasingly thin line between what is real and what is virtual would fracture.

Masami Eiri is the project director on Protocol Seven, the next-generation Internet protocol, for major IT company Tachibana General Laboratories. He had secretly included code of his very own creation to give himself control of the Wired. He then transferred his own consciousness into the Wired, leaving his body in the physical world to die. Masami explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall, and he needs her to go into the Wired and &quot;abandon the flesh&quot;, as he did, to achieve his plan. The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions, using the promise of unconditional love, romantic seduction and charm, and finally threats and force.

Meanwhile, a complex game of hide-and-seek unfolds between the &quot;Knights of the Eastern Calculus&quot; (based on the Knights of the Lambda Calculus), hackers whom Masami claims are &quot;believers that enable him to be a God in the Wired&quot;, and Tachibana General Laboratories, who try to regain control of Protocol Seven. In the end, Lain realizes, after much introspection, that she has control over everyone&#x27;s mind and over reality itself. Her dialogue with different versions of herself shows how she feels shunned from the material world, and is afraid to live in the Wired, where she has the opportunities and responsibilities of an almighty goddess. The last scenes feature her erasing everything connected to herself from everyone&#x27;s memories of her. She is last seen encountering her closest friend Alice once again, who is now married, though Lain herself is unchanged. Lain promises herself that she and Alice will meet again anytime as Lain can literally go and be anywhere she desires between both worlds.

==Characters==
:

:The title character of the series. Lain is a fourteen-year-old girl who uncovers her true nature through the series. She is first depicted as a shy junior high school student with few friends or interests. She later grows multiple bolder personalities, both in the physical world and the Wired, and starts making more friends. As the series progresses, she eventually comes to discover that she is, in reality, merely an autonomous, sentient computer program in the physical and corporeal form of a human being, designed to sever the invisible barrier between the Wired and the real world. However, the truth of her creation is left ambiguous, particularly as to whether or not she was truly created by Tachibana General Laboratories. In the end, Lain is challenged to accept herself as a &quot;de facto&quot; goddess for the Wired, having become an omnipotent and omnipresent virtual being with worshippers of her own, as well as an ability to exist beyond the borders of devices, time, or space.
:
: The key designer of Protocol Seven. While working for Tachibana General Laboratories, he illicitly included codes enabling him to control the whole protocol at will and embedded his own mind and will into the seventh protocol. Because of this, he was fired by Tachibana General Laboratories, and was found dead not long after. He believes that the only way for humans to evolve even further and develop even greater abilities is to absolve themselves of their physical and human limitations, and to live as virtual entities—or avatars—in the Wired for eternity. He claims to have been Lain&#x27;s creator all along, but was in truth standing in for another as an acting god, who was waiting for the Wired to reach its more evolved current state: Lain herself. 
:
:Lain and Mika&#x27;s father. Passionate about computers and electronic communication, he works with Masami Eiri at Tachibana General Laboratories. He subtly pushes Lain, his &quot;youngest daughter&quot;, towards the Wired and monitors her development until she becomes more and more aware of herself and of her &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot;. He eventually leaves Lain, telling her that although he did not enjoy playing house, he genuinely loved and cared for her as a real father would. Despite Yasuo&#x27;s eagerness to lure Lain into the Wired, he warns her not to get overly involved in it or to confuse it with the real world.

==Production==
&quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; was conceived, as a series, to be original to the point of it being considered &quot;an enormous risk&quot; by its producer Yasuyuki Ueda.

Ueda had to answer repeated queries about a statement he had made in an &quot;Animerica&quot; interview where he claimed that &quot;Lain&quot; was &quot;a sort of cultural war against American culture and the American sense of values we [Japan] adopted after World War II&quot;. He later explained in numerous interviews that he created &quot;Lain&quot; with a set of values he viewed as distinctly Japanese; he hoped Americans would not understand the series as the Japanese would. This would lead to a &quot;war of ideas&quot; over the meaning of the anime, hopefully culminating in new communication between the two cultures. When Ueda discovered that the American audience held most of the same views on the series as the Japanese did, he was disappointed.

The &quot;Lain&quot; franchise was originally conceived to connect across forms of media (anime, video games, manga). Ueda said in an interview, &quot;the approach I took for this project was to communicate the essence of the work by the total sum of many media products&quot;. The scenario for the video game was written first, and the video game was produced at the same time as the anime series, though the series was released first. A dōjinshi titled &quot;The Nightmare of Fabrication&quot; was produced by Yoshitoshi Abe and released in Japanese in the artbook &quot;An Omnipresence in Wired&quot;. Ueda and Konaka declared in an interview that the idea of a multimedia project was not unusual in Japan, as opposed to the contents of &quot;Lain&quot;, and the way they are exposed.

===Writing===
The authors were asked in interviews if they had been influenced by &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, in the themes and graphic design. This was strictly denied by writer Chiaki J. Konaka in an interview, arguing that he had not even seen &quot;Evangelion&quot; until he finished the fourth episode of &quot;Lain&quot;. Being primarily a horror movie writer, his stated influences are Godard (especially for using typography on screen), &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;Hell House&quot;, and Dan Curtis&#x27;s &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot;. Alice&#x27;s name, like the names of her two friends Julie and Reika, came from a previous production from Konaka, , which in turn was largely influenced by &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. As the series developed, Konaka was &quot;surprised&quot; by how close Alice&#x27;s character became to the original &quot;Wonderland&quot; character.

Vannevar Bush (and memex), John C. Lilly, Timothy Leary and his eight-circuit model of consciousness, Ted Nelson and Project Xanadu are cited as precursors to the Wired. Douglas Rushkoff and his book &quot;Cyberia&quot; were originally to be cited as such, and in &quot;Serial Experiments: Lain&quot;, Cyberia became the name of a nightclub populated with hackers and techno-punk teenagers. Likewise, the series&#x27; &quot;deus ex machina&quot; lies in the conjunction of the Schumann resonances and Jung&#x27;s collective unconscious (the authors chose this term over Kabbalah and Akashic Record). Majestic 12 and the Roswell UFO incident are used as examples of how a hoax might still affect history, even after having been exposed as such, by creating sub-cultures. This links again to Vannevar Bush, the alleged &quot;brains&quot; of MJ12.

Two of the literary references in &quot;Lain&quot; are quoted through Lain&#x27;s father: he first logs onto a website with the password &quot;&quot; (&quot;Think Blue, Count Two&quot; is an Instrumentality of Man story featuring virtual persons projected as real ones in people&#x27;s minds); and his saying that &quot;madeleines would be good with the tea&quot; in the last episode makes &quot;Lain&quot; &quot;one of the only cartoons ever to allude to Proust&quot;.

===Character design===

Yoshitoshi Abe confesses to have never read manga as a child, as it was &quot;off-limits&quot; in his household. His major influences are &quot;nature and everything around him&quot;. Specifically speaking about Lain&#x27;s character, Abe was inspired by Kenji Tsuruta, Akihiro Yamada, Range Murata and Yukinobu Hoshino. In a broader view, he has been influenced in his style and technique by Japanese artists Kyosuke Chinai and Toshio Tabuchi.

The character design of Lain was not Abe&#x27;s sole responsibility. Her distinctive left forelock for instance was a demand from Yasuyuki Ueda. The goal was to produce asymmetry to reflect Lain&#x27;s unstable and disconcerting nature. It was designed as a mystical symbol, as it is supposed to prevent voices and spirits from being heard by the left ear. The bear pajamas she wears were a demand from character animation director Takahiro Kishida. Though bears are a trademark of the Konaka brothers, Chiaki Konaka first opposed the idea. Director Nakamura then explained how the bear motif could be used as a shield for confrontations with her family. It is a key element of the design of the shy &quot;real world&quot; Lain (see &quot;mental illness&quot; under Themes). When she first goes to the Cyberia nightclub, she wears a bear hat for similar reasons. Retrospectively, Konaka said that Lain&#x27;s pajamas became a major factor in drawing fans of &quot;moe&quot; characterization to the series, and remarked that &quot;such items may also be important when making anime&quot;.

Abe&#x27;s original design was generally more complicated than what finally appeared on screen. As an example, the X-shaped hair clip was to be an interlocking pattern of gold links. The links would open with a snap, or rotate around an axis until the moment the &quot; X &quot; became a &quot; = &quot;. This was not used as there is no scene where Lain takes her hair clip off.

===Themes===
&quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; is not a conventionally linear story, being described as &quot;an alternative anime, with modern themes and realization&quot;. Themes range from theological to psychological and are dealt with in a number of ways: from classical dialogue to image-only introspection, passing by direct interrogation of imaginary characters.

Communication, in its wider sense, is one of the main themes of the series, not only as opposed to loneliness, but also as a subject in itself. Writer Konaka said he wanted to directly &quot;communicate human feelings&quot;. Director Nakamura wanted to show the audience — and particularly viewers between 14 and 15—&quot;the multidimensional wavelength of the existential self: the relationship between self and the world&quot;.

Loneliness, if only as representing a lack of communication, is recurrent through &quot;Lain&quot;. Lain herself (according to Anime Jump) is &quot;almost painfully introverted with no friends to speak of at school, a snotty, condescending sister, a strangely apathetic mother, and a father who seems to want to care but is just too damn busy to give her much of his time&quot;. Friendships turn on the first rumor; and the only insert song of the series is named &quot;Kodoku no shigunaru&quot;, literally &quot;signal of loneliness&quot;.

Mental illness, especially dissociative identity disorder, is a significant theme in &quot;Lain&quot;: the main character is constantly confronted with alter-egos, to the point where writer Chiaki Konaka and Lain&#x27;s voice actress Kaori Shimizu had to agree on subdividing the character&#x27;s dialogues between three different orthographs. The three names designate distinct &quot;versions&quot; of Lain: the real-world, &quot;childish&quot; Lain has a shy attitude and bear pajamas. The &quot;advanced&quot; Lain, her Wired personality, is bold and questioning. Finally, the &quot;evil&quot; Lain is sly and devious, and does everything she can to harm Lain or the ones close to her. As a writing convention, the authors spelled their respective names in kanji, katakana, and Latin characters (see picture).

Reality never has the pretense of objectivity in &quot;Lain&quot;. Acceptations of the term are battling throughout the series, such as the &quot;natural&quot; reality, defined through normal dialogue between individuals; the material reality; and the tyrannic reality, enforced by one person onto the minds of others. A key debate to all interpretations of the series is to decide whether matter flows from thought, or the opposite. The production staff carefully avoided &quot;the so-called God&#x27;s Eye Viewpoint&quot; to make clear the &quot;limited field of vision&quot; of the world of &quot;Lain&quot;.

Theology plays its part in the development of the story too. &quot;Lain&quot; has been viewed as a questioning of the possibility of an infinite spirit in a finite body. From self-realization as a goddess to deicide, religion (the title of a layer) is an inherent part of &quot;Lain&quot; background.

===Apple computers===
&quot;Lain&quot; contains extensive references to Apple computers, as the brand was used at the time by most of the creative staff, such as writers, producers, and the graphical team. As an example, the title at the beginning of each episode is announced by the Apple computer speech synthesis program PlainTalk, using the voice &quot;Whisper&quot;, e.g. codice_1. Tachibana Industries, the company that creates the NAVI computers, is a reference to Apple computers: the tachibana orange is a Japanese variety of mandarin orange. NAVI is the abbreviation of Knowledge Navigator, and the HandiNAVI is based on the Apple Newton, one of the world&#x27;s first PDAs. The NAVIs are seen to run &quot;Copland OS Enterprise&quot; (this reference to Copland was an initiative of Konaka, a declared Apple fan), and Lain&#x27;s and Alice&#x27;s NAVIs closely resembles the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh and the iMac G3 respectively. The HandiNAVI programming language, as seen on the seventh episode, is a dialect of Lisp; the Newton also used a Lisp dialect (NewtonScript). The program being typed by Lain can be found in the CMU AI repository; it is a simple implementation of Conway&#x27;s Game of Life in Common Lisp.

During a series of disconnected images, an iMac and the Think Different advertising slogan appears for a short time, while the &quot;Whisper&quot; voice says it. This was an unsolicited insertion from the graphic team, also Mac-enthusiasts. Other subtle allusions can be found: &quot;Close the world, Open the nExt&quot; is the slogan for the &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; video game. NeXT was the company that produced NeXTSTEP, which later evolved into Mac OS X after Apple bought NeXT. Another example is &quot;To Be Continued.&quot; at the end of episodes 1–12, with a blue &quot;B&quot; and a red &quot;e&quot; on &quot;Be&quot;; this matches the original logo of Be Inc., a company founded by ex-Apple employees and NeXT&#x27;s main competitor in its time.

==Broadcast and release history==
&quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; was first aired on TV Tokyo and its affiliates on July 6, 1998, and concluded on September 28, 1998, with the thirteenth and final episode. The series consists of 13 episodes (referred to in the series as &quot;Layers&quot;) of 24 minutes each, except for the sixth episode, &quot;Kids&quot; (23 minutes 14 seconds). In Japan, the episodes were released in LD, VHS, and DVD with a total of five volumes. A DVD compilation named &quot;&quot;Serial Experiments Lain DVD-BOX Яesurrection&quot; was released along with a promo DVD called &quot;LPR-309&quot; in 2000. As this box set is now discontinued, a rerelease was made in 2005 called &quot;Serial Experiments Lain TV-BOX&quot;. A 4-volume DVD box set was released in the US by Pioneer/Geneon. A Blu-ray release of the anime was made in December 2009 called &quot;Serial Experiments Lain Blu-ray Box| RESTORE&quot;&quot;.

The anime series was licensed in North America by Pioneer Entertainment (later Geneon USA) on VHS and DVD in 1999. In December 2002, TechTV announced that &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; would air on the channel as part of its Anime Unleashed programming block, with the series making its debut on January 21, 2003. The original home releases went out-of-print in December 2007 when Geneon closed its USA division. At Anime Expo 2010, North American distributor Funimation announced that it had obtained the license to the series and re-released it in 2012. The anime series returned to US television on October 15, 2012, on the Funimation Channel.

===Episodes===
==Reception==

&quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; was first broadcast in Tokyo at 1:15 a.m. JST. The word &quot;weird&quot; appears almost ubiquitously in English language reviews of the series, or the alternatives &quot;bizarre&quot;, and &quot;atypical&quot;, due mostly to the freedoms taken with the animation and its unusual science fiction themes, and due to its philosophical and psychological context. Critics responded positively to these thematic and stylistic characteristics, and it was awarded an Excellence Prize by the 1998 Japan Media Arts Festival for &quot;its willingness to question the meaning of contemporary life&quot; and the &quot;extraordinarily philosophical and deep questions&quot; it asks.

According to Christian Nutt from &quot;Newtype USA&quot;, the main attraction to the series is its keen view on &quot;the interlocking problems of identity and technology&quot;. Nutt saluted Abe&#x27;s &quot;crisp, clean character design&quot; and the &quot;perfect soundtrack&quot; in his 2005 review of series, saying that &quot;&quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; might not yet be considered a true classic, but it&#x27;s a fascinating evolutionary leap that helped change the future of anime.&quot; &quot;Anime Jump&quot; gave it 4.5/5, and Anime on DVD gave it A+ on all criteria for volume 1 and 2, and a mix of A and A+ for volume 3 and 4.
&quot;Lain&quot; was subject to commentary in the literary and academic worlds. The &quot;Asian Horror Encyclopedia&quot; calls it &quot;an outstanding psycho-horror anime about the psychic and spiritual influence of the Internet&quot;. It notes that the red spots present in all the shadows look like blood pools (see picture). It notes the death of a girl in a train accident is &quot;a source of much ghost lore in the twentieth century&quot;, more so in Tokyo.

The &quot;Anime Essentials&quot; anthology by Gilles Poitras describes it as a &quot;complex and somehow existential&quot; anime that &quot;pushed the envelope&quot; of anime diversity in the 1990s, alongside the much better known contemporaries &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;. Professor Susan J. Napier, in her 2003 reading to the American Philosophical Society called &quot;The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation&quot; (published 2005), compared &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; to &quot;Ghost in the Shell&quot; and Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;Spirited Away&quot;. According to her, the main characters of the two other works cross barriers; they can cross back to our world, but Lain cannot. Napier asks whether there is something to which Lain should return, &quot;between an empty &#x27;real&#x27; and a dark &#x27;virtual&#x27;&quot;. Mike Toole of Anime News Network named &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; as one of the most important anime of the 1990s.

Despite the positive feedback the television series had received, Anime Academy gave the series a 75%, partly due to the &quot;lifeless&quot; setting it had. Michael Poirier of &quot;EX&quot; magazine stated that the last three episodes fail to resolve the questions in other DVD volumes. Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network noted that the English dub was decent, but that the show relied so little on dialogue that it hardly mattered.

===Soundtracks===
The first original soundtrack, &quot;Serial Experiments Lain Soundtrack&quot;, features music by Reichi Nakaido: the ending theme and part of the television series&#x27; score, alongside other songs inspired by the series. The second, &quot;Serial Experiments Lain Soundtrack: Cyberia Mix&quot;, features electronica songs inspired by the television series, including a remix of the opening theme &quot;Duvet&quot; by DJ Wasei. The third, &quot;lain BOOTLEG&quot;, consists of the ambient score of the series across forty-five tracks. &quot;BOOTLEG&quot; also contains a second mixed-mode data and audio disc, containing a clock program and a game, as well as an extended version of the first disc – nearly double the length – across 57 tracks in 128 kbit/s MP3 format, and sound effects from the series in WAV format. Because the word &quot;bootleg&quot; appears in its title, it is easily confused with the Sonmay counterfeit edition of itself, which only contains the first disc in an edited format. All three soundtrack albums were released by Pioneer Records.

The series&#x27; opening theme, &quot;Duvet&quot;, was written and performed in English by the British rock band Bôa. The band released the song as a single and as part of the EP &quot;Tall Snake&quot;, which features both an acoustic version and DJ Wasei&#x27;s remix from &quot;Cyberia Mix&quot;.

===Video game===

On November 26, 1998, Pioneer LDC released a video game with the same name as the anime for the PlayStation. It was designed by Konaka and Yasuyuki, and made to be a &quot;network simulator&quot; in which the player would navigate to explore Lain&#x27;s story. The creators themselves did not call it a game, but &quot;Psycho-Stretch-Ware&quot;, and it has been described as being a kind of visual novel: the gameplay is limited to unlocking pieces of information, and then reading/viewing/listening to them, with little or no puzzle needed to unlock. Lain distances itself even more from classical games by the random order in which information is collected. The aim of the authors was to let the player get the feeling that there are myriads of informations that they would have to sort through, and that they would have to do with less than what exists to understand. As with the anime, the creative team&#x27;s main goal was to let the player &quot;feel&quot; Lain, and &quot;to understand her problems, and to love her&quot;. A guidebook to the game called &quot;Serial Experiments Lain Official Guide&quot; () was released the same month by MediaWorks.

<text>Spontaneous emission is the process in which a quantum mechanical system (such as a molecule, an atom or a subatomic particle) transits from an excited energy state to a lower energy state (e.g., its ground state) and emits a quantized amount of energy in the form of a photon. Spontaneous emission is ultimately responsible for most of the light we see all around us; it is so ubiquitous that there are many names given to what is essentially the same process. If atoms (or molecules) are excited by some means other than heating, the spontaneous emission is called luminescence. For example, fireflies are luminescent. And there are different forms of luminescence depending on how excited atoms are produced (electroluminescence, chemiluminescence etc.). If the excitation is effected by the absorption of radiation the spontaneous emission is called fluorescence. Sometimes molecules have a metastable level and continue to fluoresce long after the exciting radiation is turned off; this is called phosphorescence. Figurines that glow in the dark are phosphorescent. Lasers start via spontaneous emission, then during continuous operation work by stimulated emission.

Spontaneous emission cannot be explained by classical electromagnetic theory and is fundamentally a quantum process. The first person to correctly predict the phenomenon of spontaneous emission was Albert Einstein in a series of papers starting in 1916, culminating in what is now called the Einstein A Coefficient. Einstein&#x27;s quantum theory of radiation anticipated ideas later expressed in quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics by several decades. Later, after the formal discovery of quantum mechanics in 1926, the rate of spontaneous emission was accurately described from first principles by Dirac in his quantum theory of radiation, the precursor to the theory which he later called quantum electrodynamics. Contemporary physicists, when asked to give a physical explanation for spontaneous emission, generally invoke the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field. In 1963, the Jaynes–Cummings model was developed describing the system of a two-level atom interacting with a quantized field mode (i.e. the vacuum) within an optical cavity. It gave the nonintuitive prediction that the rate of spontaneous emission could be controlled depending on the boundary conditions of the surrounding vacuum field. These experiments gave rise to cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), the study of effects of mirrors and cavities on radiative corrections.

==Introduction==
If a light source (&#x27;the atom&#x27;) is in an excited state with energy formula_1, it may spontaneously decay to a lower lying level (e.g., the ground state) with energy formula_2, releasing the difference in energy between the two states as a photon. The photon will have angular frequency formula_3 and an energy formula_4:

:formula_5

where formula_6 is the reduced Planck constant. Note: formula_7, where formula_8 is the Planck constant and formula_9 is the linear frequency. The phase of the photon in spontaneous emission is random as is the direction in which the photon propagates. This is not true for stimulated emission. An energy level diagram illustrating the process of spontaneous emission is shown below:

If the number of light sources in the excited state at time formula_10 is given by formula_11, the rate at which formula_12 decays is:

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the rate of spontaneous emission. In the rate-equation formula_14 is a proportionality constant for this particular transition in this particular light source. The constant is referred to as the &quot;Einstein A coefficient&quot;, and has units s. 
The above equation can be solved to give:

:formula_16

where formula_17 is the initial number of light sources in the excited state, formula_10 is the time and formula_19 is the radiative decay rate of the transition. The number of excited states formula_12 thus decays exponentially with time, similar to radioactive decay. After one lifetime, the number of excited states decays to 36.8% of its original value (formula_21-time). The radiative decay rate formula_22 is inversely proportional to the lifetime formula_23:

:formula_24

==Theory==
Spontaneous transitions were not explainable within the framework of the Schrödinger equation, in which the electronic energy levels were quantized, but the electromagnetic field was not. Given that the eigenstates of an atom are properly diagonalized, the overlap of the wavefunctions between the excited state and the ground state of the atom is zero. Thus, in the absence of a quantized electromagnetic field, the excited state atom cannot decay to the ground state. In order to explain spontaneous transitions, quantum mechanics must be extended to a quantum field theory, wherein the electromagnetic field is quantized at every point in space. The quantum field theory of electrons and electromagnetic fields is known as quantum electrodynamics.

In quantum electrodynamics (or QED), the electromagnetic field has a ground state, the QED vacuum, which can mix with the excited stationary states of the atom. As a result of this interaction, the &quot;stationary state&quot; of the atom is no longer a true eigenstate of the combined system of the atom plus electromagnetic field. In particular, the electron transition from the excited state to the electronic ground state mixes with the transition of the electromagnetic field from the ground state to an excited state, a field state with one photon in it. Spontaneous emission in free space depends upon vacuum fluctuations to get started.

Although there is only one electronic transition from the excited state to ground state, there are many ways in which the electromagnetic field may go from the ground state to a one-photon state. That is, the electromagnetic field has infinitely more degrees of freedom, corresponding to the different directions in which the photon can be emitted. Equivalently, one might say that the phase space offered by the electromagnetic field is infinitely larger than that offered by the atom. This infinite degree of freedom for the emission of the photon results in the apparent irreversible decay, i.e., spontaneous emission.

In the presence of electromagnetic vacuum modes, the combined atom-vacuum system is explained by the superposition of the wavefunctions of the excited state atom with no photon and the ground state atom with a single emitted photon:

:formula_25

where formula_26 and formula_27 are the atomic excited state-electromagnetic vacuum wavefunction and its probability amplitude, formula_28 and formula_29 are the ground state atom with a single photon (of mode formula_30) wavefunction and its probability amplitude, formula_31 is the atomic transition frequency, and formula_32 is the frequency of the photon. The sum is over formula_33 and formula_34, which are the wavenumber and polarization of the emitted photon, respectively. As mentioned above, the emitted photon has a chance to be emitted with different wavenumbers and polarizations, and the resulting wavefunction is a superposition of these possibilities. To calculate the probability of the atom at the ground state (formula_35), one needs to solve the time evolution of the wavefunction with an appropriate Hamiltonian. To solve for the transition amplitude, one needs to average over (integrate over) all the vacuum modes, since one must consider the probabilities that the emitted photon occupies various parts of phase space equally. The &quot;spontaneously&quot; emitted photon has infinite different modes to propagate into, thus the probability of the atom re-absorbing the photon and returning to the original state is negligible, making the atomic decay practically irreversible. Such irreversible time evolution of the atom-vacuum system is responsible for the apparent spontaneous decay of an excited atom. If one were to keep track of all the vacuum modes, the combined atom-vacuum system would undergo unitary time evolution, making the decay process reversible. Cavity quantum electrodynamics is one such system where the vacuum modes are modified resulting in the reversible decay process, see also Quantum revival. The theory of the spontaneous emission under the QED framework was first calculated by Victor Weisskopf and Eugene Wigner in 1930 in a landmark paper. The Weisskopf-Wigner calculation remains the standard approach to spontaneous radiation emission in atomic and molecular physics. Dirac had also developed the same calculation a couple of years prior to the paper by Wigner and Weisskopf.

==Rate of spontaneous emission==
The rate of spontaneous emission (i.e., the radiative rate) can be described by Fermi&#x27;s golden rule. The rate of emission depends on two factors: an &#x27;atomic part&#x27;, which describes
the internal structure of the light source and a &#x27;field part&#x27;, which describes the density of electromagnetic modes of the environment. The atomic part describes the strength of a transition between two states in terms of transition moments. In a homogeneous medium, such as free space, the rate of spontaneous emission in the dipole approximation is given by:

:formula_36

:formula_37

where formula_3 is the emission frequency, formula_39 is the index of refraction, formula_40 is the transition dipole moment, formula_41 is the vacuum permittivity, formula_6 is the reduced Planck constant, formula_43 is the vacuum speed of light, and formula_44 is the fine-structure constant. The expression formula_45 stands for the definition of the transition dipole moment formula_46 for dipole moment operator formula_47, where formula_48 is the elementary charge and formula_49 stands for position operator. (This approximation breaks down in the case of inner shell electrons in high-Z atoms.) The above equation clearly shows that the rate of spontaneous emission in free space increases proportionally to formula_50.

In contrast with atoms, which have a discrete emission spectrum, quantum dots can be tuned continuously by changing their size. This property has been used to check the formula_50-frequency dependence of the spontaneous emission rate as described by Fermi&#x27;s golden rule.

==Radiative and nonradiative decay: the quantum efficiency==
In the rate-equation above, it is assumed that decay of the number of excited states formula_12 only occurs under emission of light. In this case one speaks of full radiative decay and this means that the quantum efficiency is 100%. Besides radiative decay, which occurs under the emission of light, there is a second decay mechanism; nonradiative decay. To determine the total decay rate formula_53, radiative and nonradiative rates should be summed:

:formula_54

where formula_53 is the total decay rate, formula_22 is the radiative decay rate and formula_57 the nonradiative decay rate. The quantum efficiency (QE) is defined as the fraction of emission processes in which emission of light is involved:

:formula_58

In nonradiative relaxation, the energy is released as phonons, more commonly known as heat. Nonradiative relaxation occurs when the energy difference between the levels is very small, and these typically occur on a much faster time scale than radiative transitions. For many materials (for instance, semiconductors), electrons move quickly from a high energy level to a meta-stable level via small nonradiative transitions and then make the final move down to the bottom level via an optical or radiative transition. This final transition is the transition over the bandgap in semiconductors. Large nonradiative transitions do not occur frequently because the crystal structure generally cannot support large vibrations without destroying bonds (which generally doesn&#x27;t happen for relaxation). Meta-stable states form a very important feature that is exploited in the construction of lasers. Specifically, since electrons decay slowly from them, they can be deliberately piled up in this state without too much loss and then stimulated emission can be used to boost an optical signal.

== Radiative cascade ==
If emission leaves a system in an excited state, additional transitions can occur, leading to atomic radiative cascade. For example, if calcium atoms a low pressure atomic beam are excited by ultraviolet light from their in the 41S0 ground state to the 61P1 state, they can decay in three steps, first to 61S0 then to 41P1 and finally to the ground state. The photons from the second and third transitions have correlated polarizations demonstrating quantum entanglement. These correlations were used by John Clauser and Alain Aspect in work that contributed to their 2022 Nobel prize in physics.

<doc id="28220" wikidata="Q181685" url="?curid=28220" title="Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot">
<text>Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot (; 1 June 1796 – 24 August 1832) was a French military engineer and physicist. A graduate of the École polytechnique, Carnot served as an officer in the Engineering Arm (&quot;le génie&quot;) of the French Army. He also pursued scientific studies and in June 1824 published an essay titled &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;. In that book, which would be his only publication, Carnot developed the first successful theory of the maximum efficiency of heat engines.

Carnot&#x27;s scientific work attracted little attention during his lifetime, but in 1834 it became the object of a detailed commentary and explanation by another French engineer, Émile Clapeyron. Clapeyron&#x27;s commentary in turn attracted the attention of William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and Rudolf Clausius. Thomson used Carnot&#x27;s analysis to develop an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale, while Clausius used it to define the concept of entropy, thus formalizing the second law of thermodynamics.

Sadi Carnot was the son of Lazare Carnot, an eminent mathematician, engineer, and commander of the French Revolutionary Army and later of the Napoleonic army. Some of the difficulties that Sadi faced in his own career might have been connected to the persecution of his family by the restored Bourbon monarchy after the fall of Napoleon in 1815. Sadi Carnot died in relative obscurity at the age of 36, but today he is often characterized as the &quot;father of thermodynamics&quot;.

==Life==

=== Family background ===
Sadi Carnot was born in Paris on the 1st of June 1796, at the Petit Luxembourg palace, where his father Lazare resided as one of the five members of the Directory, the highest governing body of the French First Republic in the immediate aftermath of the Thermidorian Reaction. His mother, Sophie &quot;née&quot; Dupont (1764-1813), came from a wealthy family based in Saint-Omer.

Sadi was named by his father Lazare after the 13th-century Persian poet Sadi of Shiraz. An older brother, also named Sadi, had been born in 1794 but died in infancy the following year. &quot;Sadi&quot; is the only given name that appears in the second-born&#x27;s civil birth certificate, dated 14 prairial, year IV in the French Republican calendar. On 11 July 1796 the child was baptized in the Catholic church of Saint-Louis-d&#x27;Antin as &quot;Nicolas-Léonard Dupont&quot;. The principal witness at that baptism was his maternal grandfather, Jacques-Antoine-Léonard Dupont. The father is wrongly identified in the baptismal record as Jacques-Léonard-Joseph-Auguste Dupont (who was, in fact, the child&#x27;s maternal uncle). Following the biographical notice published long after his death by his brother Hippolyte, most sources now give his full name as &quot;Nicolas Léonard Sadi&quot;, but there is no evidence that he ever used any name other than &quot;Sadi&quot;.

Sadi had a younger brother, Hippolyte Carnot, who was born in 1801 in Saint-Omer and who would later become a prominent politician. Hippolyte&#x27;s eldest son Marie François Sadi Carnot served as President of France from 1887 to 1894. Another of Hippolyte&#x27;s sons was the chemist, mining engineer and politician Adolphe Carnot. Sadi himself would remain a bachelor and left no descendants.

=== Education and military career ===
The young Sadi was educated first at home by his father and later at the Lycée Charlemagne, in Paris, where he prepared for the examinations required to enter the École polytechnique, which his father had helped to establish. In 1811, at the age of 16 (the minimum allowed) Sadi Carnot became a cadet of the École polytechnique, where his classmates included the future mathematician Michel Chasles. Among his professors were André-Marie Ampère, Siméon Denis Poisson, François Arago, and Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis. Thus, the school had become renowned for its instruction in mathematics and physics.

During the Battle of Paris in March 1814, Carnot, Chasles, and other cadets of the École polytechnique participated in the defense of Vincennes. This appears to have been Carnot&#x27;s only experience of battle. Carnot graduated in 1814 and was admitted at the École d&#x27;application de l&#x27;artillerie et du génie (&quot;School of Applied Artillery and Military Engineering&quot;) in Metz, where he completed a two-year course. Sadi then became an officer in the French army&#x27;s corps of engineers.

Carnot&#x27;s father Lazare served as Napoleon&#x27;s minister of the interior during the &quot;Hundred Days&quot;, and, after Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat in 1815, Lazare was forced into exile in the German city of Magdeburg. Sadi&#x27;s position in the army, under the restored Bourbon monarchy of King Louis XVIII, became increasingly difficult. Lazare never returned to France, dying in Magdeburg in 1823.

Sadi became a captain in the &quot;Génie&quot; and was posted to various locations, where he inspected fortifications, tracked plans, and wrote many reports. However, it appeared that his recommendations were ignored and that his career was stagnating. On 15 September 1818, at the age of 22, he took a six-month leave to prepare for the entrance examination to the newly formed General Staff in Paris. Carnot passed the exam and joined the General Staff in January of 1819, with the lower rank of lieutenant. He remained on call for military duty, but from then on he dedicated most of his attention to private intellectual pursuits and received only two-thirds pay.

=== Private studies and research ===
In Paris, Carnot befriended Nicolas Clément and Charles-Bernard Desormes and attended lectures on physics and chemistry at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France. He also attended the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers, where he followed the lectures on chemistry by Clément and those on economics by Jean-Baptiste Say. Carnot became interested in understanding the limits to improving the performance of steam engines, which led him to the investigations that became his &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;, published at his own expense in June 1824.

Carnot was finally promoted to his former rank of captain in September of 1827, but the following April he quit the army, having completed only fifteen months of active service and without right to a pension. In a directory of alumni of the École polytechnique published by Ambroise Fourcy in 1828, Carnot is listed as &quot;maker of steam engines&quot;. This and some other indications suggest that Carnot may have been involved in a practical scheme for the improvement of steam engines, but no patents or other concrete evidences of that work have emerged.

=== Views and character ===
Carnot was interested in political economy. His political orientation was liberal, but he seems to have preferred the more interventionist doctrines of Jean de Sismondi to the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies advocated by classical liberal economists like Say and David Ricardo. Out of Carnot&#x27;s private writings on economics only some fragmentary notes survive.

Carnot initially welcomed the July Revolution of 1830, which ended the Bourbonic regime under Charles X and established a new constitutional monarchy under &quot;Citizen King&quot; Louis Philippe. According to his brother Hippolyte, there was some discussion among leaders of the new regime of incorporating Sadi to the Chamber of Peers, as he could be considered to have inherited the Imperial title of &quot;Count Carnot&quot; that Napoleon had bestowed on his father Lazare in 1815. Nothing came of this, however, perhaps because Sadi&#x27;s republican convictions prevented him from accepting a hereditary distinction.

According to recollections published long after Sadi&#x27;s death by his brother Hippolyte, Sadi was an avid reader of Blaise Pascal, Molière and Jean de La Fontaine. Hippolyte recalled that Sadi was a philosophical theist who believed in divine causality but not in divine punishment. Carnot wrote in his private papers that &quot;what to an ignorant man is chance, cannot be chance to one better instructed&quot;. He was critical of established religion, but spoke in favor of &quot;the belief in an all-powerful Being, who loves us and watches over us.&quot;

Hippolyte also described his brother as a talented violin player, interested principally in the music of Jean-Baptiste Lully and Giovanni Battista Viotti, who also cultivated gymnastics, fencing, swimming, dancing, and skating. According to historian of science James F. Challey, &quot;although sensitive and perceptive&quot;, Carnot &quot;appeared extremely introverted, even aloof, to all but a few close friends.&quot; This may help explain why Carnot&#x27;s work failed to make any significant impression within either the scientific or the engineering community during his lifetime.

=== Illness and death ===

In the summer of 1832 Carnot apparently suffered from a severe bout of scarlet fever. On 3 August he was interned in a private sanatorium run by psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Esquirol and located in Ivry, just south of Paris. According to the hospital record, he was cured from &quot;mania&quot; but then died of cholera on 24 August. Carnot was buried in the old cemetery of Ivry, close to what is now the Mairie d&#x27;Ivry station.

==&quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;==

Sadi Carnot&#x27;s contribution to the development of thermodynamics is contained in his only published work, a short book titled &quot;Réflexions sur la puissance motrice du feu et sur les machines propres à développer cette puissance&quot; (&quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire and on Machines Fitted to Develop that Power&quot;) published in Paris in June of 1824 by Bachelier, with Carnot himself paying for the printing of the 600 copies. The work attracted little attention during his lifetime and virtually disappeared from booksellers and libraries. An article published in 1834 (two years after Carnot&#x27;s death and ten years after the publication of his book) by the engineer and fellow &quot;polytechnicien&quot; Émile Clapeyron finally succeeded in calling attention to Carnot&#x27;s work, which some years later was used by Lord Kelvin and Rudolf Clausius to define the concepts of absolute temperature, entropy, and the second law of thermodynamics.

===Background===
Thomas Newcomen invented the first practical piston-operated steam engine in 1712. Some 50 years after that, James Watt made his celebrated improvements, which were responsible for greatly increasing the usefulness of steam engines. When Carnot became interested in the subject in the 1820s, steam engines were in increasingly wide application in industry and their economic importance was widely recognized. Compound engines (engines with more than one stage of expansion) had already been invented, and there was even a crude internal combustion engine, known as the &quot;pyréolophore&quot; and built by the brothers Claude and Nicéphore Niépce, with which Carnot was familiar and which he described in some detail in his book.

That practical work on steam engines and the intuitive understanding among engineers of some of the principles underlying their operation co-existed, however, with an almost complete lack of a scientific understanding of the physical phenomena associated with heat. The principle of conservation of energy had not yet been clearly articulated and the ideas surrounding it were fragmentary and controversial. Carnot himself accepted the view, prevalent in France and associated with the work of Antoine Lavoisier, that heat is a weightless and invisible fluid, called &quot;caloric&quot;, which may be liberated by chemical reactions and which flows from bodies at higher temperature to bodies at lower temperature.

In his book, Carnot sought to answer basic questions: &quot;Is there a limit to the work that can be generated from a given heat source?&quot; and &quot;Can the performance of an engine be improved by replacing steam with a different working fluid?&quot;. Engineers in Carnot&#x27;s time had tried, using highly pressurized steam and other fluids, to improve the efficiency of engines. In these early stages of engine development, the efficiency of a typical engine —the useful work it was able to do when a given quantity of fuel was burned— was only about 5–7%.

Carnot&#x27;s book was only 118 pages long and covered a wide range of topics about heat engines in what Carnot must have intended to be a form accessible to a wide public. He made minimal use of mathematics, which he confined to elementary algebra and arithmetic, except in some footnotes. Carnot discussed the relative merits of air and steam as working fluids, the merits of various aspects of steam-engine design, and even included some ideas of his own regarding possible practical improvements. However, the central part of the book was an abstract treatment of an idealized engine (the Carnot cycle) with which the author sought to clarify the fundamental principles that govern all heat engines, independently of the details of their design or operation. This resulted in an idealized thermodynamic system upon which exact calculations could be made, and avoided the complications introduced by many of the crude features of the contemporary steam engines.

===Carnot cycle===

Carnot considered an idealized process in which heat from a thermal reservoir at a high temperature flows very slowly (and thus reversibly) into the gas contained in a cylinder enclosed by a movable piston. This gives an isothermal expansion of the gas that pushes out the piston and can be used to perform useful work. This does not yet constitute an engine because the piston must be returned to its original position in order for the machine to run cyclically.

Carnot then proposed reducing the temperature of the gas by an adiabatic expansion, during which the cylinder is thermally isolated so as to prevent heat from entering or leaving the gas. Once the temperature of the gas has reached the same value as that of the colder reservoir, the cylinder is put into thermal contact with that reservoir and the gas undergoes an isothermal compression, during which it very slowly (and thus reversibly) rejects heat into the reservoir.

To close the cycle, the temperature of the gas in the cylinder can be raised by adiabatic compression, until it reaches a value equal to the temperature of the hotter reservoir. This succession of isothermal expansion, adiabatic expansion, isothermal compression, and adiabatic compression can then be repeated as many times as desired, generating a net amount of work each time, at the expense of a transfer of heat from the hotter reservoir to the colder reservoir.

As Carnot explained, such a cycle constitutes the most efficient heat engine possible (given the temperatures of the two reservoirs), not only because of the (trivial) absence of friction, heat leakage, or other incidental wasteful processes: The main reason is that it involves no conduction of heat between parts of the engine at different temperatures. Carnot understood that the conduction of heat between bodies at different temperatures is a wasteful and irreversible process, which must be minimized if the heat engine is to achieve its maximum efficiency.

Because Carnot&#x27;s cycle is reversible, it can also be used as a refrigerator: if an external agent supplies the needed mechanical work to move the piston, the sequence of transformations of the gas will absorb heat from the colder reservoir and reject it into the hotter reservoir. Carnot argued that no engine operating between reservoirs at two given temperatures could deliver more work than his reversible cycle. Otherwise, the more efficient engine could run Carnot&#x27;s cycle in reverse as a refrigerator, thus returning all of the &quot;caloric&quot; from the colder back to the hotter reservoir, with some positive amount of work left over to perform a further useful task. Carnot assumed that such a process, in which no net &quot;caloric&quot; was consumed while positive work could be done forever, would be a perpetual motion and therefore forbidden by the laws of physics.

This argument led Carnot to conclude that 

Carnot understood that his idealized engine would have the maximum possible thermal efficiency given the temperatures of the two reservoirs, but he did not calculate the value of that efficiency because of the ambiguities associated with the various temperature scales used by scientists at the time:

=== Phase transitions ===
Later in his book, Carnot considered a heat engine operating very close to the boiling point of water, alcohol, or some other working fluid. The transition between the liquid and vapor phases involves a sudden change in density (and therefore in the volume occupied by the fluid) while a latent heat is needed to transform some amount of the fluid from one phase to the other. By requiring that the volume change associated with such a transition not be available to construct what he characterized as a perpetual motion device, Carnot arrived at what would later be formalized mathematically as the &quot;Clausius–Clapeyron relation&quot;. In the &quot;Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;, theoretical physicist Richard Feynman stresses that this result is due to Carnot and gives a modernized version of Carnot&#x27;s original argument.

In 1849, James Thomson (the elder brother of Lord Kelvin), applied Carnot&#x27;s reasoning to the freezing of water (i.e., the phase transition between liquid water and ice), and concluded that it predicted that the melting point of ice must decrease if an external pressure is applied to it, an effect that no one had ever proposed or studied before. James Thomson&#x27;s prediction was later confirmed experimentally by his brother (the future Lord Kelvin), who found that the data agreed fully with Carnot&#x27;s analysis. Kelvin later said of Carnot&#x27;s argument that &quot;nothing in the whole range of Natural Philosophy is more remarkable than the establishment of general laws by such a process of reasoning.&quot;

=== Reception ===
Carnot published his book in June 1824, and it was presented at that time to the French Academy of Sciences by Pierre-Simon Girard. Girard also published a praiseful but rather broad review of the book in the &quot;Revue encyclopédique&quot;, but after that the book seems to have fallen into obscurity. It was only after the publication of an extensive commentary and explication of Carnot&#x27;s work by Émile Clapeyron in 1834 that engineers and scientists began to take an interest in Carnot&#x27;s contributions. Clapeyron&#x27;s article was translated into English in 1837 and into German in 1843.

Kelvin read Clapeyron&#x27;s paper in 1845, while visiting the Paris laboratory of Henri Regnault, but it was only at the end of 1848 that Kelvin was able to read Carnot&#x27;s original work, in a copy provided to him by Lewis Gordon. Independently of Kelvin, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius also based his study of thermodynamics on Carnot&#x27;s work. Clausius modified Carnot&#x27;s arguments to make them compatible with the mechanical equivalence of heat. This then led Clausius to define the concept of entropy and to formulate the second law of thermodynamics.

Carnot&#x27;s text was re-printed in 1871 in the &quot;Annales Scientifiques&quot; of the École normale supérieure, and again by Gauthier-Villars in 1878 with the collaboration of Hippolyte Carnot. In 1890 an English translation of the book was published by R. H. Thurston. That version has been reprinted in recent decades by Dover. In 1892, Lord Kelvin referred to Carnot&#x27;s essay as &quot;an epoch-making gift to science.&quot;

Carnot published his book in the heyday of steam engines. His theory explained the advantage of engines that use superheated steam, since they absorb heat from a reservoir at a higher temperature. Carnot&#x27;s work did not, however, lead to any immediate practical improvements of steam technologies. It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that engineers deliberately implemented Carnot&#x27;s key concepts: that the efficiency of a heat is improved by increasing the temperature at which heat is drawn and by minimizing the flow of heat between bodies at different temperatures. In particular, Rudolf Diesel used Carnot&#x27;s analysis in his design of the diesel engine, in which heat is injected at a much higher temperature than in the older steam engines, and in which the heat from the combustion of the fuel goes primarily into expanding the air in the cylinder (rather than into increasing its temperature).

== Death and posterity ==
Sadi&#x27;s younger brother Hippolyte obscured the details of Sadi&#x27;s death and destroyed most of his personal papers. Much later, in 1878, when Carnot&#x27;s essay had come to be widely recognized as a founding document of the new science of thermodynamics, Hippolyte sponsored the publication of a new edition that included a &quot;Biographical notice on Sadi Carnot&quot; written by Hippolyte, along with some &quot;Excerpts from unpublished notes by Sadi on mathematics, physics and other subjects&quot;. These are the only sources of information on many aspects of Sadi&#x27;s life and thought. In the opinion of historian of science Arthur Birembaut, the &quot;smokescreen&quot; that Hippolyte drew over his brother&#x27;s life makes it impossible now to reconstruct the details of Sadi&#x27;s career, his relationship with other physicists and engineers, and the circumstances of his death.

Among the private notes published by Hippolyte in 1878 there is material indicating that Sadi Carnot had, by the spring of 1832, rejected the caloric theory and accepted the equivalence of heat and work. In his notes, Carnot wrote that

In those same notes Carnot estimated that 1 kilocalorie is the equivalent of 370 kg·m, whereas the currently accepted value is 427 kg·m. Carnot did not, however, publish any of that work, and it is possible that his uncertainty about the consequences for the validity of his previous analysis in the &quot;Reflections&quot; of rejecting the caloric theory might explain why he did not follow up on his work of 1824 before his untimely death.

Following the work of Kelvin and Clausius, Carnot came to be widely regarded as the &quot;father of thermodynamics&quot;. In 1970 the International Astronomical Union named the lunar crater Carnot in his honor. In 1991 the minor planet 12289 was also named after Carnot.

<text>The Sydney Opera House is a multi-venue performing arts centre in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Located on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour, it is widely regarded as one of the world&#x27;s most famous and distinctive buildings, and a masterpiece of 20th-century architecture.

Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon and completed by an Australian architectural team headed by Peter Hall, the building was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 20 October 1973, 16 years after Utzon&#x27;s 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The Government of New South Wales, led by the premier, Joseph Cahill, authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government&#x27;s decision to build Utzon&#x27;s design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect&#x27;s ultimate resignation.

The building and its occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour, between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove, adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens, and near to the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

The building comprises multiple performance venues, which together host over 1,800 performances annually, attended by more than 1.4 million people. Performances are presented by numerous performing artists, with many resident companies such as Opera Australia, the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia, the site is visited by more than ten million people annually, and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year. The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust, an agency of the New South Wales State Government.

In 2007 the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, having been listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate since 1980, the National Trust of Australia register since 1983, the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000, the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003, and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005. The Opera House was also a finalist in the &quot;New 7 Wonders of the World&quot; campaign list.

==Description==
The facility features a modern expressionist design, with a series of large precast concrete &quot;shells&quot;, each composed of sections of a sphere of radius, forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers of land and is long and wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as below sea level. The highest roof point is 67 metres above sea-level which is the same height as that of a 22-storey building. The roof is made of 2,194 pre-cast concrete sections, which weigh up to 15 tonnes each.

Although the roof structures are commonly referred to as &quot;shells&quot; (as in this article), they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense. Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance, they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours: glossy white and matte cream. The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper-mill industry.

Apart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building&#x27;s exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales, and brush box glulam.

Of the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.

* Concert Hall: With 2,679 seats, the home of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and used by a large number of other concert presenters. It contains the Sydney Opera House Grand Organ, the largest mechanical tracker action organ in the world, with over 10,000 pipes.
* Joan Sutherland Theatre: A proscenium theatre with 1,507 seats, the Sydney home of Opera Australia and The Australian Ballet. Until 17 October 2012 it was known as the Opera Theatre.
* Drama Theatre: A proscenium theatre with 544 seats, used by the Sydney Theatre Company and other dance and theatrical presenters.
* Playhouse: A non-proscenium end-stage theatre with 398 seats.
* Studio: A flexible space with 280 permanent seats (some of which can be folded up) and a maximum capacity of 400, depending on configuration.
* Utzon Room: A small multi-purpose venue for parties, corporate functions and small productions (such as chamber music performances).
* Yallamundi Rooms: A function space hosting up to 400 people, often used for weddings or business conferences.
* Outdoor Forecourt: A flexible open-air venue with a wide range of configuration options, including the possibility of utilising the Monumental Steps as audience seating, used for a range of community events and major outdoor performances.

Other areas (for example the northern and western foyers) are also used for performances on an occasional basis. Venues are also used for conferences, ceremonies and social functions.

=== Other facilities ===
The building also houses a recording studio, retail shops, cafes, restaurants, bars including the Opera Bar and Opera Kitchen. Guided tours are available, including a frequent tour of the front-of-house spaces, and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members.

==History==

===Origins of the project===

====Site selection====

Planning began in the late 1940s when Eugene Goossens, the Director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music, lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the Sydney Town Hall, was not considered large enough. By 1954 Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of New South Wales Premier Joseph Cahill, who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the central business district.

====Architecture competition 1955–1957====
An international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances, and other presentations.
The jury for the competition were: Professor Henry Ashworth (University of Sydney), Cobden Parkes (New South Wales Government Architect); Professor Leslie Martin (Professor of Architecture of Cambridge University and architect of Royal Festival Hall 1951) and American architect Eero Saarinen.

The winner, announced in Sydney on 29 January 1957, was Danish architect Jørn Utzon. Utzon&#x27;s design was selected by Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 rejects. The runner-up was a Philadelphia-based team assembled by Robert Geddes and George Qualls, both teaching at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design. They brought together a band of Penn faculty and friends from Philadelphia architectural offices, including Melvin Brecher, Warren Cunningham, Joseph Marzella, Walter Wiseman, and Leon Loschetter. Geddes, Brecher, Qualls, and Cunningham went on to found the firm GBQC Architects. The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds. Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project. His office moved to Palm Beach, Sydney in February 1963.

Utzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, architecture&#x27;s highest honour, in 2003. The Pritzker Prize citation read:
===Design development and construction timeline===
====Preparation of site====
The Fort Macquarie Tram Depot, occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. The Opera House was built in four stages: stage I (1957–1959) was planning out the building; stage II (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage III (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells, based upon the image of whales breaching the water; stage IV (1967–1973) interior design and construction.

====Stage I: Podium====
Stage I started on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil &amp; Civic, monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners. The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. But Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind, mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.

====Stage II: Roof====

The shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry, but, early in the design process, the &quot;shells&quot; were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs. However, engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The formwork for using &quot;in-situ&quot; concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.

From 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and ellipsoids) before a workable solution was completed.

The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis, to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected. The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day.

In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup&#x27;s letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: &quot;Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions.&quot; Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup&#x27;s biography, states that &quot;the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise &quot;eureka&quot; moment ...; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove&#x27;s house.&quot;

He goes on to claim that &quot;the existing evidence shows that Arup&#x27;s canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres.&quot; Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, &quot;Utzon&#x27;s Sphere&quot;. It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.

As Peter Murray states in &quot;The Saga of the Sydney Opera House&quot;:

The design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.

The immensely complex design and construction of the shells was completed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd, who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes. The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units and it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height.

The tiles themselves were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs Keramik. It took three years of development to produce the effect Utzon wanted in what became known as the Sydney Tile, 120mm square. It is made from clay with a small percentage of crushed stone.

Ove Arup and Partners&#x27; site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed &quot;erection arch&quot; (developed by Hornibrook&#x27;s engineer Joe Bertony) to support the different roofs before completion. On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.

====Stage III: Interiors====

Stage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry&#x27;s criticism of the project&#x27;s costs and time, along with their impression of Utzon&#x27;s designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).

The cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only A$22.9 million, less than a quarter of the final $102 million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.

The second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.

Following Utzon&#x27;s resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon&#x27;s original acoustic design allowed for only 2,000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3,000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the &quot;shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards.&quot;

====Significant changes to Utzon&#x27;s design====
* The major hall, which was originally to be a multipurpose opera/concert hall, became solely a concert hall, called the Concert Hall. The minor hall, originally for stage productions only, incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre, later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre. As a result, the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large-scale opera and ballet. A theatre, a cinema and a library were also added. These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre &quot;in the round&quot;. These now comprise the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio respectively. These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief, which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used. The layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary &quot;Autopsy on a Dream&quot;, which &quot;chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House&quot;.
* Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).
* The construction of the glass walls: Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass.
* Utzon&#x27;s plywood corridor designs, and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely. His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000, which was considered insufficient. Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer, and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good. The subsequent Todd, Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics, particularly for the performing musicians. The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians&#x27; hearing. The Concert Hall has a very high roof, leading to a lack of early reflections onstage—perspex rings (the &quot;acoustic clouds&quot;) hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an (unsuccessful) attempt to address this problem.

====Completion and cost====
The Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost $102 million. H.R. &quot;Sam&quot; Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973:
Stage I: podium Civil &amp; Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m.
Stage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m.
Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.
Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m. Fees and other costs: $16.5m.

The original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of £3,500,000 ($7 million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 (Australia Day). In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% over budget in real terms.

==== Strike and Workers&#x27; Control ====
In 1972, a construction worker was fired, leading the BLF-affiliated workers to demand his rehiring and a 25% wage increase. In response to this, all the workers were fired, and in revenge the workers broke into the construction site with a crowbar and brought their own toolboxes. Workers&#x27; control was applied to the site for five weeks as the construction workers worked 35 hours a week with improved morale, more efficient organization and fewer people skipping work. The workers agreed to end their work-in when management agreed to give them a 25% wage increase, the right to elect their foremen, four weeks annual leave and a large payment for their troubles.

===Utzon and his resignation===

Before the Sydney Opera House competition, Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built. Utzon&#x27;s submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957 stated:

For the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.

After the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales, the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a &quot;vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office.&quot; His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:
Differences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender.

Utzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client&#x27;s Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC). However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, Harry Ingham Ashworth. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.

Utzon&#x27;s ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was &quot;probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects&quot; and: &quot;The Opera House could become the world&#x27;s foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head.&quot;
In 1965 Utzon was working closely with Ralph Symonds, a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds&#x27;s &quot;knowledge of the design stresses of plywood was extremely sketchy&quot; and that the technical advice was &quot;elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes.&quot; Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup&#x27;s project engineer Michael Lewis as having &quot;other agendas&quot;. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees. Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: &quot;If you don&#x27;t do it, I resign.&quot; Hughes replied: &quot;I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye.&quot;

Utzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes&#x27;s refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later described the situation as &quot;Malice in Blunderland&quot;. In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as &quot;design architect&quot; under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House&#x27;s construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.

Following the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; initially opined: &quot;No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other.&quot; On 17 March 1966, the &quot;Herald&quot; offered the view that: &quot;It was not his [Utzon&#x27;s] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along.&quot;

The Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer-aided design to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of Gehry and blobitecture, as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.

It was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, Steensen Varming, was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over of air per minute, using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.

===Opening===

The Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II, on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9.

===Reconciliation with Utzon; building refurbishment===
In the late 1990s, the Sydney Opera House Trust resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the trust as a design consultant for future work.
In 2004, the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened and renamed &quot;The Utzon Room&quot; in his honour. It contains an original Utzon tapestry (14.00 x 3.70 metres) called &quot;Homage to Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach&quot;. In April 2007, he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre, as it was then known. Utzon died on 29 November 2008.

A state memorial service, attended by Utzon&#x27;s son Jan and daughter Lin, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.

Refurbished Western Foyer and accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son Jan, the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams. The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building&#x27;s &quot;accessibility ambassador&quot; to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.

In 2013, a 60-metre long artwork by artist Reg Mombassa was unveiled at the Sydney Opera House. The Gumscape, Road and Creatures triptych was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House to cover the scaffolding concealing refurbishment building work.

On 29 March 2016, an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called &quot;Les Dés Sont Jetés&quot; (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled &quot;in situ&quot; after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building&#x27;s Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.

In the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works.

==Architectural design role of Peter Hall==
After the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.

Hall completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Hellebæk. Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964.

Hall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back. Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would &quot;never be his own&quot;.

Hall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House. Upon Utzon&#x27;s dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon&#x27;s reinstatement.

When Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure. In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users, the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall. Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls, their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role. With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.

A former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book &quot;Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House&quot;, concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.

==Performance firsts==

During the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform, in 1960.

Various performances were presented prior to the official opening:
* The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973, played by Romola Costantino to an invited audience.
* The first performance of an opera was Larry Sitsky&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; (1965), to a libretto by Mary Durack, in a double-bill with &quot;Dalgerie&quot; by James Penberthy, conducted by Rex Hobcroft; it took place on 25 July 1973.
* The first opera to be performed in what was then known as the Opera Theatre was Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, on 28 September 1973, conducted by the Australian Opera&#x27;s Music Director, Edward Downes. (It had been intended that Peter Sculthorpe&#x27;s work &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; would have this honour, but it was not ready on time. &quot;Rites of Passage&quot; was premiered almost exactly a year later, on 27 September 1974.)
* The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 5 September 1973. It was an all-Wagner orchestral concert performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Charles Mackerras and with Birgit Nilsson as the soprano soloist. The first music played was the Prelude to &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;. The concert closed with the Immolation Scene from &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

After the opening:
* The first violin and piano recital was given by Wanda Wiłkomirska, with pianist Geoffrey Parsons.

==Public and commemorative events==

In 1993, Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose &quot;Icon&quot;, a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House.

During the 2000 Summer Olympics, the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events. The event had a swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event.

In 2006, tiles from the Sydney Opera House were added to the facade of the Tribune Tower in Chicago.

Since 2013, a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments (better known as &#x27;The Toaster&#x27;), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However, the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.

The Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection-screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013.

On 31 December 2013, the venue&#x27;s 40th anniversary year, a New Year fireworks display was mounted for the first time in a decade. The Sydney Opera House hosted an event, &#x27;the biggest blind date&#x27; on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record. The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on 27 June 2018, for 50 years of service.

On 14 June 2019, a state memorial service for former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke was held at the Sydney Opera House.

==Controversies==
The Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones on 5 October 2018. Jones called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise The Everest horse race. Within hours, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian overruled Herron. Two days later, Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the decision, calling the Opera House &quot;the biggest billboard Sydney has&quot;. The NSW Labor Party leader, Luke Foley, and senior federal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese had supported the proposal. The political view was not supported by significant public opinion, with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018. 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW Parliament in the morning. A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81% of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier&#x27;s direction.

===Coronation controversy===
In 2023, the New South Wales Government scrapped plans to light the sails of the Sydney Opera House in honour of the coronation of King Charles.

State Premier Chris Minns argued that the sails had been lit up too often and was costing significant taxpayer money, stating that the cost was somewhere between eighty and one hundred thousand dollars.

<text>Selim II (; ; 28 May 1524 – 15 December 1574), also known as Selim the Blond () or Selim the Drunkard (), was the sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1566 until his death in 1574. He was a son of Suleiman the Magnificent and his wife Hurrem Sultan. Selim had been an unlikely candidate for the throne until his brother Mehmed died of smallpox, his half-brother Mustafa was strangled to death by the order of his father and his brother Bayezid was killed on the order of his father after a rebellion against him and Selim.

During his reign, his grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha exerted significant control over state governance. The conquest of Cyprus and Tunis were notable achievements during his reign but setbacks occurred in the Battle of Lepanto and the failed capture of Astrakhan as part of the war with Russia.

==Early years==
Selim was born on 28 May 1524 in Constantinople during the reign of his father, Suleiman the Magnificent. His mother was Hürrem Sultan, an Orthodox priest&#x27;s daughter, who was the current Sultan&#x27;s concubine at the time. In 1533 or 1534, his mother, Hürrem, was freed and became Suleiman&#x27;s legal wife. He had four brothers, Şehzade Mehmed, Şehzade Bayezid, Şehzade Abdullah and Şehzade Cihangir, and a sister Mihrimah Sultan. In June–July 1530, a three week celebration was organised in Constantinople that centered around the circumcision of Selim, and his elder brothers Mustafa, and Mehmed. The princes were circumcised on 27 June 1530. The festivities ranged from displays of captured enemy items to simulated battles, featuring performances by jugglers and strongmen, as well as reenactments of recent conflicts. Suleiman played a crucial role, observing everything from a loggia in the Hippodrome, while Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha actively oversaw the proceedings and presented extravagant gifts to the sultan and the princes.

In May 1537, he and his brother Mehmed joined their father on his campaign to Corfu. This marked the inaugural military campaign of his sons. Their presence in a military campaign conveyed a message of dynastic continuity. In 1540, the sultan took him and Mehmed with him to spend the winter in Edirne. In June 1541, he and Mehmed once again accompanied their father on his campaign to Buda. In 1542, he was appointed governor of the province of Karaman, after which he went to Konya. Following Mehmed&#x27;s unexpected demise in November 1543, the role of district governorship of Saruhan was assumed by Selim in the spring of 1544. During the summer of 1544, a gathering of family members occurred in Bursa, uniting Selim, his parents Suleiman and Hürrem, his sister Mihrimah, and Mihrimah&#x27;s husband Rüstem Pasha. In the 1548–49 military campaign against the Safavids, Selim was dispatched to Edirne, acting as a substitute for the sultan during the campaign. In 1553, he accompanied his father against the Safavids and kept Suleiman&#x27;s company throughout most of the campaign. During this campaign, his elder half-brother, Mustafa was executed on their father’s orders.

==Succession struggle==
In 1555 a rebellion erupted in northeastern Bulgaria, led by a man claiming to be Şehzade Mustafa. He organised his followers like the Ottoman administration, redistributing taxes and gaining support. Bayezid, aware of the situation, prepared militarily and initiate negotiations. Suleiman sent Sokullu Mehmed Pasha to suppress the uprising. Bayezid&#x27;s envoy convinced the pretender&#x27;s chief vizier to defect, leading to the leader&#x27;s capture and execution in Constantinople on 31 July 1555. Rumors suggested Bayezid orchestrated the revolt, but Suleiman&#x27;s desire to punish him was hindered by his wife Hürrem. Tensions over succession continued, with Bayezid and Selim in rivalry. Strategic maneuvers, including Bayezid&#x27;s relocation to Germiyan, maintained equilibrium in their positions, both poised to return to the capital upon news of their father&#x27;s fate.

Suleiman&#x27;s persistent health concerns prompted efforts to dispel rumors of imminent death. In June 1557, the French ambassador noted Suleiman&#x27;s strategic display of vitality upon returning to Constantinople, countering speculations about succession plans. The dynamics shifted decisively after Hürrem&#x27;s death in April 1558, known for mediating between her sons. Suleiman aimed to secure the cooperation of his sons, Selim and Bayezid, in a plan to reassign them to new, distant governorates. The proposal involved moving Selim from Manisa to Konya and relocating Bayezid from Kütahya to the remote town of Amasya. Both brothers&#x27; sons were also granted governorships in smaller counties adjacent to their fathers&#x27; assignments. In September, Suleiman reassigned his sons, sending Selim to Konya and Bayezid to Amasya. 

In mid-April 1559, Bayezid and his army departed Amasya and advanced toward Ankara. Despite conveying to his father his desire to return to Kütahya, it became evident that his true intention was to attack and eliminate Selim, aiming to be the sole heir to the throne before Suleiman sided with Selim. Upon learning of Bayezid&#x27;s expedition, Suleiman deemed military action necessary, instructing the third vizier Sokullu Mehmed to join Selim with janissaries, accompanied by Rumeli troops. Before Constantinople&#x27;s forces reached Konya, Bayezid altered course southward from Ankara, arriving near Konya by late May 1559. Selim, anticipating the attack, assumed a defensive stance with augmented forces, ultimately prevailing in the engagement on May 30 and 31.

In July 1559, Bayezid embarked on an eastern march from Amasya, accompanied by ten thousand men and four of his sons. By the autumn of the same year, he reached Yerevan, a Safavid town, receiving great respect from its governor. Subsequently, in October, he arrived in Qazvin, where Shah Tahmasp I welcomed him initially with enthusiasm, hosting elaborate parties in his honor. However, in April 1560, on Sultan Suleiman&#x27;s request, Tahmasp imprisoned Bayezid. Both Suleiman and Selim dispatched envoys to Persia to persuade Shah Tahmasp to execute Bayezid. Over the next one and a half years, embassies shuttled between Istanbul and Qazvin. The last Ottoman embassy, arriving on 16 July 1561, had the formal task of attempting to return Bayezid to Istanbul. This delegation included figures like Hüsrev Pasha, Sinan Pasha, Ali Aqa Chavush Bashi, and two hundred officials. 

Suleiman&#x27;s letter accompanying the embassy expressed his willingness to reconfirm the Treaty of Amasya (1555) and foster a new era of Ottoman–Safavid relations. Throughout these diplomatic efforts, Suleiman bestowed numerous gifts on Tahmasp and agreed to pay him for handing over Bayezid—400,000 gold coins were given to Tahmasp. Finally, on 25 September 1561, Tahmasp handed over Bayezid and his four sons, who were subsequently executed near Qazvin by the Ottoman executioner, Ali Aqa Chavush Bashi, using the garroting method. In early 1562, Selim had been appointed as the governor of Kütahya, and following Bayezid&#x27;s death, his last years as a prince were spent peacefully in his court in Kütahya.

==Reign==
=== Accession ===

Selim ascended the throne on 29 September 1566, following the death of his father on 6 September. Initially, his enthronement ceremony occurred in Istanbul, despite the presence of viziers and the military in Szigetvár, Hungary. The ceremony went unrecognised, leading to a request for a new ceremony in Belgrade. On 2 October, three days later, the sultan left Istanbul. In order to safeguard the process of enthronement and accession, the astute grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha maintained the secrecy of Suleiman&#x27;s death until Selim arrived at the army in Belgrade. In Belgrade, a throne was positioned between two tuğs (horsehair battle standards) in front of the imperial tent. The allegiance ceremony was then conducted at that location. The new sultan went to Belgrade without offering the accession bonus, the standing army sought assurances of gratuity and promotion, but the sultan dismissed their request. Consequently, upon entering Istanbul, the army revolted, citing the absence of a proper enthronement ceremony. 

===Character of Selim&#x27;s rule===
In this new political environment, the grand vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha exerted significant control over governance throughout his entire reign. Mehmed Pasha served continuously as grand vizier under Suleiman, and then Selim. Known for strategically placing family members and associates in key positions across the empire, he established a reliable network of proteges. Contemporary accounts highlight Sokollu&#x27;s virtual sovereignty during Selim&#x27;s reign, with the grand vizier effectively managing the empire. Selim&#x27;s limited involvement in governance can be attributed not only to Sokollu&#x27;s dominant role but also to a significant shift in the empire&#x27;s political landscape. The emergence of the court and favourites system, along with the sedentarization of the sultanate, marked Selim&#x27;s reign and later became defining aspects of power struggles among his successors. 

Beginning with Selim, the sultans also abstained from participating in military campaigns, spending most of their time in the palace. Over time during his reign, the janissaries began to increase their power at the expense of the sultan. &quot;Acession money&quot; demanded by the janissaries had increased; they used their power to gain more benefits for their personal lives instead of improving the state. Janissaries were now able to marry and were allowed to enrol their sons in the Corps. 

=== Treaties of Edirne and Speyer ===
In 1568, the treaty of Edirne was concluded, after which the Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian II recognised recent Ottoman conquests in Hungary and continued paying an annual tribute to the sultan. The longstanding Transylvanian issue, a source of conflicts between the Habsburgs and Ottomans, found resolution in the treaty of Speyer during the imperial diet in 1570. In this treaty, John Sigismund Zápolya relinquished his title as the elected king of Hungary, adopting the titles of prince of Transylvania and the adjacent parts of Hungary. Maximilian acknowledged these changes, and John Sigismund accepted Maximilian&#x27;s suzerainty over his principality, which remained a part of the Holy Crown of Hungary. Despite this, the Transylvanian prince continued to be an Ottoman vassal. In essence, the Principality of Transylvania existed in a dual dependency, with its sovereignty constrained by both the sultan and the Habsburg kings of Hungary.

=== Astrakhan expedition ===
In 1569, Selim made an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Astrakhan. One of the most ambitious endeavours during his reign, albeit left unfinished, was the construction of a canal connecting the Don and Volga rivers. Championed by Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, this extensive project involved excavating around 40 miles of challenging terrain. The canal, if completed, aimed to strategically benefit the Ottomans along the northern frontiers, serving to control Muscovy&#x27;s advancement and establishing a base for potential attacks on Safavid Persia. Unfortunately, adverse weather conditions and disorder among the soldiers dispatched to the region hindered the canal&#x27;s completion.

=== Campaigns in the Mediterranean ===

During his reign, naval campaigns unfolded in the Mediterranean. In 1571, the Ottomans seized Cyprus from the Venetians, transforming it into a new province alongside neighboring regions in mainland Anatolia. Initially, the island&#x27;s harsh climate deterred migration, but under state pressure, a considerable number of Turkish settlers eventually established themselves. In the same year, the Holy League, comprising papal, Venetian, and Spanish fleets, retaliated for the capture of Cyprus in the decisive Battle of Lepanto, a significant Christian stronghold. The Ottoman navy suffered a devastating defeat, leading to a year-long reconstruction effort, yet the loss of skilled naval personnel continued to impact the state throughout Selim&#x27;s reign. Despite this setback, the recovery of the fortress of Tunis from Spain in 1574, shortly before Selim&#x27;s death, marked a notable naval success.

=== Architecture === 

Suleiman had left a lasting legacy in Damascus by commissioning the construction of the impressive Takiyya al-Sulaimaniyya mosque along the Barada River, situated outside the city walls. Designed in 1554 by the renowned architect Sinan, it was commonly referred to as the Takiyya, acknowledging the Sufi hostel (tekke or zawiyya) within its courtyard chambers. Selim expanded upon his father&#x27;s mosque by adding the Madrasa Salimiyya in 1566–67. Subsequently, this complex became the starting point for the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. Selim favoured Edirne over Istanbul, demonstrating his affection for the former Ottoman capital, especially relishing visits and hunting sessions in the city. And so he undertook the construction of a significant mosque here. The mosque which is known as Selimiye Mosque, is the largest of all Ottoman mosques, was erected between 1569 and 1575 under the supervision of Sultan Selim&#x27;s chief architect, Mimar Sinan. He also undertook a significant renovation of the Hagia Sophia Mosque from 1572 to 1574 under the guidance of Sinan. This restoration included repairing the buttresses, substituting the wooden minaret with a brick one, and introducing two new minarets. Furthermore, adjacent structures were demolished to create the characteristic courtyard of the imperial mosque.

== Death ==
Selim died after slipping and falling on a marble floor while drunk at the age of fifty on 15 December 1574. He was buried in his tomb in Hagia Sophia Mosque, Istanbul.

==Character==
Selim was known for being a generous supporter of poets and had a strong interest in literature, and wrote poems under the pen name &quot;Selimi&quot;. During his time as the governor of Kütahya, he actively engaged with poetry, surrounding himself with poets, including notable figures like Turak Çelebi. Among his associates, Nigari not only served as a confidante but also played roles as an entertainer and portraitist for the sultan.

He is reputed in the sources of the period to have been a generous monarch, fond of pleasure and entertainment and of drink councils, and who enjoyed the presence of scholars, poets and musicians around him. However, it is stated that he did not appear much in public, and that his father often went to Friday prayer and out among the public; Selim neglected this and spent his time in the palace.

==Family==
===Consorts===
Selim had a Haseki and legal wife, and at least seven others concubines. 
* Nurbanu Sultan, his favorite concubine, Haseki Sultan, legal wife and the mother of his son and successor Sultan Murad III. During Selim&#x27;s reign, her stipend was 1,100 aspers a day. Selim legally married her in 1571, and bestowed upon her 110,000 ducats as a dowry, surpassing the 100,000 ducats that his father bestowed upon his mother Hürrem Sultan. She died on 7 December 1583. 
* Other seven concubines, each mother of one of the other princes. They each received 40 aspers a day. One of these concubines died just after Selim&#x27;s death in December 1574, maybe suicide because of her son’s execution. Another concubine died in childbirth in 1572, with her son, and a third died on 19 April 1577.

===Sons===
Selim had at least eight sons:

<text>Speaker for the Dead is a 1986 science fiction novel by American writer Orson Scott Card, an indirect sequel to the 1985 novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. The book takes place around the year 5270, some 3,000 years after the events in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. However because of relativistic space travel at near-light speed Ender himself is only about 35 years old.

This is the first book to describe the Starways Congress, a high standpoint legislature for the human space colonies, and the Hundred Worlds, the planets with human colonies that are tightly intertwined by Ansible technology, which enables instantaneous communication across any distance.

Like &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, the book won the Nebula Award (1986) and the Hugo Award (1987). &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; was published in a slightly revised edition in 1991. It was followed by &quot;Xenocide&quot; and &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;.

== Setting ==
Some years after the eradication of the Formic species (in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;), Ender Wiggin writes a book called &quot;The Hive Queen&quot;, describing the life of the Formics as described to him by the dormant Formic Queen whom he secretly carries. As humanity uses light-speed travel to establish new colonies, Ender and his sister Valentine age slowly through relativistic travel. Ender&#x27;s older brother, the now-aged Hegemon of Earth, Peter Wiggin, recognizes Ender&#x27;s writings in &quot;The Hive Queen&quot;, and requests Ender write for him once he dies. Ender agrees and authors &quot;The Hegemon&quot;. These two books, written under the pseudonym &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, launch a new spiritual movement of Speakers for the Dead, who have authority to investigate and eulogize a person and their work after their death. &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; also shifts societal opinion about the Formic war, leading humanity to view Ender Wiggin, previously a hero, as responsible for a tragic and cruel xenocide, &#x27;&#x27;, meaning alien, and &#x27;-cide&#x27;, referring to the act of killing, together meaning the act of killing populations of aliens (comparable to genocide).

Three thousand years after the Formic xenocide, humans have spread across the Hundred Worlds, ruled by Starways Congress. A Brazilian Catholic human colony called Milagre is established on the planet Lusitania (1886 S.C.). The planet is home to a sentient species of symbiotic forest dwellers. The colonists (who primarily speak Portuguese) dub them &quot;Pequeninos&quot; (Little Ones) but they are often referred to as &quot;piggies&quot; due to their porcine snouts. Their society is matriarchal and gender-segregated, and their belief system centers around the trees of the forests. The Pequeninos prove to be of great interest to scientists. Since humans had destroyed the only sentient species they had encountered (the Formics), special care is taken to ensure no similar mistakes are made with the Pequeninos. The human colony is fenced in, strictly regulated to limit contact with the Pequeninos to a handful of scientists, and forbidden to share human technology or culture with them.

Shortly after the colony&#x27;s founding, many of the colonists die from the &quot;Descolada&quot; virus (Portuguese for &quot;uncoiled&quot;), which alters DNA and causes terrible pain, rampant cancerous growth of fungus and even extra limbs, decay of healthy tissue, and death. The xenobiologists Gusto and Cida von Hesse manage to create a treatment for the virus before succumbing to it themselves (1936 S.C.), leaving behind their young daughter Novinha.

==Synopsis==

Eight years after the Descolada virus has been brought under control, Xenologer Pipo and his thirteen-year-old son and apprentice Libo have developed a friendship with the Pequeninos. They allow Novinha to join their science team as the colony&#x27;s only xenobiologist after she passes the test at age thirteen. After accidentally sharing information about human genders with a male Pequenino named Rooter, the scientists find Rooter&#x27;s body eviscerated with a sapling planted within it. Guessing this may be a torturous sacrificial ritual, restrictions on studying the Pequeninos are enforced, barring the humans from asking questions directly to Pequeninos.

A few years later, Novinha discovers that every lifeform on Lusitania carries the &quot;Descolada&quot; virus which, though lethal to humans, appears to serve a beneficial purpose to native lifeforms. When Pipo learns of this, he suddenly has an insight, and before he tells the others, races off to talk to the Pequeninos. Libo and Novinha find Pipo&#x27;s body cut open just as Rooter&#x27;s had been, but with no sapling planted. As Pipo&#x27;s death appears unprovoked, the Pequeninos are now considered a threat by the Starways Congress and restrictions on studying them are tightened. Distraught, Novinha makes a call for a Speaker for the Dead for Pipo. She is in love with Libo but fears that if he sees her files of research he will make the same discovery as Pipo and meet the same fate. She marries another colonist, Marcos Ribeira, so as to lock her files from being opened.

Andrew Wiggin, unbeknownst by others to be the Ender Wiggin responsible for the Formic xenocide, lives innocuously on the planet Trondheim. He responds to Novinha&#x27;s call, parting with his sister, Valentine, who had traveled with him but is now settled with a family. He travels with an artificial intelligence named Jane who communicates with Ender through a jewel earring; she was born in the Ansible network that enables faster-than-light communications and keeps her existence secret. After relativistic travel, Ender arrives at Lusitania 22 years later (1970 S.C.), finding that Novinha canceled her request for a Speaker five days after sending it. In the intervening time, Libo died in the same manner as Pipo, and Marcos succumbed to a chronic illness. Novinha&#x27;s eldest children, Ela and Miro, have requested a Speaker for Libo and Marcos. Ender, gaining access to all of the appropriate files, learns of tension since Pipo&#x27;s death: Novinha has turned away from xenobiology to study crop growth and had a loveless abusive relationship with Marcos; Miro has secretly worked with Libo&#x27;s daughter Ouanda to continue to study the Pequeninos, breaking the law to share human technology and knowledge with them. Miro and Ouanda have fallen in love. With Ender&#x27;s arrival, Miro tells him that one of the Pequeninos, Human, has taken a great interest in Ender, and Ender becomes aware that Human can hear messages from the Formic Hive Queen. Ender discovers that Marcos was infertile: all six of Novinha&#x27;s children were fathered by Libo. Ender also learns what Pipo had seen in Novinha&#x27;s data.

As word of Miro&#x27;s and Ouanda&#x27;s illegal sharing of human technology with the Pequeninos is reported to Congress, Ender secretly meets with the Pequeninos. They know his true identity and they implore him to help them be part of civilization, while the Formic Queen tells Ender that Lusitania would be an ideal place to restart the hive, as her race can help guide the Pequeninos. Congress orders Miro and Ouanda to be sent off-planet for penal action and the colony be disbanded. Ender delivers his eulogy for Marcos, revealing Novinha&#x27;s infidelity. Miro, distraught to learn that he is Ouanda&#x27;s half-brother, attempts to escape to the Pequeninos, but he suffers neurological damage after he tries to cross the electrified fence. Ender reveals to the colony what Pipo learned: every life form on Lusitania is paired with another through the &quot;Descolada&quot; virus, so that the death of one births the other. In the case of the Pequeninos, they become trees when they die. The colony leaders agree to rebel against Congress, severing their Ansible connection and deactivating the fence, allowing Ender, Ouanda, and Ela to go with Human to speak to the Pequenino wives, to help establish a case to present to Congress.

The Pequenino wives help Ender corroborate the complex life cycle of the Pequeninos, affirming that the death ritual Pipo observed was to help create &quot;fathertrees&quot; who fertilize the Pequenino females to continue their race. The Pequeninos believed they were honoring Pipo, and later Libo, by helping them become fathertrees, but Ender explains that humans lack this &quot;third life&quot;, and if the Pequeninos are to cohabitate with humans, they must respect this difference. To affirm their understanding and agreement, Ender is asked to perform the ritual of giving Human &quot;third life&quot; as a fathertree.

Miro recovers from most of the physical damage from his encounter with the fence, but he is partially paralyzed; Ender transfers Jane to him, and she becomes Miro&#x27;s companion. Valentine and her family decide to travel from Trondheim to Lusitania to help with the revolt and will arrive in some decades due to relativistic travel; Ender sends Miro to meet them halfway. Novinha finally absolves herself of her guilt for the death of Pipo and Libo. She and Ender marry. Ender plants the Hive Queen as per her request, and he writes his third book, a biography of the life of the Pequenino Human.

==Lack of film adaptation==
At the Los Angeles Times Book Festival on April 20, 2013, Card stated that he did not want &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; to be made into a film: &quot;&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is unfilmable,&quot; Card said in response to a question from the audience. &quot;It consists of talking heads, interrupted by moments of excruciating and unwatchable violence. Now, I admit, there&#x27;s plenty of unwatchable violence in film, but never attached to my name. &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, I don&#x27;t want it to be filmed. I can&#x27;t imagine it being filmed.&quot;

==Influence==
Card writes in his introduction to the 1991 edition that he has received letters from readers who have conducted &quot;Speakings&quot; at funerals.

==Reception==

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #91, and stated that &quot;Despite token guilt at his genocide of the sensitively named alien &#x27;buggers;&#x27; (previous book), Ender never suffers for his triumphs - even though Card is strong on suffering for everyone else, and happily cripples a young boy to add needless excitement to the finale. I was impressed by this thoughtful SF adventure, but with reservations ...&quot; AudioFile reviewed the book as &quot;giving life to the emotional and intellectual challenge of the story&quot; and described it as &quot;brilliant and compelling&quot;. Publishers Weekly described it as a &quot;rich and ambitious novel&quot; but &quot;overlong&quot;.

<doc id="28232" wikidata="Q850950" url="?curid=28232" title="Star catalogue">
<text>A star catalogue is an astronomical catalogue that lists stars. In astronomy, many stars are referred to simply by catalogue numbers. There are a great many different star catalogues which have been produced for different purposes over the years, and this article covers only some of the more frequently quoted ones. Star catalogues were compiled by many different ancient people, including the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Persians, and Arabs. They were sometimes accompanied by a star chart for illustration. Most modern catalogues are available in electronic format and can be freely downloaded from space agencies&#x27; data centres. The largest is being compiled from the spacecraft &quot;Gaia&quot; and thus far has over a billion stars.

Completeness and accuracy are described by the faintest limiting magnitude V (largest number) and the accuracy of the positions.

== Historical catalogues ==

=== Ancient Near East ===
From their existing records, it is known that the ancient Egyptians recorded the names of only a few identifiable constellations and a list of thirty-six decans that were used as a star clock. The Egyptians called the circumpolar star &quot;the star that cannot perish&quot; and, although they made no known formal star catalogues, they nonetheless created extensive star charts of the night sky which adorn the coffins and ceilings of tomb chambers.

Although the ancient Sumerians were the first to record the names of constellations on clay tablets, the earliest known star catalogues were compiled by the ancient Babylonians of Mesopotamia in the late 2nd millennium BC, during the Kassite Period (). They are better known by their Assyrian-era name &#x27;Three Stars Each&#x27;. These star catalogues, written on clay tablets, listed thirty-six stars: twelve for &quot;Anu&quot; along the celestial equator, twelve for &quot;Ea&quot; south of that, and twelve for &quot;Enlil&quot; to the north. The Mul.Apin lists, dated to sometime before the Neo-Babylonian Empire (626–539 BC), are direct textual descendants of the &quot;Three Stars Each&quot; lists and their constellation patterns show similarities to those of later Greek civilization.

=== Hellenistic world and Roman Empire ===
In Ancient Greece, the astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus laid down a full set of the classical constellations around 370 BC. His catalogue &quot;Phaenomena&quot;, rewritten by Aratus of Soli between 275 and 250 BC as a didactic poem, became one of the most consulted astronomical texts in antiquity and beyond. It contained descriptions of the positions of the stars and the shapes of the constellations, and provided information on their relative times of rising and setting.

Approximately in the 3rd century BC, the Greek astronomers Timocharis of Alexandria and Aristillus created another star catalogue. Hipparchus () completed his star catalogue in 129 BC, the earliest known attempt to map the entire sky, which he compared to Timocharis&#x27; and discovered that the longitude of the stars had changed over time. This led him to determine the first value of the precession of the equinoxes. In the 2nd century, Ptolemy () of Roman Egypt published a star catalogue as part of his &quot;Almagest&quot;, which listed 1,022 stars visible from Alexandria. Ptolemy&#x27;s catalogue was based almost entirely on an earlier one by Hipparchus. It remained the standard star catalogue in the Western and Arab worlds for over eight centuries. The Islamic astronomer al-Sufi updated it in 964, and the star positions were redetermined by Ulugh Beg in 1437, but it was not fully superseded until the appearance of the thousand-star catalogue of Tycho Brahe in 1598.

The ancient Vedic and other scriptures of India were very well aware of the astronomical positions and constellations. Both &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Ramayana&quot; provide references to various events in terms of the planetary positions and constellations of that time. The Planetary positions at the time of Mahabharata war has been given comprehensively. A very interesting and exhaustive discussion about the planetary positions along with specific name of constellations appears in a paper by R N Iyengar in the &quot;Indian Journal of History of Science&quot;.

=== Ancient China ===

The earliest known inscriptions for Chinese star names were written on oracle bones and date to the Shang dynasty (). Sources dating from the Zhou dynasty ( – 256 BC) which provide star names include the &quot;Zuo Zhuan&quot;, the &quot;Shi Jing&quot;, and the &quot;Canon of Yao&quot; (堯典) in the &quot;Book of Documents&quot;. The &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot; written by the Qin statesman Lü Buwei () provides most of the names for the twenty-eight mansions (i.e. asterisms across the ecliptic belt of the celestial sphere used for constructing the calendar). An earlier lacquerware chest found in the Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng (interred in 433 BC) contains a complete list of the names of the twenty-eight mansions. Star catalogues are traditionally attributed to Shi Shen and Gan De, two rather obscure Chinese astronomers who may have been active in the 4th century BC of the Warring States period (403–221 BC). The &quot;Shi Shen astronomy&quot; (石申天文, Shi Shen tienwen) is attributed to Shi Shen, and the &quot;Astronomic star observation&quot; (天文星占, Tianwen xingzhan) to Gan De.

It was not until the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) that astronomers started to observe and record names for all the stars that were apparent (to the naked eye) in the night sky, not just those around the ecliptic. A star catalogue is featured in one of the chapters of the late 2nd-century-BC history work &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; by Sima Qian (145–86 BC) and contains the &quot;schools&quot; of Shi Shen and Gan De&#x27;s work (i.e. the different constellations they allegedly focused on for astrological purposes). Sima&#x27;s catalogue—the &quot;Book of Celestial Offices&quot; (天官書 Tianguan shu)—includes some 90 constellations, the stars therein named after temples, ideas in philosophy, locations such as markets and shops, and different people such as farmers and soldiers. For his &quot;Spiritual Constitution of the Universe&quot; (靈憲, Ling Xian) of 120 AD, the astronomer Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) compiled a star catalogue comprising 124 constellations. Chinese constellation names were later adopted by the Koreans and Japanese.

=== Islamic world ===
A large number of star catalogues were published by Muslim astronomers in the medieval Islamic world. These were mainly &quot;Zij&quot; treatises, including Arzachel&#x27;s &quot;Tables of Toledo&quot; (1087), the Maragheh observatory&#x27;s &quot;Zij-i Ilkhani&quot; (1272), and Ulugh Beg&#x27;s &quot;Zij-i Sultani&quot; (1437). Other famous Arabic star catalogues include Alfraganus&#x27; &quot;A compendium of the science of stars&quot; (850) which corrected Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;; and al-Sufi&#x27;s &quot;Book of Fixed Stars&quot; (964) which described observations of the stars, their positions, magnitudes, brightness, and colour, drawings for each constellation, and the first known description of the Andromeda Galaxy. Many stars are still known by their Arabic names (see List of Arabic star names).

=== Pre-Columbian Americas ===
The &quot;Motul Dictionary&quot;, compiled in the 16th century by an anonymous author (although attributed to Fray Antonio de Ciudad Real), contains a list of stars originally observed by the ancient Mayas. The Maya Paris Codex also contains symbols for different constellations which were represented by mythological beings.

=== Bayer and Flamsteed catalogues ===
Two systems introduced in historical catalogues remain in use to the present day. The first system comes from the German astronomer Johann Bayer&#x27;s &quot;Uranometria&quot;, published in 1603 and regarding bright stars. These are given a Greek letter followed by the genitive case of the constellation in which they are located; examples are Alpha Centauri or Gamma Cygni. The major problem with Bayer&#x27;s naming system was the number of letters in the Greek alphabet (24). It was easy to run out of letters before running out of stars needing names, particularly for large constellations such as Argo Navis. Bayer extended his lists up to 67 stars by using lower-case Roman letters (&quot;a&quot; through &quot;z&quot;) then upper-case ones (&quot;A&quot; through &quot;Q&quot;). Few of those designations have survived. It is worth mentioning, however, as it served as the starting point for variable star designations, which start with &quot;R&quot; through &quot;Z&quot;, then &quot;RR&quot;, &quot;RS&quot;, &quot;RT&quot;...&quot;RZ&quot;, &quot;SS&quot;, &quot;ST&quot;...&quot;ZZ&quot; and beyond.

The second system comes from the English astronomer John Flamsteed&#x27;s &quot;Historia coelestis Britannica&quot; (1725). It kept the genitive-of-the-constellation rule for the back end of his catalogue names, but used numbers instead of the Greek alphabet for the front half. Examples include 61 Cygni and 47 Ursae Majoris.

Bayer and Flamsteed covered only a few thousand stars between them. In theory, full-sky catalogues try to list every star in the sky. There are, however, billions of stars resolvable by 21st century telescopes, so this is an impossible goal; with this kind of catalog, an attempt is generally made to get every star brighter than a given magnitude.

=== LAL ===

Jérôme Lalande published the &quot;Histoire céleste française&quot; in 1801, which contained an extensive star catalog, among other things. The observations made were made from the Paris Observatory and so it describes mostly northern stars. This catalogue contained the positions and magnitudes of 47,390 stars, out to magnitude 9, and was the most complete catalogue up to that time. A significant reworking of this catalogue by followers of Lalande in 1846 added reference numbers to the stars that are used to refer to some of these stars to this day. The decent accuracy of this catalogue kept it in common use as a reference by observatories around the world throughout the 19th century.

=== BD/CD/CPD ===
The &quot;Bonner Durchmusterung&quot; (&quot;German&quot;: Bonn sampling) and follow-ups were the most complete of the pre-photographic star catalogues.

The &quot;Bonner Durchmusterung&quot; itself was published by Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander, Adalbert Krüger, and Eduard Schönfeld between 1852 and 1859. It covered 320,000 stars in epoch 1855.0.

As it covered only the northern sky and some of the south (being compiled from the Bonn observatory), this was then supplemented by the &quot;Südliche Durchmusterung &quot; (SD), which covers stars between declinations −1 and −23 degrees
(1886, 120,000 stars). It was further supplemented by the &quot;Cordoba Durchmusterung&quot; (580,000 stars), which began to be compiled at Córdoba, Argentina in 1892 under the initiative of John M. Thome and covers declinations −22 to −90. Lastly, the &quot;Cape Photographic Durchmusterung&quot; (450,000 stars, 1896), compiled at the Cape, South Africa, covers declinations −18 to −90.

Astronomers preferentially use the HD designation (see next entry) of a star, as that catalogue also gives spectroscopic information, but as the Durchmusterungs cover more stars they occasionally fall back on the older designations when dealing with one not found in Draper. Unfortunately, a lot of catalogues cross-reference the Durchmusterungs without specifying which one is used in the zones of overlap, so some confusion often remains.

Star names from these catalogues include the initials of which of the four catalogues they are from (though the &quot;Southern&quot; follows the example of the &quot;Bonner&quot; and uses BD; CPD is often shortened to CP), followed by the angle of declination of the star (rounded towards zero, and thus ranging from +00 to +89 and −00 to −89), followed by an arbitrary number as there are always thousands of stars at each angle. Examples include BD+50°1725 or CD−45°13677.

=== HD/HDE ===
The Henry Draper Catalogue was published in the period 1918–1924. It covers the whole sky down to about ninth or tenth magnitude, and is notable as the first large-scale attempt to catalogue spectral types of stars.
The catalogue was compiled by Annie Jump Cannon and her co-workers at Harvard College Observatory under the supervision of Edward Charles Pickering, and was named in honour of Henry Draper, whose widow donated the money required to finance it.

HD numbers are widely used today for stars which have no Bayer or Flamsteed designation. Stars numbered 1–225300 are from the original catalogue and are numbered in order of right ascension for the 1900.0 epoch. Stars in the range 225301–359083 are from the 1949 extension of the catalogue. The notation HDE can be used for stars in this extension, but they are usually denoted HD as the numbering ensures that there can be no ambiguity.

=== AC ===
The &quot;Catalogue astrographique&quot; (Astrographic Catalogue) was part of the international &quot;Carte du Ciel&quot; programme designed to photograph and measure the positions of all stars brighter than magnitude 11.0. In total, over 4.6 million stars were observed, many as faint as 13th magnitude. This project was started in the late 19th century. The observations were made between 1891 and 1950. To observe the entire celestial sphere without burdening too many institutions, the sky was divided among 20 observatories, by declination zones. Each observatory exposed and measured the plates of its zone, using a standardized telescope (a &quot;normal astrograph&quot;) so each plate photographed had a similar scale of approximately 60 arcsecs/mm. The U.S. Naval Observatory took over custody of the catalogue, now in its 2000.2 edition.

=== BS, BSC, HR ===
First published in 1930 as the &quot;Yale Catalog of Bright Stars&quot;, this catalogue contained information on all stars brighter than visual magnitude 6.5 in the &quot;Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue&quot;. The list was revised in 1983 with the publication of a supplement that listed additional stars down to magnitude 7.1. The catalogue detailed each star&#x27;s coordinates, proper motions, photometric data, spectral types, and other useful information.

The last printed version of the Bright Star Catalogue was the 4th revised edition, released in 1982. The 5th edition is in electronic form and is available online.

=== SAO ===
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory catalogue was compiled in 1966 from various previous astrometric catalogues, and contains only the stars to about ninth magnitude for which accurate proper motions were known. There is considerable overlap with the Henry Draper catalogue, but any star lacking motion data at that time is omitted. The epoch for the position measurements in the latest edition is J2000.0. The SAO catalogue contains this major piece of information not in Draper, the proper motion of the stars, so it is often used when that fact is of importance. The cross-references with the Draper and Durchmusterung catalogue numbers in the latest edition are also useful.

Names in the SAO catalogue start with the letters SAO, followed by a number. The numbers are assigned following 18 ten-degree bands in the sky, with stars sorted by right ascension within each band.

=== USNO-B1.0 ===
USNO-B1.0 is an all-sky catalogue created by research and operations astrophysicists at the U.S. Naval Observatory (as developed at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station), that presents positions, proper motions, magnitudes in various optical passbands, and star/galaxy estimators for 1,042,618,261 objects derived from 3,643,201,733 separate observations. The data was obtained from scans of 7,435 Schmidt plates taken for the various sky surveys during the last 50 years. USNO-B1.0 is believed to provide all-sky coverage, completeness down to V = 21, 0.2 arcsecond astrometric accuracy at J2000.0, 0.3 magnitude photometric accuracy in up to five colors, and 85% accuracy for distinguishing stars from non-stellar objects. USNO-B is now followed by NOMAD; both can be found on the Naval Observatory server. The entire 50GB compressed catalog can be downloaded via BitTorrent using instructions from Skychart. The Naval Observatory is currently working on B2 and C variants of the USNO catalogue series.

=== GSC ===

The &quot;Guide Star Catalog&quot; is an online catalogue of stars produced for the purpose of accurately positioning and identifying stars satisfactory for use as guide stars by the Hubble Space Telescope program. The first version of the catalogue was produced in the late 1980s by digitizing photographic plates and contained about 20 million stars, out to about magnitude 15. The latest version of this catalogue contains information for 945,592,683 stars, out to magnitude 21. The latest version continues to be used to accurately position the Hubble Space Telescope.

=== PPM ===
The PPM Star Catalogue (1991) is one of the best, both in the proper motion and star position till 1999. Not as precise as the Hipparcos catalogue but with many more stars. The PPM was built from BD, SAO, HD, and more, with sophisticated algorithm and is an extension for the Fifth Fundamental Catalogue, &quot;Catalogues of Fundamental Stars&quot;.

=== HIP ===
The Hipparcos catalogue was compiled from the data gathered by the European Space Agency&#x27;s astrometric satellite &quot;Hipparcos&quot;, which was operational from 1989 to 1993. The catalogue was published in June 1997 and contains 118,218 stars; an updated version with re-processed data was published in 2007. It is particularly notable for its parallax measurements, which are considerably more accurate than those produced by ground-based observations.

=== Gaia catalogues ===

The Gaia catalogues are based on observations made by the &quot;Gaia&quot; space telescope. They are released in stages that contain increasing amounts of information; the early releases also miss some stars, especially fainter stars located in dense star fields. Data from every data release can be accessed at the &quot;Gaia&quot; archive.

Gaia DR1, the first data release based on 14 months of observations made through September 2015, took place on 13 September 2016. The data release includes positions and magnitudes in a single photometric band for 1.1 billion stars using only &quot;Gaia&quot; data, positions, parallaxes, and proper motions for more than 2 million stars based on a combination of &quot;Gaia&quot; and Tycho-2 data for those objects in both catalogues, light curves, and characteristics for about 3000 variable stars, and positions and magnitudes for more than 2000 extragalactic sources used to define the celestial reference frame. The second data release (DR2), which occurred on 25 April 2018, is based on 22 months of observations made between 25 July 2014 and 23 May 2016. It includes positions, parallaxes, and proper motions for about 1.3 billion stars and positions of an additional 300 million stars, red and blue photometric data for about 1.1 billion stars and single colour photometry for an additional 400 million stars, and median radial velocities for about 7 million stars between magnitude 4 and 13. It also contains data for over 14,000 selected Solar System objects. The first part of the third data release, EDR3 (Early Data Release 3) was released on 3 December 2020. It is based on 34 months of observations and consists of improved positions, parallaxes, and proper motions of over 1.8 billion objects The full DR3, published in June 2022, includes the EDR3 data plus Solar System data; variability information; results for non-single stars, for quasars, and for extended objects; astrophysical parameters; and a special data set, the Gaia Andromeda Photometric Survey (GAPS). The final Gaia catalogue is expected to be released three years after the end of the Gaia mission.

== Specialized catalogues ==
Specialized catalogues make no effort to list all the stars in the sky, working instead to highlight a particular type of star, such as variables or nearby stars.

=== ADS ===
Aitken&#x27;s double star catalogue (1932) lists 17,180 double stars north of declination −30 degrees.

=== Carbon stars ===
Stephenson&#x27;s General Catalogue of galactic Carbon stars is a catalogue of 7000+ carbon stars.

=== Gl, GJ, Wo ===

The Gliese (later Gliese-Jahreiß) catalogue attempts to list all star systems within of Earth ordered by right ascension (see the List of nearest stars). Later editions expanded the coverage to . Numbers in the range 1.0–915.0 (Gl numbers) are from the second edition, which was

:&quot;Catalogue of Nearby Stars&quot; (1969, W. Gliese).
The integers up to 915 represent systems which were in the first edition. Numbers with a decimal point were used to insert new star systems for the second edition without destroying the desired order (by right ascension). This catalogue is referred to as CNS2, although this name is never used in catalogue numbers.

Numbers in the range 9001–9850 (Wo numbers) are from the supplement

:&quot;Extension of the Gliese catalogue&quot; (1970, R. Woolley, E. A. Epps, M. J. Penston and S. B. Pocock).

Numbers in the ranges 1000–1294 and 2001–2159 (GJ numbers) are from the supplement

:&quot;Nearby Star Data Published 1969–1978&quot; (1979, W. Gliese and H. Jahreiß).

The range 1000–1294 represents nearby stars, while 2001–2159 represents suspected nearby stars. In the literature, the GJ numbers are sometimes retroactively extended to the Gl numbers (since there is no overlap). For example, Gliese 436 can be interchangeably referred to as either Gl 436 or GJ 436.

Numbers in the range 3001–4388 are from

:&quot;Preliminary Version of the Third Catalogue of Nearby Stars&quot; (1991, W. Gliese and H. Jahreiß).

Although this version of the catalogue was termed &quot;preliminary&quot;, it is still the current one , and is referred to as CNS3. It lists a total of 3,803 stars. Most of these stars already had GJ numbers, but there were also 1,388 which were not numbered. The need to give these 1,388 &quot;some&quot; name has resulted in them being numbered 3001–4388 (NN numbers, for &quot;no name&quot;), and data files of this catalogue now usually include these numbers. An example of a star which is often referred to by one of these unofficial GJ numbers is GJ 3021.

=== GCTP ===
The General Catalogue of Trigonometric Parallaxes, first published in 1952 and later superseded by the New GCTP (now in its fourth edition), covers nearly 9,000 stars. Unlike the Gliese, it does not cut off at a given distance from the Sun; rather it attempts to catalogue all known measured parallaxes. It gives the co-ordinates in 1900 epoch, the secular variation, the proper motion, the weighted average absolute parallax and its standard error, the number of parallax observations, quality of interagreement of the different values, the visual magnitude, and various cross-identifications with other catalogues. Auxiliary information, including UBV photometry, MK spectral types, data on the variability and binary nature of the stars, orbits when available, and miscellaneous information to aid in determining the reliability of the data are also listed.

=== Proper motion catalogues ===
A common way of detecting nearby stars is to look for relatively high proper motions. Several catalogues exist, of which we&#x27;ll mention a few. The Ross and Wolf catalogues pioneered the domain:

:Ross, Frank Elmore, &quot;New Proper Motion Stars&quot;, eight successive lists, &quot;The Astronomical Journal&quot;, Vol. 36 to 48, 1925–1939

:Wolf, Max, &quot;Katalog von 1053 stärker bewegten Fixsternen&quot;, Veröff. d. Badischen Sternwarte zu Heidelberg (Königstuhl), Bd. 7, No. 10, 1919; and numerous lists in &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;, 209 to 236, 1919–1929

Willem Jacob Luyten later produced a series of catalogues:

L – Luyten, Proper motion stars and White dwarfs
:Luyten, W. J., &quot;Proper Motion Survey with the forty-eight inch Schmidt Telescope&quot;, University of Minnesota, 1941 (&quot;General Catalogue of the Bruce Proper-Motion Survey&quot;)
LFT – Luyten Five-Tenths catalogue
:Luyten, W. J., &quot;A Catalog of 1849 Stars with Proper Motion exceeding 0.5&quot; annually&quot;, Lund Press, Minneapolis (Mn), 1955 (A catalogue of 1849 stars with proper motions exceeding 0.5&quot; annually.)

LHS – Luyten Half-Second catalogue
:Luyten, W. J., &quot;Catalogue of stars with proper motions exceeding 0&quot;5 annually&quot;, University of Minnesota, 1979 (LHS catalogue. A catalogue of stars with proper motions exceeding 0&quot;5 annually)

LTT – Luyten Two-Tenths catalogue
:Luyten, W. J. &quot;Luyten&#x27;s Two Tenths. A catalogue of 9867 stars in the Southern Hemisphere with proper motions exceeding 0&quot;.2 annually&quot;, Minneapolis, 1957; &quot;A catalogue of 7127 stars in the Northern Hemisphere with proper motions exceeding 0&quot;.2 annually``, Minneapolis, 1961; also supplements 1961–1962. ()&quot;

NLTT – New Luyten Two-Tenths catalogue
:Luyten, W. J., &quot;New Luyten Catalogue of stars with proper motions larger than two tenths of an arcsecond (NLTT)&quot;, Univ. of Minnesota, 1979, supplement 1980 (NLTT Catalogue. Volume_III. 0__to -30_.VizieR ???????)

LPM – Luyten Proper-Motion catalogue
: Luyten, W. J., &quot;Proper Motion Survey with the 48 inch Schmidt Telescope&quot;, University of Minnesota, 1963–1981
::LP numbers: L in zones −45 to −89 deg.; LP in zones +89 to −44 deg.

Around the same time period, Henry Lee Giclas worked on a similar series of catalogues:

:Giclas, H. L., et al., &quot;Lowell Proper Motion Survey&quot;, &quot;Lowell Observatory Bulletin&quot;, 1971–1979 (Lowell proper motion survey Northern Hemisphere. The G numbered stars. 8991 stars fainter than magnitude 8 with motions &gt; 0&quot;.26/year)

=== Struve Double Star Catalog ===
Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve discovered a very large number of double stars and in 1827 published his double star catalogue &quot;Catalogus novus stellarum duplicium&quot;. For example, binary star 61 Cygni is designated &quot;Struve 2758&quot; or &quot;STF 2758&quot;. Stars of his catalogue are sometimes indicated by the Greek letter sigma, Σ. Thus, 61 Cygni is also designated as Σ2758.

===uvby98===
The &quot;ubvyβ Photoelectric Photometric Catalogue&quot; is a compilation of previously published photometric data. Published in 1998, the catalogue includes 63,316 stars surveyed through 1996.

=== ZC catalogue ===
The Robertson&#x27;s &quot;Zodiacal Catalogue&quot;, collected by the astronomer James Robertson, is a catalogue of 3539 zodiacal stars brighter than 9th magnitude. It is mainly used for Star Occultations by the Moon.

===Successors to USNO-A, etc===
Stars evolve and move over time, making catalogues evolving, impermanent databases at even the most rigorous levels of production. The USNO catalogues are the most current and widely used astrometric catalogues available at present, and include USNO products such as USNO-B (the successor to USNO-A), NOMAD, UCAC and others in production or narrowly released. Some users may see specialized catalogues (more recent versions of the above), tailored catalogues, interferometrically-produced catalogues, dynamic catalogues, and those with updated positions, motions, colors, and improved errors. Catalogue data is continually collected at the Naval Observatory dark-sky facility, NOFS; and the latest refined, updated catalogues are reduced and produced by NOFS and the USNO. See the USNO Catalog and Image Servers for more information and access.

<doc id="28233" wikidata="Q6322" url="?curid=28233" title="Stellar designations and names">
<text>In astronomy, stars have a variety of different stellar designations and names, including catalogue designations, current and historical proper names, and foreign language names.

Only a tiny minority of known stars have proper names; all others have only designations from various catalogues or lists, or no identifier at all. Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC enumerated about 850 naked-eye stars. Johann Bayer in 1603 listed about twice this number. Only in the 19th century did star catalogues list the naked-eye stars exhaustively. The Bright Star Catalogue, which is a star catalogue listing all stars of apparent magnitude 6.5 or brighter, or roughly every star visible to the naked eye from Earth, contains 9,096 stars. The most voluminous modern catalogues list on the order of a billion stars, out of an estimated total of 200 to 400 billion in the Milky Way.

Proper names may be historical, often transliterated from Arabic or Chinese names. Such transliterations can vary so there may be multiple spellings. A smaller number of names have been introduced since the Middle Ages, and a few in modern times as nicknames have come into popular use, for example &quot;Sualocin&quot; for α Delphini and &quot;Navi&quot; for γ Cassiopeiae.

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun a process to select and formalise unique proper names for the brighter naked-eye stars and for other stars of popular interest. To the IAU, &quot;name&quot; refers to the (usually colloquial) term used for a star in everyday speech, while &quot;&quot;designation&quot; is solely alphanumerical&quot; and used almost exclusively in official catalogues and for professional astronomy. Many of the names and some of the designations in use today were inherited from the time before the IAU existed. Other designations are being added all the time. As of the start of 2019, the IAU had decided on a little over 300 proper names, mostly for the brighter naked-eye stars.

== Proper names ==

Several hundred of the brightest stars had traditional names, most of which derived from Arabic, but a few from Latin. There were a number of problems with these names, however:
* Spellings were often not standardized (Almach or Almaach or Almak or Alamak)
* Many stars had more than one name of roughly equal popularity (Mirfak or Algenib or Alcheb; Regor or Suhail al Muhlif; Alkaid or Benetnasch; Gemma or Alphecca; Alpheratz and Sirrah)
* Because of imprecision in old star catalogs, it was not always clear exactly which star within a constellation a particular name corresponded to (e.g., Alniyat could refer to Sigma Scorpii or Tau Scorpii).
* Some stars in entirely different constellations had the same name: Algenib in Perseus and Algenib in Pegasus; Gienah in Cygnus and Gienah in Corvus, Alnair in Grus and Alnair in Centaurus.

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin dated July 2016 included a table of 125 stars comprising the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN (on 30 June and 20 July 2016) together with names of stars (including four traditional star names: Ain, Edasich, Errai and Fomalhaut) reviewed and adopted by the IAU Executive Committee Working Group on Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign and recognized by the WGSN. Further batches of names were approved on 21 August, 12 September, 5 October and 6 November 2016. These were listed in a table of 102 stars included in the WGSN&#x27;s second bulletin dated November 2016. The next additions were done on 1 February 2017 (13 new star names), 30 June 2017 (29), 5 September 2017 (41), 17 November 2017 (3) and 1 June 2018 (17). All 330 names are included in the current List of IAU-approved Star Names, last updated on 1 June 2018 (with a minor correction posted on 11 June 2018).

In practice, names are only universally used for the very brightest stars (Sirius, Arcturus, Vega, etc.) and for a small number of slightly less bright but &quot;interesting&quot; stars (Algol, Polaris, Mira, etc.). For other naked eye stars, the Bayer or Flamsteed designation is often preferred.

In addition to the traditional names, a small number of stars that are &quot;interesting&quot; can have modern English names. For instance, two second-magnitude stars, Alpha Pavonis and Epsilon Carinae, were assigned the proper names Peacock and Avior respectively in 1937 by Her Majesty&#x27;s Nautical Almanac Office during the creation of &quot;The Air Almanac&quot;, a navigational almanac for the Royal Air Force. Of the fifty-seven stars included in the new almanac, these two had no traditional names. The RAF insisted that all of the stars must have names, so new names were invented for them. These names have been approved by the IAU WGSN.

The book &quot;Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning&quot; by R. H. Allen (1899) has had effects on star names:
*It lists many Assyrian/Babylonian and Sumerian star names recovered by archaeology, and some of these (e.g. Sargas and Nunki) have since been approved by the IAU WGSN.
*It lists many Chinese star names (e.g. Cih alias Tsih), though these have not come into general usage.
*Allen represented the &quot;kh&quot; sound by &#x27;h&#x27; with a dot above (ḣ) and at least one astronomy book (by Patrick Moore), using Allen as a source, has misread this unfamiliar letter as &#x27;li&#x27;.

=== Stars named for individuals ===
A few stars are named for individuals. These are mostly names in common use that were taken up by the scientific community at some juncture. The first such case (discounting characters from mythology) was Cor Caroli (α CVn), named in the 17th century for Charles I of England. The remaining examples are mostly named after astronomers, the best known are probably Barnard&#x27;s Star (which has the highest known proper motion of any star and is thus notable even though it is far too faint to be seen with the naked eye), Kapteyn&#x27;s Star and recently Tabby&#x27;s Star.

The International Astronomical Union has held two NameExoWorlds contests to give proper names to exoplanets and their host stars, in 2014/5 and 2019. As a result, several stars were named after people, including Cervantes for Mu Arae, Copernicus for 55 Cancri A, and Rosalíadecastro (HD 149143) after the writer Rosalía de Castro.

== Catalogue designations ==

In the absence of any better means of designating a star, catalogue designations are generally used. Many star catalogues are used for this purpose; see star catalogues.

===By constellation===
The first modern schemes for designating stars systematically labelled them within their constellation.

*The Bayer designation is such a system, published by Johann Bayer in 1603. It introduced a system of designating the brightest stars in each constellation by means of Greek (or less often Latin) letters, and is still widely used. Bayer generally assigned letters by magnitude class: 1st magnitude stars received the earliest letters in the alphabet, followed by 2nd magnitude stars, and so forth (though there are many exceptions). The original list of Bayer designations contained 1,564 naked-eye stars, and several stars not catalogued by Bayer have been added by subsequent astronomers.
*The Flamsteed designation also lists stars by constellation, but by number rather than letter, ordering them by increasing right ascension rather than by decreasing brightness. These numbers were assigned not by Flamsteed himself but by the French astronomer J. J. Lalande in a French edition of Flamsteed&#x27;s catalogue published in 1783.
*The Gould designation for stars visible from the southern hemisphere, introduced by Benjamin Gould (1879), also lists stars by constellation, numbered by increasing right ascension.
*Hevelius and Bode both numbered stars within constellations similarly. Their number systems have fallen out of use, but their designations even now are occasionally mistakenly treated as Flamsteed designations. 47 Tucanae, a number assigned by Bode, is a famous example.

===Full-sky catalogues===
Full-sky star catalogues detach the star designation from the star&#x27;s constellation and aim at enumerating all stars with apparent magnitude greater than a given cut-off value.

*The &quot;Histoire céleste française&quot; (1801) enumerated 47,390 stars to magnitude 9.
*The &quot;Bonner Durchmusterung&quot; (1859) was the most complete star catalogue compiled without the aid of photography. It listed a total of 320,000 northern stars, expanded by the &quot;Cordoba Durchmusterung&quot; (1892) and the &quot;Cape Photographic Durchmusterung&quot; (1896).
*The &quot;Henry Draper Catalogue&quot; (1924) listed 225,300 stars to magnitude 10, extended to a total of 359,083 in 1949. The HD numbers remain in widespread use for stars that do not have a Flamsteed or Bayer designation.
*The &quot;Bright Star Catalogue&quot; of 1930 listed all stars brighter than magnitude 6. It was supplemented to include stars down to magnitude 7.1 in 1983.
*The &quot;Catalogue astrographique&quot; was compiled between 1891 and 1950 with the aim of listing all stars to magnitude 11, resulting in a list of 4.6 million stars. It is under continued development, now under custody of the U.S. Naval Observatory.
*The USNO-B1.0 catalogue contains over a billion objects, and is also under continued development at the U.S. Naval Observatory.
*The online &quot;Guide Star Catalog II&quot; (2008) contains 945 million stars to magnitude 21.

=== Variable designations ===

Variable stars that do not have Bayer designations are assigned designations in a variable star scheme that superficially extends the Bayer scheme with uppercase Latin letters followed by constellation names, starting with single letters R to Z, and proceeding to pairs of letters. Such designations mark them as variable stars. Examples include R Cygni, RR Lyrae, and GN Andromedae. (Many variable stars also have designations in other catalogues.)

=== Exoplanet searches ===

When a planet is detected around a star, the star is often given a name and number based on the name of the telescope or survey mission that discovered it and based on how many planets have already been discovered by that mission e.g. HAT-P-9, WASP-1, COROT-1, Kepler-4, TRAPPIST-1.

== Sale of star names by non-scientific entities==

Star naming rights are not available for sale via the IAU or any other scientific body. Rather, star names are selected on a non-commercial basis by a small number of international organizations of astronomers, scientists, and registration bodies, who assign names consisting usually of a Greek letter followed by the star&#x27;s constellation name, or less frequently based on their ancient traditional name.

However, there are a number of non-scientific &quot;star-naming&quot; companies that offer to assign personalized nicknames to stars within their own private catalogs. These names are used only by that company and are only available for viewing on their web site or on purchased items. Names by commercial entities are not recognized by the astronomical community, or by competing star-naming companies. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs has issued violation notices against companies which claimed to sell stars or the naming rights to them. A survey conducted by amateur astronomers discovered that just over half of consumers would still want to &quot;name a star&quot; with a non-scientific star-naming company even though they have been warned or informed such naming is not recognized by the astronomical community.

<doc id="28235" wikidata="Q54382" url="?curid=28235" title="Space Shuttle Challenger">
<text>Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; (OV-099) was a Space Shuttle orbiter manufactured by Rockwell International and operated by NASA. Named after the commanding ship of a nineteenth-century scientific expedition that traveled the world, &quot;Challenger&quot; was the second Space Shuttle orbiter to fly into space after &quot;Columbia&quot;, and launched on its maiden flight in April 1983. It was destroyed in January 1986 soon after launch in a disaster that killed all seven crewmembers aboard. 

Initially manufactured as a test article not intended for spaceflight, it was used for ground testing of the Space Shuttle orbiter&#x27;s structural design. However, after NASA found that their original plan to upgrade &quot;Enterprise&quot; for spaceflight would be more expensive than upgrading &quot;Challenger&quot;, the orbiter was pressed into operational service in the Space Shuttle program. Lessons learned from the first orbital flights of &quot;Columbia&quot; led to &quot;Challenger&quot;″s design possessing fewer thermal protection system tiles and a lighter fuselage and wings. This led to it being lighter than &quot;Columbia&quot;, though still heavier than &quot;Discovery&quot;.

During its three years of operation, &quot;Challenger&quot; was flown on ten missions in the Space Shuttle program, spending over 62 days in space and completing almost 1,000 orbits around Earth. Following its maiden flight, &quot;Challenger&quot; supplanted &quot;Columbia&quot; as the leader of the Space Shuttle fleet, being the most-flown orbiter during all three years of its operation while &quot;Columbia&quot; itself was seldom used during the same time frame. &quot;Challenger&quot; was used for numerous civilian satellite launches, such as the first tracking and data relay satellite, the Palapa B communications satellites, the Long Duration Exposure Facility, and the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite. It was also used as a test bed for the Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU) and served as the platform to repair the malfunctioning SolarMax telescope. In addition, three consecutive Spacelab missions were conducted with the orbiter in 1985, one of which being the first German crewed spaceflight mission. Passengers carried into orbit by &quot;Challenger&quot; include the first American female astronaut, the first American female spacewalker, the first African-American astronaut, and the first Canadian astronaut.

On its tenth flight in January 1986, &quot;Challenger&quot; broke up 73 seconds after liftoff, killing the seven-member crew of STS-51-L that included Christa McAuliffe, who would have been the first teacher in space. The Rogers Commission concluded that an O-ring seal in one of &quot;Challenger&quot;″s solid rocket boosters failed to contain pressurized burning gas that leaked out of the booster, causing a structural failure of &quot;Challenger&quot;″s external tank and the orbiter&#x27;s subsequent breakup due to aerodynamic forces. NASA&#x27;s organizational culture was also scrutinized by the Rogers Commission, and the Space Shuttle program&#x27;s goal of replacing the United States&#x27; expendable launch systems was cast into doubt. The loss of &quot;Challenger&quot; and its crew led to a broad rescope of the program, and numerous aspects – such as launches from Vandenberg, the MMU, and Shuttle-Centaur – were scrapped to improve crew safety; &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; were the only orbiters modified to conduct Shuttle-Centaur launches. The recovered remains of the orbiter are mostly buried in a missile silo located at Cape Canaveral LC-31; one piece is on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

==History==
&quot;Challenger&quot; was named after HMS &quot;Challenger&quot;, a British corvette that was the command ship for the &quot;Challenger&quot; Expedition, a pioneering global marine research expedition undertaken from 1872 through 1876. The Apollo 17 Lunar Module, which landed on the Moon in 1972, was also named &quot;Challenger&quot;.

===Construction===
Because of the low production volume of orbiters, the Space Shuttle program decided to build a vehicle as a Structural Test Article, STA-099, that could later be converted to a flight vehicle. The contract for STA-099 was awarded to North American Rockwell on July 26, 1972, and construction was completed in February 1978. After STA-099&#x27;s rollout, it was sent to a Lockheed test site in Palmdale, where it spent over 11 months in vibration tests designed to simulate entire shuttle flights, from launch to landing. To prevent damage during structural testing, qualification tests were performed to a safety factor of 1.2 times the design limit loads. The qualification tests were used to validate computational models, and compliance with the required 1.4 factor of safety was shown by analysis. STA-099 was essentially a complete airframe of a Space Shuttle orbiter, with only a mockup crew module installed and thermal insulation placed on its forward fuselage.
NASA planned to refit the prototype orbiter &quot;Enterprise&quot; (OV-101), used for flight testing, as the second operational orbiter; but &quot;Enterprise&quot; lacked most of the systems needed for flight, including a functional propulsion system, thermal insulation, a life support system, and most of the cockpit instrumentation. Modifying it for spaceflight was considered to be too difficult, expensive, and time-consuming. Since STA-099 was not as far along in the construction of its airframe, it would be easier to upgrade to a flight article. Because STA-099&#x27;s qualification testing prevented damage, NASA found that rebuilding STA-099 into a flightworthy orbiter would be less expensive than refitting &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Work on converting STA-099 to operational status began in January 1979, starting with the crew module (the pressurized portion of the vehicle), as the rest of the vehicle was still being used for testing by Lockheed. STA-099 returned to the Rockwell plant in November 1979, and the original, unfinished crew module was replaced with the newly constructed model. Major parts of STA-099, including the payload bay doors, body flap, wings, and vertical stabilizer, also had to be returned to their individual subcontractors for rework. By early 1981, most of these components had returned to Palmdale to be reinstalled. Work continued on the conversion until July 1982, when the new orbiter was rolled out as &quot;Challenger&quot;.

&quot;Challenger&quot;, as did the orbiters built after it, had fewer tiles in its Thermal Protection System than &quot;Columbia&quot;, though it still made heavier use of the white LRSI tiles on the cabin and main fuselage than did the later orbiters. Most of the tiles on the payload bay doors, upper wing surfaces, and rear fuselage surfaces were replaced with DuPont white Nomex felt insulation. These modifications and an overall lighter structure allowed &quot;Challenger&quot; to carry 2,500 lb (1,100 kg) more payload than &quot;Columbia.&quot; &quot;Challenger&quot;″s fuselage and wings were stronger and lighter than &quot;Columbia&quot;″s. The hatch and vertical-stabilizer tile patterns were different from those of the other orbiters. &quot;Challenger&quot; was the first orbiter to have a heads-up display (HUD) system for use in the descent phase of a mission, and the first to feature Phase I main engines rated for 104% maximum thrust.

===Flights and modifications===
After its first flight in April 1983, &quot;Challenger&quot; quickly became the workhorse of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle fleet, flying six of nine Space Shuttle missions in 1983 and 1984. Even when the orbiters &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; joined the fleet, &quot;Challenger&quot; flew three missions a year from 1983 to 1985. &quot;Challenger&quot;, along with &quot;Atlantis&quot;, was modified at Kennedy Space Center to be able to carry the Centaur-G upper stage in its payload bay. If flight STS-51-L had been successful, &quot;Challenger&quot;″s next mission would have been the deployment of the &quot;Ulysses&quot; probe with the Centaur to study the polar regions of the Sun.

&quot;Challenger&quot; flew the first American woman, African-American, Dutchman, and Canadian into space; carried three Spacelab missions; and performed the first night launch and night landing of a Space Shuttle.

=== Final mission and destruction ===

STS-51-L was the orbiter&#x27;s tenth and final flight, initially planned to launch on January 26, 1986 (after several technical and paperwork delays). The mission attracted huge media attention, as one of the crew was a civilian schoolteacher, Christa McAuliffe, who was assigned to carry out live lessons from the orbiter (as part of NASA&#x27;s Teacher in Space Project). Other members would deploy the TDRS-B satellite and conduct comet observations.

&quot;Challenger&quot; blasted off at 11:38 am EST on January 28, 1986. Just over a minute into the flight, a faulty booster joint opened up, leading to a flame that melted securing struts which resulted in a catastrophic structural failure and explosion of the External Tank. The resulting pressure waves and aerodynamic forces destroyed the orbiter, resulting in the loss of all of the crew.

&quot;Challenger&quot; was the first Space Shuttle to be destroyed in a mission disaster. The collected debris of the vessel is currently buried in decommissioned missile silos at Launch Complex 31, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A section of the fuselage recovered from Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; can also be found at the &quot;Forever Remembered&quot; memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida. Debris from the orbiter sometimes washes up on the Florida coast. This is collected and transported to the silos for storage. Because of its early loss, &quot;Challenger&quot; was the only Space Shuttle that never wore the NASA &quot;meatball&quot; logo, and was never modified with the MEDS &quot;glass cockpit&quot;. The tail was never fitted with a drag chute, which was fitted to the remaining orbiters in 1992. &quot;Challenger&quot; and sister ship &quot;Columbia&quot; are the only two shuttles that never visited the Mir Space Station or the International Space Station. In September 2020 Netflix released &quot;&quot;, a four-part miniseries created by Steven Leckart and Glen Zipper documenting the tragedy firsthand.

=== Lawsuits ===

In March 1988 the federal government and Morton Thiokol Inc. agreed to pay $7.7 million in cash and annuities to the families of four of the seven &quot;Challenger&quot; astronauts as part of a settlement aimed at avoiding lawsuits in the nation&#x27;s worst space disaster, according to government documents.
The documents show that Morton Thiokol, which manufactured the faulty solid rocket boosters blamed for the accident, paid 60 percent, or $4,641,000. The remainder, $3,094,000, was paid by the government.

In September 1988 a federal judge dismissed two lawsuits seeking $3 billion from Space Shuttle rocket-maker Morton Thiokol Inc. by Roger Boisjoly, a former company engineer who warned against the ill-fated 1986 &quot;Challenger&quot; launch.

<text>Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot; (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-101) was the first orbiter of the Space Shuttle system. Rolled out on September 17, 1976, it was built for NASA as part of the Space Shuttle program to perform atmospheric test flights after being launched from a modified Boeing 747. It was constructed without engines or a functional heat shield. As a result, it was not capable of spaceflight.

Originally, &quot;Enterprise&quot; had been intended to be refitted for orbital flight to become the second space-rated orbiter in service. However, during the construction of , details of the final design changed, making it simpler and less costly to build around a body frame that had been built as a test article. Similarly, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was considered for refit to replace &quot;Challenger&quot; after the latter was destroyed, but was built from structural spares instead.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was restored and placed on display in 2003 at the Smithsonian&#x27;s new Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, replaced &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the Udvar-Hazy Center, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; was transferred to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in New York City, where it has been on display since July 2012.

==Differences between &quot;Enterprise&quot; and future shuttles==
The design of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was not the same as that planned for , the first flight model; the aft fuselage was constructed differently, and it did not have the interfaces to mount OMS pods. A large number of subsystems—ranging from main engines to radar equipment—were not installed on &quot;Enterprise&quot;, but the capacity to add them in the future was retained, as NASA originally intended to refit the orbiter for spaceflight at the conclusion of its testing. Instead of a thermal protection system, its surface was primarily covered with simulated tiles made from polyurethane foam. Fiberglass was used for the leading edge panels in place of the reinforced carbon–carbon ones of spaceflight-worthy orbiters. Only a few sample thermal tiles and some Nomex blankets were real. &quot;Enterprise&quot; used fuel cells to generate its electrical power, but these were not sufficient to power the orbiter for spaceflight.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; also lacked reaction control system thrusters and hydraulic mechanisms for the landing gear; the landing gear doors were simply opened through the use of explosive bolts and the gear dropped down solely by gravity. As it was only used for atmospheric testing, &quot;Enterprise&quot; featured a large nose probe mounted on its nose cap, common on test aircraft because the location provides the most accurate readings for the test instruments, being mounted out in front of the disturbed airflow.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was equipped with Lockheed-manufactured zero-zero ejection seats like those its sister carried on its first four missions.

==Construction milestones==
==Service==
Construction began on &quot;Enterprise&quot; on June 4, 1974. Designated OV-101, it was originally planned to be named &quot;Constitution&quot; and unveiled on Constitution Day, September 17, 1976. Fans of &quot;Star Trek&quot; asked US President Gerald Ford, through a letter-writing campaign, to name the orbiter after the television show&#x27;s fictional starship, USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. 

In an official memo, White House advisors cited &quot;hundreds of thousands of letters&quot; from Trekkies, &quot;one of the most dedicated constituencies in the country&quot;, as a reason for giving the shuttle the name. Although Ford did not publicly mention the campaign, the president said that he was &quot;partial to the name&quot; &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and directed NASA officials to change the name.

In mid-1976 the orbiter was used for ground vibration tests, allowing engineers to compare data from an actual flight vehicle with theoretical models.

On September 17, 1976, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was rolled out of Rockwell&#x27;s plant at Palmdale, California. In recognition of its fictional namesake, &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry and most of the principal cast of the original series of &quot;Star Trek&quot; were on hand at the dedication ceremony.

===Approach and landing tests (ALT)===

On January 31, 1977, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was taken by road to Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base to begin operational testing.

While at NASA Dryden &quot;Enterprise&quot; was used by NASA for a variety of ground and flight tests intended to validate aspects of the shuttle program. The initial nine-month testing period was referred to by the acronym &quot;ALT&quot;, for &quot;Approach and Landing Test&quot;. These tests included a maiden &quot;flight&quot; on February 18, 1977, atop a Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) to measure structural loads and ground handling and braking characteristics of the mated system. Ground tests of all orbiter subsystems were carried out to verify functionality prior to atmospheric flight.

The mated &quot;Enterprise&quot;/SCA combination was then subjected to five test flights with &quot;Enterprise&quot; uncrewed and unactivated. The purpose of these test flights was to measure the flight characteristics of the mated combination. These tests were followed with three test flights with &quot;Enterprise&quot; crewed to test the shuttle flight control systems.

On August 12, 1977, &quot;Enterprise&quot; flew on its own for the first time. &quot;Enterprise&quot; underwent four more free flights where the craft separated from the SCA and was landed under astronaut control. These tests verified the flight characteristics of the orbiter design and were used to carry out several aerodynamic and weight configurations. The first three flights were flown with a tailcone placed at the end of &quot;Enterprise&quot; aft fuselage, which reduced drag and turbulence when mated to the SCA. The final two flights saw the tailcone removed and mockup main engine nozzles installed. On the fifth and final glider flight, pilot-induced oscillation problems were revealed, which had to be addressed before the first orbital launch occurred.

===Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test (MGVT)===
Following the conclusion of the ALT test flight program, on March 13, 1978, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was flown once again, but this time halfway across the country to NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Alabama for the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Testing (MGVT). The orbiter was lifted up on a sling very similar to the one used at Kennedy Space Center and placed inside the Dynamic Test Stand building, and mated to the Vertical Mate Ground Vibration Test tank (VMGVT-ET), which in turn was attached to a set of inert Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) to form a complete shuttle launch stack, and marked the first time in the program&#x27;s history that all Space Shuttle elements, an Orbiter, an External Tank (ET), and two SRBs, were mated together. During the course of the program, &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the rest of the launch stack would be exposed to a punishing series of vibration tests simulating as closely as possible those expected during various phases of launch, some tests with and others without the SRBs in place.

===Planned preparations for spaceflight===
At the conclusion of this testing, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was due to be taken back to Palmdale for retrofitting as a fully spaceflight capable vehicle. Under this arrangement, &quot;Enterprise&quot; would be launched on its maiden spaceflight in July 1981 to launch a communications satellite and retrieve the Long Duration Exposure Facility, then planned for a 1980 release on the first operational orbiter, &quot;Columbia&quot;. Afterward, &quot;Enterprise&quot; would conduct two Spacelab missions. However, in the period between the rollout of &quot;Enterprise&quot; and the rollout of &quot;Columbia&quot;, a number of significant design changes had taken place, particularly with regard to the weight of the fuselage and wings. This meant that retrofitting the prototype would have been a much more expensive process than previously realized, involving the dismantling of the orbiter and the return of various structural sections to subcontractors across the country. As a consequence, NASA made the decision to convert an incomplete Structural Test Article, numbered STA-099, which had been built to undergo a variety of stress tests, into a fully flight-worthy orbiter, which became .
===Fit checks===
Following the MGVT program and with the decision to not use &quot;Enterprise&quot; for orbital missions, it was ferried to Kennedy Space Center on April 10, 1979. By June 1979, it was mated with an external tank and solid rocket boosters (known as a boilerplate configuration) and tested in a launch configuration at KSC Launch Complex 39A for a series of fit checks of the facilities there.

After this period, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was returned to NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Facility in September 1981. In 1983 and 1984, &quot;Enterprise&quot; underwent an international tour visiting France, West Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Canada. &quot;Enterprise&quot; also visited California, Alabama, and Louisiana (while visiting the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition). 
Between November 1984 and May 1985, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was again mated with an external tank and solid rocket boosters in a boilerplate configuration for a series of fit checks of the never-used shuttle facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

On November 18, 1985, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was ferried to Washington, D.C., where it became property of the Smithsonian Institution and was stored in the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s hangar at Dulles International Airport.

===Post-&quot;Challenger&quot;===
After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, NASA considered using &quot;Enterprise&quot; as a replacement. Refitting the shuttle with all of the necessary equipment for it to be used in space was considered, but NASA decided to use spare parts constructed at the same time as and to build.

===Post-&quot;Columbia&quot;===
In 2003 after the breakup of during re-entry, the &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board conducted tests at Southwest Research Institute, which used an air cannon to shoot foam blocks of similar size, mass and speed to that which struck &quot;Columbia&quot; at a test structure which mechanically replicated the orbiter wing leading edge. They removed a section of fiberglass leading edge from &quot;Enterprise&quot; wing to perform analysis of the material and attached it to the test structure, then shot a foam block at it. While the leading edge was not broken as a result of the test, which took place on May 29, 2003, the impact was enough to permanently deform a seal and leave a thin gap long. Since the strength of the reinforced carbon–carbon (RCC) on &quot;Columbia&quot; is &quot;substantially weaker and less flexible&quot; than the test section from &quot;Enterprise&quot;, this result suggested that the RCC would have been shattered. A section of RCC leading edge from &quot;Discovery&quot; was tested on June 6, to determine the effects of the foam on a similarly aged leading edge, resulting in a crack on panel 6 and cracking on a T-shaped seal between panels 6 and 7. On July 7, using a leading edge from &quot;Atlantis&quot; and focused on panel 8 with refined parameters stemming from the &quot;Columbia&quot; accident investigation, a second test created a ragged hole approximately in the RCC structure. The tests clearly demonstrated that a foam impact of the type &quot;Columbia&quot; sustained could seriously breach the protective RCC panels on the wing leading edge.

The board determined that the probable cause of the accident was that the foam impact caused a breach of a reinforced carbon-carbon panel along the leading edge of &quot;Columbia&quot; left wing, allowing hot gases generated during re-entry to enter the wing and cause structural collapse. This caused &quot;Columbia&quot; to tumble out of control, breaking up with the loss of the entire crew.

====New Orleans, Louisiana====

In 1984, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was on display during the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition (World&#x27;s Fair) in New Orleans.

====Washington, D.C.====

From 1985 to 2003, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was stored at the Smithsonian&#x27;s hangar at Washington Dulles International Airport before it was restored and moved to the Smithsonian&#x27;s newly built National Air and Space Museum Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington Dulles, where it was the centerpiece of the space collection. On April 12, 2011, NASA announced that , the most traveled orbiter in the fleet, would replace &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the Smithsonian&#x27;s collection once the Shuttle fleet was retired, with ownership of &quot;Enterprise&quot; transferred to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in New York City. On April 17, 2012, &quot;Discovery&quot; was transported by Shuttle Carrier Aircraft to Dulles from Kennedy Space Center, where it made several passes over the Washington D.C. metro area. After &quot;Discovery&quot; had been removed from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, both orbiters were displayed nose-to-nose outside the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center before &quot;Enterprise&quot; was made ready for its flight to New York.

====New York====
On December 12, 2011, ownership of &quot;Enterprise&quot; was officially transferred to the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in New York City. In preparation for the anticipated relocation, engineers evaluated the vehicle in early 2010 and determined that it was safe to fly on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft once again. At approximately 13:40 UTC on April 27, 2012, &quot;Enterprise&quot; took off from Dulles International Airport en route to a fly-by over the Hudson River, New York&#x27;s JFK International Airport, the Statue of Liberty, the George Washington and Verrazano-Narrows Bridges, and several other landmarks in the city, in an approximately 45-minute &quot;final tour&quot;. At 15:23 UTC, &quot;Enterprise&quot; touched down at JFK International Airport.

The mobile Mate-Demate Device and cranes were transported from Dulles to the ramp at JFK and the shuttle was removed from the SCA overnight on May 12, 2012, placed on a specially designed flat bed trailer and returned to Hangar 12. On June 3 a Weeks Marine barge took &quot;Enterprise&quot; to Jersey City. The Shuttle sustained cosmetic damage to a wingtip when a gust of wind blew the barge towards a piling. It was hoisted June 6 onto the Intrepid Museum in Manhattan.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; went on public display on July 19, 2012, at the Intrepid Museum&#x27;s new Space Shuttle Pavilion, a temporary shelter consisting of a pressurized, air-supported fabric bubble constructed on the aft end of the carrier&#x27;s flight deck.

On October 29, 2012, storm surges from Hurricane Sandy caused Pier 86, including the Intrepid Museum&#x27;s visitor center, to flood, and knocked out the museum&#x27;s electrical power and both backup generators. The loss of power caused the Space Shuttle Pavilion to deflate, and high winds from the hurricane caused the fabric of the Pavilion to tear and collapse around the orbiter. Minor damage was spotted on the vertical stabilizer of the orbiter, as a portion of the tail fin above the rudder/speedbrake had broken off. The broken section was recovered by museum staff. While the pavilion itself could not be replaced for some time in 2013, the museum erected scaffolding and sheeting around &quot;Enterprise&quot; to protect it from the environment.

By April 2013, the damage sustained to &quot;Enterprise&quot; vertical stabilizer had been fully repaired, and construction work on the structure for a new pavilion was under way. The pavilion and exhibit reopened on July 10, 2013.

&quot;Enterprise&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 13, 2013, reference number 13000071, in recognition of its role in the development of the Space Shuttle Program. The historic significance criteria are in space exploration, transportation, and engineering.

<text>Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; (OV-102) was a Space Shuttle orbiter manufactured by Rockwell International and operated by NASA. Named after the first American ship to circumnavigate the globe, and the female personification of the United States, &quot;Columbia&quot; was the first of five Space Shuttle orbiters to fly in space, debuting the Space Shuttle launch vehicle on its maiden flight on April 12, 1981 and becoming the first spacecraft to be re-used after its first flight when it launched on STS-2 on November 12, 1981. As only the second full-scale orbiter to be manufactured after the Approach and Landing Test vehicle &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot; retained unique external and internal features compared to later orbiters, such as test instrumentation and distinctive black chines. In addition to a heavier aft fuselage and the retention of an internal airlock throughout its lifetime, these made &quot;Columbia&quot; the heaviest of the five spacefaring orbiters; around heavier than &quot;Challenger&quot; and heavier than &quot;Endeavour&quot; when originally constructed. &quot;Columbia&quot; also carried ejection seats based on those from the SR-71 during its first six flights until 1983, and from 1986 onwards carried an imaging pod on its vertical stabilizer.

During its 22 years of operation, &quot;Columbia&quot; was flown on 28 missions in the Space Shuttle program, spending over 300 days in space and completing over 4,000 orbits around Earth. NASA&#x27;s flagship orbiter, &quot;Columbia&quot; often flew flights dedicated to scientific research in orbit following the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1986. &quot;Columbia&quot; was used for eleven of the fifteen flights of Spacelab laboratories, all four United States Microgravity Payload missions, and the only flight of Spacehab&#x27;s Research Double Module. &quot;Columbia&quot; flew many of the longest duration space shuttle missions, all dedicated to scientific research. The only space shuttle that could rival &quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s long missions was &quot;Endeavour&quot;, which flew the STS-67 mission that lasted for nearly 17 days. In 1992, NASA modified &quot;Columbia&quot; to be able to fly some of the longest missions in the Shuttle Program history using the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. The orbiter used the pallet in thirteen of the pallet&#x27;s fourteen flights, which aided lengthy stays in orbit for scientific and technological research missions. The longest duration flight of the Shuttle Program, STS-80, was flown with &quot;Columbia&quot; in 1996, at over 17 days in orbit. &quot;Columbia&quot; was also used to deploy the first ever satellites into orbit by the Shuttle on STS-5, retrieve the Long Duration Exposure Facility and deploy the &quot;Chandra&quot; observatory, which was the heaviest payload ever carried by the Space Shuttle. &quot;Columbia&quot; also carried into space the first female commander of an American spaceflight mission, the first ESA astronaut, the first female astronaut of Indian origin, and the first Israeli astronaut.

At the end of its final flight in February 2003, &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated upon reentry, killing the seven-member crew of STS-107 and destroying most of the scientific payloads aboard. The &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board convened shortly afterwards concluded that damage sustained to the orbiter&#x27;s left wing during the launch of STS-107 fatally compromised the vehicle&#x27;s thermal protection system. The loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; and its crew led to a refocusing of NASA&#x27;s human exploration programs and led to the establishment of the Constellation program in 2005 and the eventual retirement of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. Numerous memorials and dedications were made to honor the crew following the disaster; the Columbia Memorial Space Center was opened as a national memorial for the accident, and the Columbia Hills in Mars&#x27; Gusev crater, which the &quot;Spirit&quot; rover explored, were named after the crew. The majority of &quot;Columbia&quot;″s recovered remains are stored at the Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Vehicle Assembly Building, though some pieces are on public display at the nearby Visitor Complex.

==History==

Construction began on &quot;Columbia&quot; in 1975 at Rockwell International&#x27;s (formerly North American Aviation/North American Rockwell) principal assembly facility in Palmdale, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. &quot;Columbia&quot; was named after the American sloop &quot;Columbia Rediviva&quot; which, from 1787 to 1793, under the command of Captain Robert Gray, explored the US Pacific Northwest and became the first American vessel to circumnavigate the globe. It is also named after the command module of Apollo 11, the first crewed landing on another celestial body. &quot;Columbia&quot; was also the female symbol of the United States. After construction, the orbiter arrived at Kennedy Space Center on March 25, 1979, to prepare for its first launch. &quot;Columbia&quot; was originally scheduled to lift off in late 1979, however the launch date was delayed by problems with both the RS-25 engine and the thermal protection system (TPS). On March 19, 1981, during preparations for a ground test, workers were asphyxiated in Columbia&#x27;s nitrogen-purged aft engine compartment, resulting in (variously reported) two or three fatalities.
The first flight of &quot;Columbia&quot; (STS-1) was commanded by John Young, a veteran from the Gemini and Apollo programs who in 1972 had been the ninth person to walk on the Moon; and piloted by Robert Crippen, a rookie astronaut originally selected to fly on the military&#x27;s Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL) spacecraft, but transferred to NASA after its cancellation, and served as a support crew member for the Skylab and Apollo-Soyuz missions.

&quot;Columbia&quot; spent 610 days in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF), another 35 days in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB), and 105 days on Pad 39A before finally lifting off. It was successfully launched on April 12, 1981, the 20th anniversary of the first human spaceflight (Vostok 1), and returned on April 14, 1981, after orbiting the Earth 36 times, landing on the dry lakebed runway at Edwards Air Force Base in California. It then undertook three further research missions to test its technical characteristics and performance. Its first operational mission, with a four-man crew, was STS-5, which launched on November 11, 1982. At this point &quot;Columbia&quot; was joined by &quot;Challenger&quot;, which flew the next three shuttle missions, while &quot;Columbia&quot; underwent modifications for the first Spacelab mission.

In 1983, &quot;Columbia&quot;, under the command of John Young on what was his sixth spaceflight, undertook its second operational mission (STS-9), in which the Spacelab science laboratory and a six-person crew was carried, including the first non-American astronaut on a space shuttle, Ulf Merbold. After the flight, it spent 18 months at the Rockwell Palmdale facility beginning in January 1984, undergoing modifications that removed the Orbiter Flight Test hardware and updating it to similar specifications as those of its sister orbiters. At that time the shuttle fleet was expanded to include &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

&quot;Columbia&quot; returned to space on January 12, 1986, with the launch of STS-61-C. The mission&#x27;s crew included Franklin Chang-Diaz, and the first sitting member of the House of Representatives to venture into space, Bill Nelson.

The next shuttle mission, STS-51-L, was undertaken by &quot;Challenger&quot;. It was launched on January 28, 1986, ten days after STS-61-C had landed, and ended in disaster 73 seconds after launch. Prior to the accident, &quot;Columbia&quot; had been slated to be ferried to Vandenberg Air Force Base to conduct fueling tests and to perform a flight readiness firing at SLC-6 to validate the west coast launch site. In the aftermath, NASA&#x27;s shuttle timetable was disrupted, and the Vandenberg tests, which would have cost $60 million, were canceled. &quot;Columbia&quot; was not flown again until 1989 (on STS-28), after which it resumed normal service as part of the shuttle fleet.

STS-93, launched on July 23, 1999, was the first U.S. space mission with a female commander, Lt. Col. Eileen Collins. This mission deployed the Chandra X-ray Observatory.

&quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s final complete mission was STS-109, the fourth servicing mission for the Hubble Space Telescope. Its next mission, STS-107, culminated in the orbiter&#x27;s loss when it disintegrated during reentry, killing all seven of its crew.

Consequently, President George W. Bush decided to retire the Shuttle orbiter fleet by 2010 in favor of the Constellation program and its crewed Orion spacecraft. The Constellation program was later canceled with the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 signed by President Barack Obama on October 11.
===Construction milestones===
==First operational orbiter==

===Weight===
As the second orbiter to be constructed and the first able to fly into space, &quot;Columbia&quot; was roughly heavier than subsequent orbiters such as &quot;Endeavour&quot; when she was first constructed, which had benefited from advances in materials technology. In part, this was due to heavier wing and fuselage spars, the weight of early test instrumentation that remained fitted to the avionics suite, and an internal airlock that, originally fitted into the other orbiters, was later removed in favor of an external airlock to facilitate Shuttle/Mir and Shuttle/International Space Station dockings..&quot;Columbia&quot; was not modified for the planned Centaur-G booster (canceled after the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot;). The retention of the internal airlock allowed NASA to use &quot;Columbia&quot; for the STS-109 Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission, along with the Spacehab double module used on STS-107. Due to &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; higher weight, it was less ideal for NASA to use it for missions to the International Space Station due the performance decreases needed to carry the heavy payloads to the high inclination orbit, though modifications were made to the Shuttle during its last refit in case the spacecraft was needed for such tasks.

===Thermal protection system===
Externally, &quot;Columbia&quot; was the first orbiter in the fleet whose surface was mostly covered with High &amp; Low Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI/LRSI) tiles as its main thermal protection system (TPS), with white silicone rubber-painted Nomex – known as Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI) blankets – in some areas on the wings, fuselage, and payload bay doors. FRSI once covered almost 25% of the orbiter; the first upgrade resulted in its removal from many areas, and in later flights, it was only used on the upper section of the payload bay doors and inboard sections of the upper wing surfaces. The upgrade also involved replacing many of the white LRSI tiles on the upper surfaces with Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) blankets (also known as Fibrous Insulation Blankets, or FIBs) that had been used on &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

Originally, &quot;Columbia&quot; had 32,000 tiles – the upgrade reduced this to 24,300. The AFRSI blankets consisted of layers of pure silica felt sandwiched between a layer of silica fabric on the outside and S-Glass fabric on the inside, stitched together using pure silica thread in a 1-inch grid, then coated with a high-purity silica coating. The blankets were semi-rigid and could be made as large as 30&quot; by 30&quot;. Each blanket replaced as many as 25 tiles and was bonded directly to the orbiter. The direct application of the blankets to the orbiter resulted in weight reduction, improved durability, reduced fabrication, and installation cost, and reduced installation schedule time. All of this work was performed during &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; first retrofitting and the post-&quot;Challenger&quot; stand-down.

Though the orbiter&#x27;s thermal protection system and other enhancements had been refined, &quot;Columbia&quot; would never weigh as little unloaded as the other orbiters in the fleet. The next-oldest shuttle, &quot;Challenger&quot;, was also relatively heavy, although lighter than &quot;Columbia&quot;.

===Markings and insignia===
&quot;Columbia&quot; was the only operational orbiter with black chines. These were added because at first, shuttle designers did not know how reentry heating would affect the craft&#x27;s upper wing surfaces. The chines allowed &quot;Columbia&quot; to be easily recognized at a distance, unlike the subsequent orbiters. The black chines were a late modification and were a high temperature paint over the white FRSI. The chines were modified on &quot;Columbia&quot; shortly before rollover to the Vehicle Assembly Building in late 1980 for STS-1. The only other orbiter with black chines was &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, but it was a cosmetic test article and only gained it when was refurbished.

Additionally, until its last refit, &quot;Columbia&quot; was the only operational orbiter with wing markings consisting of an American flag on the port (left) wing and the letters &quot;USA&quot; on the starboard (right) wing. &quot;Challenger&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; all, until 1998, bore markings consisting of the letters &quot;USA&quot; above an American flag on the left-wing, and the pre-1998 NASA &quot;worm&quot; logotype afore the respective orbiter&#x27;s name on the right-wing. &quot;Enterprise&quot;, the test vehicle which was the prototype for &quot;Columbia&quot;, originally had the same wing markings as &quot;Columbia&quot; but with white chines and the &quot;USA&quot; letters on the right-wing spaced closer together. &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s markings were modified to match &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1983. The name of the orbiter was originally placed on the payload bay doors much like &quot;Enterprise&quot; but was placed on the crew cabin after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster so that the orbiter could be easily identified while in orbit.

From its last refit following the conclusion of STS-93 to its destruction, &quot;Columbia&quot; bore markings identical to those of its operational sister orbiters–the NASA &quot;meatball&quot; insignia on the left-wing and the American flag afore the orbiter&#x27;s name on the right-wing. &quot;Columbia&quot; only flew twice with these markings, STS-109 and STS-107.

===SILTS pod===
Another unique external feature, termed the &quot;SILTS&quot; pod (Shuttle Infrared Leeside Temperature Sensing), was located on the top of &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; vertical stabilizer, and was installed after STS-9 to acquire infrared and other thermal data. Though the pod&#x27;s equipment was removed after initial tests, NASA decided to leave it in place, mainly to save costs, along with the agency&#x27;s plans to use it for future experiments. The vertical stabilizer was later modified to incorporate the drag chute first used on &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1992.

===OEX/MADS &quot;black box&quot;===
One unique feature that permanently stayed on &quot;Columbia&quot; from STS-1 to STS-107 was the OEX (Orbiter Experiments) box or MADS (Modular Auxiliary Data System) recorder. On March 19, 2003, this &quot;black box&quot; was found slightly damaged but fully intact by the U.S. Forest Service in San Augustine County in Texas after weeks of search and recovery efforts after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. The OEX/MADS was not designed to survive a catastrophic loss like an airplane black box.

===Other upgrades===

&quot;Columbia&quot; was originally fitted with Lockheed-built ejection seats identical to those found on the SR-71 Blackbird. These were active for the four orbital test flights, but deactivated after STS-4, and removed entirely after STS-9. &quot;Columbia&quot; was the only spaceworthy orbiter not delivered with head-up displays for the Commander and Pilot, although these were incorporated after STS-9. Like its sister ships, &quot;Columbia&quot; was eventually retrofitted with the new MEDS &quot;glass cockpit&quot; display and lightweight seats.

===Planned future===
Had &quot;Columbia&quot; not been destroyed, it would have been fitted with the external airlock/docking adapter for STS-118, an International Space Station assembly mission, originally planned for November 2003. &quot;Columbia&quot; was scheduled for this mission due to &quot;Discovery&quot; being out of service for its Orbital Major Modification, and because the ISS assembly schedule could not be adhered to with only &quot;Endeavour&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

&quot;Columbia&quot;&#x27;s career would have started to wind down after STS-118. It was to service the Hubble Space Telescope two more times between 2004 and 2005. Following the &quot;Columbia&quot; accident, NASA flew the STS-125 mission using &quot;Atlantis&quot;, combining the planned fourth and fifth servicing missions into one final mission to Hubble. Because of the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet, the batteries and gyroscopes that keep the telescope pointed will eventually fail, which would result in its reentry and breakup in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. A &quot;Soft Capture Docking Mechanism&quot;, based on the docking adapter that was to be used on the Orion spacecraft, was installed during the last servicing mission in anticipation of this event.

==Flights==
&quot;Columbia&quot; flew 28 missions, gathering 300.74 days spent in space with 4,808 orbits and a total distance of until STS-107.

Though having been in service during the Shuttle-Mir and International Space Station programs, &quot;Columbia&quot; did not fly any missions that visited a space station. The other three active orbiters at the time had visited both &quot;Mir&quot; and the ISS at least once. &quot;Columbia&quot; was built according to a heavier earlier design with a reduced payload for ISS missions, so it was decided not to install a Space Station docking system. This made room for longer science modules such as Spacelab and the Spacehab Research Double Module, so &quot;Columbia&quot; was used instead for science missions and for Hubble Space Telescope service.


===Mission and tribute insignias===

* Mission canceled following the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

** Mission flown by &quot;Endeavour&quot; due to loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; on STS-107.

==Final mission and destruction==

&quot;Columbia&quot; was destroyed at about 09:00 EST on February 1, 2003, while re-entering the atmosphere after a 16-day scientific mission. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board determined that a hole was punctured in the leading edge on one of &quot;Columbia&#x27;s&quot; wings, which was made of a carbon composite. The hole had formed when a piece of insulating foam from the external fuel tank peeled off during the launch 16 days earlier and struck the shuttle&#x27;s left wing. During the intense heat of re-entry, hot gases penetrated the interior of the wing, likely compromising the hydraulic system and leading to control failure of the control surfaces. The resulting loss of control exposed minimally protected areas of the orbiter to full-entry heating and dynamic pressures that eventually led to vehicle break up.

The report delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues the board believed contributed to the accident. The report was highly critical of NASA&#x27;s decision-making and risk-assessment processes. Further, the report outlined several potential options for saving the crew which NASA had not considered during the mission, such as a potential rescue with the shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (then being prepped for launch for STS-114), or in-flight repairs for the damaged wing. The nearly 84,000 pieces of collected debris of the vessel are stored in a large room on the 16th-floor of the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center. The collection was opened to the media once and has since been open only to researchers. Unlike &quot;Challenger&quot;, for which a replacement orbiter was built, &quot;Columbia&quot; was not replaced.

The seven crew members who died aboard this final mission were: Rick Husband, Commander; William C. McCool, Pilot; Michael P. Anderson, Payload Commander/Mission Specialist 3; David M. Brown, Mission Specialist 1; Kalpana Chawla, Mission Specialist 2; Laurel Clark, Mission Specialist 4; and Ilan Ramon, Payload Specialist 1.

==Tributes and memorials==

===Patricia Huffman Smith Museum===
The debris field encompassed hundreds of miles across Texas extending into Louisiana and Arkansas. The nose cap and remains of all seven crew members were found in Sabine County, East Texas. The Patricia Huffman Smith NASA Museum &quot;Remembering Columbia&quot; was opened in Hemphill, Sabine County. The museum documents &quot;Columbia&quot; explorations throughout all its missions, including the final STS-107. Its exhibits also show the efforts of local citizens during the recovery period of the &quot;Columbia&quot; shuttle debris and its crew&#x27;s remains. An area is dedicated to each STS-107 crew member, and also to the Texas Forest Service helicopter pilot who died in the recovery effort. The museum houses many objects and artifacts from NASA and its contractors, the families of the STS-107 crew and other individuals. The crew&#x27;s families contributed personal items of the crew members to be on permanent display. The museum features two interactive simulator displays that emulate activities of the shuttle and orbiter, and the digital learning center and its classroom provide educational opportunities.

===Columbia Memorial Space Center===
The Columbia Memorial Space Center is the U.S. national memorial for the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;″s seven crew members. It is located in Downey, California on the site of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s origin and production, the former North American Aviation plant in Los Angeles County, California. The facility is also a hands-on learning center with interactive exhibits, workshops, and classes about space science, astronautics, and the Space Shuttle program&#x27;s legacy—providing educational opportunities for all ages.

===Naming dedications===

The Shuttle&#x27;s final crew was honored in 2003 when the United States Board on Geographic Names approved the name Columbia Point for a mountain in Colorado&#x27;s Sangre de Cristo Mountains, less than a half-mile from Challenger Point, a peak named after America&#x27;s other lost Space Shuttle. The Columbia Hills on Mars were also named in honor of the crew, and a host of other memorials were dedicated in various forms.

The Columbia supercomputer at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division located at Ames Research Center in California was named in honor of the crew lost in the 2003 disaster. Built as a joint effort between NASA and technical partners SGI and Intel in 2004, the supercomputer was used in scientific research of space, the Earth&#x27;s climate, and aerodynamic design of space launch vehicles and aircraft. The first part of the system, built in 2003, was dedicated to STS-107 astronaut and engineer Kalpana Chawla, who prior to joining the Space Shuttle program worked at Ames Research Center.

A female bald eagle at the National Eagle Center in Wabasha, Minnesota is named in tribute to the victims of the disaster.

==In popular culture==
A refurbished &quot;Columbia&quot; features prominently in a 1999 episode of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, being used to rescue series protagonist Spike from burning up in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere after his ship runs out of fuel. &quot;Columbia&quot; is depicted taking off horizontally with the aid of small boosters mounted near its nose. After capturing the stray craft in its cargo bay, &quot;Columbia&quot; encounters trouble on its return to Earth, including a failure of the heat shielding, finally crash landing in a desert with its occupants unharmed. Following the real-world disaster, Adult Swim temporarily removed the episode from its rotation.

In response to the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot;, guitarist Steve Morse of the rock band Deep Purple wrote the instrumental &quot;Contact Lost&quot;, which was featured as the closing track on their 2003 album &quot;Bananas&quot;. It was dedicated to the astronauts who died in the disaster, and Morse&#x27;s songwriting royalties were donated to the families of the lost astronauts. Astronaut and mission specialist engineer Kalpana Chawla, one of the victims of the accident, was a fan of Deep Purple and had exchanged e-mails with the band during the flight, making the tragedy even more personal for the group. She took three CDs into space with her, two of which were Deep Purple albums &quot;Machine Head&quot; and &quot;Purpendicular.&quot; Both CDs survived the destruction of the shuttle and the 39-mile plunge. 

Several songs in popular music give minor tribute to &quot;Columbia&quot;, and some are dedicated. The Eric Johnson instrumental &quot;Columbia&quot; from his 2005 album &quot;Bloom&quot; was written as a commemoration and tribute to the lives that were lost. Johnson said &quot;I wanted to make it more of a positive message, a salute, a celebration rather than just concentrating on a few moments of tragedy, but instead the bigger picture of these brave people&#x27;s lives.&quot; The Canadian Band Rush made a song &#x27;Countdown&#x27; on their album &#x27;Signals&#x27; which is about the first Space Shuttle launch by Columbia. The Scottish band Runrig pays tribute to Clark on the 2016 album &quot;The Story&quot;. The final track, &quot;Somewhere,&quot; ends with a recording of her voice. Clark was a Runrig fan and had a wake up call with Runrig&#x27;s &quot;Running to the Light&quot;. She took &quot;The Stamping Ground&quot; CD into space with her. When the shuttle broke up, the CD was found back on Earth and was presented to the band by her family.

The &quot;Columbia&quot; appears as an exhibit within the Pewter City Museum in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;.

<text>Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-103) is a retired American Space Shuttle orbiter. The spaceplane was one of the orbiters from NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program and the third of five fully operational orbiters to be built. Its first mission, STS-41-D, flew from August 30 to September 5, 1984. Over 27 years of service it launched and landed 39 times, aggregating more spaceflights than any other spacecraft . The Space Shuttle launch vehicle had three main components: the Space Shuttle orbiter, a single-use central fuel tank, and two reusable solid rocket boosters. Nearly 25,000 heat-resistant tiles cover the orbiter to protect it from high temperatures on re-entry.

&quot;Discovery&quot; became the third operational orbiter to enter service, preceded by &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Challenger&quot;. After the Challenger and Columbia accidents, Discovery became the oldest surviving orbiter. It embarked on its final mission, STS-133, on February 24, 2011, and touched down for the last time at Kennedy Space Center on March 9, having spent a cumulative total of nearly a full year in space. &quot;Discovery&quot; performed both research and International Space Station (ISS) assembly missions, and also carried the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit among other satellites. 
&quot;Discovery&quot; was the first operational shuttle to be retired, followed by &quot;Endeavour&quot; and then &quot;Atlantis&quot;. The shuttle is now on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

==History==
The name &quot;Discovery&quot; was chosen to carry on a tradition based on ships of exploration, primarily , one of the ships commanded by Captain James Cook during his third and final major voyage from 1776 to 1779, and Henry Hudson&#x27;s , which was used in 1610–1611 to explore Hudson Bay and search for a Northwest Passage. Other ships bearing the name have included of the 1875–1876 British Arctic Expedition to the North Pole, and , which carried the 1901–1904 &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition to Antarctica, led by Captain Scott.

Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; launched the Hubble Space Telescope and conducted the second and third Hubble service missions. It also launched the &quot;Ulysses&quot; probe and three TDRS satellites. Twice &quot;Discovery&quot; was chosen as the &quot;Return To Flight&quot; Orbiter, first in 1988 after the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1986, and then again for the twin &quot;Return To Flight&quot; missions in July 2005 and July 2006 after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in 2003. Project Mercury astronaut John Glenn, who was 77 at the time, flew with &quot;Discovery&quot; on STS-95 in 1998, making him the oldest person to go into space at that time in history.

Had plans to launch United States Department of Defense payloads from Vandenberg Air Force Base gone ahead, &quot;Discovery&quot; would have become the dedicated US Air Force shuttle. Its first West Coast mission, STS-62-A, was scheduled for 1986, but canceled in the aftermath of the &quot;Challenger disaster&quot;.

On May 27, 1999, &quot;Discovery&quot; was launched on STS-96, the first shuttle mission to dock with the International Space Station.

&quot;Discovery&quot; was retired after completing its final mission, STS-133 on March 9, 2011. The spacecraft is now on display in Virginia at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum.

==Construction milestones==

== Features and upgrades ==


During its construction, &quot;Discovery&quot; was fitted with several black tiles near the middle starboard window where there should have been white tiles. It is unknown if this was the result of a harmless manufacturing mishap or done intentionally to give a distinctive look to the shuttle. This feature has been called &#x27;teardrop&#x27; and allowed &quot;Discovery&quot; to be told apart from the rest of the fleet without looking at its name, although often unnoticed by the uninitiated.

The spacecraft weighed roughly less than &quot;Columbia&quot; when it was brought into service due to optimalizations determined during the construction and testing of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, &quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Challenger&quot;. &quot;Discovery&quot; weighs heavier than &quot;Atlantis&quot; and heavier than &quot;Endeavour&quot; after further weight-saving adjustments were made.

Part of the &quot;Discovery&quot; weight optimizations included the greater use of quilted AFRSI blankets rather than the white LRSI tiles on the fuselage, and the use of graphite epoxy instead of aluminum for the payload bay doors and some of the wing spars and beams.

Upon its delivery to the Kennedy Space Center in 1983, &quot;Discovery&quot; was modified alongside &quot;Challenger&quot; to accommodate the liquid-fueled Centaur-G booster, which had been planned for use beginning in 1986 but was cancelled in the wake of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster.

Beginning in late 1995, the orbiter underwent a nine-month Orbiter Maintenance Down Period (OMDP) in Palmdale, California. This included outfitting the vehicle with a fifth set of cryogenic tanks and an external airlock to support missions to the International Space Station. As with all the orbiters, it could be attached to the top of specialized aircraft and did so in June 1996 when it returned to the Kennedy Space Center, and later in April 2012 when sent to the Udvar-Hazy Center, riding piggy-back on a modified Boeing 747.

After STS-105, &quot;Discovery&quot; became the first of the orbiter fleet to undergo Orbiter Major Modification (OMM) period at the Kennedy Space Center. Work began in September 2002 to prepare the vehicle for Return to Flight. The work included scheduled upgrades and additional safety modifications.

==Decommissioning==

&quot;Discovery&quot; was decommissioned on March 9, 2011. NASA offered &quot;Discovery&quot; to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum for public display and preservation, after a month-long decontamination process, as part of the national collection. &quot;Discovery&quot; replaced &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which was in the Smithsonian&#x27;s display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center until 2011. &quot;Discovery&quot; was transported to Washington Dulles International Airport on April 17, 2012, and was transferred to the Udvar-Hazy on April 19 where a welcome ceremony was held. Afterwards, at around 5:30 pm, &quot;Discovery&quot; was rolled to its &quot;final wheels stop&quot; in the Udvar Hazy Center.
==Flights==

By its last mission, &quot;Discovery&quot; had flown in 39 missions, completed 5,830 orbits, and spent 365 days in orbit over 27 years. &quot;Discovery&quot; flew more flights than any other Orbiter Shuttle, including four in 1985 alone. &quot;Discovery&quot; flew both &quot;return to flight&quot; missions after the &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; disasters: STS-26 in 1988, STS-114 in 2005, and STS-121 in 2006. &quot;Discovery&quot; flew the ante-penultimate mission of the Space Shuttle program, STS-133, having launched on February 24, 2011. &quot;Endeavour&quot; flew STS-134 and &quot;Atlantis&quot; performed STS-135, NASA&#x27;s last Space Shuttle mission. On February 24, 2011, Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; launched from Kennedy Space Center&#x27;s Launch Complex 39-A to begin its final orbital flight.

==Flow directors==
The Flow Director was responsible for the overall preparation of the shuttle for launch and processing it after landing, and remained permanently assigned to head the spacecraft&#x27;s ground crew while the astronaut flight crews changed for every mission. Each shuttle&#x27;s Flow Director was supported by a Vehicle Manager for the same spacecraft. Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;&#x27;s Flow Directors were:
* Until 01/1991: John J. &quot;Tip&quot; Talone Jr. (afterwards Flow Director for &quot;Endeavour&quot;)
* 01/1991 – 09/1992: John C. &quot;Chris&quot; Fairey
* 09/1992 – 10/1996: David A. King
* 10/1996 – 05/2000: W. Scott Cilento
* 12/2000 – 03/2011: Stephanie S. Stilson

<text>Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; (Orbiter Vehicle designation: OV‑104) is a retired Space Shuttle orbiter vehicle which belongs to NASA, the spaceflight and space exploration agency of the United States. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was manufactured by the Rockwell International company in Southern California and was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center in Eastern Florida in April 1985. &quot;Atlantis&quot; is the fourth operational and the second-to-last Space Shuttle built. Its maiden flight was STS-51-J made from October 3 to 7, 1985.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; embarked on its 33rd and final mission, also the final mission of a space shuttle, STS-135, on July 8, 2011. STS-134 by &quot;Endeavour&quot; was expected to be the final flight before STS-135 was authorized in October 2010. STS-135 took advantage of the processing for the STS-335 Launch on Need mission that would have been necessary if STS-134&#x27;s crew became stranded in orbit. &quot;Atlantis&quot; landed for the final time at the Kennedy Space Center on July 21, 2011.

By the end of its final mission, &quot;Atlantis&quot; had orbited the Earth a total of 4,848 times, traveling nearly , which is more than 525 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; is named after RV &quot;Atlantis&quot;, a two-masted sailing ship that operated as the primary research vessel for the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution from 1930 to 1966.

The space shuttle is now on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex.

== Missions ==
Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; lifted off on its maiden voyage STS-51-J on October 3, 1985. This was the second shuttle mission that was a dedicated Department of Defense mission. It flew one other mission, STS-61-B (the second shuttle night launch) before the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster temporarily grounded the shuttle fleet in 1986. Among the five Space Shuttles flown into space, &quot;Atlantis&quot; conducted a subsequent mission in the shortest time after the previous mission (turnaround time) when it launched in November 1985 on STS-61-B, only 50 days after its previous mission, STS-51-J in October 1985. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was then used for ten flights from 1988 to 1992. Two of these, both flown in 1989, deployed the planetary probes &quot;Magellan&quot; to Venus (on STS-30) and &quot;Galileo&quot; to Jupiter (on STS-34). With STS-30 &quot;Atlantis&quot; became the first Space Shuttle to launch an interplanetary probe.


During the launch of STS-27 in 1988, a piece of insulation shed from the right solid rocket booster struck the underside of the vehicle, severely damaging over 700 tiles and removing one tile altogether. The crew were instructed to use the remote manipulator system to survey the condition of the underside of the right wing, ultimately finding substantial tile damage. Due to the classified nature of the mission, the only images transferred to the mission control center were encrypted and of extremely poor quality. Mission control personnel deemed the damage to be &quot;lights and shadows&quot; and instructed the crew to proceed with the mission as usual, infuriating many of the crew. Upon landing, Atlantis became the single-most-damaged shuttle to successfully land. The survival of the crew is attributed to a steel L band antenna plate which was positioned directly under the missing tile. A similar situation would eventually lead to the loss of the shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; in 2003, albeit on the more critical reinforced carbon-carbon.

During STS-37 in 1991, &quot;Atlantis&quot; deployed the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Beginning in 1995 with STS-71, &quot;Atlantis&quot; made seven straight flights to the former Russian space station &quot;Mir&quot; as part of the Shuttle–&quot;Mir&quot; program. STS-71 marked a number of firsts in human spaceflight: 100th U.S. crewed space flight; first U.S. Shuttle-Russian Space Station &quot;Mir&quot; docking and joint on-orbit operations; and first on-orbit change-out of shuttle crew. When linked, &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Mir&quot; together formed the largest spacecraft in orbit at the time.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; delivered several vital components for the construction of the International Space Station (ISS). During the February 2001 mission STS-98 to the ISS, &quot;Atlantis&quot; delivered the Destiny Module, the primary operating facility for U.S. research payloads aboard the ISS. The five-hour 25-minute third spacewalk performed by astronauts Robert Curbeam and Thomas Jones during STS-98 marked NASA&#x27;s 100th extra vehicular activity in space. The Quest Joint Airlock, was flown and installed to the ISS by &quot;Atlantis&quot; during the mission STS-104 in July 2001. The successful installation of the airlock gave on-board space station crews the ability to stage repair and maintenance spacewalks outside the ISS using U.S. EMU or Russian Orlan space suits. The first mission flown by &quot;Atlantis&quot; after the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster was STS-115, conducted during September 2006. The mission carried the P3/P4 truss segments and solar arrays to the ISS. On ISS assembly flight STS-122 in February 2008, &quot;Atlantis&quot; delivered the Columbus laboratory to the ISS. Columbus laboratory is the largest single contribution to the ISS made by the European Space Agency (ESA).


In May 2009 &quot;Atlantis&quot; flew a seven-member crew to the Hubble Space Telescope for its Servicing Mission 4, STS-125. The mission was a success, with the crew completing five spacewalks totaling 37 hours to install new cameras, batteries, a gyroscope and other components to the telescope. This was the final mission not to rendezvous with the ISS.

The longest mission flown using &quot;Atlantis&quot; was STS-117, which lasted almost 14 days in June 2007. During STS-117, &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ crew added a new starboard truss segment and solar array pair (the S3/S4 truss), folded the P6 array in preparation for its relocation and performed four spacewalks. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was not equipped to take advantage of the Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System so missions could not be extended by making use of power provided by ISS.

During the STS-129 post-flight interview on November 16, 2009, shuttle launch director Mike Leinbach said that &quot;Atlantis&quot; officially beat Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot; for the record low amount of interim problem reports, with a total of just 54 listed since returning from STS-125. Leinbach added, &quot;It is due to the team and the hardware processing. They just did a great job. The record will probably never be broken again in the history of the Space Shuttle Program, so congratulations to them.&quot; Leinbach made a similar report during a post-launch interview on May 14, 2010, saying that there were a total of 46 listed from STS-129 to STS-132.

== Orbiter maintenance down periods ==
&quot;Atlantis&quot; went through two overhauls of scheduled orbiter maintenance down periods (OMDPs) during its operational history.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; arrived at Palmdale, California in October 1992 for OMDP-1. During that visit 165 modifications were made over the next 20 months. These included the installation of a drag chute, new plumbing lines to configure the orbiter for extended duration, improved nose wheel steering, more than 800 new heat tiles and blankets, new insulation for main landing gear, and structural modifications to the airframe.

On November 5, 1997, &quot;Atlantis&quot; again arrived at Palmdale for OMDP-2 which was completed on September 24, 1998. The 130 modifications carried out during OMDP-2 included glass cockpit displays, replacement of TACAN navigation with GPS and ISS airlock and docking installation. Several weight reduction modifications were performed on the orbiter including replacement of Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation (AFRSI) insulation blankets on upper surfaces with FRSI. Lightweight crew seats were installed and the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) package installed on OMDP-1 was removed to lighten &quot;Atlantis&quot; to better serve its prime mission of servicing the ISS.

During the standdown period post &quot;Columbia&quot; accident, &quot;Atlantis&quot; went through over 75 modifications to the orbiter ranging from very minor bolt change-outs to window change-outs and different fluid systems.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; was known among the shuttle workforce as being more prone than the others in the fleet to problems that needed to be addressed while readying the vehicle for launch, leading to some nicknaming it &quot;Britney&quot;.

== Decommissioning ==

NASA initially planned to withdraw &quot;Atlantis&quot; from service in 2008, as the orbiter would have been due to undergo its third scheduled OMDP; the timescale of the final retirement of the shuttle fleet was such that having the orbiter undergo this work was deemed uneconomical. It was planned that &quot;Atlantis&quot; would be kept in near-flight condition to be used as a spares source for &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;. However, with the significant planned flight schedule up to 2010, the decision was taken to extend the time between OMDPs, allowing &quot;Atlantis&quot; to be retained for operations. &quot;Atlantis&quot; was subsequently swapped for one flight of each &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot; in the flight manifest. &quot;Atlantis&quot; had completed what was meant to be its last flight, STS-132, prior to the end of the shuttle program, but the extension of the Shuttle program into 2011 led to &quot;Atlantis&quot; being selected for STS-135, the final Space Shuttle mission in July 2011.

&quot;Atlantis&quot; is currently displayed at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex. NASA Administrator Charles Bolden announced the decision at an employee event held on April 12, 2011, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the first shuttle flight: &quot;First, here at the Kennedy Space Center where every shuttle mission and so many other historic human space flights have originated, we&#x27;ll showcase my old friend, &quot;Atlantis&quot;&quot;.

The Visitor Complex displays &quot;Atlantis&quot; with payload bay doors opened mounted at a 43.21° angle to give the appearance of being in orbit around the Earth. The mount angle pays tribute to the countdown that preceded every shuttle launch at KSC. A multi-story digital projection of Earth rotates behind the orbiter in a indoor facility. Ground breaking of the facility occurred in 2012.

The exhibit opened on June 29, 2013.

==Crews==
A total of 207 individuals flew with Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; over the course of its 33 missions. Because the shuttle sometimes flew crew members arriving and departing Mir and the ISS, not all of them launched and landed on &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

Astronaut Clayton Anderson, ESA astronaut Leopold Eyharts and Russian cosmonauts Nikolai Budarin and Anatoly Solovyev only launched on &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Similarly, astronauts Daniel Tani and Sunita Williams, as well as cosmonauts Vladimir Dezhurov and Gennady Strekalov only landed with &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Only 146 men and women both launched and landed aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot;.

Some of those people flew with &quot;Atlantis&quot; more than once. Taking them into account, 203 total seats were filled over &quot;Atlantis&quot;″ 33 missions. Astronaut Jerry Ross holds the record for the most flights aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; at five.

Astronaut Rodolfo Neri Vela who flew aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; on STS-61-B mission in 1985 is the only Mexican to have traveled to space. ESA astronaut Dirk Frimout who flew on STS-45 as a payload specialist was the first Belgian in space. STS-46 mission specialist Claude Nicollier was the first astronaut from Switzerland. On the same flight, astronaut Franco Malerba became the first citizen of Italy to travel to space.

Astronaut Mike Massimino who flew on STS-125 mission became the first person to use Twitter in space in May 2009.

Having flown aboard &quot;Atlantis&quot; as part of the STS-132 crew in May 2010 and &quot;Discovery&quot; as part of the STS-133 crew in February/March 2011, Stephen Bowen became the first NASA astronaut to be launched on consecutive missions.

==Problems==

===Composite overwrapped pressure vessels===
NASA announced in 2007 that 24 helium and nitrogen gas tanks in &quot;Atlantis&quot; were older than their designed lifetime. These composite overwrapped pressure vessels (COPV) were designed for a 10-year life and later cleared for an additional 10 years; they exceeded this life in 2005. NASA said it could not guarantee any longer that the vessels on &quot;Atlantis&quot; would not burst or explode under full pressure. Failure of these tanks could have damaged parts of the orbiter and even wound or kill ground personnel. An in-flight failure of a pressure vessel could have even resulted in the loss of the orbiter and its crew. NASA analyses originally assumed that the vessels would leak before they burst, but new tests showed that they could in fact burst before leaking.

Because the original vendor was no longer in business, and a new manufacturer could not be qualified before 2010, when the shuttles were scheduled to be retired, NASA decided to continue operations with the existing tanks. Therefore, to reduce the risk of failure and the cumulative effects of load, the vessels were maintained at 80 percent of the operating pressure as late in the launch countdown as possible, and the launch pad was cleared of all but essential personnel when pressure was increased to 100 percent. The new launch procedure was employed during some of the remaining launches of &quot;Atlantis&quot;, but was resolved when the two COPVs deemed to have the highest risk of failure were replaced.

===Window damage===
After the STS-125 mission, a work light knob was discovered jammed in the space between one of &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s front interior windows and the Orbiter dashboard structure. The knob was believed to have entered the space during flight, when the pressurized Orbiter was expanded to its maximum size. Then, once back on Earth, the Orbiter contracted, jamming the knob in place. Leaving &quot;as-is&quot; was considered unsafe for flight, and some options for removal (including window replacement) would have included a 6-month delay of &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s next mission (planned to be STS-129). Had the removal of the knob been unsuccessful, the worst-case scenario was that &quot;Atlantis&quot; could have been retired from the fleet, leaving &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot; to complete the manifest alone. On June 29, 2009, &quot;Atlantis&quot; was pressurized to (3 psi above ambient), which forced the Orbiter to expand slightly. The knob was then frozen with dry ice, and successfully removed. Small areas of damage to the window were discovered where the edges of the knob had been embedded into the pane. Subsequent investigation of the window damage discovered a maximum defect depth of approximately , less than the reportable depth threshold of and not serious enough to warrant the pane&#x27;s replacement.

<text>Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-105) is a retired orbiter from NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program and the fifth and final operational Shuttle built. It embarked on its first mission, STS-49, in May 1992 and its 25th and final mission, STS-134, in May 2011. STS-134 was expected to be the final mission of the Space Shuttle program, but with the authorization of STS-135 by the United States Congress, &quot;Atlantis&quot; became the last shuttle to fly.

The United States Congress approved the construction of &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1987 to replace the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot;, which was destroyed in 1986.

NASA chose, on cost grounds, to build much of &quot;Endeavour&quot; from spare parts rather than refitting the Space Shuttle &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and used structural spares built during the construction of &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; in its assembly.

The space shuttle will soon be on display in the upcoming Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center at the California Science Center.

== History ==


Following the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1986, NASA was authorized to begin the procurement process for a replacement orbiter. A major refit of the prototype orbiter &quot;Enterprise&quot; was looked at and rejected on cost grounds, with instead the cache of structural spares that were produced as part of the construction of &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; earmarked for assembly into the new orbiter. Assembly was completed in July 1990, and the new orbiter was rolled out in April 1991. As part of the process, NASA ran a national competition for schools to name the new orbiter—the criteria included a requirement that it be named after an exploratory or research vessel, with a name &quot;easily understood in the context of space&quot;; entries included an essay about the name, the story behind it and why it was appropriate for a NASA shuttle, and the project that supported the name. Amongst the entries, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was suggested by one-third of the participating schools, with President George H.W. Bush eventually selecting it on the advice of the NASA Administrator, Richard Truly. The national winners were Senatobia Middle School in Senatobia, Mississippi, in the elementary division and Tallulah Falls School in Tallulah Falls, Georgia, in the upper school division. They were honored at several ceremonies in Washington, D.C., including a White House ceremony where President Bush presented awards to each school. &quot;Endeavour&quot; was delivered by Rockwell International Space Transportation Systems Division in May 1991 and first launched a year later, in May 1992, on STS-49.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; cost $1.7 billion to build. The orbiter is named after the British HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the ship which took Captain James Cook on his first voyage of discovery (1768–1771). This is why the name is spelled in the British English manner, rather than the American English (&quot;Endeavor&quot;). This has caused confusion, including when NASA itself misspelled a sign on the launch pad in 2007. The Space Shuttle carried a piece of the original wood from Cook&#x27;s ship inside the cockpit. The name also honored &quot;Endeavour&quot;, the command module of Apollo 15, which was also named for Cook&#x27;s ship.

On May 30, 2020, Dragon 2 capsule C206 was named &quot;Endeavour&quot; during the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission by astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken in honor of the shuttle, on which both astronauts took their first flights (STS-127 and STS-123 respectively).

== Service ==
On its first mission, it captured and redeployed the stranded &quot;Intelsat VI&quot; communications satellite. The first African-American woman astronaut, Mae Jemison, was launched into space on the mission STS-47 on September 12, 1992.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; flew the first servicing mission STS-61 for the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993. In 1997 it was withdrawn from service for eight months for a retrofit, including installation of a new airlock. In December 1998, it delivered the Unity Module to the International Space Station.

&quot;Endeavour&quot;″s last Orbiter Major Modification period began in December 2003 and ended on October 6, 2005. During this time, &quot;Endeavour&quot; received major hardware upgrades, including a new, multi-functional, electronic display system, often referred to as a glass cockpit, and an advanced GPS receiver, along with safety upgrades recommended by the &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) for the shuttle&#x27;s return to flight following the loss of &quot;Columbia&quot; during reentry on February 1, 2003.

The STS-118 mission, &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s first since the refit, included astronaut Barbara Morgan, formerly assigned to the Teacher in Space project, and later a member of the Astronaut Corps from 1998 to 2008, as part of the crew. Morgan was the backup for Christa McAuliffe who was on the ill-fated mission STS-51-L in 1986.

=== Early milestones ===
=== Upgrades and features ===

As it was constructed later than its elder sisters, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was built with new hardware designed to improve and expand orbiter capabilities. Most of this equipment was later incorporated into the other three orbiters during out-of-service major inspection and modification programs. &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s upgrades include:
* A diameter drag chute that reduced the orbiter&#x27;s landing roll-out distance (the runway length used for deceleration) from to .
* The plumbing and electrical connections needed for Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) modifications to allow up to a 28-day mission (although a 28-day mission was never attempted; the record is 17 days, which was set by &quot;Columbia&quot;).
* Updated avionics systems that included advanced general purpose computers, improved inertial measurement units and tactical air navigation systems, enhanced master events controllers and multiplexer-demultiplexers, a solid-state star tracker and improved nose wheel steering mechanisms.
* An improved version of the Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) that provided power to operate the Shuttle&#x27;s hydraulic systems.

Modifications resulting from a 2005–2006 refit of &quot;Endeavour&quot; included:
* The &quot;Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System&quot; (SSPTS), which converted 8 kilowatts of DC power from the ISS main voltage of 120VDC to the orbiter bus voltage of 28VDC. This upgrade allowed &quot;Endeavour&quot; to remain on-orbit while docked at ISS for an additional 3- to 4-day duration. The corresponding power equipment was added to the ISS during the STS-116 station assembly mission, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; flew with SSPTS capability during STS-118.

=== Final flights ===
&quot;Endeavour&quot; flew its final mission, STS-134, to the International Space Station (ISS) in May 2011. After the conclusion of STS-134, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was formally decommissioned.

STS-134 was intended to launch in late 2010, but on July 1 NASA released a statement saying the &quot;Endeavour&quot; mission was rescheduled for February 27, 2011.

&quot;The target dates were adjusted because critical payload hardware for STS-133 will not be ready in time to support the previously planned 16 September launch,&quot; NASA said in a statement. With the &quot;Discovery&quot; launch moving to November, &quot;Endeavour&quot; mission &quot;cannot fly as planned, so the next available launch window is in February 2011,&quot; NASA said, adding that the launch dates were subject to change.

The launch was further postponed until April to avoid a scheduling conflict with a Russian supply vehicle heading for the International Space Station. STS-134 did not launch until May 16 at 08:56 EDT.

&quot;Endeavour&quot; landed at the Kennedy Space Center at 06:34 UTC on June 1, 2011, completing its final mission. It was the 25th night landing of a shuttle. Over its flight career, &quot;Endeavour&quot; flew and spent 299 days in space. During &quot;Endeavour&#x27;s&quot; last mission, the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TMA-20 departed from the ISS and paused at a distance of . Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli took a series of photographs and videos of the ISS with &quot;Endeavour&quot; docked. This was the second time a shuttle was photographed docked and the first time since 1996. Commander Mark Kelly was the last astronaut off &quot;Endeavour&quot; after the landing, and the crew stayed on the landing strip to sign autographs and pose for pictures.

STS-134 was the penultimate Space Shuttle mission; STS-135 was added to the schedule in January 2011, and in July &quot;Atlantis&quot; flew for the final time.

== Flow Directors ==
The Flow Director was responsible for the overall preparation of the Shuttle for launch and processing it after landing, and remained permanently assigned to head the spacecraft&#x27;s ground crew while the astronaut flight crews changed for every mission. Each Shuttle&#x27;s Flow Director was supported by a Vehicle Manager for the same spacecraft. Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Flow Directors were:

* 01/1991 – ?: John J. &quot;Tip&quot; Talone Jr. (previously Flow Director for &quot;Discovery&quot;)
* 08/2000 – 05/2006: Tassos Abadiotakis
* STS-126 --- Ken Tenbusch
* Until 08/2012: Dana M. Hutcherson

== Decommissioning ==

After more than twenty organizations submitted proposals for the display of an orbiter, on April 12, 2011, NASA announced that the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; would go to the California Science Center in Los Angeles. The Space Shuttle was mounted on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and departed from the Kennedy Space Center on September 19, 2012, heading to the Los Angeles International Airport, with some refueling stops in Ellington Field and Edwards Air Force Base. After low level flyovers above NASA and civic landmarks across the country and in California, it was delivered to LAX on September 21. It was then hoisted off the aircraft and placed inside a United Airlines hangar to prepare for its transportation through the streets of Los Angeles.
On October 11 at 11:30pm, &quot;Endeavour&quot; left the hangar on four self-propelled robotic transporters and the orbiter was slowly left the airport and was carefully transported through the streets of Los Angeles. The Space Shuttle&#x27;s journey was meticulously measured and each move was carefully choreographed. 

In multiple locations, there were only inches of clearance for the shuttle&#x27;s wide wings between telephone poles, apartment buildings and other structures. Many street light standards and traffic signals were temporarily removed as the shuttle passed through. It was necessary to remove over 400 street trees as well, some of which were fairly old, leading to concern. However, the removed trees were replaced two-for-one by the Science Center, using part of the $200 million funding for the move. 

The power had to be turned off and power carrying poles had to be removed temporarily as the orbiter crept along the streets. News crews lined the streets along the path with visible news personalities in the news trucks. Police escorts and other security personnel, among them including the LAPD, LASD, CHP, and NASA officials, controlled the large crowds gathered, with support from the LAFD and LACoFD to treat heat exhaustion victims as &quot;Endeavour&quot; made its way through the city. &quot;Endeavour&quot; was sometimes parked for a few hours at certain places, such as Randy&#x27;s Donuts, and The Forum where it was available for viewing.
&quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s biggest part of the journey was crossing the Manchester Boulevard Bridge over Interstate 405. However, due to weight restrictions of the bridge, the shuttle was moved from the robotic transporters to a lighter non-powered dolly and was towed across the bridge by an unmodified Toyota Tundra. Once it had completely crossed the bridge, the shuttle was then returned to the robotic transporters to continue its course. Toyota used the footage of &quot;Endeavour&quot; crossing the bridge in a commercial for the 2013 Super Bowl, and the Tundra used to pull the shuttle was donated to the Science Center, where it became part of an exhibit on leverage.

Having taken longer than expected, &quot;Endeavour&quot; reached the Science Center on October 14 at 7:30pm. Prior to its arrival, a building was constructed on the side of the museum to temporary house the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle&#x27;s entire journey through the streets of Los Angeles was often dubbed as &quot;Mission 26: The Big Endeavour&quot;, a nod to its 25 space missions during its career.

=== California Science Center ===
On October 30, 2012, the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; was opened to the public. The shuttle was on display inside the temporary Samuel Oschin Pavilion, where guests offered to not only walk around Endeavour, but also under it, as the vehicle was displayed in the horizontal atop four friction-pendulum seismic isolators to protect it from earthquakes. The shuttle remained inside the temporary pavilion until December 31, 2023. A companion exhibit inside the Science Center features images and artifacts that related the Space Shuttle program to California, where the orbiters were originally constructed.

After its decommissioning, &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Canadarm (formally the &#x27;Shuttle Remote Manipulator System&#x27;) was removed in order to be sent to the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s John H. Chapman Space Centre in Longueuil, Quebec, a suburb of Montreal, where it was to be placed on display. In a Canadian poll on which science or aerospace museum should be selected to display the Canadarm, originally built by SPAR Aerospace, the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s headquarters placed third to last with only 35 out of 638 votes. &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s Canadarm has since gone on permanent display at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa. In August 2015, NASA engineers removed a few of the tanks from &quot;Endeavour&quot; for reuse as storage containers for potable water on the International Space Station.

On May 28, 2015, NASA donated the ET-94 external tank, the last mission-ready one in existence as all others were destroyed during launch. On April 12, 2016, the tank was transported by barge from the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, across the Panama Canal, and was safely docked in Marina del Rey on May 15. The tank was delivered to the Science Center on May 21. It was displayed outside the Samuel Oschin Pavilion until 2023. On March 28, 2017, both Northrop Grumman and NASA donated a pair of flight-proven solid rocket boosters for &quot;Endeavour&quot; exhibit. The rocket parts were delivered on September 11, 2020, and was temporarily stored in the Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California until construction begins.

==== Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center ====

The &quot;Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center&quot;, is a new building that is under construction, will serve as &quot;Endeavour&#x27;s&quot; new permanent home. The Space Shuttle will be in a 20-story-tall display mounted on with the ET-94 tank, and solid rocket boosters. Once finished, it will be the only Space Shuttle mounted vertically in launch position. 

Originally slated to open in 2015, construction on the new building started on June 1, 2022. Meanwhile, the ET-94 tank underwent some restoration after being used to analyze the foam on its sister tank, ET-93, which was a factor during the STS-107 mission, which resulted in the Columbia disaster.

On July 20, 2023, the assembly of the stack began with the aft skirts (bottom segments of the rocket boosters) being precisely positioned on a concrete slab supported by six base isolators that will protect &quot;Endeavour&quot; from earthquakes. The motors for the rocket boosters were installed on October 11, which was in storage at the Mojave Air and Space Port. The rocket boosters was fully assembled when the tops were added on December 5. 

On January 3, 2024, &quot;Endeavour&quot; was protected in a shrink wrap, likely to stay on until construction is complete. The ET-94 tank was then moved into its position in January 16 and was mounted to the rocket boosters. On January 30, the Space Shuttle was then moved into its position, thus completing the stack. Once all components are mounted into place, construction on the building continues, as it will be built a complex diagrid structure around it. Construction work on the building is scheduled to be completed in mid-2025. It will take several more years to install the artifacts and exhibits inside the building. An official grand opening is not yet announced.

== Legacy ==
Following their May 30, 2020, launch on board the SpaceX Crew Dragon Demo-2 vehicle, the crew announced in orbit that they had named their spacecraft &quot;Endeavour&quot;. Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley said the name has a dual meaning: first, after the &quot;incredible endeavor&quot; put forth by SpaceX and NASA after the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2011; and second, because both Hurley and Behnken each flew their first flight aboard the shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; (Behnken on STS-123, Hurley on STS-127) and wanted to name this new spacecraft after the one that took each of them into space. The shuttle appeared in the 2022 films &quot;Moonfall&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot;.

=== Replica ===
A replica of a section of &quot;Endeavour&quot; is on exhibit outside the Discovery Cube Orange County, a science museum in Santa Ana, California.

<doc id="28242" wikidata="Q2467696" url="?curid=28242" title="Sports Car Club of America">
<text>The Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) is a non-profit American automobile club and sanctioning body supporting Autocross, Rallycross, HPDE, Time Trial, Road Racing, and Hill Climbs in the United States. Formed in 1944, it runs many programs for both amateur and professional racers.

==History==
The SCCA traces its roots to the Automobile Racing Club of America (not to be confused with the current stock car series of the same name). ARCA was founded in 1933 by brothers Miles and Sam Collier, and dissolved in 1941 at the outbreak of World War II. The SCCA was formed in 1944 as an enthusiast group. The SCCA began sanctioning road racing in 1948 with the inaugural Watkins Glen Grand Prix. Cameron Argetsinger, an SCCA member and local enthusiast who would later become Director of Pro Racing and Executive Director of the SCCA, helped organize the event for the SCCA.

In 1951, the SCCA National Sports Car Championship was formed from existing marquee events around the nation, including Watkins Glen, Pebble Beach, and Elkhart Lake. Many early SCCA events were held on disused air force bases, organized with the help of Air Force General Curtis LeMay, a renowned enthusiast of sports car racing. LeMay loaned out facilities of Strategic Air Command bases for the SCCA&#x27;s use; the SCCA relied heavily on these venues during the early and mid-1950s during the transition from street racing to permanent circuits.

By 1962, the SCCA was tasked with managing the U.S. World Sportscar Championship rounds at Daytona, Sebring, Bridgehampton and Watkins Glen. The club was also involved in the Formula 1 U.S. Grand Prix. SCCA Executive Director John Bishop helped to create the United States Road Racing Championship series for Group 7 sports cars to recover races that had been taken by rival USAC Road Racing Championship. Bishop was also instrumental in founding the SCCA Trans-Am Series and the SCCA/CASC Can-Am series. In 1969, tension and infighting over Pro Racing&#x27;s autonomy caused Bishop to resign and help form the International Motor Sports Association.

==Sanctioned Events==
===Autocross (Solo)===
The autocross program is branded as &quot;Solo&quot;. Up to four cars at a time run on a course laid out with traffic cones on a large paved surface, such as a parking lot or airport runway, without interfering with one another.

Competitions are held at the regional, divisional, and national levels. A national champion in each class is determined at the national championship (usually referred to as &quot;Nationals&quot;) held in September. In 2009, Solo Nationals moved to the Lincoln Airpark in Lincoln, Nebraska. Individual national-level events called &quot;Championship Tours&quot; and &quot;Match Tours&quot; are held throughout the racing season. The SCCA also holds national-level events in an alternate format called &quot;ProSolo&quot;. In ProSolo, two cars compete at the same time on mirror-image courses with drag racing-style starts, complete with reaction and 60-foot times. Class winners and other qualifiers (based on time differential against the class winner) then compete in a handicapped elimination round called the &quot;Challenge&quot;. Points are awarded in both class and Challenge competition, and an annual champion is crowned each September at the ProSolo Finale event in Lincoln, Nebraska.
===Rallycross===
The SCCA sanctions &quot;RallyCross&quot; events, similar to autocross, but on a non-paved course. SCCA ProRally was a national performance rally series similar to the World Rally Championship. At the end of the 2004 season SCCA dropped ProRally and ClubRally. A new organization, Rally America, picked up both series starting in 2005.

Road rallies are run on open, public roads. These are not races in the sense of speed, but of precision and navigation. The object is to drive on time, arriving at checkpoints with the proper amount of elapsed time from the previous checkpoint. Competitors do not know where the checkpoints are.

=== Track Night in America ===
Track Night in America is a track experience program sanctioned by the SCCA. The program is designed to be low barrier to entry, and accepting to all skill levels. Events happen all over the country, on week evenings usually between Tuesday and Thursday. SCCA planned week night track events to keep costs down, as well as build a program that doesn&#x27;t take over the entrants entire weekend. 

TNiA goes to well known tracks like Road America, VIR, even Sebring and Lime Rock. There are also smaller club tracks like CMP, AMP and Pitt Race. TNiA puts on about 150 events a year, totaling nearly 10,000 entrants each year, and as of 2024 has been running for 10 years.

===Time Trials===
In recent years, the SCCA has expanded and re-organized some of the higher-speed events under the Time Trials banner. These include Performance Driving Experience (&quot;PDX&quot;), Club Trials, Track Trials, and Hill Climb events. PDX events are non-competition HPDE-type events and consist of driver-education and car control classroom learning combined with on-track instruction.

===Club Racing===
The Club Racing program is a road racing division where drivers race on either dedicated race tracks or on temporary street circuits. Competitors require either a regional or a national racing license. Both modified production cars (ranging from lightly modified cars with only extra safety equipment to heavily modified cars that retain only the basic shape of the original vehicle) and designed-from-scratch &quot;formula&quot; and &quot;sports racer&quot; cars can be used in Club Racing. Most of the participants in the Club Racing program are unpaid amateurs, but some go on to professional racing careers. The club is also the source for race workers in all specialties.

The annual national championship for Club Racing is called the SCCA National Championship Runoffs and has been held at Riverside International Raceway (1964, 1966, 1968), Daytona International Speedway (1965, 1967, 1969, 2015), Road Atlanta (1970–1993), Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course (1994–2005, 2016), Heartland Park Topeka (2006–2008), Road America (2009-2013, 2020), Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca (2014), and Indianapolis Motor Speedway (2017). In 2018, the Runoffs will go back west to Sonoma Raceway. In 2019, the race will be held at Virginia International Raceway a track where the race has never been held. It was announced on 15 June 2018 that the Runoffs would go back to Road America in the year 2020. On 25 May 2019, the weekend of the 2019 Indianapolis 500, SCCA announced they will be returning to Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2021. The current SCCA record holder is Jerry Hansen, (former owner of Brainerd International Raceway), with twenty-seven national championships.

====SCCA Majors formula group classes====
The five national classes of the formula group are Formula Atlantic (FA), Formula Continental (FC), Formula Enterprises 2 (FE2), Formula F (FF), and Formula Vee (FV).

===Professional racing===

The SCCA dropped its amateur only policy in 1962 and began sanctioning professional racing. In 1963, the United States Road Racing Championship was formed. In 1966 the Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am) was created for Group 7 open-top sportscars. The Trans-Am Series for pony cars also began in 1966. Today, Trans-Am uses GT-1 class regulations, giving amateur drivers a chance to race professionally. A professional series for open-wheel racing cars was introduced in 1967 as the SCCA Grand Prix Championship. This series was then held under various names through to the 1976 SCCA/USAC Formula 5000 Championship.

Current SCCA-sanctioned series include Trans Am, the GT World Challenge America for GT and touring cars, the Global MX-5 Cup, and the F1600 Championship Series, F2000 Championship Series, and Atlantic Championship Series for open-wheel racing. SCCA Pro Racing has also sanctioned professional series for some amateur classes such as Spec Racer Ford Pro and Formula Enterprises Pro. SCCA Pro Racing also sanctioned the Volkswagen Jetta TDI Cup during its time.

==Conferences, divisions and regions==
The SCCA is organized into six conferences, nine divisions and 115 regions, each organizing events in that area to make the events more accessible to people throughout the country. The number of divisions has increased since the SCCA&#x27;s foundation. Northern Pacific and Southern Pacific started as a single Pacific Coast Division until dividing in 1966. Rocky Mountain Division is a relatively recent split. The Great Lakes Division was split from the Central Division at the end of 2006.

<doc id="28244" wikidata="Q841749" url="?curid=28244" title="Star network">
<text>A star network is an implementation of a spoke–hub distribution paradigm in computer networks. In a star network, every host is connected to a central hub. In its simplest form, one central hub acts as a conduit to transmit messages. The star network is one of the most common computer network topologies.

==Network==
The hub and hosts, and the transmission lines between them, form a graph with the topology of a star. Data on a star network passes through the hub before continuing to its destination. The hub manages and controls all functions of the network. It also acts as a repeater for the data flow. In a typical network the hub can be a network switch, Ethernet hub, wireless access point or a router 

The star topology reduces the impact of a transmission line failure by independently connecting each host to the hub. Each host may thus communicate with all others by transmitting to, and receiving from, the hub. The failure of a transmission line linking any host to the hub will result in the isolation of that host from all others, but the rest of the network will be unaffected.

The star configuration is commonly used with twisted pair cable and optical fiber cable. However, it can also be used with coaxial cable as in, for example, a video router.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

===Advantages===
* If one node or its connection fails, it does not affect the other nodes.
* Devices can be added or removed without disturbing the network.
*Works well under heavy load.
*Appropriate for a large network.

===Disadvantages===
* Expensive due to the number and length of cables needed to wire each host to the central hub.
* The central hub is a single point of failure for the network.
* Each device needs a separate cable connection to the central hub, leading to higher cable usage.
* The number of devices is limited by the capacity of the central hub.
