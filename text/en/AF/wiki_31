<text>Rush was a Canadian rock band formed in Toronto in 1968 that consisted primarily of Geddy Lee (vocals, bass guitar, keyboards), Alex Lifeson (guitar) and Neil Peart (drums, percussion). The band&#x27;s original line-up consisted of Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bassist and vocalist Jeff Jones, whom Lee immediately replaced. After Lee joined, the band went through a few line-up changes before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their self-titled debut album; this line-up remained unchanged for the remainder of the band&#x27;s career.

Rush first achieved moderate success with their second album, &quot;Fly by Night&quot; (1975). The commercial failure of their next album &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;, released seven months after &quot;Fly by Night&quot;, resulted in the band nearly getting dropped from their then-record label Mercury Records. Rush&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;2112&quot; (1976), reignited their popularity, becoming their first album to enter the top five of the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Albums Chart. Their next two albums, &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; (1977) and &quot;Hemispheres&quot; (1978), were also successful, with the former becoming Rush&#x27;s first to enter the UK Albums Chart. The band saw their furthest commercial success throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with most albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980), &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; (1981), &quot;Signals&quot; (1982), &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (1984), &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; (1991), &quot;Counterparts&quot; (1993), and &quot;Test for Echo&quot; (1996). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band went on a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart&#x27;s life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; (2002), &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; (2007), and &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; (2012). Rush performed their final concerts in 2015, with Peart retiring from music later that year. Lifeson confirmed in January 2018 that the band decided not to resume activity following the R40 Tour, which was later cemented by Peart&#x27;s death in January 2020. Lee and Lifeson have continued to periodically work together since Peart&#x27;s death, including performing at the 25th anniversary celebration of &quot;South Park&quot; and tributes to then-recently deceased Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins in 2022.

Rush are known for their virtuosic musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs, which drew primarily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band&#x27;s style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers&#x27; polls in various years.

As of 2024, Rush ranks 90th in the US with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. They have been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US and 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush were nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won ten Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. Critics consider Rush to be one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
==History==
===1968–1974: early years and debut album===
The band was formed in the neighbourhood of Willowdale in Toronto, Ontario, by guitarist Alex Lifeson, bassist and frontman Jeff Jones, and drummer John Rutsey, in August 1968. Lifeson and Rutsey had been friends since a young age and played together in a short-lived band, The Projection (formerly known as The Lost Cause). Afterward the two stuck together and brought in Jones to form a new group; their first gig was in September at the Coff-Inn, a youth centre in the basement of St. Theodore of Canterbury Anglican Church in Willowdale; they were paid CA$25. They had not named themselves at the time of the booking; Rutsey&#x27;s brother Bill thought they needed a name that was short and to the point. He suggested Rush, and the group went with it.

Due to increasing difficulties in getting to Lifeson&#x27;s house for practice, Jones suggested that Lifeson get his schoolmate Gary &quot;Geddy&quot; Weinrib to step in on lead vocals and bass. Weinrib replaced Jones as Rush&#x27;s frontman, adopting the stage name Geddy Lee. Rush rehearsed a set mainly formed of covers by various rock artists, including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and John Mayall. The band underwent several line-up configurations that included Lindy Young (who was recruited in early 1969) on keyboards and various instruments, and Mitch Bossi on second guitar (later on, in 1971). Shortly after becoming a four-piece band of Lee, Lifeson, Young and Rutsey, Ray Danniels was hired to be their manager. As Lee recounted years later, 
With Lee kicked out of the band in spring 1969, Rutsey recruited new bassist and vocalist Joe Perna, and the group of Lifeson, Rutsey, Young and Perna named themselves Hadrian. But after a disastrous gig with Perna, Rutsey invited Lee back in September 1969 and the group resumed as Rush. Lee stated, &quot;I started a blues band (named Ogilvie, then Judd, and joined by Lindy Young) and I was, frankly speaking, doing better than they were. Then I got a call from John and he said, &#x27;Can we get together?&#x27; Basically, &#x27;Can you come back? We&#x27;re sorry. Second guitarist Mitch Bossi joined during the first half of 1971 but after that, the band stabilized as a trio of Lifeson, Rutsey and Lee. They kept Danniels as their manager, with his business partner and agent Vic Wilson sharing duties.

Rush honed their skills with regular gigs, initially touring the Ontario high school circuit. In 1971, the legal drinking age was decreased from 21 to 18, allowing the band to play bars and clubs. Lee said it was at this point that Rush turned &quot;from a basement garage band that played the occasional high school gig to a regular working band playing six days a week.&quot; A demo tape was then shipped to various record labels, but Rush were unable to secure a deal, leading to the formation of their own label, Moon Records, with Danniels. Rush entered the studio in 1973 to record their first single; their cover of &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; by Buddy Holly was chosen as it had become a crowd favourite. &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fight It&quot;, an original song, was put on the B-side. Released in September, it went to No. 88 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart. That same month, Rush performed their first major gig, opening for the New York Dolls in Toronto, and finished putting down tracks for their first album. The initial sessions produced undesirable results over the sound quality, so tracks were recut and remixed with a new engineer, Terry Brown. Danniels sold his management company to help raise funds to make the record. Rutsey wrote the lyrics, but tore them up on the day Lee was to record them and would not produce a new set. Lee quickly wrote a fresh set based on earlier versions, which was used on the final takes.
The debut album, &quot;Rush&quot;, was released in March 1974; the initial pressing of 3,500 copies quickly sold out. It went on to peak at No. 86 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Albums chart. Most critics considered the album highly derivative of Led Zeppelin. It saw a limited release until it was picked up by Donna Halper, a music director and DJ at rock station WMMS in Cleveland, Ohio. She added &quot;Working Man&quot; to the station&#x27;s regular playlist, and the song&#x27;s blue-collar theme resonated with hard rock fans in the predominantly working class city. In June 1974, Danniels signed Rush to the American booking agency ATI, of which executive Ira Blacker sent a copy of &quot;Rush&quot; to Mercury Records. The record caught the attention of A&amp;R man Cliff Burnstein, who signed Rush with a $75,000 advance as part of a $200,000 deal.

Following a series of Canadian dates, Rutsey played his last gig with the band on July 25. His preference for more straightforward rock was incompatible with the more complex music that Lifeson and Lee had written, and Lee recalled that Rutsey had a general distaste for life as a touring musician. His Type 1 diabetes caused further complications, as he required frequent hospital visits to have tests and receive insulin. Since October 1973, Rutsey&#x27;s health had often been too critical for him to perform; in the months prior to his departure, Rush temporarily replaced him with a substitute drummer, Gerry Fielding.

===1974–1977: arrival of Neil Peart and foray into progressive rock===
After auditioning five drummers, Lifeson and Lee picked Neil Peart, who joined on July 29, 1974, which was two weeks before the group&#x27;s first US tour. They performed their first concert together on August 14 at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, opening for Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band to more than 11,000 people. Peart assumed the role of lyricist; Lifeson and Lee had little interest in the job and recognized Peart&#x27;s wider vocabulary range from reading regularly. Lifeson and Lee focused primarily on the music, with the new material displaying their influences from progressive rock bands Yes and Pink Floyd. When the US tour concluded in December 1974, &quot;Rush&quot; had reached its peak of No. 105 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart.

&quot;Fly by Night&quot; (1975), Rush&#x27;s first album with Peart, saw the inclusion of the story song &quot;By-Tor &amp; the Snow Dog&quot;, replete with complex arrangements and a multi-section format. Lyrical themes also underwent dramatic changes because of Peart&#x27;s love for fantasy and science-fiction literature. Despite these new styles, some other songs on the album mirrored the simplistic blues style found on Rush&#x27;s debut. &quot;Fly by Night&quot; was released as a single that reached No. 45 in Canada. The album reached No. 9 in Canada, where it was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CAN) for selling 100,000 copies and in the US by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling 1 million copies there.

The band followed &quot;Fly by Night&quot; quickly with &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; (1975), a five-track album featuring two extended multi-chapter songs, &quot;The Necromancer&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Lamneth&quot;. Some critics said &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; was unfocused and an audacious move for the band because of the placement of two back-to-back protracted songs, as well as a heavier reliance on atmospherics and storytelling, a large deviation from &quot;Fly by Night&quot;. Intended to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough album, &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; sold below expectations. The tour consisted of smaller venues and declining box office receipts, which led to it being nicknamed the Down the Tubes Tour.
In light of these events, Rush&#x27;s record label tried to pressure the members into moulding their next album in a more commercially friendly and accessible fashion; the band ignored the requests and developed their next album &quot;2112&quot; (1976) with a 20-minute title track divided into seven sections. Despite this, the album was the band&#x27;s first taste of significant commercial success as it reached No. 5 in Canada, becoming their first to reach double platinum certification.

Rush toured in support of &quot;2112&quot; between February 1976 and June 1977 with concerts in Canada, the US, and for the first time Europe, with dates in the UK, Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands. The three sold-out shows at Massey Hall in Toronto in June 1976 were recorded for Rush&#x27;s debut live album, &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;. Released in September of that year, the double album reached No. 6 in Canada and became Rush&#x27;s first to crack the US top 40. &quot;Record World&quot; wrote: &quot;Building its American reputation slowly but steadily Rush stands poised for breaking through all the way via this two record live set [...] All the highly charged electricity is here in an explosive setting.&quot; The liner notes includes the statement: &quot;This album to us, signifies the end of the beginning, a milestone to mark the close of chapter one, in the annals of Rush.&quot;

===1977–1981: peak progressive era===
After the conclusion of the &quot;2112&quot; tour, Rush went to Wales to record &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; (1977) and &quot;Hemispheres&quot; (1978) at Rockfield Studios. These albums saw the band members expanding the progressive elements in their music. &quot;As our tastes got more obscure&quot;, Lee said in an interview, &quot;we discovered more progressive rock-based bands like Yes, Van der Graaf Generator and King Crimson, and we were very inspired by those bands. They made us want to make our music more interesting and more complex, and we tried to blend that with our own personalities to see what we could come up with that was indisputably us.&quot; Increased synthesizer use, lengthy songs, and highly dynamic playing featuring complex time signature changes became a staple of Rush&#x27;s compositions. To achieve a broader, more progressive sound, Lifeson began to experiment with classical and twelve-string guitars, and Lee added bass-pedal synthesizers and Minimoog. Likewise, Peart&#x27;s percussion became diversified in the form of triangles, glockenspiel, wood blocks, cowbells, timpani, gong, and chimes. Beyond instrument additions, the band kept in stride with progressive rock trends by continuing to compose long, conceptual songs with science fiction and fantasy overtones. As the new decade approached, Rush gradually began to dispose of their older styles of music in favour of shorter and sometimes softer arrangements, due in part to the band&#x27;s exhaustion from recording &quot;Hemispheres&quot;. The lyrics up to this point were heavily influenced by classical poetry, fantasy literature, science fiction, and the writings of novelist Ayn Rand, as exhibited most prominently by their 1975 song &quot;Anthem&quot; from &quot;Fly By Night&quot; and a specifically acknowledged derivation in &quot;2112&quot; (1976). The first single from &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot;, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, was the band&#x27;s first successful song in the UK, peaking at No. 36, while reaching No. 76 in the US and No. 45 in Canada. &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; did not sell as well as &quot;2112&quot;, but still went platinum in both Canada and the United States. By this time, Rush&#x27;s record deal allowed them a CA$250,000 advance on each album and a 16% royalty rate.

&quot;Permanent Waves&quot; (1980) shifted Rush&#x27;s style of music with the introduction of reggae and new wave elements. Although a hard rock style was still evident, more synthesizers were introduced. Because of the limited airplay Rush&#x27;s previous extended-length songs received, &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; contained shorter, more radio-friendly songs, such as &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot;, which helped the album become Rush&#x27;s highest-charting album to date. &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; became the group&#x27;s biggest hit single to date, peaking at No. 22 in Canada, No. 51 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart. Peart&#x27;s lyrics on &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; shifted toward an expository tone with subject matter that dwelled less on fantastical or allegorical storytelling and more heavily on topics that explored humanistic, social, and emotional elements. Rush toured &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; for six months through 1980 to more than 650,000 people across 96 shows, becoming their first tour to make a profit. After the tour, Rush joined fellow Toronto-based rock band Max Webster to record &quot;Battle Scar&quot; for their 1980 album, &quot;Universal Juveniles&quot;. Max Webster&#x27;s lyricist, Pye Dubois, offered the band the lyrics to a song he had written. The band accepted, and the song went on, after reworking by Peart, to become &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;.
Rush&#x27;s popularity reached its pinnacle with the release of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; in February 1981. &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; essentially continued where &quot;Permanent Waves&quot; left off, extending the trend of accessible and commercially friendly progressive rock that helped thrust them into the spotlight. The lead track, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, is probably the band&#x27;s best-known song. Upon release, it reached No. 24 on the Canadian Top 40 Singles Chart, No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 8 on the new US Album Rock Tracks chart. The second single, &quot;Limelight&quot;, also received a strong response from listeners and radio stations, going to No. 18 in Canada, No. 54 on the Hot 100, and No. 4 on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart. &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was Rush&#x27;s last album to feature an extended song, the 11-minute &quot;The Camera Eye&quot;. The song also contained the band&#x27;s heaviest usage of synthesizers yet, hinting that Rush&#x27;s music was shifting direction once more. &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; became the band&#x27;s first album to reach No. 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, and also reached No. 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and UK album charts; it has been certified quintuple platinum by both the Recording Industry Association of America and Music Canada. Following the success of &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, Rush released their second live recording, &quot;Exit... Stage Left&quot;, in 1981.

===1981–1989: synthesizer-oriented era===
The band underwent another stylistic change with the recording of &quot;Signals&quot; in 1982. While Lee&#x27;s synthesizers had been featured instruments since the late 1970s, keyboards were shifted from the background to the melodic front-lines in songs like &quot;Countdown&quot; and the opening track, &quot;Subdivisions&quot;. Both feature prominent lead synthesizer lines with minimalistic guitar chords and solos. Other previously unused instrument additions were seen in the song &quot;Losing It&quot;, featuring collaborator Ben Mink on electric violin.
&quot;Signals&quot; also represented a drastic stylistic transformation apart from instrumental changes. The album contained Rush&#x27;s biggest hit single, &quot;New World Man&quot;, while other more experimental songs such as &quot;Digital Man&quot;, &quot;The Weapon&quot;, and &quot;Chemistry&quot; expanded the band&#x27;s use of ska, reggae, and funk. The second single, &quot;Subdivisions&quot; reached No. 36 in Canada and No. 5 on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart. Both singles reached the Top 50 in the UK. &quot;Signals&quot; became the group&#x27;s second No. 1 album in Canada, their third straight No. 3 album in the UK, and peaked at No. 10 in the US, while continuing their moderate success in the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, making the Top 30 in each country. Although the band members consciously decided to move in this overall direction, creative differences between the band and longtime producer Terry Brown began to emerge. The band felt dissatisfied with Brown&#x27;s studio treatment of &quot;Signals&quot;, while Brown was becoming more uncomfortable with the increased use of synthesizers. Ultimately, Rush and Brown parted ways in 1983, and the experimentation with new electronic instruments and varying musical styles would come into further play on their next studio album.

The style and production of &quot;Signals&quot; were augmented and taken to new heights on &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; (1984). It was Peart who named the album, as he borrowed the words of Ernest Hemingway (&quot;Courage is grace under pressure&quot;) to describe what the band had to go through after making the decision to leave Brown. Producer Steve Lillywhite, who gained fame with successful productions of Simple Minds and U2, was enlisted to produce &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;. He backed out at the last moment, however, much to the ire of Lee, Lifeson and Peart. Lee said, &quot;Steve Lillywhite is really not a man of his word ... after agreeing to do our record, he got an offer from Simple Minds, changed his mind, blew us off ... so it put us in a horrible position.&quot; Rush eventually hired Peter Henderson to co-produce and engineer the album instead. Henderson was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on Supertramp&#x27;s &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;.
Musically, although Lee&#x27;s use of sequencers and synthesizers remained the band&#x27;s cornerstone, his focus on new technology was complemented by Peart&#x27;s adaptation of Simmons electronic drums and percussion. Lifeson&#x27;s contributions on the album were decidedly enhanced, in response to the minimalist role he played on &quot;Signals&quot;. Still, many of his trademark guitar textures remained intact in the form of open reggae chords and funk and new-wave rhythms. &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; reached the Top 5 in Canada and the UK and the Top 10 in the US It became the highest charter to that date in Sweden (No. 18), while becoming their first album to chart in Germany (No. 43) and Finland (No. 14). While &quot;Distant Early Warning&quot; was not a success on Top 40 radio, it peaked at No. 5 on the US Album Rock Tracks chart.

With new producer Peter Collins, the band released &quot;Power Windows&quot; (1985) and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; (1987). The music on these two albums gives far more emphasis and prominence to Lee&#x27;s multi-layered synthesizer work, and he switched to an English-made Wal MK1 bass. While fans and critics took notice of Lifeson&#x27;s diminished guitar work, his presence was still palpable. Lifeson, like many guitarists in the mid to late 1980s, experimented with processors that reduced his instrument to echoey chord bursts and thin leads. &quot;Power Windows&quot; went to No. 2 in Canada while peaking at No. 9 and 10 in the UK and US, respectively. The lead track, &quot;The Big Money&quot; made the Top 50 in Canada, the UK and US, plus No. 4 on the US Mainstream Rock Chart. &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; represents both an extension of the guitar style found on &quot;Power Windows&quot;, and, according to AllMusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia, the culmination of this era of Rush. &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; only went gold in the US, whereas the previous five Rush albums had gone platinum, although it managed to peak at No. 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. and made the Top 10 in Canada, the UK and Finland. Two tracks from &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;, &quot;Force Ten&quot; and &quot;Time Stand Still&quot;, both peaked at No. 3 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

A third live album and video, &quot;A Show of Hands&quot; (1989), was also released by Anthem and Mercury following the &quot;Power Windows&quot; and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; tours, demonstrating the aspects of Rush in the &#x27;80s. &quot;A Show of Hands&quot; met with strong fan approval, but &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Michael Azerrad dismissed it as &quot;musical muscle&quot; with 1.5 stars, claiming Rush fans viewed their favourite power trio as &quot;the holy trinity&quot;. Nevertheless, &quot;A Show of Hands&quot; reached the gold album mark in the US and the platinum level in Canada. At this point, the group decided to change international record labels from Mercury to Atlantic. After Rush&#x27;s departure in 1989, Mercury released a double platinum two-volume compilation of their Rush catalogue, &quot;Chronicles&quot; (1990).

===1989–2000: return to guitar-oriented sound and hiatus===
Rush started to deviate from its 1980s style with the albums &quot;Presto&quot; (1989) and &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; (1991). Produced by record engineer and musician Rupert Hine, these two albums saw Rush shedding much of its keyboard-saturated sound. Beginning with &quot;Presto&quot;, the band opted for arrangements notably more guitar-centric than the previous two studio albums. Although synthesizers were still used, they were no longer featured as the centrepiece of Rush&#x27;s compositions. Continuing this trend, &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; extended the use of the standard three-instrument approach with even less focus on synthesizers than its predecessor. While musically these albums do not deviate significantly from a general pop-rock sound, Rush incorporated other musical styles such as funk and hip hop in &quot;Roll the Bones&quot; and jazz in the instrumental track &quot;Where&#x27;s My Thing?&quot;. &quot;Show Don&#x27;t Tell&quot; from &quot;Presto&quot; was a No. 1 hit on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart, and while the album reached the Top 10 in Canada, it was less successful in the US (No. 16) and the UK (No. 27). From &quot;Roll the Bones&quot;&quot;, &quot;Dreamline&quot; (No. 1) and &quot;Ghost of a Chance&quot; (No. 2) were successful on US Mainstream Rock Radio stations, marking a resurgence of Rush&#x27;s album sales in the US (No. 3 and platinum), the UK (No. 10) and some other parts of northern Europe.

The transition from synthesizers to more guitar-oriented and organic instrumentation continued with &quot;Counterparts&quot; (1993) and its follow-up, &quot;Test for Echo&quot; (1996), both produced in collaboration with Peter Collins. Up to this point, &quot;Counterparts&quot; and &quot;Test for Echo&quot; were two of Rush&#x27;s most guitar-driven albums. The latter album also includes elements of jazz and swing-style drumming by Peart, which he had learned from drum coach Freddie Gruber during the interim between &quot;Counterparts&quot; and &quot;Test for Echo&quot;. &quot;Stick It Out&quot; from &quot;Counterparts&quot; reached the summit of the US Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart, with the album peaking at No. 2 in the US and No. 6 in Canada. &quot;Test for Echo&quot; reached the Top 5 in both countries, with the title track again topping the US Mainstream Rock Tracks Chart. In October 1996, in support of &quot;Test For Echo&quot;, the band embarked on a North American tour, the band&#x27;s first without an opening act and dubbed &quot;An Evening with Rush&quot;. The tour was broken into two segments, spanning October through December 1996 and May through July 1997.

After the conclusion of the &quot;Test for Echo&quot; tour in 1997, the band entered a five-year hiatus primarily due to personal tragedies in Peart&#x27;s life. Peart&#x27;s daughter Selena died in a car crash in August 1997, and his wife Jacqueline died of cancer in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus to mourn and reflect. During this time, he travelled extensively throughout North America on his BMW motorcycle, covering . In his book &quot;Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road&quot;, Peart writes of how he had told his bandmates at Selena&#x27;s funeral, &quot;consider me retired.&quot; This left the band&#x27;s future uncertain, and Lee and Lifeson prepared an archival album, &quot;Different Stages&quot;, for release during the hiatus. Mixed by producer Paul Northfield and engineered by Terry Brown, it is a three-disc live album featuring recorded performances from the band&#x27;s &quot;Counterparts&quot;, &quot;Test For Echo&quot;, and &quot;A Farewell to Kings&quot; tours, dedicated to the memory of Selena and Jacqueline. After a time of grief and recovery, and while visiting longtime Rush photographer Andrew MacNaughtan in Los Angeles, Peart was introduced to his future wife, photographer Carrie Nuttall, whom he married on September 9, 2000. By the following year, Peart decided to return to Rush.

===2001–2009: comeback, &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; and &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot;===
In January 2001, Lee, Lifeson, and Peart came together to see if they could reassemble the band. According to Peart, &quot;We laid out no parameters, no goals, no limitations, only that we would take a relaxed, civilized approach to the project.&quot; With the help of producer Paul Northfield, the band produced seventy-four minutes of music for their new album &quot;Vapor Trails&quot;, which was written and recorded in Toronto. &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; marked the first Rush studio recording to not include any keyboards or synthesizers since &quot;Caress of Steel&quot;. According to the band, the album&#x27;s developmental process was extremely taxing and took approximately 14 months to finish, the longest they had ever spent writing and recording a studio album. &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; was released on May 14, 2002; to herald the band&#x27;s comeback, the single and lead track from the album, &quot;One Little Victory&quot;, was designed to grab the attention of listeners with its rapid guitar and drum tempos. The album was supported by the band&#x27;s first tour in six years, including first-ever concerts in Brazil and Mexico City, where they played to some of the largest crowds of their career. The largest was a capacity of 60,000 in São Paulo. &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; peaked at No. 3 in Canada and No. 6 in the US, while selling disappointingly in the UK, where it peaked at No. 38.
A live album and DVD, &quot;Rush in Rio&quot;, was released in October 2003, featuring the last performance of the band&#x27;s Vapor Trails Tour on November 23, 2002, at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. To celebrate the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, June 2004 saw the release of &quot;Feedback&quot;, an extended play work recorded in suburban Toronto that featured eight covers of artists such as Cream, The Who and The Yardbirds, bands the members of Rush cite as inspiration around the time of their inception. To help support &quot;Feedback&quot; and continue celebrating their 30th anniversary as a band, Rush launched the 30th Anniversary Tour in the summer of 2004, playing dates in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and the Netherlands. On September 24, 2004, the concert at The Festhalle in Frankfurt, Germany was filmed for a DVD titled &quot;R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour&quot;, which was released on November 22, 2005. This release omitted eight songs also included on &quot;Rush in Rio&quot;; the complete concert was released on Blu-ray on December 8, 2009.

During promotional interviews for the &quot;R30&quot; DVD, the band members revealed their intention to begin writing new material in early 2006. While in Toronto, Lifeson and Lee began the songwriting process in January 2006. During this time, Peart assumed his role of lyric writing while residing in Southern California. The following September, Rush hired American producer Nick Raskulinecz to co-produce the album. The band officially entered Allaire Studios in Shokan, New York, in November 2006 to record the bulk of the material. Taking the band five weeks, the sessions ended in December. On February 14, 2007, an announcement was made on the official Rush website that the title of the new album would be &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot;. The first single, &quot;Far Cry&quot;, was released to North American radio stations on March 12, 2007, and reached No. 2 on the Mediabase Mainstream and Radio and Records Charts.
The Rush website, newly redesigned on March 12, 2007, to support the new album, also announced that the band would embark on a tour to begin in the summer. &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; was released on May 1, 2007, in North America, where it debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with approximately 93,000 units sold in its first week. It also peaked at No. 3 in Canada and No. 13 in the UK, selling an estimated 611,000 copies worldwide. To coincide with the beginning of Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, &quot;Spindrift&quot; was released as the official second radio single on June 1, 2007, while &quot;The Larger Bowl (A Pantoum)&quot; saw single status on June 25, 2007. &quot;The Larger Bowl&quot; peaked within the top 20 of both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock and Mediabase Mainstream charts, but &quot;Spindrift&quot; failed to appear on any commercial chart. The planned intercontinental tour in support of &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; began on June 13, 2007, in Atlanta, Georgia, coming to a close on October 29, 2007, at Hartwall Arena in Helsinki, Finland.

The 2008 portion of the &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; tour began on April 11, 2008, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, at José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum, and concluded on July 24, 2008, in Noblesville, Indiana at the Verizon Wireless Music Center. On April 15, 2008, the band released &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows Live&quot;, a double live album documenting the first leg of the tour, recorded at the Ahoy arena in Rotterdam, Netherlands on October 16 and 17, 2007. A DVD and Blu-ray recording of the same concerts was released on November 24, 2008. As Rush neared the conclusion of the &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; tour, they announced their first appearance on American television in over 30 years. They appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; on July 16, 2008, where they were interviewed by Stephen Colbert and performed &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;. Continuing to ride what film critic Manohla Dargis called a &quot;pop cultural wave&quot;, the band appeared as themselves in the 2009 comedy film &quot;I Love You, Man&quot;.

===2009–2013: Time Machine Tour and &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;===
On February 16, 2009, Lifeson remarked that the band might begin working on a new album in the fall of 2009, with Nick Raskulinecz once again producing. In November 2009, Lee, Lifeson and Peart were awarded the International Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards in Toronto. On March 19, 2010, the CBC posted a video interview with Lee and Lifeson in which they discussed Rush&#x27;s induction into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame on March 28, 2010, at the Toronto Centre for the Arts&#x27; George Weston Recital Hall. The band was recognized for the songs &quot;Limelight&quot;, &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot;, &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;, &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Subdivisions&quot;. In addition to discussing their induction, Lee and Lifeson touched on future material, with Lee saying, &quot;Just about a month and a half ago we had no songs. And now we&#x27;ve been writing, and now we&#x27;ve got about 6 songs that we just love ...&quot; On March 26, 2010, in an interview with The Globe and Mail, Lifeson remarked that there was even the potential for two supporting tours. Soon after, Peart confirmed that Raskulinecz had returned as co-producer.

In April 2010, Rush entered Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee with Raskulinecz to record &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;BU2B&quot;, two new songs to be featured on the band&#x27;s then-upcoming studio album &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;. &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;BU2B&quot; were released together on June 1, 2010, and made available for digital download. The Time Machine Tour&#x27;s first leg began on June 29 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and finished on October 17 in Santiago, Chile, at the National Stadium. It featured the album &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; played in its entirety, as well as &quot;Caravan&quot; and &quot;BU2B&quot;. It was suggested that Rush would return to the studio after the completion of the Time Machine Tour with plans to release &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; in 2011. However, Rush announced on November 19, 2010, that they would be extending the Time Machine Tour. The second leg began on March 30, 2011, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and came to an end on July 2, 2011, in Seattle, Washington. On November 8, 2011, the band released &quot;Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland&quot;, a concert DVD, Blu-ray and double CD documenting the April 15, 2011, concert at the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. After the tour&#x27;s second leg was finished, Rush entered Revolution Recording studios in Toronto to finalize the recording of &quot;Clockwork Angels.&quot; The second single, &quot;Headlong Flight&quot;, was released on April 19, 2012. Peart and author Kevin J. Anderson collaborated on a novelization of &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; that was released in September 2012.

&quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on June 12, 2012, reaching No. 1 in Canada, No. 2 in the US, No. 21 in the UK and entering the Top 10 in most of Rush&#x27;s traditional northern European markets. The supporting Clockwork Angels Tour began on September 7, 2012, with performances on November 25 in Phoenix, Arizona and November 28 in Dallas, Texas, recorded to make a live CD/DVD/Blu-ray that was released on November 19, 2013. During Rush&#x27;s European leg of the &quot;Clockwork Angels Tour&quot;, the June 8, 2013, show at the Sweden Rock Festival was the group&#x27;s first festival appearance in 30 years. On August 31, 2011, Rush switched their American distribution from Atlantic Records to the Warner Brothers majority-owned metal label Roadrunner Records. Roadrunner handled American distribution of &quot;Time Machine 2011: Live in Cleveland&quot; and &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;. Anthem/Universal Music would continue to release their music in Canada. On April 18, 2013, Rush were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

===2013–2020: R40 Tour, disbandment and Peart&#x27;s death===
On November 18, 2013, Lifeson said the band would take a year off, following the completion of the world tour in support of &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;. &quot;We&#x27;ve committed to taking about a year off&quot;, Lifeson said. &quot;We all agreed when we finished this [&quot;Clockwork Angels&quot;] tour [in early August], we were going to take this time off and we weren&#x27;t going to talk about band stuff or make any plans. We committed to a year, so that&#x27;s going to take us through to the end of next summer, for sure. That&#x27;s the minimum. We haven&#x27;t stopped or quit. Right now we&#x27;re just relaxing. We&#x27;re taking it easy and just enjoying our current employment.&quot;

In September 2014, the &quot;Rush R40&quot; box set was announced to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the release of the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album. It included five previously released live video albums, and various previously unreleased footage from across the band&#x27;s career. On January 22, 2015, the band announced the Rush R40 Tour, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Peart&#x27;s membership in the band. The tour started on May 8 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and wrapped up on August 1 in Los Angeles.

On April 29, 2015, Lifeson said in an interview that R40 might be the final large-scale Rush tour due to his psoriatic arthritis and Peart&#x27;s chronic tendinitis. He noted that it didn&#x27;t necessarily mean an end to the band, suggesting the possibility of smaller tours and limited performances. He also said he wanted to work on soundtracks with Lee. On December 7, 2015, Peart stated in an interview that he was retiring. The following day, Lee insisted that Peart&#x27;s remarks had been taken out of context, and suggested he was &quot;simply taking a break&quot;. Lifeson confirmed in 2016 that the R40 tour was the band&#x27;s last large-scale tour. The band&#x27;s latest documentary, &quot;Time Stand Still&quot;, was announced in November 2016.

On January 16, 2018, Lifeson told &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that it was unlikely that Rush would play any more shows or record new material. He said, &quot;We have no plans to tour or record anymore. We&#x27;re basically done. After 41 years, we felt it was enough.&quot; In October 2018, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published an interview with Lee, who said, 
On January 7, 2020, Peart died at the age of 67 following a 3½-year battle with glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. A year later, Lee confirmed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Rush was &quot;over&quot; and expressed the impossibility of the band continuing without Peart: &quot;That&#x27;s finished, right? That&#x27;s over. I still am very proud of what we did. I don&#x27;t know what I will do again in music. And I&#x27;m sure Al doesn&#x27;t, whether its together, apart, or whatever. But the music of Rush is always part of us. And I would never hesitate to play one of those songs in the right context. But at the same time, you have to give respect to what the three of us with Neil did together.&quot;

===2021–present: aftermath===
In a January 2021 interview with Make Weird Music, Lifeson revealed that he and Lee were talking of working together on new music: &quot;We&#x27;re both eager to get back together and kind of get back into that thing that we&#x27;ve done since we were 14 years old that we love to do. And we work really, really well together. So we&#x27;ll see what happens with that.&quot; Lifeson reiterated the status of Rush and the possibility of continuing to work with Lee in a June 2021 interview with Eddie Trunk: 
In August 2022, Lee and Lifeson returned to the stage at the &quot;South Park&quot; 25th anniversary concert in Colorado, with &quot;South Park&quot;″s co-creator Matt Stone on drums to perform &quot;Closer to the Heart&quot; alongside the members of Primus, their first performance since the death of Peart.

In September 2022, Lee and Lifeson performed at the London Taylor Hawkins tribute concert with Dave Grohl and Omar Hakim on drums. They performed &quot;2112: Overture&quot;, &quot;Working Man&quot;, and &quot;YYZ&quot;, the latter of which was Hawkins&#x27; favourite Rush song. Later that month, Lee and Lifeson played the same set at the second Taylor Hawkins Tribute show in Los Angeles. Grohl once again drummed on &quot;2112&quot;, Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers joined them for &quot;Working Man&quot;, and Danny Carey from Tool drummed for &quot;YYZ&quot;. Those appearances fuelled speculation over a possible Rush reunion, with Paul McCartney (who attended the Hawkins tribute shows) urging Lee and Lifeson to tour again, and Smith commenting, &quot;Those guys are so happy to be playing again... They were part of the show. They loved it and enjoyed the hell out of it. Those guys miss playing. They couldn&#x27;t play anymore, Neil couldn&#x27;t do it anymore, but they still want to play.&quot;

Lee told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in November 2023 that he would not rule out performing with Lifeson again as Rush, saying, &quot;It was nice to know that if we decide to go out, Alex and I, whether we went out as part of a new thing, or whether we just wanted to go out and play Rush as Rush, we could do that now.&quot; When asked in the following month by &quot;CBS News Sunday Morning&quot; if he and Lifeson had talked about continuing as Rush with a new drummer, Lee said, &quot;Have we talked about it? Yeah. It&#x27;s not impossible, but at this point, I can&#x27;t guarantee it.&quot; Lifeson then expressed optimism about the band&#x27;s future, stating that, &quot;It&#x27;s just not in our DNA to stop.&quot; Lifeson later stated in a January 2024 interview that he was no longer interested in touring, citing arthritis and expressing doubt that he could perform as he did years ago. In May 2024, Lifeson stated that he and Lee were playing songs together, but continued to rule out the possibility of ever going back on tour, declaring that he is &quot;proud of the fact&quot; that Rush &quot;was over when it was over.&quot; In that same month, Lee and Lifeson appeared together onstage at a Gordon Lightfoot tribute concert at the Massey Hall, where they joined Blue Rodeo to perform one of Lightfoot&#x27;s songs &quot;The Way I Feel&quot;.

An anthology box set, titled &quot;Rush 50&quot;, is due for release on March 21, 2025. In addition to tracks from all of their studio albums, the box set contains live tracks dating back to 1974 through the band&#x27;s final show in 2015, and also marks the first time that their 1973 debut single &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; and its B-side &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fight It&quot; have been made available on any other format.

==Musical style and influences==
Rush&#x27;s musical style had changed substantially over the years. Its debut album was strongly influenced by British blues-based hard rock: an amalgam of sounds and styles from such rock bands as the Beatles, Black Sabbath, the Who, Cream, and Led Zeppelin. Rush became increasingly influenced by bands of the British progressive rock movement of the mid-1970s, especially Pink Floyd, Genesis, Yes, and Jethro Tull. In the tradition of progressive rock, Rush wrote extended songs with irregular and shifting mood, timbre, and metre, combined with lyrics influenced by Ayn Rand. In the 1980s, Rush merged their sound with the trends of this period, experimenting with new wave, reggae, and pop rock. This period included the band&#x27;s most extensive use of instruments such as synthesizers, sequencers, and electronic percussion. In the early 1990s, the band transformed their style once again to return to a more grounded hard rock style and simultaneously harmonize with the alternative rock movement.

==Reputation and legacy==

More than 40 years of activity provided Rush with the opportunity for musical diversity across their discography. As with many bands known for experimentation, changes inevitably resulted in dissent among critics and fans. The bulk of the band&#x27;s music included synthetic instruments, and this has been a source of contention among fans and critics, especially the band&#x27;s heavy usage of synthesizers and keyboards during the 1980s, particularly on &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, &quot;Power Windows&quot;, and &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;.

The members of Rush have noted that people &quot;either love Rush or hate Rush&quot;, resulting in strong detractors and an intensely loyal fan base. In 1979, &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; called them &quot;the power boogie band for the &quot;16&quot; magazine graduating class&quot;. A July 2008 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article stated, &quot;Rush fans are the Trekkies/trekkers of rock&quot;. Rush have been cited as an influence by artists including Alice in Chains, Anthrax, Dream Theater, Exciter, Fates Warning, Fishbone, Foo Fighters, Iron Maiden, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Living Colour, Manic Street Preachers, Megadeth, Meshuggah, Metallica, No Doubt, Pearl Jam, the Pixies, Primus, Queensrÿche, Rage Against the Machine, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sepultura, the Smashing Pumpkins, Elliott Smith, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots, System of a Down, Testament, Tool, and Steven Wilson. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails said in the 2010 documentary &quot;&quot; that Rush is one of his favourite bands, and he has also cited the band&#x27;s early 1980s period in particular as a major influence on him in regard to incorporating keyboards and synthesizers into hard rock.

Rush were eligible for nomination into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame beginning in 1998. The band were nominated for entry in 2012, and their induction was announced on December 11, 2012. A reason for their previous exclusion may have been their genre. &quot;USA Today&quot; writer Edna Gundersen criticized the Hall of Fame for excluding some genres, including progressive rock. Supporters cited the band&#x27;s accomplishments, including longevity, proficiency, and influence, as well as commercial sales figures and RIAA certifications. In the years before induction, Lifeson expressed his indifference toward the perceived slight, saying, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t care less. Look who&#x27;s up for induction; it&#x27;s a joke&quot;.

On April 24, 2010, the documentary &quot;Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage&quot;, directed by Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. It went on to receive the Tribeca Film Festival Audience Award. The film was also nominated for Best Long Form Music Video at the 53rd Grammy Awards, losing to &quot;When You&#x27;re Strange&quot;, a documentary about The Doors. A limited theatrical run began on June 10, 2010, and the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the US and Canada on June 29, 2010. The film explores the band&#x27;s influence on popular music and the reasons why that influence has been underrepresented over the years. This is done via interviews with popular musicians, music industry professionals, and the band members themselves.

On June 25, 2010, Rush received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard. Critical acclaim continued to mount for Rush in 2010 when, on September 28, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; announced that Rush would receive that year&#x27;s Living Legends award at the Marshall Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards in the UK. The award was presented on November 10, 2010. On September 29, Billboard.com announced that Rush would also receive the 2010 Legends of Live award for significant and lasting contributions to live music and the art of performing live and reaching fans through the concert experience. The award was presented at the Billboard Live Music Awards on November 4, 2010.

In 2013, the Canadian government honoured Rush with a first class &quot;permanent&quot; postage stamp, the equivalent of a &quot;Forever&quot; stamp in the US, featuring the iconic &quot;Starman&quot; Rush logo.

The band members were made Officers of the Order of Canada in 1996. In May 2012, the band received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement at a ceremony at Rideau Hall, followed the next by a gala at the National Arts Centre celebrating the award recipients. In 2017, the band members had three new microbe species named in their honour.

===Geddy Lee===

Geddy Lee&#x27;s high-register vocal style has always been a signature of the band – and sometimes a focal point for criticism, especially during the early years of Rush&#x27;s career when his vocals were high-pitched, with a strong likeness to other singers like Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined that Lee&#x27;s voice &quot;suggests a munchkin giving a sermon&quot;. Although his voice has softened, it is often described as a &quot;wail&quot;. His instrumental abilities, on the other hand, are rarely criticized. He has cited Jeff Berlin, Jack Casady, John Entwistle, Jack Bruce and Chris Squire as the bassists who had the biggest impact on his playing style. Lee&#x27;s style, technique, and ability on the bass guitar have been influential to rock and heavy metal musicians, inspiring players including Steve Harris, John Myung, Les Claypool, and Cliff Burton. Lee is able to operate various pieces of instrumentation simultaneously during concerts, most evidently when he plays bass and keyboards, sings, and triggers foot pedals as in the song &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;.

===Alex Lifeson===

Lifeson as a guitarist is best known for his signature riffing, electronic effects and processing, unorthodox chord structures, and a copious arsenal of equipment used over the years.

During his adolescent years, he was influenced by Jimi Hendrix, Pete Townshend, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page. Lifeson incorporated touches of Spanish and classical music into Rush&#x27;s sound during the 1970s, reflecting his interest in progressive rock guitarists like Steve Hackett and Steve Howe. To adapt to Lee&#x27;s expanding use of synthesizers in the 1980s, Lifeson took inspiration from guitarists like Allan Holdsworth, Andy Summers of The Police and The Edge of U2, who gave him models for rethinking the guitar&#x27;s role in Rush&#x27;s music. Lifeson&#x27;s guitar returned to the forefront in the 1990s, and especially on &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; (2002). During live performances, he was responsible for cuing various guitar effects, the use of bass-pedal synthesizers and backing vocals. He has occasionally played keyboard synthesizers live.

===Neil Peart===

Peart has been voted the greatest rock drummer by music fans, critics and fellow musicians, according to Drummerworld. He was also regarded as one of the finest practitioners of the in-concert drum solo. Initially inspired by Keith Moon, Peart absorbed the influence of other rock drummers from the 1960s and 1970s such as Ginger Baker, Carmine Appice, and John Bonham. Incorporation of unusual instruments (for rock drummers of the time) such as the glockenspiel and tubular bells, along with several standard kit elements, helped create a highly varied setup. Continually modified, Peart&#x27;s drumkit offered an enormous array of percussion instruments for sonic diversity. For two decades Peart honed his technique; each new Rush album introduced an expanded percussive vocabulary. In the 1990s, he reinvented his style with the help of drum coach Freddie Gruber.

Peart also served as Rush&#x27;s primary lyricist, attracting attention over the years for his eclectic style. During the band&#x27;s early years, Peart&#x27;s lyrics were largely fantasy/science fiction-focused, though after 1980 he focused more on social, emotional, and humanitarian issues. In 2007, he was placed second on &quot;Blender&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;40 Worst Lyricists In Rock&quot;. In contrast, AllMusic has called Peart &quot;one of rock&#x27;s most accomplished lyricists&quot;, Gibson.com describes Rush&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;great&quot;, and others have called the lyrics &quot;brilliant&quot;.

==Sales==
Rush has released 24 gold records and 14 platinum records (including three multi-platinum), placing them fifth behind the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Kiss and Aerosmith for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band in the United States. As of 2005, Rush had sold about 25 million copies of their albums in the US (ranked 88th among recording acts) and 40 million worldwide. As of April 2021, &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was the band&#x27;s highest-selling album at over 5 million units, having been certified 5× platinum by the RIAA.

Despite dropping out of the public eye for five years after the gold-selling &quot;Test for Echo&quot; (which peaked at No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart) and the band being relegated almost solely to classic rock stations in the US, &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in its first week of release in 2002, with 108,000 copies sold. It has sold about 343,000 units to date. The subsequent &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; tour grossed over $24 million and included the largest audience ever to see a headlining Rush show: 60,000 fans in São Paulo, Brazil.

Rush&#x27;s triple-CD live album, &quot;Rush in Rio&quot; (2003), was certified gold, marking the fourth decade in which a Rush album had been released and certified at least gold. In 2004, &quot;Feedback&quot; cracked the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received radio airplay. The band&#x27;s 2007 album, &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot;, debuted at No. 3 (just one position shy of Rush&#x27;s highest-peaking albums, &quot;Counterparts&quot; (1993) and &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; (2012), which both debuted at No. 2) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling about 93,000 in its first week of release. This marks the 13th Rush studio album to appear in the Top 20 and the band&#x27;s 27th album to appear on the chart. The album also debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard&#x27;s Top Rock Albums chart, and, when the album was released on the MVI format a month later, peaked at No. 1 on the Top Internet Albums chart.

The tours in support of &quot;Snakes &amp; Arrows&quot; in 2007 and 2008 accrued $21 million and $18.3 million respectively, earning Rush the No. 6 and 8 spots among the summers&#x27; rock concerts.

==Live performances==
The members of Rush shared a strong work ethic, desiring to accurately recreate songs from their albums when playing live performances. To achieve this goal, beginning in the late 1980s, Rush included a capacious rack of digital samplers in their concert equipment to recreate the sounds of non-traditional instruments, accompaniments, vocal harmonies, and other sound &quot;events&quot; in real time to match the sounds on the studio versions of the songs. In live performances, the band members shared duties throughout most songs. Each member had one or more MIDI controllers, which were loaded with different sounds for each song, and they used available limbs to trigger the sounds while simultaneously playing their primary instrument(s). It was with this technology that the group was able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity fans had come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of backing tracks or employing an additional band member. The members&#x27; coordinated use of pedal keyboards and other electronic triggers to &quot;play&quot; sampled instruments and audio events was subtly visible in their live performances, especially on the R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour, their 2005 concert DVD.

A staple of Rush&#x27;s concerts was Neil Peart&#x27;s drum solos, which included a basic framework of routines connected by sections of improvisation, making each performance unique. Each successive tour saw his solos become more advanced, with some routines dropped in favour of newer, more complex ones. Since the mid-1980s, Peart used MIDI trigger pads to elicit sounds sampled from various pieces of acoustic percussion that would otherwise consume far too much stage area, such as a marimba, harp, temple blocks, triangles, glockenspiel, orchestra bells, tubular bells, and vibraslap, as well as other, more esoteric percussion.

One prominent feature of Rush&#x27;s concerts were props on stage, at one point called &quot;diversions&quot;. These props have included washing machines, vintage popcorn poppers, animations, and inflatable rabbits emerging from giant hats behind the band. Starting in the mid-&#x27;90s, the props often took up Lee&#x27;s side of the stage (stage left) as a way to balance out the amp stacks on Lifeson&#x27;s side (stage right) when Lee opted to use a venue&#x27;s house system instead of amps.

==Philanthropy==
Rush actively participated in philanthropic causes. The band were one of several hometown favourites to play Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto, also dubbed SARStock, at Downsview Park in Toronto on July 30, 2003, with an attendance of over half a million people. The concert benefited the Toronto economy after the SARS outbreaks earlier in the year. The band has also sustained an interest in promoting human rights. They donated $100,000 to the Canadian Museum for Human Rights after a concert they held in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on May 24, 2008.

On July 24, 2013, Rush performed a benefit concert in Red Deer, Alberta, at the ENMAX Centrium, with all proceeds going to the Canadian Red Cross to help victims of the 2013 flooding that devastated many regions of southern Alberta. The original venue for the show, the Scotiabank Saddledome, was heavily damaged from the flooding and was unavailable for the concert date as originally planned.

The individual members of Rush have also been a part of philanthropic causes. Hughes &amp; Kettner zenTera and TriAmp electronics have been endorsed and used by Lifeson for many years. A custom signature amplifier was engineered by Lifeson and released in April 2005 with the stipulation that UNICEF receive a $50 donation for every Alex Lifeson Signature TriAmp sold. Lee, a longtime fan of baseball, donated 200 baseballs signed by famous Negro league players, including Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and Josh Gibson, to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in June 2008. In late 2009, Lee and Lifeson launched an auction for their initiative &quot;Grapes Under Pressure&quot;, in support of the cause &quot;Grapes for Humanity&quot;. The auction consisted of items from the band such as autographed guitars, cymbals and basses. There were also autographs by band members from Depeche Mode, Tool, the Fray, Judas Priest, Pearl Jam and more, as well as signatures from Ricky, Julian and Bubbles from &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; on a rare Epiphone guitar.

The band is featured on the album &quot;Songs for Tibet&quot;, appearing with other celebrities as an initiative to support Tibet and the current Dalai Lama Tenzin Gyatso. The album, made downloadable on August 5, 2008, via iTunes, was released commercially on August 12, 2008.

Rush have also been big supporters of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education programs in disadvantaged US public schools. They teamed up with Musician&#x27;s Friend and Sabian to help Little Kids Rock provide percussion to public schools nationwide. They donated $500 of the proceeds from every Neil Peart Paragon Cymbal Pack sold, each of which came with a free splash cymbal personalized, autographed, and dated by Peart. The cause-based marketing initiative raised over $50,000 for Little Kids Rock.

<doc id="25433" wikidata="Q9960" url="?curid=25433" title="Ronald Reagan">
<text>Ronald Wilson Reagan (February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. He was a member of the Republican Party and became an important figure in the American conservative movement. His presidency is known as the Reagan era.

Born in Illinois, Reagan graduated from Eureka College in 1932 and was hired the next year as a sports broadcaster in Iowa. In 1937, he moved to California where he became a well-known film actor. During his acting career, Reagan was president of the Screen Actors Guild twice, from 1947 to 1952 and from 1959 to 1960. In the 1950s, he hosted &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; and worked as a motivational speaker for General Electric. Reagan&#x27;s &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot; speech during the 1964 presidential election launched his rise as a leading conservative figure. After being elected governor of California in 1966, he raised state taxes, turned the state budget deficit into a surplus and implemented harsh crackdowns on university protests. Following his loss to Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican Party presidential primaries, Reagan won the Republican Party&#x27;s nomination and then a landslide victory over President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election.

In his first term as president, Reagan began implementing &quot;Reaganomics&quot;, which involved economic deregulation and cuts in both taxes and government spending during a period of stagflation. On the world stage, he escalated the arms race, increased military spending, transitioned Cold War policy away from the policies of &quot;détente&quot; with the Soviet Union, and ordered the 1983 invasion of Grenada. He also survived an assassination attempt, fought public-sector labor unions, expanded the war on drugs, and was slow to respond to the AIDS epidemic. In the 1984 presidential election, he defeated former vice president Walter Mondale in another landslide victory. Foreign affairs dominated Reagan&#x27;s second term, including the 1986 bombing of Libya, the secret and illegal sale of arms to Iran to fund the Contras, and engaging in negotiations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, which culminated in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

Reagan left the presidency in 1989 with the American economy having seen a significant reduction of inflation, the unemployment rate having fallen, and the U.S. having entered its then-longest peacetime expansion. At the same time, the national debt had nearly tripled since 1981 as a result of his cuts in taxes and increased military spending, despite cuts to domestic discretionary spending. Reagan&#x27;s foreign policies also contributed to the end of the Cold War. Though he planned an active post-presidency, it was hindered, after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1994, and his physical and mental capacities gradually deteriorated, leading to his death in 2004. His tenure constituted a realignment toward conservative policies in the United States, and he is often considered an icon of American conservatism. Historical rankings of U.S. presidents have typically placed Reagan in the upper tier, and his post-presidential approval ratings by the general public are usually high.

==Early life==
Ronald Wilson Reagan was born on February 6, 1911, in an apartment in Tampico, Illinois, as the younger son of Nelle Clyde Wilson and Jack Reagan. Nelle was committed to the Disciples of Christ, which believed in the Social Gospel. She led prayer meetings and ran mid-week prayers at her church when the pastor was out of town. Reagan credited her spiritual influence and he became a Christian. According to American political figure Stephen Vaughn, Reagan&#x27;s values came from his pastor, and the First Christian Church&#x27;s religious, economic and social positions &quot;coincided with the words, if not the beliefs of the latter-day Reagan&quot;. Jack focused on making money to take care of the family, but this was complicated by his alcoholism. Reagan had an older brother, Neil. The family lived in Chicago, Galesburg, and Monmouth before returning to Tampico. In 1920, they settled in Dixon, Illinois, living in a house near the H. C. Pitney Variety Store Building.

Reagan attended Dixon High School, where he developed interests in drama and football. His first job was as a lifeguard at the Rock River in Lowell Park. In 1928, Reagan began attending Eureka College, which Nelle approved because of its affiliation with the Disciples of Christ. He was a mediocre student who participated in sports, drama, and campus politics. He became student body president and joined a student strike that resulted in the college president&#x27;s resignation. Reagan was initiated as a member of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity and served as president of the local chapter. Reagan played at the guard position for the 1930 and 1931 Eureka Red Devils football teams and recalled a time when two Black teammates were refused service at a segregated hotel; he invited them to his parents&#x27; home nearby in Dixon and his parents welcomed them. At the time, his parents&#x27; stance on racial questions was unusually progressive in Dixon. Reagan himself had grown up with very few Black Americans and was oblivious to racial discrimination.

==Entertainment career==
===Radio and film===
After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in economics and sociology from Eureka College in 1932, Reagan took a job in Davenport, Iowa, as a sports broadcaster for four football games in the Big Ten Conference. He then worked for WHO radio in Des Moines as a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs. His specialty was creating play-by-play accounts of games using only basic descriptions that the station received by wire as the games were in progress. Simultaneously, he often expressed his opposition to racism. In 1936, while traveling with the Cubs to their spring training in California, Reagan took a screen test that led to a seven-year contract with Warner Bros.

Reagan arrived at Hollywood in 1937, debuting in &quot;Love Is on the Air&quot; (1937). Using a simple and direct approach to acting and following his directors&#x27; instructions, Reagan made thirty films, mostly B films, before beginning military service in April 1942. He broke out of these types of films by portraying George Gipp in &quot;Knute Rockne, All American&quot; (1940), which would be rejuvenated when reporters called Reagan &quot;the Gipper&quot; while he campaigned for president. Reagan starred in &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942) as a leg amputee; this performance was considered his best by many critics. Reagan became a star, with Gallup polls placing him &quot;in the top 100 stars&quot; from 1941 to 1942.

World War II interrupted the movie stardom that Reagan would never be able to achieve again as Warner Bros. became uncertain about his ability to generate ticket sales. Reagan, who had a limited acting range, was dissatisfied with the roles he received. Lew Wasserman renegotiated his contract with his studio, allowing him to also make films with Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and RKO Pictures as a freelancer. Reagan appeared in multiple western films, something that had been denied to him while working at Warner Bros. In 1952, he ended his relationship with Warner Bros., but went on to appear in a total of 53 films, his last being &quot;The Killers&quot; (1964).

===Military service===
In April 1937, Reagan enlisted in the United States Army Reserve. He was assigned as a private in Des Moines&#x27; 322nd Cavalry Regiment and reassigned to second lieutenant in the Officers Reserve Corps. He later became a part of the 323rd Cavalry Regiment in California. As relations between the United States and Japan worsened, Reagan was ordered for active duty while he was filming &quot;Kings Row&quot;. Wasserman and Warner Bros. lawyers successfully sent draft deferments to complete the film in October 1941. However, to avoid accusations of Reagan being a draft dodger, the studio let him go in April 1942.

Reagan reported for duty with severe near-sightedness. His first assignment was at Fort Mason as a liaison officer, a role that allowed him to transfer to the United States Army Air Forces (AAF). Reagan became an AAF public relations officer and was assigned to the 18th AAF Base Unit in Culver City where he felt that it was &quot;impossible to remove an incompetent or lazy worker&quot; due to what he felt was &quot;the incompetence, the delays, and inefficiencies&quot; of the federal bureaucracy. Despite this, Reagan participated in the Provisional Task Force Show Unit in Burbank and continued to make theatrical films. He was also ordered to temporary duty in New York City to participate in the sixth War Loan Drive before being reassigned to Fort MacArthur until his discharge on December 9, 1945, as a captain. Throughout his military service, Reagan produced over 400 training films.

===Screen Actors Guild presidency===
When Robert Montgomery resigned as president of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) on March 10, 1947, Reagan was elected to that position in a special election. Reagan&#x27;s first tenure saw various labor–management disputes, the Hollywood blacklist, and the Taft–Hartley Act&#x27;s implementation. Reagan aligned the union with the studios against the Conference of Studio Unions in the aftermath of the Hollywood Black Friday strike. In &quot;The Invisible Bridge,&quot; Rick Perlstein wrote that Reagan&#x27;s actions lent legitimacy to the studio&#x27;s efforts to crush the more radical union by giving liberals in SAG who did not want to strike &quot;a story that turned them into moral innocents instead of scabs&quot;. On April 10, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) interviewed Reagan and he provided the names of actors whom he believed to be communist sympathizers. During a House Un-American Activities Committee hearing, Reagan testified that some guild members were associated with the Communist Party and that he was well-informed about a &quot;jurisdictional strike&quot;. When asked if he was aware of communist efforts within the Screen Writers Guild, he called information about the efforts &quot;hearsay&quot;. Reagan resigned as SAG president November 10, 1952, but remained on the board.

The SAG fought with film producers for the right to receive residual payments, and on November 16, 1959, the board elected Reagan SAG president for the second time. Reagan managed to secure payments for actors whose theatrical films had been released between 1948 and 1959 and subsequently televised. The producers were initially required to pay the actors fees, but they ultimately settled instead for providing pensions and paying residuals for films made after 1959. Reagan resigned from the SAG presidency on June 7, 1960, and also left the board.

===Marriages and children===
In January 1940, Reagan married Jane Wyman, his co-star in the 1938 film &quot;Brother Rat&quot;. Together, they had two biological daughters: Maureen in 1941, and Christine in 1947 (born prematurely and died the following day). They adopted one son, Michael, in 1945. Wyman filed for divorce in June 1948. She was uninterested in politics, and occasionally recriminated, reconciled and separated with him. Although Reagan was unprepared, the divorce was finalized in July 1949. Reagan would remain close to his children. Later that year, Reagan met Nancy Davis after she contacted him in his capacity as the SAG president about her name appearing on a communist blacklist in Hollywood; she had been mistaken for another Nancy Davis. They married in March 1952, and had two children, Patti in October 1952, and Ron in May 1958. Reagan has three grandchildren.

===Television===
Reagan became the host of MCA Inc. television production &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; at Wasserman&#x27;s recommendation. It featured multiple guest stars, and Ronald and Nancy Reagan, continuing to use her stage name Nancy Davis, acted together in three episodes. When asked how Reagan was able to recruit such stars to appear on the show during television&#x27;s infancy, he replied, &quot;Good stories, top direction, production quality&quot;. However, the viewership declined in the 1960s and the show was canceled in 1962. In 1965, Reagan became the host of another MCA production, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;.

==Early political activities==
Reagan began his political career as a Democrat, viewing Franklin D. Roosevelt as &quot;a true hero&quot;. He joined the American Veterans Committee and Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (HICCASP), worked with the AFL–CIO to fight right-to-work laws, and continued to speak out against racism when he was in Hollywood. In 1945, Reagan planned to lead an HICCASP anti-nuclear rally, but Warner Bros. prevented him from going. In 1946, he appeared in a radio program called &quot;Operation Terror&quot; to speak out against rising Ku Klux Klan activity, calling it a &quot;capably organized systematic campaign of fascist violence and intimidation and horror&quot;. Reagan supported Harry S. Truman in the 1948 presidential election, and Helen Gahagan Douglas for the U.S. Senate in 1950. It was Reagan&#x27;s belief that communism was a powerful backstage influence in Hollywood that led him to rally his friends against them.

Reagan began shifting to the right when he supported the presidential campaigns of Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and Richard Nixon in 1960. When Reagan was contracted by General Electric (GE), he gave speeches to their employees. His speeches had a positive take on free markets. In 1961, Reagan adapted his speeches into another speech to criticize Medicare. In his view, its legislation would have meant &quot;the end of individual freedom in the United States&quot;. In 1962, Reagan was dropped by GE, and he formally registered as a Republican.

In the 1964 U.S. presidential election, Reagan gave a speech for presidential contender Barry Goldwater that was eventually referred to as &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot;. Reagan argued that the Founding Fathers &quot;knew that governments don&#x27;t control things. And they knew when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose&quot; and that &quot;We&#x27;ve been told increasingly that we must choose between left or right&quot;. Even though the speech was not enough to turn around the faltering Goldwater campaign, it increased Reagan&#x27;s profile among conservatives. David S. Broder and Stephen H. Hess called it &quot;the most successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified the 1896 Democratic convention with his famous &#x27;Cross of Gold&#x27; address&quot;.

===1966 California gubernatorial election===

In January 1966, Reagan announced his candidacy for the California governorship, repeating his stances on individual freedom and big government. When he met with black Republicans in March, he was criticized for opposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Reagan responded that bigotry was not in his nature and later argued that certain provisions of the act infringed upon the rights of property owners. After the Supreme Court of California ruled that the initiative that repealed the Rumford Act was unconstitutional in May, he voiced his support for the act&#x27;s repeal, but later preferred amending it. In the Republican primary, Reagan defeated George Christopher, a moderate Republican who William F. Buckley Jr. thought had painted Reagan as extreme.

Reagan&#x27;s general election opponent, incumbent governor Pat Brown, attempted to label Reagan as an extremist. Reagan portrayed himself as a political outsider, and charged Brown as responsible for the Watts riots and lenient on crime. In numerous speeches, Reagan &quot;hit the Brown administration about high taxes, uncontrolled spending, the radicals at the University of California, Berkeley, and the need for accountability in government&quot;. Meanwhile, many in the press perceived Reagan as &quot;monumentally ignorant of state issues&quot;, though Lou Cannon said that Reagan benefited from an appearance he and Brown made on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; in September. Reagan won the governorship with 57 percent of the vote compared to Brown&#x27;s 42 percent.

== California governorship (1967–1975) ==

Brown had spent much of California&#x27;s funds on new programs, prompting them to use accrual accounting to avoid raising taxes. Consequently, it generated a larger deficit, and Reagan called for reduced government spending and tax hikes to balance the budget. He worked with Jesse M. Unruh on securing tax increases and promising future property tax cuts. This caused some conservatives to accuse Reagan of betraying his principles. As a result, taxes on sales, banks, corporate profits, inheritances, liquor, and cigarettes jumped. Kevin Starr states Reagan &quot;gave Californians the biggest tax hike in their history—and got away with it&quot;. In the 1970 gubernatorial election, Unruh used Reagan&#x27;s tax policy against him, saying it disproportionally favored the wealthy. Reagan countered that he was still committed to reducing property taxes. By 1973, the budget had a surplus, which Reagan preferred &quot;to give back to the people&quot;.

In 1967, Reagan reacted to the Black Panther Party&#x27;s strategy of copwatching by signing the Mulford Act to prohibit the public carrying of firearms. The act was California&#x27;s most restrictive piece of gun control legislation, with critics saying that it was &quot;overreacting to the political activism of organizations such as the Black Panthers&quot;. The act marked the beginning of both modern legislation and public attitude studies on gun control. Reagan also signed the 1967 Therapeutic Abortion Act that allowed abortions in the cases of rape and incest when a doctor determined the birth would impair the physical or mental health of the mother. He later expressed regret over signing it, saying that he was unaware of the mental health provision. He believed that doctors were interpreting the provision loosely, resulting in more abortions.

After Reagan won the 1966 election, he and his advisors planned a run in the 1968 Republican presidential primaries. He ran as an unofficial candidate to cut into Nixon&#x27;s southern support and be a compromise candidate if there were to be a brokered convention. He won California&#x27;s delegates, but Nixon secured enough delegates for the nomination.

Reagan had previously been critical of former governor Brown and university administrators for tolerating student demonstrations in the city of Berkeley, making it a major theme in his campaigning.
On February 5, 1969, Reagan declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing protests and violence at the University of California, Berkeley, and sent in the California Highway Patrol. In May 1969, these officers, along with local officers from Berkeley and Alameda county, clashed with protestors over a site known as the People&#x27;s Park. One student was shot and killed while many police officers and two reporters were injured. Reagan then commanded the state National Guard troops to occupy Berkeley for seventeen days to subdue the protesters, allowing other students to attend class safely. In February 1970, violent protests broke out near the University of California, Santa Barbara, where he once again deployed the National Guard. On April 7, Reagan defended his policies regarding campus protests, saying, &quot;If it takes a bloodbath, let&#x27;s get it over with. No more appeasement&quot;.
During his victorious reelection campaign in 1970, Reagan, remaining critical of government, promised to prioritize welfare reform. He was concerned that the programs were disincentivizing work and that the growing welfare rolls would lead to both an unbalanced budget and another big tax hike in 1972. At the same time, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to combat inflation, putting the American economy in a mild recession. Reagan worked with Bob Moretti to tighten up the eligibility requirements so that the financially needy could continue receiving payments. This was only accomplished after Reagan softened his criticism of Nixon&#x27;s Family Assistance Plan. Nixon then lifted regulations to shepherd California&#x27;s experiment. In 1976, the Employment Development Department published a report suggesting that the experiment that ran from 1971 to 1974 was unsuccessful.

Reagan declined to run for the governorship in 1974 and it was won by Pat Brown&#x27;s son, Jerry. Reagan&#x27;s governorship, as professor Gary K. Clabaugh writes, saw public schools deteriorate due to his opposition to additional basic education funding. As for higher education, journalist William Trombley believed that the budget cuts Reagan enacted damaged Berkeley&#x27;s student-faculty ratio and research. The homicide rate doubled and armed robbery rates rose by even more during Reagan&#x27;s eight years, even with the many laws Reagan signed to try toughening criminal sentencing and reforming the criminal justice system. Reagan strongly supported capital punishment, but his efforts to enforce it were thwarted by &quot;People v. Anderson&quot; in 1972. According to his son, Michael, Reagan said that he regretted signing the Family Law Act that granted no-fault divorces.

== Seeking the presidency (1975–1981) ==

===1976 Republican primaries===

Insufficiently conservative to Reagan and many other Republicans, President Gerald Ford suffered from multiple political and economic woes. Ford, running for president, was disappointed to hear him also run. Reagan was strongly critical of &quot;détente&quot; and Ford&#x27;s policy of &quot;détente&quot; with the Soviet Union. He repeated &quot;A Time for Choosing&quot; around the country before announcing his campaign on November 20, 1975, when he discussed economic and social problems, and to a lesser extent, foreign affairs. Both candidates were determined to knock each other out early in the primaries, but Reagan would devastatingly lose the first five primaries beginning with New Hampshire, where he popularized the welfare queen narrative about Linda Taylor, exaggerating her misuse of welfare benefits and igniting voter resentment for welfare reform, but never overtly mentioning her name or race.

In Florida, Reagan referred to a &quot;strapping young buck&quot;, which became an example of dog whistle politics, and attacked Ford for handing the Panama Canal to Panama&#x27;s government while Ford implied that he would end Social Security. Then, in Illinois, he again criticized Ford&#x27;s policy and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. Losing the first five primaries prompted Reagan to desperately win North Carolina&#x27;s by running a grassroots campaign and uniting with the Jesse Helms political machine that viciously attacked Ford. Reagan won an upset victory, convincing party delegates that Ford&#x27;s nomination was no longer guaranteed. Reagan won subsequent victories in Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Indiana with his attacks on social programs, opposition to forced busing, increased support from inclined voters of a declining George Wallace campaign for the Democratic nomination, and repeated criticisms of Ford and Kissinger&#x27;s policies, including &quot;détente&quot;.

The result was a seesaw battle for the 1,130 delegates required for their party&#x27;s nomination that neither would reach before the Kansas City convention in August and Ford replacing mentions of &quot;détente&quot; with Reagan&#x27;s preferred phrase, &quot;peace through strength&quot;. Reagan took John Sears&#x27; advice of choosing liberal Richard Schweiker as his running mate, hoping to pry loose of delegates from Pennsylvania and other states, and distract Ford. Instead, conservatives were left alienated, and Ford picked up the remaining uncommitted delegates, earning 1,187 to Reagan&#x27;s 1,070. Before giving his acceptance speech, Ford invited Reagan to address the convention; Reagan emphasized individual freedom and the dangers of nuclear weapons. In 1977, Ford told Cannon that Reagan&#x27;s primary challenge contributed to his own narrow loss to Democrat Jimmy Carter in the 1976 presidential election.

===1980 election===

Reagan emerged as a vocal critic of President Carter in 1977. The Panama Canal Treaty&#x27;s signing, the 1979 oil crisis, and rise in the interest, inflation and unemployment rates helped set up his 1980 presidential campaign, which he announced on November 13, 1979 with an indictment of the federal government. His announcement stressed his fundamental principles of tax cuts to stimulate the economy and having both a small government and a strong national defense, since he believed the United States was behind the Soviet Union militarily. Heading into 1980, his age became an issue among the press, and the United States was in a severe recession. 

In the primaries, Reagan unexpectedly lost the Iowa caucus to George H. W. Bush. Three days before the New Hampshire primary, the Reagan and Bush campaigns agreed to a one-on-one debate sponsored by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; at Nashua, New Hampshire, but hours before the debate, the Reagan campaign invited other candidates including Bob Dole, John B. Anderson, Howard Baker and Phil Crane. Debate moderator Jon Breen denied seats to the other candidates, asserting that &quot;The Telegraph&quot; would violate federal campaign contribution laws if it sponsored the debate and changed the ground rules hours before the debate. As a result, the Reagan campaign agreed to pay for the debate. Reagan said that as he was funding the debate, he could decide who would debate. During the debate, when Breen was laying out the ground rules and attempting to ask the first question, Reagan interrupted in protest to make an introductory statement and wanted other candidates to be included before the debate began. The moderator asked Bob Malloy, the volume operator, to mute Reagan&#x27;s microphone. After Breen repeated his demand to Malloy, Reagan furiously replied, &quot;I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!&quot;. This turned out to be the turning point of the debate and the primary race. Ultimately, the four additional candidates left, and the debate continued between Reagan and Bush. Reagan&#x27;s polling numbers improved, and he won the New Hampshire primary by more than 39,000 votes. Soon thereafter, Reagan&#x27;s opponents began dropping out of the primaries, including Anderson, who left the party to become an independent candidate. Reagan easily captured the presidential nomination and chose Bush as his running mate at the Detroit convention in July.

The general election pitted Reagan against Carter amid the multitude of domestic concerns and ongoing Iran hostage crisis that began on November 4, 1979. Reagan&#x27;s campaign worried that Carter would be able to secure the release of the American hostages in Iran as part of the October surprise, Carter &quot;suggested that Reagan would wreck Social Security&quot; and portrayed him as a warmonger, and Anderson carried support from liberal Republicans dissatisfied with Reagan&#x27;s conservatism. One of Reagan&#x27;s key strengths was his appeal to the rising conservative movement. Though most conservative leaders espoused cutting taxes and budget deficits, many conservatives focused more closely on social issues like abortion and gay rights. Evangelical Protestants became an increasingly important voting bloc, and they generally supported Reagan. Reagan also won the backing of Reagan Democrats. Though he advocated socially conservative viewpoints, Reagan focused much of his campaign on attacks against Carter&#x27;s foreign policy.

In August, Reagan gave a speech at the Neshoba County Fair, stating his belief in states&#x27; rights. Joseph Crespino argues that the visit was designed to reach out to Wallace-inclined voters, and some also saw these actions as an extension of the Southern strategy to garner white support for Republican candidates. Reagan&#x27;s supporters have said that this was his typical anti-big government rhetoric, without racial context or intent. In the October 28 debate, Carter chided Reagan for being against national health insurance. Reagan replied, &quot;There you go again&quot;, though the audience laughed and viewers found him more appealing. Reagan later asked the audience if they were better off than they were four years ago, slightly paraphrasing Roosevelt&#x27;s words in 1934. In 1983, Reagan&#x27;s campaign managers were revealed to having obtained Carter&#x27;s debate briefing book before the debates. On November 4, 1980, Reagan won in a decisive victory in the Electoral College over Carter, carrying 44 states and receiving 489 electoral votes to Carter&#x27;s 49 in six states and the District of Columbia. He won the popular vote by a narrower margin, receiving nearly 51 percent to Carter&#x27;s 41 percent and Anderson&#x27;s 7 percent. Republicans won a majority of seats in the Senate for the first time since 1952 while Democrats retained the House of Representatives.

== Presidency (1981–1989) ==


===First inauguration===

Reagan was inaugurated as the 40th president of the United States on January 20, 1981. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger administered the presidential oath of office. In his , Reagan commented on the country&#x27;s economic malaise, arguing, &quot;In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem&quot;. As a final insult to President Carter, Iran waited until Reagan had been sworn in before announcing the release of their American hostages.

===&quot;Reaganomics&quot; and the economy===
Reagan advocated a &quot;laissez-faire&quot; philosophy, and promoted a set of neoliberal reforms dubbed &quot;Reaganomics&quot;, which included monetarism and supply-side economics.

====Taxation====

Reagan worked with the boll weevil Democrats to pass tax and budget legislation in a Congress led by Tip O&#x27;Neill, a liberal who strongly criticized Reaganomics. He lifted federal oil and gasoline price controls on January 28, 1981, and in August, he signed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 to dramatically lower federal income tax rates and require exemptions and brackets to be indexed for inflation starting in 1985. Amid growing concerns about the mounting federal debt, Reagan signed the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, one of the eleven times Reagan raised taxes. The bill doubled the federal cigarette tax, rescinded a portion of the corporate tax cuts from the 1981 tax bill, and according to Paul Krugman, &quot;a third of the 1981 cut&quot; overall. Many of his supporters condemned the bill, but Reagan defended his preservation of cuts on individual income tax rates. By 1983, the amount of federal tax had fallen for all or most taxpayers, with taxes for higher-income people decreasing the most.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the number of tax brackets and top tax rate, and almost doubled personal exemptions.

To Reagan, the tax cuts would not have increased the deficit as long as there was enough economic growth and spending cuts. His policies proposed that economic growth would occur when the tax cuts spurred investments. This theoretical relationship has been illustrated by some with the controversial Laffer curve. Critics labeled this &quot;trickle-down economics&quot;, the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will spread to the poor. Milton Friedman and Robert Mundell argued that these policies invigorated America&#x27;s economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s.

====Inflation and unemployment====
Reagan took office in the midst of stagflation. The economy briefly experienced growth before plunging into a recession in July 1981. As Federal Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker fought inflation by pursuing a tight money policy of high interest rates, which restricted lending and investment, raised unemployment, and temporarily reduced economic growth. In December 1982, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured the unemployment rate at 10.8 percent. Around the same time, economic activity began to rise until its end in 1990, setting the record for the longest peacetime expansion. In 1983, the recession ended and Reagan nominated Volcker to a second term in fear of damaging confidence in the economic recovery.

Reagan appointed Alan Greenspan to succeed Volcker in 1987. Greenspan raised interest rates in another attempt to curb inflation, setting off the Black Monday stock market crash, although the markets eventually recovered. By 1989, the BLS measured unemployment at 5.3 percent. The inflation rate dropped from 12 percent during the 1980 election to under 5 percent in 1989. Likewise, the interest rate dropped from 15 percent to under 10 percent. Yet, not all shared equally in the economic recovery, and both economic inequality and the number of homeless individuals increased during the 1980s. Critics have contended that a majority of the jobs created during this decade paid the minimum wage.

====Government spending====
In 1981, in an effort to keep it solvent, Reagan approved a plan for cuts to Social Security. He later backed off due to public backlash. He then created the Greenspan Commission to keep Social Security financially secure, and in 1983 he signed amendments to raise both the program&#x27;s payroll taxes and retirement age for benefits. He had signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to cut funding for federal assistance such as food stamps, unemployment benefits, subsidized housing and the Aid to Families with Dependent Children, and would discontinue the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. On the other side, defense spending doubled between 1981 and 1985. During Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Project Socrates operated within the Defense Intelligence Agency to discover why the United States was unable to maintain its economic competitiveness. According to program director Michael Sekora, their findings helped the country surpass the Soviets in terms of missile defense technology.

====Deregulation====
Reagan sought to loosen federal regulation of economic activities, and he appointed key officials who shared this agenda. William Leuchtenburg writes that by 1986, the Reagan administration eliminated almost half of the federal regulations that had existed in 1981. The 1982 Garn–St. Germain Depository Institutions Act deregulated savings and loan associations by letting them make a variety of loans and investments outside of real estate. After the bill&#x27;s passage, savings and loans associations engaged in riskier activities, and the leaders of some institutions embezzled funds. The administration&#x27;s inattentiveness toward the industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis and costly bailouts.

====Deficits====
The deficits were exacerbated by the early 1980s recession, which cut into federal revenue. The national debt tripled between the fiscal years of 1980 and 1989, and the national debt as a percentage of the gross domestic product rose from 33 percent in 1981 to 53 percent by 1989. During his time in office, Reagan never fulfilled his 1980 campaign promise of submitting a balanced budget. The United States borrowed heavily to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits. Reagan described the tripled debt the &quot;greatest disappointment of his presidency&quot;. Jeffrey Frankel opined that the deficits were a major reason why Reagan&#x27;s successor, Bush, reneged on his campaign promise by raising taxes through the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.

===Assassination attempt===

On March 30, 1981, Reagan was shot by John Hinckley Jr. outside the Washington Hilton. Although &quot;right on the margin of death&quot; upon arrival at George Washington University Hospital, Reagan underwent surgery and recovered quickly from a broken rib, punctured lung, and internal bleeding. Professor J. David Woodard says that the assassination attempt &quot;created a bond between him and the American people that was never really broken&quot;. Later, Reagan came to believe that God had spared his life &quot;for a chosen mission&quot;.

===Supreme Court appointments===
Reagan appointed three Associate Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States: Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor in 1981, which fulfilled a campaign promise to name the first female justice to the Court, Antonin Scalia in 1986, and Anthony Kennedy in 1988. He also elevated William Rehnquist from Associate Justice to Chief Justice in 1986. The direction of the Supreme Court&#x27;s reshaping has been described as conservative.

===Public sector labor union fights===
Early in August 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) went on strike, violating a federal law prohibiting government unions from striking. On August 3, Reagan said that he would fire air traffic controllers if they did not return to work within 48 hours; according to him, 38 percent did not return. On August 13, Reagan fired roughly 12,000 striking air traffic controllers who ignored his order. He used military controllers and supervisors to handle the nation&#x27;s commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained. The breaking of the PATCO strike demoralized organized labor, and the number of strikes fell greatly in the 1980s. With the assent of Reagan&#x27;s sympathetic National Labor Relations Board appointees, many companies also won wage and benefit cutbacks from unions, especially in the manufacturing sector. During Reagan&#x27;s presidency, the share of employees who were part of a labor union dropped from approximately one-fourth of the total workforce to approximately one-sixth of the total workforce.

===Civil rights===
Despite Reagan having opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the bill was extended for 25 years in 1982. He initially opposed the establishment of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and alluded to claims that King was associated with communists during his career, but signed a bill to create the holiday in 1983 after it passed both houses of Congress with veto-proof margins. In 1984, he signed legislation intended to impose fines for fair housing discrimination offenses. In March 1988, Reagan vetoed the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987, but Congress overrode his veto. He had argued that the bill unreasonably increased the federal government&#x27;s power and undermined the rights of churches and business owners. Later in September, legislation was passed to correct loopholes in the Fair Housing Act of 1968.

Early in his presidency, Reagan appointed Clarence M. Pendleton Jr., known for his opposition to affirmative action and equal pay for men and women, as chair of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. Pendleton and Reagan&#x27;s subsequent appointees greatly eroded the enforcement of civil rights law, arousing the ire of civil rights advocates. In 1987, Reagan unsuccessfully nominated Robert Bork to the Supreme Court as a way to achieve his civil rights policy that could not be fulfilled during his presidency; his administration had opposed affirmative action, particularly in education, federal assistance programs, housing and employment, but Reagan reluctantly continued these policies. In housing, Reagan&#x27;s administration saw considerably fewer fair housing cases filed than the three previous administrations.

===War on drugs===

In response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic, Reagan intensified the war on drugs in 1982. While the American public did not see drugs as an important issue then, the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Department of Defense all increased their anti-drug funding immensely. Reagan&#x27;s administration publicized the campaign to gain support after crack became widespread in 1985. Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and 1988 to specify penalties for drug offenses. Both bills have been criticized in the years since for promoting racial disparities. Nancy Reagan founded the &quot;Just Say No&quot; campaign to discourage others from engaging in recreational drug use and raise awareness about the dangers of drugs. A 1988 study showed 39 percent of high school seniors using illegal drugs compared to 53 percent in 1980, but Scott Lilienfeld and Hal Arkowitz say that the success of these types of campaigns has not been affirmatively proven.

===Escalation of the Cold War===
Reagan ordered a massive defense buildup; he revived the B-1 Lancer program that had been rejected by the Carter administration, and deployed the MX missile. In response to Soviet deployment of the SS-20, he oversaw NATO&#x27;s deployment of the Pershing missile in Western Europe. In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off the Soviet Union&#x27;s access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe. It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue; he later retreated on this issue. In March 1983, Reagan introduced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to protect the United States from space intercontinental ballistic missiles. He believed that this defense shield could protect the country from nuclear destruction in a hypothetical nuclear war with the Soviet Union. There was much disbelief among the scientific community surrounding the program&#x27;s scientific feasibility, leading opponents to dub the SDI &quot;Star Wars&quot;, although Soviet leader Yuri Andropov said it would lead to &quot;an extremely dangerous path&quot;.
In a 1982 address to the British Parliament, Reagan said, &quot;the march of freedom and democracy... will leave Marxism–Leninism on the ash heap of history&quot;. Dismissed by the American press as &quot;wishful thinking&quot;, Margaret Thatcher called the address a &quot;triumph&quot;. David Cannadine says of Thatcher that &quot;Reagan had been grateful for her interest in him at a time when the British establishment refused to take him seriously&quot;, with the two agreeing on &quot;building up stronger defenses against Soviet Russia&quot; and both believing in outfacing &quot;what Reagan would later call &#x27;the evil empire, in reference to the Soviet Union, during a speech to the National Association of Evangelicals in March 1983. After Soviet fighters downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in September, which included Congressman Larry McDonald and 61 other Americans, Reagan expressed outrage towards the Soviet Union. The next day, reports suggested that the Soviets had fired on the plane by mistake. In spite of the harsh, discordant rhetoric, Reagan&#x27;s administration continued discussions with the Soviet Union on .
Although the Reagan administration agreed with the communist government in China to reduce the sale of arms to Taiwan in 1982, Reagan himself was the first president to reject containment and &quot;détente&quot;, and to put into practice the concept that the Soviet Union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with. His covert aid to Afghan mujahideen forces through Pakistan against the Soviets has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan; however, the United States was subjected to blowback in the form of the Taliban that opposed them in the war in Afghanistan. In his 1985 State of the Union Address, Reagan proclaimed, &quot;Support for freedom fighters is self-defense.&quot; Through the Reagan Doctrine, his administration supported anti-communist movements that fought against groups backed by the Soviet Union in an effort to rollback Soviet-backed communist governments and reduce Soviet influence across the world. The Reagan administration ignored human rights violations in the countries they backed and held a narrow definition of human rights. Other human rights concerns include the genocide in Guatemala, as well as mass killings in Chad.

===Invasion of Grenada===

On October 19, 1983, Maurice Bishop was overthrown and murdered by one of his colleagues. Several days later, Reagan ordered American forces to invade Grenada. Reagan cited a regional threat posed by a Soviet-Cuban military build-up and concern for the safety of hundreds of American medical students at St. George&#x27;s University. Two days of fighting commenced, resulting in an American victory. While the invasion enjoyed public support in the United States, it was criticized internationally, with the United Nations General Assembly voting to censure the American government. Cannon later noted that throughout Reagan&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign, the invasion overshadowed the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, which killed 241 Americans taking part in an international peacekeeping operation during the Lebanese Civil War.

===1984 election===

Reagan announced his reelection campaign on January 29, 1984, declaring, &quot;America is back and standing tall&quot;. In February, his administration reversed the unpopular decision to send the United States Marine Corps to Lebanon, thus eliminating a political liability for him. Reagan faced minimal opposition in the Republican primaries, and he and Bush accepted the nomination at the Dallas convention in August. In the general election, his campaign ran the commercial, &quot;Morning in America&quot;. At a time when the American economy was already recovering, former vice president Walter Mondale was attacked by Reagan&#x27;s campaign as a &quot;tax-and-spend Democrat&quot;, while Mondale criticized the deficit, the SDI, and Reagan&#x27;s civil rights policy. However, Reagan&#x27;s age induced his campaign managers to minimize his public appearances. Mondale&#x27;s campaign believed that Reagan&#x27;s age and mental health were issues before the October presidential debates.

Following Reagan&#x27;s performance in the first debate where he struggled to recall statistics, his age was brought up by the media in negative fashion. Reagan&#x27;s campaign changed his tactics for the second debate where he quipped, &quot;I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent&#x27;s youth and inexperience&quot;. This remark generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale. At that point, Broder suggested that age was no longer a liability for Reagan, and Mondale&#x27;s campaign felt that &quot;the election was over&quot;. In November, Reagan won a landslide reelection victory with 59 percent of the popular vote and 525 electoral votes from 49 states. Mondale won 41 percent of the popular vote and 13 electoral votes from the District of Columbia and his home state of Minnesota.

===Response to the AIDS epidemic===

The AIDS epidemic began to unfold in 1981, and AIDS was initially difficult to understand for physicians and the public. As the epidemic advanced, according to White House physician and later physician to the president, brigadier general John Hutton, Reagan thought of AIDS as though &quot;it was the measles and would go away&quot;. The October 1985 death of the President&#x27;s friend Rock Hudson affected Reagan&#x27;s view; Reagan approached Hutton for more information on the disease. Still, between September 18, 1985, and February 4, 1986, Reagan did not mention AIDS in public.

In 1986, Reagan asked C. Everett Koop to develop a report on AIDS. Koop angered many evangelical conservatives, both in and out of the Reagan administration, by stressing the importance of sex education including condom usage in schools. A year later, Reagan, who reportedly had not read the report, gave his first speech on the epidemic when 36,058 Americans had been diagnosed with AIDS, and 20,849 had died of it. Reagan called for increased testing (including routine testing for marriage applicants) and mandatory testing of select groups (including federal prisoners). Even after this speech, however, Reagan remained reluctant to publicly address AIDS.

Scholars and AIDS activists have argued that the Reagan administration largely ignored the AIDS crisis. Randy Shilts and Michael Bronski said that AIDS research was chronically underfunded during Reagan&#x27;s administration, and Bronski added that requests for more funding by doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were routinely denied. In a September 1985 press conference (soon after Hollywood celebrity Rock Hudson had announced his AIDS diagnosis) Reagan called a government AIDS research program a &quot;top priority&quot;, but also cited budgetary constraints. Between the fiscal years of 1984 and 1989, federal spending on AIDS totaled $5.6 billion. The Reagan administration proposed $2.8 billion during this time period, but pressure from congressional Democrats resulted in the larger amount.

===Addressing apartheid===
Popular opposition to apartheid increased during Reagan&#x27;s first term in office and the disinvestment from South Africa movement achieved critical mass after decades of growing momentum. Criticism of apartheid was particularly strong on college campuses and among mainline Protestant denominations. President Reagan was opposed to divestiture because he personally thought, as he wrote in a letter to Sammy Davis Jr., it &quot;would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within South Africa to try and bring influence to bear on the government&quot;. He also noted the fact that the &quot;American-owned industries there employ more than 80,000 blacks&quot; and that their employment practices were &quot;very different from the normal South African customs&quot;.

The Reagan administration developed constructive engagement with the South African government as a means of encouraging it to gradually move away from apartheid and to give up its nuclear weapons program. It was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout southern Africa. This policy, however, engendered much public criticism, and renewed calls for the imposition of stringent sanctions. In response, Reagan announced the imposition of new sanctions on the South African government, including an arms embargo in late 1985. These sanctions were seen as weak by anti-apartheid activists and as insufficient by the president&#x27;s opponents in Congress. In 1986, Congress approved the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which included tougher sanctions; Reagan&#x27;s veto was overridden by Congress. Afterward, he remained opposed to apartheid and unsure of &quot;how best to oppose it&quot;. Several European countries, as well as Japan, also imposed their sanctions on South Africa soon after.

===Libya bombing===

Contentious relations between Libya and the United States under President Reagan were revived in the West Berlin discotheque bombing that killed an American soldier and injured dozens of others on April 5, 1986. Stating that there was irrefutable evidence that Libya had a direct role in the bombing, Reagan authorized the use of force against the country. On April 14, the United States launched a series of airstrikes on ground targets in Libya. Thatcher allowed the United States Air Force to use Britain&#x27;s air bases to launch the attack, on the justification that the United Kingdom was supporting America&#x27;s right to self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. The attack was, according to Reagan, designed to halt Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s &quot;ability to export terrorism&quot;, offering him &quot;incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior&quot;. The attack was condemned by many countries; by an overwhelming vote, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to condemn the attack and deem it a violation of the Charter and international law.

===Iran–Contra affair===

Reagan authorized William J. Casey to arm the Contras, fearing that Communists would take over Nicaragua if it remained under the leadership of the Sandinistas. Congress passed the 1982 Boland Amendment, prohibiting the CIA and Department of Defense from using their budgets to provide aid to the Contras. Still, the Reagan administration raised funds for the Contras from private donors and foreign governments. When Congress learned that the CIA had secretly placed naval mines in Nicaraguan harbors, Congress passed a second Boland Amendment that barred granting any assistance to the Contras. By mid-1985, Hezbollah began to take American hostages in Lebanon, holding seven of them in reaction to the United States&#x27; support of Israel.

Reagan procured the release of seven American hostages held by Hezbollah by selling American arms to Iran, then engaged in the Iran–Iraq War, in hopes that Iran would pressure Hezbollah to release the hostages. The Reagan administration sold over 2,000 missiles to Iran without informing Congress; Hezbollah released four hostages but captured an additional six Americans. On Oliver North&#x27;s initiative, the administration redirected the proceeds from the missile sales to the Contras. The transactions were exposed by &quot;Ash-Shiraa&quot; in early November 1986. Reagan initially denied any wrongdoing, but on November 25, he announced that John Poindexter and North had left the administration and that he would form the Tower Commission to investigate the transactions. A few weeks later, Reagan asked a panel of federal judges to appoint a special prosecutor who would conduct a separate investigation.

The Tower Commission released a report in February 1987 confirming that the administration had traded arms for hostages and sent the proceeds of the weapons sales to the Contras. The report laid most of the blame on North, Poindexter, and Robert McFarlane, but it was also critical of Donald Regan and other White House staffers. Investigators did not find conclusive proof that Reagan had known about the aid provided to the Contras, but the report noted that Reagan had &quot;created the conditions which made possible the crimes committed by others&quot; and had &quot;knowingly participated or acquiesced in covering up the scandal&quot;. The affair damaged the administration and raised questions about Reagan&#x27;s competency and the wisdom of conservative policies. The administration&#x27;s credibility was also badly damaged on the international stage as it had violated its own arms embargo on Iran.

===The USS &quot;Stark&quot; incident===
In the context of the Tanker War on May 17, 1987, an Iraqi fighter jet hit the with two Exocet missiles, killing 37 sailors. Three days later, President Reagan declared a &quot;policy of self-defense&quot; would now be ordered, as he accepted Iraq&#x27;s official apology: &quot;Our ships are deployed in the Persian Gulf in order to protect U.S. interests and maintain free access and maintain freedom of navigation and access to the area&#x27;s oil supplies. It is a vital mission, but our ships need to protect themselves and they will. [From now on] if aircraft approach any of our ships in a way that appears hostile, there is one order of battle. Defend yourselves. Defend American lives.. We&#x27;re going to do what has to be done to keep the Persian Gulf open. It&#x27;s international waters. No country there has a right to try and close it off and take it for itself. And the villain in the piece really is Iran. And so they&#x27;re delighted with what has just happened.&quot;

===Soviet decline and thaw in relations===

Although the Soviets did not accelerate military spending in response to Reagan&#x27;s military buildup, their enormous military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for the Soviet economy. At the same time, the prices of oil, the primary source of Soviet export revenues, fell to one third of the previous level in 1985. These factors contributed to a stagnant economy during the tenure of Mikhail Gorbachev as Soviet leader.

Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy towards the Soviets wavered between brinkmanship and cooperation. Reagan appreciated Gorbachev&#x27;s revolutionary change in the direction of the Soviet policy and shifted to diplomacy, intending to encourage him to pursue substantial arms agreements. They held four summit conferences between 1985 and 1988. Reagan believed that if he could persuade the Soviets to allow for more democracy and free speech, this would lead to reform and the end of communism. The critical summit was in Reykjavík in 1986, where they agreed to abolish all nuclear weapons. However, Gorbachev added the condition that SDI research must be confined to laboratories during the ten-year period when disarmament would take place. Reagan refused, stating that it was defensive only and that he would share the secrets with the Soviets, thus failing to reach a deal.

In June 1987, Reagan addressed Gorbachev during a speech at the Berlin Wall, demanding that he &quot;tear down this wall&quot;. The remark was ignored at the time, but after the wall fell in November 1989, it was retroactively recast as a soaring achievement. In December, Reagan and Gorbachev met again at the Washington Summit to sign the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, committing to the total abolition of their respective short-range and medium-range missile stockpiles. The treaty established an inspections regime designed to ensure that both parties honored the agreement. In May 1988, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly voted in favor of ratifying the treaty, providing a major boost to Reagan&#x27;s popularity in the aftermath of the Iran–Contra affair. A new era of trade and openness between the two powers commenced, and the United States and Soviet Union cooperated on international issues such as the Iran–Iraq War.

== Post-presidency (1989–2004) ==
Upon leaving the presidency on January 20, 1989, at the age of 77, Reagan became the oldest president at the end of his tenure. This distinction eventually passed to president Joe Biden who left office at 82 years old.

In retirement, Ronald and Nancy Reagan lived at 668 St. Cloud Road in Bel Air, in addition to Rancho del Cielo in Santa Barbara. He received multiple awards and honors in addition to generous payments for speaking engagements. In 1989 he supported repealing the Twenty-second Amendment&#x27;s presidential term limits. In 1991, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opened. Reagan also addressed the 1992 Republican National Convention &quot;to inspire allegiance to the party regulars&quot;, and favored a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget.

===Support for Brady Bill===
Reagan publicly favored the Brady Bill, drawing criticism from gun control opponents. In 1989, in his first public appearance after leaving office and shortly after the Stockton schoolyard shooting, he stated: &quot;I do not believe in taking away the right of the citizen to own guns for sporting, for hunting, and so forth, or for home defense. But I do believe that an AK-47, a machine gun, is not a sporting weapon or needed for the defense of the home&quot;.

In March 1991, Reagan wrote an op-ed in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, titled &quot;Why I&#x27;m for the Brady Bill&quot;. In May 1994, Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter sent a letter to House members, urging them to support the controversial Federal Assault Weapons Ban.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
His final public speech occurred on February 3, 1994, during a tribute to him in Washington, D.C.; his last major public appearance was at the funeral of Richard Nixon on April 27, 1994. In August 1994, Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which he announced through a handwritten letter in November. There was speculation over how long he had demonstrated symptoms of mental degeneration, but lay observations that he suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s while still in office have been disputed by medical experts; his doctors said that he first began exhibiting overt symptoms of the illness in late 1992&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_2004/06/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or 1993. Over time, the disease destroyed Reagan&#x27;s mental capacity. By 1997, he was reported to recognize few people other than his wife, though he continued to walk through parks and on beaches, play golf, and visit his office in nearby Century City. Eventually, his family decided that he would live in quiet semi-isolation with his wife. By the end of 2003, Reagan had lost his ability to speak and was mostly confined to his bed, no longer able to recognize family members.

==Death and funeral==
Reagan died of pneumonia, complicated by Alzheimer&#x27;s, at his home in Los Angeles, on June 5, 2004. President George W. Bush called Reagan&#x27;s death &quot;a sad hour in the life of America&quot;. His public funeral was held in the Washington National Cathedral, where eulogies were given by Margaret Thatcher, Brian Mulroney, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush. Other world leaders attended including Mikhail Gorbachev and Lech Wałęsa. Reagan was interred at his presidential library.
==Legacy==
===Approval ratings===
Similar to previous presidents, Reagan began his presidency with approval ratings greater than 50 percent, peaking above 70 percent shortly after his attempted assassination, before declining by the end of his first year. Afterwards, his ratings fluctuated in the mid-30s and mid-40s in his second and third years, which has been attributed to the 1981–1982 recession. His approval ratings rebounded after the invasion of Grenada and by mid-1984 his approval rating neared 60 percent. In the first two years of his second term, his approval ratings were consistently above 60 percent but declined during the Iran–Contra scandal, before beginning to recover in mid-1987. In the Gallup poll, Reagan finished his presidency with an approval rating of 63 percent, the third highest for a departing president in history, behind only Franklin D. Roosevelt and Bill Clinton, both of whom finished at 66 percent.

In 1990, a year after he left office, a Gallup survey found that 54 percent of Americans said they approved of the overall job Reagan did as president. The number of Americans who approved of the Reagan administration declined to 48 percent in 1992 but rebounded two years later to 52 percent. In recent years, favorability of Reagan&#x27;s presidency reached its highest ever: 71 percent approval in 2006; 74 percent in 2010; 72 percent in 2018; and 69 percent in 2023. He is often found to be second-most popular president since World War II, with only John F. Kennedy having higher ratings.

===Historical reputation===

In 2008, British historian M. J. Heale summarized that scholars had reached a broad consensus in which &quot;Reagan rehabilitated conservatism, turned the country to the right, practiced a &#x27;pragmatic conservatism&#x27; that balanced ideology with the constraints of government, revived faith in the presidency and American self-respect, and contributed to critically ending the Cold War&quot;, which ended with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Many conservative and liberal scholars have agreed that Reagan has been the most influential president since Roosevelt, leaving his imprint on American politics, diplomacy, culture, and economics through his effective communication of his conservative agenda and pragmatic compromising. During the initial years of Reagan&#x27;s post-presidency, historical rankings placed his presidency in the twenties. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, his presidency was often placed in the top ten.

Many proponents, including his Cold War contemporaries, believe that his defense policies, economic policies, military policies, and hard-line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and communism, together with his summits with Gorbachev, played a significant part in ending the Cold War. Professor Jeffrey Knopf argues that while Reagan&#x27;s practice of referring to the Soviet Union as &quot;evil&quot; probably made no difference to the Soviet leaders, it possibly gave encouragement to Eastern European citizens who opposed their communist regimes. President Truman&#x27;s policy of containment is also regarded as a force behind the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan undermined the Soviet system itself. Nevertheless, Melvyn P. Leffler called Reagan &quot;Gorbachev&#x27;s minor, yet indispensable partner, setting the framework for the dramatic changes that neither anticipated happening anytime soon&quot;.

Critics, for example Paul Krugman, note Reagan&#x27;s tenure as having begun a period of increased income inequality, sometimes called the &quot;Great Divergence&quot;. Krugman also views Reagan as having initiated the ideology of the current-day Republican Party, which he feels is led by &quot;radicals&quot; who seek to &quot;undo the twentieth century&quot; gains in income equality and unionization. Others, such as Nixon&#x27;s Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, also criticize what they feel was not just Reagan&#x27;s fiscal irresponsibility, but also the ushering in of an era where tax cutting &quot;became the GOP&#x27;s core platform&quot;, with resulting deficits and GOP leaders (speciously in Peterson&#x27;s opinion) arguing supply-side gains would enable the country to &quot;grow&quot; its way out of deficits.

Reagan was known for storytelling and humor, which involved puns and self-deprecation. Reagan also often emphasized family values, despite being the first president to have been divorced. He showed the ability to comfort Americans during the aftermath of the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. Reagan&#x27;s ability to talk about substantive issues with understandable terms and to focus on mainstream American concerns earned him the laudatory moniker the &quot;Great Communicator&quot;. He also earned the nickname &quot;Teflon President&quot; in that public perceptions of him were not substantially tarnished by the controversies that arose during his administration.

===Political influence===
Reagan led a new conservative movement, altering the political dynamic of the United States. Conservatism became the dominant ideology for Republicans, displacing the party&#x27;s faction of liberals and moderates. Men began voting more Republican, and women began voting more Democrat – a gender distinction that has persisted. He was supported by young voters, an allegiance that shifted many of them to the party. He attempted to appeal to Black voters in 1980, but would receive the lowest Black vote for a Republican presidential candidate at the time. Throughout Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Republicans were unable to gain complete control of Congress.

The period of American history most dominated by Reagan and his policies (particularly on taxes, welfare, defense, the federal judiciary, and the Cold War) is known as the Reagan era, which suggests that the &quot;Reagan Revolution&quot; had a lasting impact on the United States in domestic and foreign policy. The George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations are often treated as an extension of the era, as is the George W. Bush administration. Since 1988, Republican presidential candidates have invoked Reagan&#x27;s policies and beliefs.

<text>Robert Joseph Flaherty, (; February 16, 1884 – July 23, 1951) was an American filmmaker who directed and produced the first commercially successful feature-length documentary film, &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; (1922). The film made his reputation and nothing in his later life fully equaled its success, although he continued the development of this new genre of narrative documentary with &quot;Moana&quot; (1926), set in the South Seas, and &quot;Man of Aran&quot; (1934), filmed in Ireland&#x27;s Aran Islands. Flaherty is considered the father of both the documentary and the ethnographic film.

Flaherty was married to writer Frances H. Flaherty from 1914 until his death in 1951. Frances worked on several of her husband&#x27;s films, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Story for &quot;Louisiana Story&quot; (1948).

==Early life==
Flaherty was one of seven children born to prospector Robert Henry Flaherty (an Irish Protestant) and Susan Klockner (a German Catholic).

Due to exposure from his father&#x27;s work as an iron ore explorer, he developed a natural curiosity for people of other cultures. Flaherty was an acclaimed still-photographer in Toronto. His portraits of American Indians and wild life during his travels are what led to the creation of his critically acclaimed &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;. It was his enthusiasm and interests in these people that sparked his need to create a new genre of film.

In 1914, he married his fiancée Frances Hubbard. Hubbard came from a highly educated family, her father being a distinguished geologist. A graduate from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, Hubbard studied music and poetry in Paris and was also secretary of the local Suffragette Society. Following their marriage, Frances Flaherty became a crucial part of Robert&#x27;s success in film. Frances took on the role of director at times, and helped to edit and distribute her husband&#x27;s films, even landing governmental film contracts for England.

In 1909 he shared stories about information he was told by an Inuk man named George Weetaltuk, grandfather of Mini Aodla Freeman. Flaherty said he met Weetaltuk while visiting the Hudson Bay in search of iron ore. In his Weetaltuk story, Flaherty published a detailed map of the Inuit region and shared information about the bay that Weetaltuk had told him. His writing about George Weetaltuk would go on to be published in his book, &quot;My Eskimo Friends: &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;.&quot;

==&quot;Nanook of the North&quot;==
In 1913, on Flaherty&#x27;s expedition to prospect the Belcher Islands, his boss, Sir William Mackenzie, suggested that he take a motion picture camera along. He brought a Bell and Howell hand cranked motion picture camera. He was particularly intrigued by the life of the Inuit, and spent so much time filming them that he had begun to neglect his real work. When Flaherty returned to Toronto with 30,000 feet of film, the nitrate film stock was ignited in a fire started from his cigarette in his editing room. His film was destroyed and his hands were burned. Although his editing print was saved and shown several times, Flaherty was not satisfied with the results. &quot;It was utterly inept, simply a scene of this or that, no relation, no thread of story or continuity whatever, and it must have bored the audience to distraction. Certainly it bored me.&quot;

Flaherty was determined to make a new film, one following a life of a typical Inuk and his family. In 1920, he secured funds from Revillon Frères, a French fur trade company to shoot what was to become &quot;Nanook of the North&quot;. On August 15, 1920, Flaherty arrived in Port Harrison, Quebec to shoot his film. He brought two Akeley motion-picture cameras which the Inuit referred to as &quot;the aggie&quot;. He also brought full developing, printing, and projection equipment to show the Inuit his film, while he was still in the process of filming. He lived in an attached cabin to the Revillon Frères trading post.

In making &quot;Nanook&quot;, Flaherty cast various locals in parts in the film, in the way that one would cast actors in a work of fiction. With the aim of showing traditional Inuit life, he also staged some scenes, including the ending, where Allakariallak (who acts the part of Nanook) and his screen family are supposedly at risk of dying if they could not find or build shelter quickly enough. The half-igloo had been built beforehand, with a side cut away for light so that Flaherty&#x27;s camera could get a good shot. Flaherty insisted that the Inuit not use rifles to hunt, though their use had by that time become common. He also pretended at one point that he could not hear the hunters&#x27; pleas for help, instead continuing to film their struggle and putting them in greater danger.
Melanie McGrath writes that, while living in Northern Quebec for the year of filming &quot;Nanook&quot;, Flaherty had an affair with his lead actress, the young Inuk woman who played Nanook&#x27;s wife. A few months after he left, she gave birth to his son, Josephie (December 25, 1921 – 1984), whom he never acknowledged. Josephie was one of the Inuit who were relocated in the 1950s to very difficult living conditions in Resolute and Grise Fiord, in the extreme north. Corroboration of McGrath&#x27;s account is not readily available and Flaherty never discussed the matter.

&quot;Nanook&quot; began a series of films that Flaherty made on the same theme of humanity against the elements. Others included &quot;Moana: A Romance of the Golden Age&quot;, set in Samoa, and &quot;Man of Aran&quot;, set in the Aran Islands of Ireland. All these films employ the same rhetorical devices: the dangers of nature and the struggle of the communities to eke out an existence.

==Hollywood==
&quot;Nanook of the North&quot; (1922) was a successful film, and Flaherty was in great demand afterwards. On a contract with Paramount to produce another film on the order of &quot;Nanook&quot;, he went to Samoa to film &quot;Moana&quot; (1926). He shot the film in Safune on the island of Savai&#x27;i where he lived with his wife and family for more than a year. The studio heads repeatedly asked for daily rushes but Flaherty had nothing to show because he had not filmed anything yet — his approach was to try to live with the community, becoming familiar with their way of life before writing a story about it to film. He was also concerned that there was no inherent conflict in the islanders&#x27; way of life, providing further incentive not to shoot anything. Eventually he decided to build the film around the ritual of a boy&#x27;s entry to manhood. Flaherty was in Samoa from April 1923 until December 1924, with the film completed in December 1925 and released the following month. The film, on its release, was not as successful as &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; domestically, but it did very well in Europe, inspiring John Grierson to coin the word &quot;documentary&quot;.

Before the release of &quot;Moana&quot;, Flaherty made two short films in New York City with private backing, &quot;The Pottery Maker&quot; (1925) and &quot;The Twenty-Four Dollar Island&quot; (1927). Irving Thalberg of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer invited Flaherty to film &quot;White Shadows in the South Seas&quot; (1928) in collaboration with W. S. Van Dyke, but their talents proved an uncomfortable fit, and Flaherty resigned from the production. Moving to Fox Film Corporation, Flaherty spent eight months working on the Native American documentary &quot;Acoma the Sky City&quot; (1929), but the production was shut down, and subsequently Flaherty&#x27;s footage was lost in a studio vault fire. He then agreed to collaborate with F. W. Murnau on another South Seas picture, &quot;Tabu&quot; (1931). However, this combination proved even more volatile, and while Flaherty did contribute significantly to the story, the finished film, originally released by Paramount Pictures, is essentially Murnau&#x27;s.

==Britain==
After &quot;Tabu&quot;, Flaherty was considered finished in Hollywood, and Frances Flaherty contacted John Grierson of the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit in London, who assigned Flaherty to the documentary &quot;Industrial Britain&quot; (1931). By comparison to Grierson and his unit, Flaherty&#x27;s habitual working methods involved shooting relatively large amounts of film in relation to the planned length of the eventual finished movie, and the ensuing cost overruns obliged Grierson to take Flaherty off the project, which was edited by other hands into three shorter films.

Flaherty wrote a novel about the sea called &quot;The Captain&#x27;s Chair&quot; which was published in 1938 by Scribner. This was presented on BBC Television in November that year, under the title &quot;The Last Voyage of Captain Grant&quot;, adapted and directed by Denis Johnston.

Flaherty&#x27;s career in Britain ended when producer Alexander Korda removed him from the production &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; (1937), re-editing it into a commercial entertainment picture.

==Ireland==
Producer Michael Balcon took Flaherty on to direct &quot;Man of Aran&quot; (1934), which portrayed the harsh traditional lifestyle of the occupants of the isolated Aran Islands off the west coast of Ireland. The film was a major critical success, and for decades was considered in some circles an even greater achievement than &quot;Nanook&quot;. As with &quot;Nanook&quot;, &quot;Man of Aran&quot; showed human beings&#x27; efforts to survive under extreme conditions: in this case, an island whose soils were so thin that the inhabitants carried seaweed up from the sea to construct fields for cultivation. Flaherty again cast locals in the various fictionalized roles, and made use of dramatic recreation of anachronistic behaviors: in this case, a sequence showing the hunting of sharks from small boats with harpoons, which the islanders had by then not practiced for several decades. He also staged the film&#x27;s climactic sequence, in which three men in a small boat strive to row back to shore through perilously high, rock-infested seas.

==Last years==
Back in the United States, Pare Lorentz of the United States Film Service hired Flaherty to film a documentary about US agriculture, a project which became &quot;The Land&quot;. Flaherty and his wife covered some 100,000 miles, shooting 25,000 feet of film, and captured a series of striking images of rural America. Among the themes raised by Flaherty&#x27;s footage were the challenge of the erosion of agricultural land and the Dust Bowl (as well as the beginning of effective responses via improved soil conservation practices), mechanization and rural unemployment, and large-scale migration from the Great Plains to California. In the latter context, Flaherty highlighted competition for agricultural jobs between native-born Americans and migrants from Mexico and the Philippines.

The film encountered a series of obstacles. After production had begun, Congress abolished the United States Film Service, and the project was shunted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). With America&#x27;s entry to World War II approaching, USDA officials (and the film&#x27;s editor Helen van Dongen) attempted to reconcile Flaherty&#x27;s footage with rapidly changing official messages (including a reversal of concern from pre-war rural unemployment to wartime labor shortages). Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, officials grew apprehensive that the film could project an unduly negative image of the US internationally, and although a prestige opening was held at the Museum of Modern Art in 1942, the film was never authorized for general release.

&quot;Louisiana Story&quot; (1948) was a Flaherty documentary shot by himself and Richard Leacock, about the installation of an oil rig in a Louisiana swamp. The film stresses the rig&#x27;s peaceful and unproblematic coexistence with the surrounding environment, and it was in fact funded by Standard Oil, a petroleum company. The main character of the film is a Cajun boy. The poetry of childhood and nature, some critics argue, is used to make exploration for oil look beautiful. Virgil Thomson composed the music for the film.

Flaherty was one of the makers of &quot;The Titan: Story of Michelangelo&quot; (1950), which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The film was a re-edited version of the German/Swiss film originally titled &quot;Michelangelo: Life of a Titan&quot; (1938), directed by Curt Oertel. The re-edited version put a new English narration by Fredric March and musical score onto a shorter edit of the existing film. The new credits include Richard Lyford as director and Robert Snyder as producer. The film was edited by Richard Lyford.

Also in the early 1950s, Lowell Thomas, an investor and the most prominent promotor of Cinerama, was eager to secure his &quot;good friend&quot; Flaherty&#x27;s endorsement of this pioneer film technology. Reportedly, Flaherty was very excited about Cinerama&#x27;s promise, and for about a month, he tested the camera invented by Fred Waller. But &quot;just as he was to set forth round the world&quot; to shoot Cinerama footage with Waller&#x27;s camera, he died, which prompted Thomas to find and hire a new film crew and also join forces with Mike Todd.

==Legacy==
Flaherty is considered a pioneer of documentary film. He was one of the first to combine documentary subjects with a fiction-film-like narrative and poetic treatment.

A self-proclaimed explorer, Flaherty was inducted into the Royal Geographic Society of England for his (re)discovery of the main island of the Belcher group in Hudson Bay in 1914.

Flaherty Island, one of the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay, is named in his honor.

The Flaherty Seminar is an annual international forum for independent filmmakers and film-lovers, held in rural upstate New York at Colgate University in mid June. The festival was founded in Flaherty&#x27;s honor by his widow in 1955.

Flaherty&#x27;s contribution to the advent of the documentary is scrutinized in the 2010 British Universities Film &amp; Video Council award-winning and FOCAL International award-nominated documentary &quot;A Boatload of Wild Irishmen&quot;, written by Professor Brian Winston of University of Lincoln, UK, and directed by Mac Dara Ó Curraidhín. The film explores the nature of &quot;controlled actuality&quot; and sheds new light on thinking about Flaherty. The argument is made that the impact of Flaherty&#x27;s films on the indigenous peoples portrayed changes over time, as the films become valuable records for subsequent generations of now-lost ways of life. The film&#x27;s title derives from Flaherty&#x27;s statement that he had been accused, in the staged climactic sequence of &quot;Man of Aran&quot;, of &quot;trying to drown a boatload of wild Irishmen&quot;.

In 1994, Flaherty was portrayed by Charles Dance in the Canadian drama film &quot;Kabloonak&quot;, a dramatization of the making of &quot;Nanook of the North&quot; from an Inuit perspective.

The wife of Robert Joseph Flaherty&#x27;s grandson, Louise Flaherty, is the co-founder of Canada&#x27;s first independent Inuk publishing house, Inhabit Media. She is also an author, educator and politician.

<text>Rolling Stone is an American monthly magazine that focuses on music, politics, and popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco, California in 1967 by Jann Wenner and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason.

The magazine was first known for its coverage of rock music and political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine broadened and shifted its focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. It has since returned to its traditional mix of content, including music, entertainment, and politics.

The first magazine was released in 1967 and featured John Lennon on the cover, and was then published every two weeks. It is known for provocative photography and its cover photos, featuring musicians, politicians, athletes, and actors. In addition to its print version in the United States, it publishes content through Rollingstone.com and numerous international editions.

The magazine experienced a rapid rise during the 1970s, followed by a sharp decline into financial turmoil in the 21st century; leading Jann Wenner to sell 49 percent of the magazine to BandLab Technologies in 2016 and 51 percent to Penske Media Corporation (PMC) in 2017. PMC eventually acquired the 49 percent stake from BandLab Technologies in 2019, giving it full ownership of the magazine.

==History==
===1967–1979: Founding and early history===
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner and Ralph J. Gleason. To pay for the setup costs, Wenner borrowed $7,500 () from his family and the parents of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim. The first issue was released on November 9, 1967, and featured John Lennon in costume for the film &quot;How I Won the War&quot; on the cover. It was in newspaper format with a lead article on the Monterey International Pop Festival. The cover price was 25¢ (equivalent to $2.27 in 2023) and it was published bi-weekly.

In the first issue, Wenner explained that the title of the magazine came from the old saying &quot;A rolling stone gathers no moss.&quot; He also mentioned the 1950 blues song &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot;, recorded by Muddy Waters, The Rolling Stones band, and Bob Dylan&#x27;s 1965 hit single &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. Some authors have attributed the name solely to Dylan&#x27;s hit single: &quot;At [Ralph] Gleason&#x27;s suggestion, Wenner named his magazine after a Bob Dylan song.&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; initially identified with and reported the hippie counterculture of the era.

However, it distanced itself from the underground newspapers of the time, such as &quot;Berkeley Barb&quot;, embracing more traditional journalistic standards and avoiding the radical politics of the underground press. In the first edition, Wenner wrote that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; &quot;is not just about the music, but about the things and attitudes that music embraces&quot;. In a 2017 article celebrating the publication&#x27;s 50th anniversary, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s David Browne stated that the magazine&#x27;s name was a nod to the Rolling Stones in an addition to &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; and &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;.

The magazine&#x27;s long-running slogan, &quot;All the news that fits&quot;, was provided by early contributor, manager and sometime editor Susan Lydon. She lifted it from an April Fools issue of the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot; which posted &quot;All the news that fits we print&quot;, a parody of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ slogan, &quot;All the News That&#x27;s Fit to Print&quot;. The first appearance of the rubric was in 1969.

In the 1970s, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; began to make a mark with its political coverage, with the likes of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson writing for the magazine&#x27;s political section. Thompson first published his most famous work, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, within the pages of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, where he remained a contributing editor until his death in 2005. In the 1970s, the magazine also helped launch the careers of many prominent authors, including Cameron Crowe, Lester Bangs, Joe Klein, Joe Eszterhas, Ben Fong-Torres, Patti Smith and P. J. O&#x27;Rourke. It was at this point that the magazine ran some of its most famous stories. The January 21, 1970, issue covered the Altamont Free Concert and the killing of Meredith Hunter, which won a Specialized Journalism award at the National Magazine Awards in 1971. Later in 1970, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published a 30,000-word feature on Charles Manson by David Dalton and David Felton, including their interview of Manson when he was in the L.A. County Jail awaiting trial, which won &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; its first National Magazine Award. Four years later, they also covered the Patty Hearst abduction odyssey. One interviewer, speaking for many of his peers, said that he bought his first copy of the magazine upon initial arrival on his college campus, describing it as a &quot;rite of passage&quot;.

In 1972, Wenner assigned Tom Wolfe to cover the launch of NASA&#x27;s last Moon mission, Apollo 17. He published a four-part series in 1973 titled &quot;Post-Orbital Remorse&quot;, about the depression that some astronauts experienced after having been in space. After the series, Wolfe began researching the whole of the space program, in what became a seven-year project from which he took time to write &quot;The Painted Word&quot;, a book on art, and to complete &quot;Mauve Gloves &amp; Madmen, Clutter &amp; Vine&quot;, a collection of shorter pieces and eventually &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.

The magazine began running the photographs of Annie Leibovitz in 1970. In 1973, she became its chief photographer, and her images appeared on more than 140 covers. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; recruited writers from smaller music magazines, including Paul Nelson from &quot;Sing Out!&quot;, who became record reviews editor from 1978 to 1983, and Dave Marsh from &quot;Creem&quot;. In 1977, the magazine moved its headquarters from San Francisco to New York City. Editor Jann Wenner said San Francisco had become &quot;a cultural backwater&quot;.

===1980–1999: Change to entertainment magazine===
Kurt Loder joined &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in May 1979 and spent nine years there, including as editor. Timothy White joined as a writer from &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; and David Fricke from &quot;Musician&quot;. Tom Wolfe wrote to Wenner to propose an idea drawn from Charles Dickens and William Makepeace Thackeray: to serialize a novel. Wenner offered Wolfe around $200,000 to serialize his work. The frequent deadline pressure gave Wolfe the motivation he had sought, and from July 1984 to August 1985, he published a new installment in each biweekly issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Later Wolfe was unhappy with his &quot;very public first draft&quot; and thoroughly revised his work, even changing his protagonist, Sherman McCoy, and published it as &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; in 1987.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was known for its musical coverage and for Thompson&#x27;s political reporting and in 1985, they hired an advertising agency to refocus its image under the series &quot;Perception/Reality&quot; comparing Sixties symbols to those of the Eighties, which led to an increase in advertising revenue and pages. It also shifted to more of an entertainment magazine in the 1980s. It still had music as the main topic but began to increase its coverage of celebrities, films, and pop culture. It also began releasing its annual &quot;Hot Issue&quot;. In the 1990s, the magazine changed its format to appeal to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music. This led to criticism that the magazine was emphasizing style over substance.

===2000–2015: Expansion of readership===

After years of declining readership, the magazine experienced a major resurgence of interest and relevance with the work of two young journalists in the late 2000s, Michael Hastings and Matt Taibbi. Rob Sheffield also joined from &quot;Spin&quot;. In 2005, Dana Leslie Fields, former publisher of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, who had worked at the magazine for 17 years, was an inaugural inductee into the Magazine Hall of Fame. In 2009, Taibbi unleashed an acclaimed series of scathing reports on the financial meltdown of the time. He famously described Goldman Sachs as &quot;a great vampire squid&quot;.

In December 2009, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the owners of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine planned to open a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; restaurant in the Hollywood &amp; Highland Center in Hollywood in the spring of 2010. The expectation was that the restaurant could become the first of a national chain if it was successful. As of November 2010, the &quot;soft opening&quot; of the restaurant was planned for December 2010. In 2011, the restaurant was open for lunch and dinner as well as a full night club downstairs on the weekends. The restaurant closed in February 2013.

Bigger headlines came at the end of June 2010. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; caused a controversy in the White House by publishing in the July issue an article by journalist Michael Hastings entitled &quot;The Runaway General&quot;, quoting criticism by General Stanley A. McChrystal, commander of the International Security Assistance Force and U.S. Forces-Afghanistan commander, about Vice President Joe Biden and other Administration members of the White House. McChrystal resigned from his position shortly after his statements went public. In 2010, Taibbi documented illegal and fraudulent actions by banks in the foreclosure courts, after traveling to Jacksonville, Florida and sitting in on hearings in the courtroom. His article, &quot;Invasion of the Home Snatchers&quot;, also documented attempts by the judge to intimidate a homeowner fighting foreclosure and the attorney Taibbi accompanied into the court.

In January 2012, the magazine ran exclusive excerpts from Hastings&#x27; book just prior to publication. The book, &quot;The Operators: The Wild and Terrifying Inside Story of America&#x27;s War in Afghanistan&quot;, provided a much more expansive look at McChrystal and the culture of senior American military and how they become embroiled in such wars. The book reached Amazon.com&#x27;s bestseller list in the first 48 hours of release, and it received generally favorable reviews. &quot;Salon&quot;″s Glenn Greenwald described it as &quot;superb&quot;, &quot;brave&quot; and &quot;eye-opening&quot;. In 2012, Taibbi, through his coverage of the Libor scandal, emerged as an expert on that topic, which led to media appearances outside &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. On November 9, 2012, the magazine published its first Spanish-language section on Latino music and culture, in the issue dated November 22.

===2016–present: New ownership===
In September 2016, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; reported that Wenner was in the process of selling a 49% stake of the magazine to a company from Singapore called BandLab Technologies. The new investor had no direct involvement in the editorial content of the magazine.

In September 2017, Wenner Media announced that the remaining 51% of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine was up for sale. In December 2017, Penske Media acquired the remaining stake from Wenner Media. It became a monthly magazine from the July 2018 issue. On January 31, 2019, Penske acquired BandLab&#x27;s 49% stake in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, gaining full ownership of the magazine.

In January 2021, a Chinese edition of the magazine was launched, while in September 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; launched a dedicated UK edition in conjunction with Attitude magazine publisher Stream Publishing. The new British &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; launched into a marketplace which already featured titles like &quot;Mojo&quot; and BandLab Technologies&#x27;s monthly music magazine &quot;Uncut&quot;. The first issue had a choice of three cover stars (including music acts Bastille and Sam Fender, as well as &quot;No Time To Die&quot; actor Lashana Lynch), with the magazine due to be a bi-monthly publication.

In February 2022, Rolling Stone announced the acquisition of Life Is Beautiful, saying, &quot;Live events are an integral part of Rolling Stone&#x27;s future.&quot;

In 2023 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was nominated for its first-ever Emmy award in the &quot;Outstanding Interactive Media&quot; category for its investigation into &quot;The DJ and the War Crimes&quot;. The piece also won a National Magazine Award for digital design and an Overseas Press Club Award. In December 2023 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; collected five National Arts &amp; Entertainment Journalism Awards, four Front Page Awards, and a Deadline Club award.

==Covers==

Some artists have been featured on the cover many times, and some of these pictures went on to become iconic. The Beatles, for example, have appeared on the cover more than 30 times, either individually or as a band. The magazine is known for provocative photography and has featured musicians and celebrities on the cover throughout its history. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called the January 22, 1981, cover featuring John Lennon and Yoko Ono the &quot;Greatest &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Cover Ever&quot;.

The first ten issues featured, in order of appearance:
# John Lennon
# Tina Turner
# The Beatles
# Jimi Hendrix, Donovan and Otis Redding
# Jim Morrison
# Janis Joplin
# Jimi Hendrix
# Monterey International Pop Festival
# John Lennon and Paul McCartney
# Eric Clapton

The magazine spent $1 million (equivalent to $ million in ) on the 3-D hologram cover of the special 1,000th issue (May 18, 2006) displaying multiple celebrities and other personalities.

===Print format===
The printed format has gone through several changes. The first publications, in 1967 to 1972, were in folded tabloid newspaper format, with no staples, only black ink text, and a single color highlight that changed each edition. From 1973 onwards, editions were produced on a four-color press with a different newsprint paper size. In 1979, the bar code appeared. In 1980, it became a gloss-paper, large-format (10 × 12 inch) magazine. Editions switched to the standard 8 × 11 inch magazine size starting with the issue dated October 30, 2008. Starting with the new monthly July 2018 issue, it returned to the previous 10 × 12 inch large format.

==Website==
The publication&#x27;s site at one time had an extensive message-board forum. By the late 1990s, this had developed into a thriving community, with many regular members and contributors worldwide. However, the site was also plagued with numerous Internet trolls, who vandalized the forum substantially. The magazine abruptly deleted the forum in May 2004, then began a new, much more limited message board community on their site in late 2005, only to remove it again in 2006. In March 2008, the website started a new message board section once again, then deleted it in April 2010.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; devotes one of its table of contents pages to promoting material currently appearing on its website, listing detailed links to the items.

On April 19, 2010, the website underwent a redesign and began featuring the complete archives of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The archive was first launched under a for-pay model, but has since transitioned to a free-with-print-subscription model. In the spring of 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; launched a federated search feature, which searches both the website and the archive.

The website has become an interactive source of biographical information on music artists in addition to historical rankings from the magazine. Users can cross-reference lists and they are also provided with historical insights. For example, one group that is listed on both Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time is Toots and the Maytals, with biographical details from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that explain how Toots and the Maytals coined the term &quot;reggae&quot; in their song &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;. For biographical information on all artists, the website contains a directory listed alphabetically.

===&quot;Glixel&quot;===

In May 2016, Wenner Media announced plans to create a separate online publication dedicated to the coverage of video games and video game culture. Gus Wenner, Jann Wenner&#x27;s son and head of digital for the publication at the time, told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;gaming is today what rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll was when &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was founded&quot;. &quot;Glixel&quot; was originally hosted on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s website and transitioned to its own domain by October 2016. Stories from &quot;Glixel&quot; are included on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; website, while writers for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; were also able to contribute to &quot;Glixel&quot;. The site was headed by John Davison, and its offices were located in San Francisco. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; closed down the offices in June 2017 and fired the entire staff, citing the difficulties of working with the remote site from their main New York office. Brian Crecente, founder of Kotaku and co-founder of Polygon, was hired as editorial director and runs the site from the main New York office. Following the sale of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s assets to Penske Media Corporation, the &quot;Glixel&quot; content was merged into the routine publishing of &quot;Variety&quot;, with Crecente remaining as editorial director.

== Political alignment ==
In 2017, Graham Ruddick of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a &quot;rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll magazine turned liberal cheerleader&quot;. Bruce Schulman wrote in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has &quot;routinely support[ed] liberal candidates and causes&quot; since the 1990s.

Conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg stated in 2008 that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had &quot;essentially become the house organ of the Democratic National Committee&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner has made all of his political donations to Democrats and has conducted high-profile interviews for the magazine with Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has criticized Republican Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump. In 2006, it described Bush as the &quot;worst president in history&quot;. The magazine featured Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau on its August 2017 cover with the headline &quot;Why can&#x27;t he be our president?&quot;

==Criticism and controversies==
One major criticism of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; involves its generational bias toward the 1960s and 1970s. One critic referred to the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs&quot; as an example of &quot;unrepentant rockist fogeyism&quot;. In further response to this issue, rock critic Jim DeRogatis, a former &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor, published a thorough critique of the magazine&#x27;s lists in a book called &quot;Kill Your Idols: A New Generation of Rock Writers Reconsiders the Classics&quot;, which featured differing opinions from many younger critics.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine has been criticized for reconsidering many classic albums that it had previously dismissed, and for frequent use of the 3.5-star rating. For example, Led Zeppelin was largely written off by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine critics during the band&#x27;s most active years in the 1970s, but by 2006, a cover story on the band honored them as &quot;the Heaviest Band of All Time&quot;. A critic for &quot;Slate&quot; magazine described a conference at which 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; was scrutinized. As he described it, &quot;The guide virtually ignored hip-hop and ruthlessly panned heavy metal, the two genres that within a few years would dominate the pop charts. In an auditorium packed with music journalists, you could detect more than a few anxious titters: How many of us will want our record reviews read back to us 20 years hence?&quot;

The hiring of former &quot;FHM&quot; editor Ed Needham further enraged critics who alleged that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had lost its credibility.

The 2003 &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s 100 Greatest Guitarists of all Time&quot; article, which named only two female musicians, resulted in &quot;Venus Zine&quot; answering with their own list, entitled &quot;The Greatest Female Guitarists of All Time&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s film critic, Peter Travers, has been criticized for his high number of repetitively used blurbs.

===Homosexual HIV story===
In 2003, the article &quot;Bug Chasers: The men who long to be HIV+&quot; claimed that homosexuals who intentionally sought to be infected with HIV accounted for 25% of new cases each year. However, the article&#x27;s cited physicians later denied making such statements.

===Anti-vaccine article===
In 2005, the article &quot;Deadly Immunity&quot; by anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attracted criticism for quoting material out of context, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; eventually amended the story with corrections in response to these and other criticisms.

===Tsarnaev cover===
The August 2013 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover, featuring then-accused (later convicted) Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, drew widespread criticism that the magazine was &quot;glamorizing terrorism&quot; and that the cover was a &quot;slap in the face to the great city of Boston&quot;. The online edition of the article was accompanied by a short editorial stating that the story &quot;falls within the traditions of journalism and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s long-standing commitment to serious and thoughtful coverage of the most important political and cultural issues of our day&quot;. The controversial cover photograph that was used by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had previously featured on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on May 5, 2013.

In response to the outcry, New England–based CVS Pharmacy and Tedeschi Food Shops banned their stores from carrying the issue. Also refusing to sell the issue were Walgreens; Rite-Aid and Kmart; Roche Bros. and Stop &amp; Shop; H-E-B and Walmart; 7-Eleven; Hy-Vee, Rutter&#x27;s Farm, and United Supermarkets; Cumberland Farms and Market Basket; and Shaw&#x27;s.

Boston mayor Thomas Menino sent a letter to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; publisher Jann Wenner, calling the cover &quot;ill-conceived, at best ... [it] reaffirms a message that destruction gains fame for killers and their &#x27;causes&#x27;.&quot; Menino also wrote, &quot;To respond to you in anger is to feed into your obvious market strategy&quot;, and that Wenner could have written about the survivors or the people who came to help after the bombings instead. In conclusion he wrote, &quot;The survivors of the Boston Marathon deserve &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover stories, though I no longer feel that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; deserves them.&quot;

===Defamatory false rape story and lawsuit===
In the issue dated November 19, 2014, the story &quot;A Rape on Campus&quot; was run about an alleged gang rape on the campus of the University of Virginia. Separate inquiries by Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity accused by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; of facilitating the alleged rape, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; revealed major errors, omissions and discrepancies in the story. Reporter Sabrina Erdely&#x27;s story was subject to intense media criticism. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Boston Herald&quot; issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; subsequently issued three apologies for the story.

On December 5, 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s managing editor, Will Dana, apologized for not fact-checking the story. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commissioned an outside investigation of the story and its problems by the dean of the Columbia School of Journalism. The report uncovered journalistic failure in the UVA story and institutional problems with reporting at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; retracted the story on April 5, 2015. On April 6, 2015, following the investigation and retraction of the story, Phi Kappa Psi announced plans to pursue all available legal action against &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, including claims of defamation.

On May 12, 2015, UVA associate dean Nicole Eramo, chief administrator for handling sexual assault issues at the school, filed a $7.5 million defamation lawsuit in Charlottesville Circuit Court against &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and Erdely, claiming damage to her reputation and emotional distress. Said the filing, &quot;&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and Erdely&#x27;s highly defamatory and false statements about Dean Eramo were not the result of an innocent mistake. They were the result of a wanton journalist who was more concerned with writing an article that fulfilled her preconceived narrative about the victimization of women on American college campuses, and a malicious publisher who was more concerned about selling magazines to boost the economic bottom line for its faltering magazine, than they were about discovering the truth or actual facts.&quot; On November 4, 2016, after 20 hours of deliberation, a jury consisting of eight women and two men found &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s publisher and Erdely liable for defaming Eramo, and awarded Eramo $3 million.

On July 29, 2015, three graduates of the fraternity Phi Kappa Psi filed a lawsuit against &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, its publisher Wenner Media, and a journalist for defamation and infliction of emotional distress. The same day, and just months after the controversy began, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that managing editor Will Dana was departing the magazine with his last date recorded as August 7, 2015. On November 9, 2015, the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity filed suit for $25 million for damages to its reputation caused by the magazine&#x27;s publication of this story, &quot;with reckless disregard for the truth&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; paid the fraternity $1.65 million to settle the suit out of court.

===Ethics controversy over El Chapo interview===
In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commissioned Sean Penn to write a feature on Joaquín &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzmán in what was billed as a landmark story and Guzmán&#x27;s first-ever interview. Penn met Guzmán, then wanted by Mexican and U.S. authorities, at a jungle hideout for an interview, the interview agreed to by Guzmán on the condition he have final editorial control over the article. Upon publication, the article – characterized by the Associated Press as &quot;long and rambling&quot; – was extensively mocked by social media users and prompted a discussion about the magazine&#x27;s ethical standards. Andrew Seaman, chairman of the ethics committee of the Society of Professional Journalists, called the decision to allow a source pre-approval of an article &quot;inexcusable&quot; while the Poynter Institute&#x27;s chief ethicist Kelly McBride opined that the article evidenced several failures of editorial control by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In an interview with NPR, Alfredo Corchado, a former Mexico City bureau chief for the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot;, said that pre-approval rights meant the story was not real journalism: &quot;It&#x27;s business, it&#x27;s Hollywood. It&#x27;s more in the lines of what a public relations firm would do.&quot;

Questions also arose as to whether relaxed security procedures by the magazine helped authorities track and capture Guzmán, who was arrested several days after the interview was conducted. Meanwhile, Kate del Castillo, who arranged the meeting, said that she had to flee the country after the article&#x27;s publication and charged that Penn had &quot;used me as a bait, and then he never protected me. And risked my life and my parents&#x27; life and my sister&#x27;s life and everybody surrounding me&quot;.

Penn later said his article &quot;had failed&quot;, noting that discussion about the ethics of the story overshadowed the actual report.

=== False ivermectin story ===
In September 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; picked up a story published by Oklahoma news outlet KFOR which claimed that so many people had been hospitalized due to ivermectin overdoses in Oklahoma that there was no room in intensive care units for other patients, including those with gunshot wounds. However, an Oklahoma hospital said in a statement that there was no shortage of beds due to ivermectin overdoses, and the doctor who had been interviewed by KFOR had not said that ivermectin cases were crowding out other patients, but the initial story and subsequent coverage had linked separate comments about ivermectin overdoses and scarce beds. CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale stated that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; had &quot;[run] an adaptation of the KFOR story without appearing to do sufficient research to make sure the local report was sound&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; subsequently added an editor&#x27;s note which retracted the core point of its story.

Kyle Smith of &quot;National Review&quot; wrote that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s correction &quot;is so humiliating, it&#x27;s a wonder the place doesn&#x27;t shut its doors immediately, liquidate all assets, and deny that it ever existed.&quot; Robby Soave of &quot;Reason&quot; wrote that the correct story &quot;was something &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; could have figured out on its own had the magazine bothered to contact any hospitals in Oklahoma, but alas.&quot; Alex Shephard of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote: &quot;For mainstream and, particularly, liberal media this should be a stark reminder of the value of due diligence and checking sources. At the very least, make a phone call.&quot;

===James Gordon Meek child pornography case===
On January 31, 2023, ABC News reporter James Gordon Meek was arrested by the FBI and charged with transporting child pornography. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; initially broke the story, but did not mention the child sexual abuse images that led to the investigation, which were known to the reporters, instead suggesting that Meek had been &quot;targeted&quot; by the US government for his reporting on national security issues, writing that &quot;Meek appears to be on the wrong side of the national-security apparatus&quot;. In the following months, it was revealed that &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Noah Shachtman, who personally knows Meek and is considered friendly with him, had the story rewritten before publication to exclude all mentions of the child sexual abuse material, without the original journalist Tatiana Siegel&#x27;s knowledge.

==In popular culture==
George Harrison&#x27;s 1975 song &quot;This Guitar (Can&#x27;t Keep from Crying)&quot;, a lyrical sequel to his Beatles track &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; (1968), references the magazine in its second verse: &quot;Learned to get up when I fall / Can even climb &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; walls&quot;. The song was written in response to some highly unfavorable reviews from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and other publications for Harrison&#x27;s 1974 North American tour and the &quot;Dark Horse&quot; album.

The 2000 film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; centers on a teenage journalist writing for the magazine in the early 1970s while covering the fictional band Stillwater. The film was directed by Cameron Crowe and based on his own experiences as a young journalist for the magazine in the same time period.

&quot;The Cover of Rolling Stone&quot; is a song written by Shel Silverstein and first recorded by American rock group Dr. Hook &amp; the Medicine Show. The song satirizes success in the music business; the song&#x27;s narrator laments that his band, despite having the superficial attributes of a successful rock star (including drug usage, &quot;teenage groupies, who&#x27;ll do anything we say&quot;, and a frenetic guitar solo), has been unable to &quot;get their pictures on the cover of the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&quot;.

The title track of Pink Floyd&#x27;s album &quot;The Final Cut&quot; features the line, &quot;Would you sell your story to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;?&quot;

The track &quot;Baker Street Muse&quot; on Jethro Tull&#x27;s album &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; includes the line &quot;I have no time for &quot;Time&quot; Magazine or &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&quot;.

Charlie Robison&#x27;s 1998 song of lost love &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; name-drops the magazine with the line, &quot;Well, I wish I had my picture on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; today&quot;.

In Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Firestarter&quot;, the protagonists decide to tell their story to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

In Joni Mitchell&#x27;s song &quot;California&quot;, the magazine is referenced in the line, &quot;Reading &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reading &quot;Vogue&quot;&quot;.

In May 2022, an off-Broadway play adapted from the &quot;A Rape on Campus&quot; article controversy and resulting legal battles titled &quot;Retraction&quot; premiered in New York City at Theatre Four at Theatre Row.

<text>Romania is a country located at the crossroads of Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe. It borders Ukraine to the north and east, Hungary to the west, Serbia to the southwest, Bulgaria to the south, Moldova to the east, and the Black Sea to the southeast. It has a mainly continental climate, and an area of with a population of 19 million people. Romania is the twelfth-largest country in Europe and the sixth-most populous member state of the European Union. Europe&#x27;s second-longest river, the Danube, empties into the Danube Delta in the southeast of the country. The Carpathian Mountains cross Romania from the north to the southwest and include Moldoveanu Peak, at an altitude of . Bucharest is the country&#x27;s largest urban area and economic center. Other major urban centers include Cluj-Napoca, Timișoara, Iași, Constanța and Brașov.

Settlement in the territory of modern Romania began in the Lower Paleolithic, later becoming the Dacian Kingdom before Roman conquest and Romanization. The modern Romanian state formed in 1859 with the union of Moldavia and Wallachia under Alexandru Ioan Cuza, becoming a kingdom in 1881 under Carol I. Romania gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877, formalized by the Treaty of Berlin. After World War I, Transylvania, Banat, Bukovina, and Bessarabia joined the Old Kingdom, forming Greater Romania, which reached its largest territorial extent. In 1940, under Axis pressure, Romania lost territories to Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union. Following the 1944 Romanian coup d&#x27;état, Romania switched sides to join the Allies. After World War II, it regained Northern Transylvania through the Paris Peace Treaties. Under Soviet occupation, King Michael I was forced to abdicate, and Romania became a socialist republic and Warsaw Pact member. After the 1989 Revolution, Romania began a transition to liberal democracy and a market economy.

Romania is a developing country with a high-income economy, classified as a middle power in international relations. It is a unitary republic with a multi-party system and a semi-presidential representative democracy. It is home to 11 UNESCO World Heritage Sites and has become an increasingly popular tourist destination, attracting 14 million foreign visitors in 2024. Romania is a net exporter of automotive and vehicle parts worldwide and has established a growing reputation as a technology center, with some of the fastest internet speeds globally. Romania is a member of several international organizations, including the European Union, NATO, and the BSEC.

==Etymology==

&quot;Romania&quot; derives from the local name for Romanian (), which in turn derives from Latin , meaning &quot;Roman&quot; or &quot;of Rome&quot;. This ethnonym for Romanians is first attested in the 16th century by Italian humanists travelling in Transylvania, Moldavia, and Wallachia. The oldest known surviving document written in Romanian that can be precisely dated, a 1521 letter known as the &quot;Letter of Neacșu from Câmpulung&quot;, is notable for including the first documented occurrence of &quot;Romanian&quot; in a country name: Wallachia is mentioned as . The earliest evidence of the name &quot;Romanian&quot; may be found in the 13th‑century Nibelungenlied: &quot;Duke Ramunch of the land of the Vlachs / with seven hundred warriors he runs to meet her / like wild birds, he was seen galloping.&quot; Ramunch may be a transliteration of &quot;Romanian&quot;, representing in this context a symbolic leader of the Romanians.

==History==
===Dacia and the Roman Empire=== 

It is believed that the tribes responsible for creating the Bronze Age culture on the territory of modern Romania belonged to the Indo-European group of Thracians. Strabon, in Geographica, noted that the Getae spoke the same language as the Thracians, and the Dacians the same language as the Getae. However, the earliest account of the Getae is attributed to Herodotus. The conquest of Dacia by the Romans led to the fusion of two cultures—the Daco-Romans became the ancestors of the Romanian people. After Dacia became a province of the Roman Empire, elements of Roman culture and civilization—most notably Vulgar Latin, which laid the foundation for the development of the Romanian language—were introduced.

Based on information from the inscription at Dionysupolis and the account of Iordanes, it is known that under the rule of Burebista, assisted by the great priest Deceneu, the first Geto-Dacian state was formed. In 44 BCE, Burebista was assassinated by one of his servants. After his death, the Geto-Dacian state fragmented into four, and later five, kingdoms. The core of the state remained in the area of the Șureanu Mountains, where successive rulers such as Deceneu, Comosicus, and Coryllus held power. The centralized Dacian state reached the peak of its development under Decebalus. During this period, a series of conflicts with the Roman Empire continued, with part of the Dacian state being conquered in 106 AD by the Roman emperor Trajan. Between 271–275 AD, the Aurelian retreat took place.

===Period of the Principalities and the Phanariot Era===
In the first millennium, waves of nomads swept across the territory of Romania: the Goths during the 3rd–4th centuries, the Huns in the 4th century, the Gepids in the 5th century, the Avars in the 6th century, the Slavs in the 7th century, the Magyars in the 9th century, the Pechenegs, the Cumans, the Uzes and the Alans during the 10th–12th centuries, and the Tatars in the 13th century.

In the 13th century, the first Knyaz south of the Carpathian Mountains are attested. Later, in the context of the crystallization of feudal relations, as a result of the creation of favorable internal and external conditions (the weakening of Hungarian pressure and the diminishing of Tatars domination), autonomous feudal states emerged south and east of the Carpathians – Wallachia in 1310, under Basarab I, and Moldova in 1359, under Bogdan I. Among the Romanian rulers who played a more important role can be mentioned: Alexander the Good, Stephen the Great, Petru Rareș, and Dimitrie Cantemir in Moldova; Mircea the Elder, Vlad the Impaler, Michael the Brave, and Constantin Brâncoveanu in Wallachia; and John Hunyadi in Transylvania.

Beginning with the end of the 15th century, the two principalities gradually came under the influence of the Ottoman Empire.

Transylvania, which throughout the Middle Ages was part of the Kingdom of Hungary, governed by voivodes, became a self-governing principality and a vassal of the Ottoman Empire from 1526. At the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries, Michael the Brave ruled, for a very brief period, over a large part of the territory of present-day Romania.

In the 18th century, Moldavia and Wallachia maintained their internal autonomy, but in 1711 and 1716, respectively, the period of the Phanariots began, with rulers appointed directly by the Porte from among the noble families of Greek origin in Constantinople. With the signing of the Ausgleich in 1867, Transylvania quickly lost its remaining political autonomy, being politically and administratively incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary.

=== Early modern times and national awakening ===


The Kingdom of Hungary collapsed, and the Ottomans occupied parts of Banat and Crișana in 1541. Transylvania and Maramureș, along with the rest of Banat and Crișana developed into a new state under Ottoman suzerainty, the Principality of Transylvania. The Reformation encouraged the rise of Protestantism and four denominations—Calvinism, Lutheranism, Unitarianism, and Roman Catholicism—were officially acknowledged in 1568. The Romanians&#x27; Orthodox faith remained only tolerated, although they made up more than one-third of the population, according to 17th-century estimations.

The princes of Transylvania, Wallachia, and Moldavia joined the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire in 1594. The Wallachian prince, Michael the Brave, united the three principalities under his rule in May 1600. The neighboring powers forced him to abdicate in September, but he became a symbol of the unification of the Romanian lands in the 19th century. Although the rulers of the three principalities continued to pay tribute to the Ottomans, the most talented princes—Gabriel Bethlen of Transylvania, Matei Basarab of Wallachia, and Vasile Lupu of Moldavia—strengthened their autonomy.

The united armies of the Holy League expelled the Ottoman troops from Central Europe between 1684 and 1699, and the Principality of Transylvania was integrated into the Habsburg monarchy. The Habsburgs supported the Catholic clergy and persuaded the Orthodox Romanian prelates to accept the union with the Roman Catholic Church in 1699. The Church Union strengthened the Romanian intellectuals&#x27; devotion to their Roman heritage. The Orthodox Church was restored in Transylvania only after Orthodox monks stirred up revolts in 1744 and 1759. The organisation of the Transylvanian Military Frontier caused further disturbances, especially among the Székelys in 1764.

Princes Dimitrie Cantemir of Moldavia and Constantin Brâncoveanu of Wallachia concluded alliances with the Habsburg Monarchy and Russia against the Ottomans, but they were dethroned in 1711 and 1714, respectively. The sultans lost confidence in the native princes and appointed Orthodox merchants from the Phanar district of Istanbul to rule Moldova and Wallachia. The Phanariot princes pursued oppressive fiscal policies and dissolved the army. The neighboring powers took advantage of the situation: the Habsburg Monarchy annexed the northwestern part of Moldavia, or Bukovina, in 1775, and the Russian Empire seized the eastern half of Moldavia, or Bessarabia, in 1812.

A census revealed that the Romanians were more numerous than any other ethnic group in Transylvania in 1733, but legislation continued to use contemptuous adjectives (such as &quot;tolerated&quot; and &quot;admitted&quot;) when referring to them. The Uniate bishop, Inocențiu Micu-Klein who demanded recognition of the Romanians as the fourth privileged nation was forced into exile. Uniate and Orthodox clerics and laymen jointly signed a plea for the Transylvanian Romanians&#x27; emancipation in 1791, but the monarch and the local authorities refused to grant their requests.
The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca authorised the Russian ambassador in Istanbul to defend the autonomy of Moldavia and Wallachia (known as the Danubian Principalities) in 1774. Taking advantage of the Greek War of Independence, a Wallachian lesser nobleman, Tudor Vladimirescu, stirred up a revolt against the Ottomans in January 1821, but he was murdered in June by Phanariot Greeks. After a new Russo-Turkish War, the Treaty of Adrianople strengthened the autonomy of the Danubian Principalities in 1829, although it also acknowledged the sultan&#x27;s right to confirm the election of the princes.

Mihail Kogălniceanu, Nicolae Bălcescu and other leaders of the 1848 revolutions in Moldavia and Wallachia demanded the emancipation of the peasants and the union of the two principalities, but Russian and Ottoman troops crushed their revolt. The Wallachian revolutionists were the first to adopt the blue, yellow and red tricolour as the national flag. In Transylvania, most Romanians supported the imperial government against the Hungarian revolutionaries after the Diet passed a law concerning the union of Transylvania and Hungary. Bishop Andrei Șaguna proposed the unification of the Romanians of the Habsburg Monarchy in a separate duchy, but the central government refused to change the internal borders.

=== Unification and the Kingdom of Romania ===


====From the Little Union to the Great War====
The modern Romanian state was created through the unification of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia, accepted as a federative structure by the Great Powers following the Paris Convention of 1858, and later cemented by the simultaneous election as ruler of both states of the unionist Alexandru Ioan Cuza. After carrying out numerous reforms that laid the foundations for the modernization of the state, he was forced in 1866 by a broad coalition of the political parties of the time, also known as the &quot;Monstrous coalition&quot;, to abdicate and leave the country. 
The union was at one time in peril, but the political leaders of the era succeeded in placing on the princely throne Carol I of Romania, who accepted the Constitution and took the oath on 10 May 1866. Eleven years later, on 10 May 1877, Romania proclaimed its independence—achieved on the battlefield—and in 1881, on the same day of the year, Carol was crowned as King of Romania. In 1913, Romania entered the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria, at the end of which it obtained the Quadrilateral. In 1914, King Carol I died, and his nephew, Ferdinand I, succeeded him on the throne.

====World War I and the Great Union====
In 1916, Romania entered World War I on the side of the Entente Powers. Although the Romanian forces did not perform well militarily, by the end of the war the Austrian and Russian Empires had disintegrated; the National Assembly in Transylvania, and the Sfatul Țării in Bessarabia and Bukovina proclaimed their union with Romania, and King Ferdinand I and Queen Maria were crowned sovereign of all Romanians in Alba Iulia on 15 October 1922. The Treaty of Versailles recognized all the union proclamations in accordance with the right to self-determination established by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s &quot;Fourteen Points&quot;.

====Interwar Period====
After having left the country and renounced his claim to the throne in 1925, Carol II returned in 1930 and usurped his son’s throne; influenced by his inner circle—referred to by historians as the “Royal Camarilla”—he gradually undermined the democratic system, and in 1938 he assumed dictatorial powers. Although he was pro-Western (especially Anglophile), Carol attempted to appease extreme centrifugal forces by appointing nationalist governments that adopted anti-Semitic measures, such as the Goga cabinet and the one led by the Orthodox Patriarch Miron Cristea.

====World War II: Positions and Territorial Losses====

Following the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, in June 1940 Romania accepted the loss of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina and the Hertsa region in favor of the USSR (as stipulated in the Soviet ultimatum of 28 June 1940). Unaware of the details of the Soviet–German pact, Carol attempted to secure an alliance with Nazi Germany, and appointed Ion Gigurtu as President of the Council of Ministers, who declared that he would pursue a Nazi pro-Axis (Berlin–Rome) policy that was anti-Semitic and fascist-totalitarian in nature. Between 4 July and 4 September 1940, by accepting Hitler&#x27;s arbitration over Transylvania (after Gigurtu declared on radio that Romania must make territorial sacrifices to justify its Nazi orientation and full adherence to the Berlin–Rome Axis), Romania ceded Northern Transylvania—including the city of Cluj—to Hungary. The vast territories in Transylvania ceded by Ion Gigurtu to Hungary contained important natural resources, including gold mines. Ion Gigurtu also initiated negotiations to cede 8,000 km2 of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria, these negotiations were interrupted by Antonescu’s unconditional acceptance of the territorial cession.

In response to the chaotic withdrawal from Bessarabia, the territorial cessions, public discontent, and protests from political leaders, King Carol II suspended the 1938 Constitution of Romania and appointed General Ion Antonescu as Prime Minister. This measure, supported by the Iron Guard, demanded that the king abdicate in favor of his son, Mihai. Subsequently, Antonescu assumed dictatorial powers and became President of the Council of Ministers, self-titling himself as the “Leader” of the state.

====Participation in the War====

In 1941, as an ally of Nazi Germany, Romania entered World War II by declaring war on the Soviet Union. A shift in fortunes only became discernible after the defeat at Stalingrad and the subsequent change of the USSR from a defensive to an offensive posture.

On 23 August 1944, with the Soviet army having been present in northern Moldova since March, King Mihai I forcibly removed Marshal Ion Antonescu from power, as he refused to sign an armistice with the Allies of World War II. Following Antonescu’s outright refusal, King Mihai I ordered the dismissal and arrest of the marshal, and Romania switched sides to join the Allies.

===Socialist Republic of Romania===
Less than three years after the Soviet occupation of Romania, in 1947, King Michael I was forced to abdicate and the People&#x27;s Republic of Romania—a state of &quot;popular democracy&quot;—was proclaimed. The newly established communist regime, led by the Romanian Workers&#x27; Party, consolidated its power through a Stalinist-type policy aimed at suppressing any political opposition and transforming the economic and social structures of the old bourgeois regime.

In the early 1960s, the Romanian government began asserting a certain degree of independence from the Soviet Union in its foreign policy, although it did not abandon its repressive policies (which it labeled &quot;revolutionary conquests&quot;) in domestic affairs. In 1965, communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej died, ushering in a period of change in Romania. After a brief power struggle, Nicolae Ceaușescu emerged as the head of the communist party, becoming General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party in 1965, President of the State Council in 1967, and President of the Socialist Republic of Romania in 1974. Ceaușescu&#x27;s long rule, spanning several decades, grew increasingly authoritarian during the 1980s.

=== Romania since 1989 ===


In the context of the fall of communism throughout Eastern Europe during the revolutions of 1989, a protest that began in mid-December 1989 in Timișoara quickly escalated into a national uprising against the communist regime, ultimately ousting Nicolae Ceaușescu from power.

An interim council composed of figures from civil society and former communist officials assumed control of the government, and Ion Iliescu became the provisional president of the country. The new government reversed many of the authoritarian communist policies and dismissed several leaders of the former regime.

In May 1990, elections were held for both the legislature and the presidency. Iliescu was elected president, and his party, the National Salvation Front, gained control of the legislature. Petre Roman became prime minister. However, the elections did not put an end to the Golaniad. The miners&#x27; riots in 1991 led to the dismissal of the Second Roman cabinet in September 1991. In October, former Finance Minister Theodor Stolojan succeeded Roman as prime minister and formed a new cabinet. In the 1992 national elections, Ion Iliescu secured another term. With parliamentary support from the nationalist parties Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR), Greater Romania Party (PRM), and the former communist party Socialist Party of Labour (PSM), Văcăroiu Cabinet was formed in November 1992, led by Prime Minister Nicolae Văcăroiu.

The subsequent disintegration of the Front produced several political parties, including most notably the Social Democratic Party (PDSR then PSD) and the Democratic Party (PD and subsequently PDL). The former governed Romania from 1990 until 1996 through several coalitions and governments, with Ion Iliescu as head of state. Since then, there have been several other democratic changes of government: in 1996 Emil Constantinescu was elected president, in 2000 Iliescu returned to power, while Traian Băsescu was elected in 2004 and narrowly re-elected in 2009.

In 2009, the country was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund as an aftershock of the Great Recession in Europe. In November 2014, Sibiu former FDGR/DFDR mayor Klaus Iohannis was elected president, unexpectedly defeating former Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who had been previously leading in the opinion polls. This surprise victory was attributed by many analysts to the implication of the Romanian diaspora in the voting process, with almost 50% casting their votes for Klaus Iohannis in the first round, compared to only 16% for Ponta. In 2019, Iohannis was re-elected president in a landslide victory over former Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă.

The post–1989 period is characterised by the fact that most of the former industrial and economic enterprises which were built and operated during the communist period were closed, mainly as a result of the policies of privatisation of the post–1989 regimes.

Corruption has been a major issue in contemporary Romanian politics. In November 2015, massive anti-corruption protests which developed in the wake of the Colectiv nightclub fire led to the resignation of Romania&#x27;s Prime Minister Victor Ponta. During 2017–2018, in response to measures which were perceived to weaken the fight against corruption, some of the biggest protests since 1989 took place in Romania, with over 500,000 people protesting across the country. Nevertheless, there have been significant reforms aimed at tackling corruption. A National Anticorruption Directorate was formed in the country in 2002, inspired by similar institutions in Belgium, Norway and Spain. Since 2014, Romania launched an anti-corruption effort that led to the prosecution of medium- and high-level political, judicial and administrative offenses by the National Anticorruption Directorate.

After the end of the Cold War, Romania developed closer ties with Western Europe and the United States, eventually joining NATO in 2004, and hosting the 2008 summit in Bucharest. The country applied in June 1993 for membership in the European Union and became an Associated State of the EU in 1995, an Acceding Country in 2004, and a full member on 1 January 2007.

During the 2000s, Romania had one of the highest economic growth rates in Europe and has been referred at times as &quot;the Tiger of Eastern Europe&quot;. This has been accompanied by a significant improvement in living standards as the country successfully reduced domestic poverty and established a functional democratic state. However, Romania&#x27;s development suffered a major setback during the late 2000s&#x27; recession leading to a large gross domestic product contraction and a budget deficit in 2009. This led to Romania borrowing from the International Monetary Fund. Worsening economic conditions led to unrest and triggered a political crisis in 2012.

==Geography==


Romania is the largest country in Southeastern Europe and the twelfth-largest in Europe, having an area of . It lies between latitudes 43° and 49° N and longitudes 20° and 30° E. The terrain is distributed roughly equally between mountains, hills, and plains. The Carpathian Mountains dominate the centre of Romania, with 14 mountain ranges reaching above —the highest is Moldoveanu Peak at . They are surrounded by the Moldavian and Transylvanian plateaus, the Pannonian Plain and the Wallachian plains.

Romania is home to six terrestrial ecoregions: Balkan mixed forests, Central European mixed forests, East European forest steppe, Pannonian mixed forests, Carpathian montane conifer forests, and Pontic steppe. Natural and semi-natural ecosystems cover about 47% of the country&#x27;s land area. There are almost (about 5% of the total area) of protected areas in Romania covering 13 national parks and three biosphere reserves. The Danube river forms a large part of the border with Serbia and Bulgaria, and flows into the Black Sea, forming the Danube Delta, which is the second-largest and best-preserved delta in Europe, and a biosphere reserve and a biodiversity World Heritage Site. At , the Danube Delta is the largest continuous marshland in Europe, and supports 1,688 different plant species alone.

Romania has one of the largest areas of undisturbed forest in Europe, covering almost 27% of its territory. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 5.95/10, ranking it 90th globally out of 172 countries. Some 3,700 plant species have been identified in the country, from which to date 23 have been declared natural monuments, 74 extinct, 39 endangered, 171 vulnerable, and 1,253 rare.

The fauna of Romania consists of 33,792 species of animals, 33,085 invertebrate and 707 vertebrate, with almost 400 unique species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, including about 50% of Europe&#x27;s (excluding Russia) brown bears and 20% of its wolves.

===Climate===

Owing to its distance from open sea and its position on the southeastern portion of the European continent, Romania has a climate that is continental, with four distinct seasons. The average annual temperature is  in the south and  in the north. In summer, average maximum temperatures in Bucharest rise to , and temperatures over are fairly common in the lower-lying areas of the country. In winter, the average maximum temperature is below . Precipitation is average, with over per year only on the highest western mountains, while around Bucharest it drops to approximately .
There are some regional differences: in western sections, such as Banat, the climate is milder and has some Mediterranean influences; the eastern part of the country has a more pronounced continental climate. In Dobruja, the Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region&#x27;s climate.

==Politics==

Romania is a unitary semi-presidential representative democratic republic with a structured system of governance and an active civil society. The President, elected by popular vote, serves as the head of state, representing the country in international affairs, safeguarding constitutional order, and acting as supreme commander of the Romanian Armed Forces. The Prime Minister, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Parliament, acts as the head of government, responsible for overseeing the executive branch, implementing domestic and foreign policies, and managing public administration. Legislative authority is vested in a bicameral Parliament, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, whose members are elected through a proportional representation system. The judiciary operates independently, with the High Court of Cassation and Justice as the highest court of appeal.

===Government===

Romania has a democratic, multi-party system, with legislative power vested in the government and the two chambers of the Parliament, more specifically the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The latter is elected by popular vote for a maximum of two terms of five years and appoints the prime minister who in turn appoints the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch of the government, collectively known as the Parliament (residing at the Palace of the Parliament), consists of two chambers (Senate and Chamber of Deputies) whose members are elected every four years by simple plurality.

The justice system is independent of the other branches of government and is made up of a hierarchical system of courts with the High Court of Cassation and Justice being the supreme court of Romania. There are also courts of appeal, county courts and local courts. The Romanian judicial system is strongly influenced by the French model, is based on civil law and is inquisitorial in nature. The Constitutional Court (&quot;Curtea Constituțională&quot;) is responsible for judging the compliance of laws and other state regulations with the constitution, which is the fundamental law of the country and can be amended only through a public referendum. Romania&#x27;s 2007 entry into the EU has been a significant influence on its domestic policy, and including judicial reforms, increased judicial cooperation with other member states, and measures to combat corruption.

===Foreign relations===


Since December 1989, Romania has pursued a policy of strengthening relations with the West in general, more specifically with the United States and the European Union, albeit with limited relations involving the Russian Federation. It joined NATO on 29 March 2004, the European Union (EU) on 1 January 2007, while it joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in 1972, and is a founding member of the World Trade Organization. Romania is recognized as a middle power for it&#x27;s military capabilities, as well as its active diplomatic engagement on the global stage.

In the past, recent governments have stated that one of their goals is to strengthen ties with and helping other countries (in particular Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia) with the process of integration with the rest of the West. Romania has also made clear since the late 1990s that it supports NATO and EU membership for the democratic former Soviet republics in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus.

Romania opted on 1 January 2007, to accede to the Schengen Area, and its bid to join was approved by the European Parliament in June 2011, but was rejected by the EU Council in September 2011. As of August 2019, its acceptance into the Schengen Area was hampered because the European Council had misgivings about Romania&#x27;s adherence to the rule of law, a fundamental principle of EU membership. On 31 March 2024, Romania joined the Schengen Area only with the sea and air borders. After Austria, the last country to oppose Romania&#x27;s and Bulgaria&#x27;s Schengen membership, lifted its veto, the two countries became full members on 1 January 2025.

In December 2005, President Traian Băsescu and United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice signed an agreement that would allow a U.S. military presence at several Romanian facilities primarily in the eastern part of the country. In May 2009, Hillary Clinton, US Secretary of State, declared that &quot;Romania is one of the most trustworthy and respectable partners of the USA.&quot;

Relations with Moldova are a special case given that the two countries share the same language and a common history. A movement for unification of Moldova and Romania appeared in the early 1990s after both countries achieved emancipation from communist rule but lost ground in the mid-1990s when a new Moldovan government pursued an agenda towards preserving a Moldovan republic independent of Romania. After the 2009 protests in Moldova and the subsequent removal of Communists from power, relations between the two countries have improved considerably.

===Military===


The Romanian Armed Forces consist of land, air, and naval forces led by a Commander-in-chief under the supervision of the Ministry of National Defence, and by the president as the Supreme Commander during wartime. The Armed Forces consist of approximately 55,000 reservists and 71,500 active military personnel—35,800 for land, 10,700 for air, 6,600 for naval forces, and 16,500 in other fields. Total defence spending in 2023 accounted for 2.44% of total national GDP, or approximately US$8.48 billion, with a total of $9 billion intended to be spent until 2026 for modernisation and acquisition of new equipment. Conscription stopped in 2007, when Romania switched to a volunteer army.

The Air Force operates F-16AM/BM MLU fighters, C-27J Spartan and C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, as well as IAR 330 and IAR 316 helicopters. A procurement programme for F-35 fifth-generation fighters is also currently being carried out. The Naval Forces operate three frigates, of which two Type 22 frigates acquired from the British Royal Navy, as well as four corvettes. The River Flotilla operates Mihail Kogălniceanu and Smârdan-class river monitors.

Romania contributed troops to the international coalition in Afghanistan beginning in 2002, with a peak deployment of 1,600 troops in 2010 (which was the 4th largest contribution according to the US). Its combat mission in the country concluded in 2014. Romanian troops participated in the occupation of Iraq, reaching a peak of 730 soldiers before being slowly drawn down to 350 soldiers. Romania terminated its mission in Iraq and withdrew its last troops on 24 July 2009, among the last countries to do so. The frigate the &quot;Regele Ferdinand&quot; participated in the 2011 military intervention in Libya.

In December 2011, the Romanian Senate unanimously adopted the draft law ratifying the Romania-United States agreement signed in September of the same year that would allow the establishment and operation of a US land-based ballistic missile defence system in Romania as part of NATO&#x27;s efforts to build a continental missile shield. The Aegis Ashore missile system based at Deveslu became operational in 2016.

In 2024, construction work started on expanding the Mihail Kogălniceanu Air Base (RoAF 57th Air Base). The air base is set to become the largest NATO base in Europe after the implementation of a project spanning 20 years.

===Administrative divisions===
Romania is divided into 41 counties (&quot;județe&quot;) and the municipality of Bucharest. Each county is administered by a county council, responsible for local affairs, as well as a prefect responsible for the administration of national affairs at the county level. The prefect is appointed by the central government but cannot be a member of any political party. Each county is subdivided further into cities and communes, which have their own mayor and local council. There are a total of 320 cities and 2,861 communes in Romania. A total of 103 of the larger cities have municipality status, which gives them greater administrative power over local affairs. The municipality of Bucharest is a special case, as it enjoys a status on par to that of a county. It is further divided into six sectors and has a prefect, a general mayor (&quot;primar general&quot;), and a general city council.

The NUTS-3 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) level divisions of the European Union reflect Romania&#x27;s administrative-territorial structure and correspond to the 41 counties plus Bucharest. The cities and communes correspond to the NUTS-5 level divisions, but there are no current NUTS-4 level divisions. The NUTS-1 (four macroregions) and NUTS-2 (eight development regions) divisions exist but have no administrative capacity and are used instead for coordinating regional development projects and statistical purposes.

==Economy==


In 2024, Romania has a GDP (PPP) of around $894 billion and a GDP per capita (PPP) of $47,203. According to the World Bank, Romania is a high-income economy. According to Eurostat, Romania&#x27;s GDP per capita (PPS) was 77% of the EU average (100%) in 2022, an increase from 44% in 2007 (the year of Romania&#x27;s accession to the EU), making Romania one of the fastest growing economies in the EU.

The Bucharest Stock Exchange (BVB) is the stock exchange of Romania, located in Bucharest. In 2024, the BVB boasted a $74 billion market capitalization and a trading volume of $7.2 billion. As of 2024, 86 companies were listed on the exchange. In September 2020, FTSE Russell upgraded the BVB from a Frontier market to a Secondary Emerging Market.

After 1989 the country experienced a decade of economic instability and decline, led in part by an obsolete industrial base and a lack of structural reform. From 2000 onwards, however, the Romanian economy was transformed into one of relative macroeconomic stability, characterised by high growth, low unemployment and declining inflation. In 2006, according to the Romanian Statistics Office, GDP growth in real terms was recorded at 7.7%, one of the highest rates in Europe. However, the Great Recession forced the government to borrow externally, including an IMF €20 billion bailout programme. According to The World Bank, GDP per capita in purchasing power parity grew from $13,703 in 2007 to $47,903 in 2023.

Romania&#x27;s main exports are vehicles, software, clothing and textiles, industrial machinery, electrical and electronic equipment, metallurgic products, raw materials, military equipment, pharmaceuticals, fine chemicals, and agricultural products (fruits, vegetables, and flowers). Trade is mostly centred on the member states of the European Union, with Germany, Italy and France being the country&#x27;s single largest trading partners.

After a series of privatisations and reforms in the late 1990s and 2000s, government intervention in the Romanian economy is somewhat less than in other European economies. In 2005, the government replaced Romania&#x27;s progressive tax system with a flat tax of 16% for both personal income and corporate profit, among the lowest rates in the European Union. The economy is based predominantly on services, which account for 56.2% of the country&#x27;s total GDP as of 2017, with industry and agriculture accounting for 30% and 4.4% respectively.
Approximately 25.8% of the Romanian workforce is employed in agriculture, one of the highest rates in Europe.

Romania has attracted increasing amounts of foreign investment following the end of Communism, with the stock of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Romania rising to €83.8 billion in June 2019. Romania&#x27;s FDI outward stock (an external or foreign business either investing in or purchasing the stock of a local economy) amounted to $745 million in December 2018, the lowest value among the 28 EU member states.

Since 1867 the official currency has been the Romanian &quot;leu&quot; (&quot;lion&quot;) and following a denomination in 2005. After joining the EU in 2007, Romania plans to adopt the euro in 2029.

===Infrastructure===

According to the Romania&#x27;s National Institute of Statistics (INS), Romania&#x27;s total road network was estimated in 2015 at . The World Bank estimates the railway network at of track, the fourth-largest railroad network in Europe. Romania&#x27;s rail transport experienced a dramatic decline after 1989 and was estimated at 99 million passenger journeys in 2004, but has experienced a recent (2013) revival due to infrastructure improvements and partial privatisation of lines, accounting for 45% of all passenger and freight movements in the country. Bucharest Metro, the only underground railway system, was opened in 1979 and measures with an average ridership in 2021 of 720,000 passengers during the workweek in the country. There are sixteen international commercial airports in service today. Over 12.8 million passengers flew through Bucharest&#x27;s Henri Coandă International Airport in 2017.

Romania is a net exporter of electrical energy and is 52nd worldwide in terms of consumption of electric energy. Around a third of the produced energy comes from renewable sources, mostly as hydroelectric power. It has one of the largest refining capacities in Eastern Europe, even though oil and natural gas production has been decreasing for more than a decade. With one of the largest reserves of crude oil and shale gas in Europe it is among the most energy-independent countries in the European Union, and is looking to expand its nuclear power plant at Cernavodă further.

There were almost 18.3 million connections to the Internet in June 2014. According to Bloomberg, in 2013 Romania ranked fifth in the world, and according to &quot;The Independent&quot;, it ranks number one in Europe at Internet speeds, with Timișoara ranked among the highest in the world.

Tourism is a significant contributor to the Romanian economy, generating around 5% of GDP. The number of tourists has been rising steadily, reaching 9.33 million foreign tourists in 2016, according to the Worldbank. Tourism in Romania attracted €400 million in investments in 2005. More than 60% of the foreign visitors in 2007 were from other EU countries. The popular summer attractions of Mamaia and other Black Sea Resorts attracted 1.3 million tourists in 2009.
Most popular skiing resorts are along the Valea Prahovei and in Poiana Brașov. Castles, fortifications, or strongholds as well as preserved medieval Transylvanian cities or towns such as Cluj-Napoca, Sibiu, Brașov, Alba Iulia, Baia Mare, Bistrița, Mediaș, Cisnădie, Sebeș, or Sighișoara also attract a large number of tourists. Bran Castle, near Brașov, is one of the most famous attractions in Romania, drawing hundreds of thousands of tourists every year as it is often advertised as being Dracula&#x27;s Castle. Other attractions include the Danube Delta or the Sculptural Ensemble of Constantin Brâncuși at Târgu Jiu.

Rural tourism, focusing on getting visitors acquainted with local folklore and customs, has become an important alternative, and is targeted to promote such sites as Bran and its Dracula&#x27;s Castle, the painted churches of northern Moldavia, and the wooden churches of Maramureș, or the villages with fortified churches in Transylvania. The Via Transilvanica long-distance hiking and cycling trail, which crosses 10 counties in the Transylvania, Banat and Bukovina regions of the country further promotes rural slow tourism.

In 2014, Romania had 32,500 companies active in the hotel and restaurant industry, with a total turnover of €2.6 billion. More than 1.9 million foreign tourists visited Romania in 2014, 12% more than in 2013. According to the country&#x27;s National Statistics Institute, some 77% came from Europe (particularly from Germany, Italy, and France), 12% from Asia, and less than 7% from North America.

===Science and technology===

Historically, Romanian researchers and inventors have made notable contributions to several fields. In the history of flight, Traian Vuia built the first airplane to take off under its own power and Aurel Vlaicu built and flew some of the earliest successful aircraft, while Henri Coandă discovered the Coandă effect of fluidics. Victor Babeș discovered more than 50 types of bacteria; biologist Nicolae Paulescu developed an extract of the pancreas and showed that it lowers blood sugar in diabetic dogs, thus being significant in the history of insulin; while Emil Palade received the Nobel Prize for his contributions to cell biology. Lazăr Edeleanu was the first chemist to synthesise amphetamine, and he also invented the procedure of separating valuable petroleum components with selective solvents.

During the 1990s and 2000s, the development of research was hampered by several factors, including: corruption, low funding, and a considerable brain drain. In recent years, Romania has ranked the lowest or second-lowest in the European Union by research and development spending as a percentage of GDP, standing at roughly 0.5% in 2016 and 2017, substantially below the EU average of just over 2%. The country joined the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2011, and CERN in 2016. In 2018, however, Romania lost its voting rights in the ESA due to a failure to pay €56.8 million in membership contributions to the agency.

In the early 2010s, the situation for science in Romania was characterised as &quot;rapidly improving&quot; albeit from a low base. In January 2011, Parliament passed a law that enforces &quot;strict quality control on universities and introduces tough rules for funding evaluation and peer review&quot;. Romania was ranked 48th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

The nuclear physics facility of the European Union&#x27;s proposed Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) laser will be built in Romania. In early 2012, Romania launched its first satellite from the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana. Starting in December 2014, Romania became a co-owner of the International Space Station.

==Demographics==


According to the 2021 Romanian census, Romania&#x27;s population was 19,053,815. Like other countries in the region, its population is expected to decline gradually as a result of sub-replacement fertility rates and negative net migration rate. According to the 2021 Romanian census, Romanians made up 89.33% of the population, Hungarians 6.05% and the Roma 3.44% of the population, but many ethnicities are not recorded, as they do not have ID cards. International sources give higher figures for Roma than the official census. According to the Council of Europe, the Roma makes up 8.32% of the population. Hungarians constitute a majority in the counties of Harghita and Covasna. Other minorities include Ukrainians, Germans, Turks, Lipovans, Aromanians, Tatars, and Serbs. In 1930, there were 745,421 Germans living in Romania, but only about 36,000 remained in the country to this day. , there were also approximately 133,000 immigrants living in Romania, primarily from Moldova and China.

The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2018 was estimated at 1.36 children born per woman, which is below the replacement rate of 2.1, and one of the lowest in the world, it remains considerably below the high of 5.82 children born per woman in 1912. In 2014, 31.2% of births were to unmarried women.
The birth rate (9.49‰, 2012) is much lower than the mortality rate (11.84‰, 2012), resulting in a shrinking (−0.26% per year, 2012) and aging population (median age: 41.6 years, 2018), one of the oldest populations in the world, with approximately 16.8% of total population aged 65 years and over. The life expectancy in 2015 was estimated at 74.92 years (71.46 years male, 78.59 years female).
The number of Romanians and individuals with ancestors born in Romania living abroad is estimated at 12 million. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, a significant number of Romanians emigrated to other European countries, North America or Australia. For example, in 1990, 96,919 Romanians permanently settled abroad.

=== Languages ===

The official language is Romanian, a Romance language (the most widely spoken of the Eastern Romance branch), which presents a consistent degree of similarity to Aromanian, Megleno-Romanian, and Istro-Romanian, but shares many features equally with the rest of the Western Romance languages, specifically Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan. The Romanian alphabet contains the same 26 letters of the standard Latin alphabet, as well as five additional ones (namely &quot;ă&quot;, &quot;â&quot;, &quot;î&quot;, &quot;ț&quot;, and &quot;ș&quot;), totaling 31.

Romanian is spoken as a first language by 91.55% of the entire population, while Hungarian and Vlax Romani are spoken by 6.28% and 1.20% of the population, respectively. There are also 40,861 native speakers of Ukrainian (concentrated in some compact regions near the border, where they form local majorities), 17,101 native speakers of Turkish, 15,943 native speakers of German, and 14,414 native speakers of Russian living in Romania.

According to the Constitution, local councils ensure linguistic rights to all minorities. In localities with ethnic minorities of over 20%, that minority&#x27;s language can be used in the public administration, justice system, and education. Foreign citizens and stateless persons who live in Romania have access to justice and education in their own language. English and French are the main foreign languages taught in schools. In 2010, the identified 4,756,100 French speakers in the country. According to the 2012 Eurobarometer, English is spoken by 31% of Romanians, French is spoken by 17%, and Italian and German, each by 7%.

===Religion===

Romania is a secular state and has no state religion. An overwhelming majority of the population identify themselves as Christians. At the country&#x27;s 2021 census, 73.60% of respondents identified as Orthodox Christians, with 73.42% belonging to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Other denominations include Protestantism (6.22%), Roman Catholicism (3.89%), and Greek Catholicism (0.61%). From the remaining population 128,291 people belong to other Christian denominations or have another religion, which includes 58,347 Muslims (mostly of Turkish and Tatar ethnicity) and 2,708 Jewish (Jews once constituted 4% of the Romanian population—728,115 persons in the 1930 census). Additionally, 71,430 people are irreligious, 57,229 are atheist, 25,485 are agnostic, and 2,658,165 people chose to not declare their religion.

The Romanian Orthodox Church is an autocephalous Eastern Orthodox Church in full communion with other Orthodox churches, with a Patriarch as its leader. It is the third-largest Eastern Orthodox Church in the world, and unlike other Orthodox churches, it functions within a Latin culture and uses a Romance liturgical language. Its canonical jurisdiction covers the territories of Romania and Moldova. Romania has the world&#x27;s third-largest Eastern Orthodox population.

===Urbanisation===
Although 54.0% of the population lived in urban areas in 2011, this percentage has been declining since 1996. Counties with over   urban population are Hunedoara, Brașov and Constanța, while those with less than a third are Dâmbovița (30.06%) and Giurgiu and Teleorman. Bucharest is the capital and the largest city in Romania, with a population of over 1.7 million in 2021. Its larger urban zone has a population of almost 2.2 million, which are planned to be included into a metropolitan area up to 20 times the area of the city proper.

Another 17 cities have a population of over 100,000, with Cluj-Napoca, Iași, Constanța and Timișoara of more than 250,000 inhabitants, and Craiova, Brașov and Galați with over 200,000 inhabitants. Metropolitan areas have been constituted for most of these cities.
=== Education ===


Since the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the Romanian educational system has been in a continuous process of reform that has received mixed criticism. In 2004, some 4.4 million individuals were enrolled in school. Of these, 650,000 were in kindergarten (three-six years), 3.11 million in primary and secondary level, and 650,000 in tertiary level (universities). In 2018, the adult literacy rate was 98.8%. Kindergarten is optional between three and five years. Since 2020, compulsory schooling starts at age 5 with the last year of kindergarten (grupa mare) and is compulsory until twelfth grade. Primary and secondary education is divided into 12 or 13 grades. There is also a semi-legal, informal private tutoring system used mostly during secondary school, which prospered during the Communist regime.

Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași, Babeș-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca, University of Bucharest, and West University of Timișoara have been included in the QS World University Rankings&#x27; top 800.

Romania ranks fifth in the all-time medal count at the International Mathematical Olympiad with 316 total medals, dating back to 1959. Ciprian Manolescu managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for a gold medal more times than anybody else in the history of the competition, in 1995, 1996 and 1997. Romania has achieved the highest team score in the competition, after China, Russia, the United States and Hungary. Romania also ranks sixth in the all-time medal count at the International Olympiad in Informatics with 107 total medals, dating back to 1989.

===Healthcare===
Healthcare in Romania is mainly provided by the public sector, which runs most hospitals and offers national health insurance to nearly all citizens. In 2021, healthcare costs were USD16. 7 billion, or USD2,385 per person, making up 5. 69 percent of GDP. Government spending is higher than in markets like Bulgaria but lower than Hungary. Spending is expected to rise by 7. 5 billion USD (+37. 68 percent) from 2024 to 2028, reaching 27. 3 billion USD by 2028.

The Romanian National Institute of Statistics reports over 65,000 health units in Romania, with 53,000 in urban areas and 12,000 in rural areas. There are 543 hospitals, including 488 in urban and 55 in rural areas, along with 160 other hospital-like establishments. Nearly 50% of these are large facilities with over 100 beds, while 39% are small with fewer than 50 beds. The total number of inpatient beds is 135,085, allocated mainly to psychiatry, surgery, and internal medicine among other specialties.

==Culture==


=== Arts and monuments ===


The topic of the origin of Romanian culture began to be discussed by the end of the 18th century among the Transylvanian School scholars. Several writers rose to prominence in the 19th century, including: George Coșbuc, Ioan Slavici, Mihail Kogălniceanu, Vasile Alecsandri, Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Luca Caragiale, Ion Creangă, and Mihai Eminescu, the later being considered the greatest and most influential Romanian poet, particularly for the poem &quot;Luceafărul&quot;.

In the 20th century, a number of Romanian artists and writers achieved international acclaim, including: Tristan Tzara, Marcel Janco, Mircea Eliade, Nicolae Grigorescu, Marin Preda, Liviu Rebreanu, Eugène Ionesco, Emil Cioran, and Constantin Brâncuși. Brâncuși has a sculptural ensemble in Târgu Jiu, while his sculpture &quot;Bird in Space&quot;, was auctioned in 2005 for $27.5 million. Romanian-born Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, while Banat Swabian writer Herta Müller received the 2009 Nobel Prize in Literature.

Winter holidays include the Christmas and New Year festivities during which various unique folklore dances and games are common: &quot;plugușorul&quot;, &quot;sorcova&quot;, &quot;ursul&quot;, and &quot;capra&quot;. The traditional Romanian dress that otherwise has largely fallen out of use during the 20th century, is a popular ceremonial vestment worn on these festivities, especially in rural areas. There are sacrifices of live pigs during Christmas and lambs during Easter that has required a special exemption from EU law after 2007. In the Easter, traditions such as painting the eggs are very common. On 1 March &quot;&quot; gifting is featured, which is a tradition whereby females are gifted with a type of talisman that is given for good luck.

Romanian cuisine has been influenced by Austrian and German cuisine (especially in the historical regions that had been formerly administered by the Habsburg monarchy), but also shares some similarities with other cuisines in the Balkan region such as the Greek, Bulgarian, or Serbian cuisine. &quot;Ciorbă&quot; includes a wide range of sour soups, while &#x27;, &#x27; (similar to polenta), and &quot;sarmale&quot; are featured commonly in main courses.

<doc id="25446" wikidata="Q515008" url="?curid=25446" title="Robert Chambers (publisher, born 1802)">
<text>Robert Chambers (; 10 July 1802 – 17 March 1871) was a Scottish publisher, geologist, evolutionary thinker, author and journal editor who, like his elder brother and business partner William Chambers, was highly influential in mid-19th-century scientific and political circles.

Chambers was an early phrenologist in the Edinburgh Phrenological Society. He was also the anonymous author of &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot;, which was so controversial that his authorship was not acknowledged until after his death.

==Early life==
Chambers was born in Peebles in the Scottish Borders 10 July 1802 to Jean Gibson (&quot;c&quot;. 1781–1843) and James Chambers, a cotton manufacturer. He was their second son of six children. The town had changed little in centuries. The town had old and new parts, each consisting of little more than a single street. Peebles was mainly inhabited by weavers and labourers living in thatched cottages. His father, James Chambers, made his living as a cotton manufacturer. Their slate-roofed house was built by James Chambers&#x27; father as a wedding gift for his son, and the ground floor served as the family workshop.

A small circulating library in the town, run by Alexander Elder, introduced Robert to books and developed his literary interests when he was young. Occasionally his father would buy books for the family library, and one day Robert found a complete set of the fourth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; hidden away in a chest in the attic. He eagerly read this for many years. Near the end of his life, Chambers remembered feeling &quot;a profound thankfulness that such a convenient collection of human knowledge existed, and that here it was spread out like a well-plenished table before me.&quot; Robert&#x27;s older brother, William, later recalled that for Robert, &quot;the acquisition of knowledge was with him the highest of earthly enjoyments.&quot;

Robert was sent to local schools and showed unusual literary taste and ability, though he found his schooling to be uninspiring. His education was typical for the day. The country school, directed by James Gray, taught the boys reading, writing, and, for an additional charge, arithmetic. In grammar school it was the classics—Latin and Ancient Greek, with some English composition. Boys bullied one another and the teacher administered corporal punishment in the classroom for unruly behaviour. Although uninspired by the school, Robert made up for this at the bookseller.

Both Robert and William were born with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. Their parents attempted to correct this abnormality through operations, and while William&#x27;s was successful Robert was left partially lame. So while other boys roughed it outside, Robert was content to stay indoors and study his books.

Robert surpassed his elder brother in his education, which he continued for several years beyond William&#x27;s. Robert had been destined for the ministry, but at the age of fifteen he dropped this intended career. The arrival of the power loom suddenly threatened James Chambers&#x27; cotton business, forcing him to close it down and become a draper. During this time, James began to socialise with a number of French prisoners of war on parole who were stationed in Peebles. Unfortunately, James Chambers lent these exiles a large amount of credit, and when they were abruptly transferred away he was forced to declare bankruptcy. The family moved to Edinburgh in 1813. Robert continued his education at the High School, and William became a bookseller&#x27;s apprentice. In 1818 Robert, at sixteen years old, began his own business as a bookstall-keeper on Leith Walk. At first, his entire stock consisted of some old books belonging to his father, amounting to thirteen feet of shelf space and worth no more than a few pounds. By the end of the first year the value of his stock went up to twelve pounds, and modest success came gradually.

===Early works===
While Robert built up a business, his brother William expanded his own by purchasing a home-made printing press and publishing pamphlets as well as creating his own type. Soon afterwards, Robert and William decided to join forces—with Robert writing and William printing. Their first joint venture was a magazine series called &quot;The Kaleidoscope, or Edinburgh Literary Amusement&quot;, sold for threepence. This was issued every two weeks between 6 October 1821 and 12 January 1822. It was followed by &quot;Illustrations of the Author of Waverley&quot; (1822), which offered sketches of individuals believed to have been the inspirations for some of the characters in Walter Scott&#x27;s works of fiction. The last book to be printed on William&#x27;s old press was &quot;Traditions of Edinburgh&quot; (1824), derived from Robert&#x27;s enthusiastic interest in the history and antiquities of Edinburgh. He followed this with &quot;Walks in Edinburgh&quot; (1825), &quot;Popular Rhymes of Scotland&quot; (1826) and &quot;Picture of Scotland&quot; (1826). This was followed by five volumes of Scottish history to form part of &quot;Constable&#x27;s Miscellany&quot;. In 1832 he compiled &quot;Gazetteer of Scotland&quot;.

These books gained him the approval and personal friendship of Walter Scott. After Scott&#x27;s death, Robert paid tribute to him by writing a &quot;Life of Sir Walter Scott&quot; (1832). Robert also wrote a &quot;History of the Rebellions in Scotland from 1638 to 1745&quot; (5 vols, 1828) and numerous other works on Scotland and Scottish traditions.

==Marriage==
On 7 December 1829 Robert married Anne Kirkwood, the only child of Jane and John Kirkwood. Together they had 14 children, three of whom died in infancy. Excluding these three, their children were Robert (Robert Chambers Jr.), Nina (Mrs. Frederick Lehmann, and mother of Rudolf Chambers Lehmann), Mary (Mrs. Alexander Mackenzie Edwards, mother of satirist Bob Edwards), Anne (Mrs. Dowie, mother of Ménie Muriel Dowie), Janet, Eliza (Mrs. William Overend Priestley), Amelia (Mrs. Rudolf Lehmann), James, William, Phoebe (Mrs. Zeigler), and Alice.

==W. &amp; R. Chambers==
At the beginning of 1832 Robert&#x27;s brother William Chambers started a weekly publication entitled &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Edinburgh Journal&quot;, which speedily gained a large circulation. Robert was at first only a contributor, but after 14 volumes had appeared, he became joint editor with his brother, and his collaboration contributed more perhaps than anything else to the success of the &quot;Journal&quot;. The two brothers eventually united as partners in the book publishing firm of W. &amp; R. Chambers Publishers.

At the same time Robert ran a bookshop and circulating library from 48 Hanover Street with his younger brother, James Chambers. Meanwhile, William ran his shop from 47 Broughton Street. Robert at this time was living close to the shop, at 27 Elder Street (demolished in the 1960s to improve access to Edinburgh Bus Station).

Among the other numerous works of which Robert was in whole or in part the author, the &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen&quot; (4 vols., Glasgow, 1832–1835), the &quot;Cyclopædia of English Literature&quot; (1844), the &quot;Life and Works of Robert Burns&quot; (4 vols., 1851), &quot;Ancient Sea Margins&quot; (1848), the &quot;Domestic Annals of Scotland&quot; (1859–1861) and the &quot;Book of Days&quot; (2 vols., 1862–1864) were the most important.

&quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot; (1859–1868), with Dr Andrew Findlater as editor, was carried out under the superintendence of the brothers. The &quot;Cyclopædia of English Literature&quot; contains a series of admirably selected extracts from the best authors of every period, &quot;set in a biographical and critical history of the literature itself.&quot; For the &quot;Life of Burns&quot; he made diligent and laborious original investigations, gathering many hitherto unrecorded facts from the poet&#x27;s sister, Mrs Begg, to whose benefit the whole profits of the work were generously devoted.

==&quot;Vestiges&quot;==

During the 1830s, Robert Chambers took a particularly keen interest in the then rapidly expanding field of geology, and he was elected a fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1844. Prior to this, he was elected a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1840, which connected him through correspondence to numerous scientific men. William later recalls that &quot;His mind had become occupied with speculative theories which brought him into communication with Sir Charles Bell, George Combe, his brother Dr. Andrew Combe, Dr. Neil Arnott, Professor Edward Forbes, Dr. Samuel Brown, and other thinkers on physiology and mental philosophy.&quot; In 1848 Chambers published his first geological book on &quot;Ancient Sea Margins.&quot; Later, he toured Scandinavia and Canada for the purpose of geological exploration. The results of his travels were published in &quot;Tracings of the North of Europe&quot; (1851) and &quot;Tracings in Iceland and the Faroe Islands&quot; (1856).

However, his most popular book, influenced by his geological studies and interest in speculative theories, was a work to which he never openly attached his name. In 1844, Chambers completed the dictation of his &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; to his wife, Anne Kirkwood, as he recuperated from depression at his holiday home in St Andrews. The composition of &quot;Vestiges&quot; may have served a therapeutic purpose. Chambers had been an enthusiastic phrenologist in Edinburgh in the 1830s, and the anonymously authored &quot;Vestiges&quot; became an international bestseller and a powerful public influence, subsequent to Combe&#x27;s &quot;Constitution of Man&quot; (1828), and anticipating the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Origin of Species&quot; in 1859. The first edition of &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; was released in 1844 and published anonymously. Literary anonymity was not uncommon at the time, especially in periodical journalism. However, in the science genre, anonymity was especially rare, due to the fact that science writers typically wanted to take credit for their work to claim priority for their findings.

The reason for Chambers&#x27; anonymity was clear enough as soon as one began reading the text. The book was arguing for a developmental view of the cosmos combining stellar evolution with progressive transmutation of species in the same spirit as the late Frenchman Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck had been discredited among intellectuals by this time, and evolutionary (or development) theories were exceedingly unpopular, except among political radicals, and materialists. Chambers, however, tried to explicitly distance his own theory from that of Lamarck&#x27;s by denying Lamarck&#x27;s evolutionary mechanism any plausibility. &quot;Now it is possible that wants and the exercise of faculties have entered in some manner into the production of the phenomena which we have been considering; but certainly not in the way suggested by Lamarck, whose whole notion is obviously so inadequate to account for the rise of the organic kingdoms, that we only can place it with pity among the follies of the wise.&quot; Additionally, his work was far more sweeping in scope than any of his predecessors. &quot;The book, as far as I am aware,&quot; he writes in his concluding chapter, &quot;is the first attempt to connect the natural sciences in a history of creation.&quot;

Robert Chambers was aware of the storm that would probably be raised by his treatment of the subject, and he did not wish to get his and his brother&#x27;s publishing firm involved in any kind of scandal. The arrangements for publication, therefore, were made through a friend named Alexander Ireland, of Manchester. To further prevent the possibility of any unwanted revelations, Chambers only disclosed his authorship to four people: his wife, his brother William, Ireland, and George Combe&#x27;s nephew, Robert Cox. All correspondence to and from Chambers passed through Ireland&#x27;s hands first, and all letters and manuscripts were dutifully transcribed in Mrs. Chambers&#x27; hand to prevent the possibility of anyone recognizing Robert&#x27;s handwriting.

By implying that God might not actively sustain the natural and social hierarchies, the book threatened the social order and provided ammunition to Chartists and revolutionaries. Anglican clergymen and naturalists attacked the book. The geologist Adam Sedgwick predicted &quot;ruin and confusion in such a creed&quot; which, if taken up by the working classes, &quot;will undermine the whole moral and social fabric&quot; bringing &quot;discord and deadly mischief in its train&quot;. In contrast, many Quakers and Unitarians liked the book. The Unitarian physiologist William Benjamin Carpenter called it &quot;a very beautiful and a very interesting book&quot;, and helped Chambers to correct later editions. Critics thanked God that the author began &quot;in ignorance and presumption&quot;, for the revised versions &quot;would have been much more dangerous&quot;. Nevertheless, the book caused a sensation and quickly went through a number of new editions. &quot;Vestiges&quot; brought widespread discussion of evolution out of the streets and es and into the drawing rooms of respectable men and women.

==Other activities==
Chambers gave a talk on ancient beaches at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Oxford in May 1847. An observer named Andrew Crombie Ramsay at the meeting reported that Chambers &quot;pushed his conclusions to a most unwarrantable length and got roughly handled on account of it by Buckland, De la Beche, Sedgwick, Murchison, and Lyell. The last told me afterwards that he did so purposely that [Chambers] might see that reasonings in the style of the author of the Vestiges would not be tolerated among scientific men.&quot; On the Sunday Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, used his sermon at St. Mary&#x27;s Church on &quot;the wrong way of doing science&quot; to deliver a stinging attack obviously aimed at Chambers. The church, &quot;crowded to suffocation&quot; with geologists, astronomers and zoologists, heard jibes about the &quot;half-learned&quot; seduced by the &quot;foul temptation&quot; of speculation looking for a self-sustaining universe in a &quot;mocking spirit of unbelief&quot;, showing a failure to understand the &quot;modes of the Creator&#x27;s acting&quot; or to meet the responsibilities of a gentleman. Chambers denounced this as an attempt to stifle progressive opinion, but others thought he must have gone home &quot;with the feeling of a martyr&quot;.

Near the close of autumn 1848, Chambers allowed himself to be brought forward as a candidate for the administrative position of Lord Provost of Edinburgh. The timing was especially poor, with others seeking any means possible to try and discredit his character. His adversaries found the perfect opportunity to do so in the swirling allegations that he was the author of the much reviled &quot;Vestiges&quot;. William Chambers, in his &quot;Memoir of Robert Chambers&quot;, still sworn to secrecy despite his brother&#x27;s recent passing, makes his only mention of &quot;Vestiges&quot; in connection with this affair: &quot;(Robert) might have been well assured that a rumor to the effect that he was the author of &#x27;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&#x27; would be used to his disadvantage, and that anything he might say on the subject would be unavailing.&quot; Robert withdrew his candidacy in disgust.

In 1851 Chambers was one of a group of writers who joined the publisher John Chapman in reinvigorating the &quot;Westminster Review&quot; as a flagship of free thought and reform, spreading the ideas of evolutionism.

Robert Chambers was a golfer and was elected an honorary member of the Musselburgh Golf Club (now Royal Musselburgh Golf Club) on 14 September 1833. His son, who followed him into the publishing business, was a renowned player and became Champion Golfer in 1858 as a member of Bruntsfield Links Golfing Society.

==&quot;Book of Days&quot;==

The &quot;Book of Days&quot; was Chambers&#x27;s last major publication, and perhaps his most elaborate. It was a miscellany of popular antiquities in connection with the calendar, and it is supposed that his excessive labour in connexion with this book hastened his death. Two years before, the University of St Andrews had conferred on him the degree of Doctor of Laws, and he was elected a member of the Athenaeum Club in London.

==Death==
Robert Chambers died on 17 March 1871 in St Andrews. He was buried in the Cathedral burial ground in the interior of the old Church of St. Regulus, according to his wishes. The grave lies against the southern wall of the structure attaching the roofless section, east of the tower. A memorial window was also erected to Robert by his brother William in St Giles Cathedral next to a larger window to William himself, placed at the time of his restoration of the cathedral. The pair of windows lie in the northern transept.

A year after Robert&#x27;s death, his brother William published a biography under the title &quot;Memoir of Robert Chambers; With Autobiographical Reminiscences of William Chambers&quot;. However, the book did not reveal Robert&#x27;s authorship of the &quot;Vestiges&quot;. Milton Millhauser, in his 1959 book &quot;Just Before Darwin&quot;, wrote the following about William&#x27;s memoir: &quot;The fraternal &quot;Memoir of Robert Chambers&quot; might have been an excellent biography had not the author been concerned to keep the &quot;Vestiges&quot; secret and one or two others. Despite the author&#x27;s intelligence and sympathy, such omissions inevitably produced a distorted picture&quot; (p. 191, note 7). The book contains some reminiscences by Robert of his early life, with the rest of the narration filled in by William.

Alexander Ireland, in 1884, issued a 12th edition of &quot;Vestiges&quot; with Robert Chambers finally listed as the author and a preface giving an account of its authorship. Ireland felt that there was no longer any reason for concealing the author&#x27;s name.

<doc id="25447" wikidata="Q81009" url="?curid=25447" title="Rhetoric">
<text>Rhetoric () is the art of persuasion. It is one of the three ancient arts of discourse (trivium) along with grammar and logic/dialectic. As an academic discipline within the humanities, rhetoric aims to study the techniques that speakers or writers use to inform, persuade, and motivate their audiences. Rhetoric also provides heuristics for understanding, discovering, and developing arguments for particular situations.

Aristotle defined rhetoric as &quot;the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion&quot;, and since mastery of the art was necessary for victory in a case at law, for passage of proposals in the assembly, or for fame as a speaker in civic ceremonies, he called it &quot;a combination of the science of logic and of the ethical branch of politics&quot;. Aristotle also identified three persuasive audience appeals: logos, pathos, and ethos. The five canons of rhetoric, or phases of developing a persuasive speech, were first codified in classical Rome: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.

From Ancient Greece to the late 19th century, rhetoric played a central role in Western education in training orators, lawyers, counsellors, historians, statesmen, and poets.

==Uses==

===Scope===

Scholars have debated the scope of rhetoric since ancient times. Although some have limited rhetoric to the specific realm of political discourse, to many modern scholars it encompasses every aspect of culture. Contemporary studies of rhetoric address a much more diverse range of domains than was the case in ancient times. While classical rhetoric trained speakers to be effective persuaders in public forums and in institutions such as courtrooms and assemblies, contemporary rhetoric investigates human discourse . Rhetoricians have studied the discourses of a wide variety of domains, including the natural and social sciences, fine art, religion, journalism, digital media, fiction, history, cartography, and architecture, along with the more traditional domains of politics and the law.

Because the ancient Greeks valued public political participation, rhetoric emerged as an important curriculum for those desiring to influence politics. Rhetoric is still associated with its political origins. However, even the original instructors of Western speech—the Sophists—disputed this limited view of rhetoric. According to Sophists like Gorgias, a successful rhetorician could speak convincingly on a topic in any field, regardless of his experience in that field. This suggested rhetoric could be a means of communicating any expertise, not just politics. In his &quot;Encomium to Helen&quot;, Gorgias even applied rhetoric to fiction by seeking, for his amusement, to prove the blamelessness of the mythical Helen of Troy in starting the Trojan War.

Plato defined the scope of rhetoric by discarding any connotation of religious ritual or magical incantation, simply taking the term in its literal sense, which means &quot;leading the soul&quot; through words. He criticized the Sophists for using rhetoric to deceive rather than to discover truth. In &quot;Gorgias&quot;, one of his Socratic Dialogues, Plato defines rhetoric as the persuasion of ignorant masses within the courts and assemblies. Rhetoric, in Plato&#x27;s opinion, is merely a form of flattery and functions similarly to culinary arts, which mask the undesirability of unhealthy food by making it taste good. Plato considered any speech of lengthy prose aimed at flattery as within the scope of rhetoric. Some scholars, however, contest the idea that Plato despised rhetoric and instead view his dialogues as a dramatization of complex rhetorical principles. Socrates explained the relationship between rhetoric in flattery when he maintained that a rhetorician who teaches anyone how to persuade people in an assembly to do what he wants, without knowledge of what is just or unjust, engages in a kind of flattery (&quot;kolakeia&quot;) that constitutes an image (&quot;eidolon&quot;) of a part of the art of politics.

Aristotle both redeemed rhetoric from Plato and narrowed its focus by defining three genres of rhetoric—deliberative, forensic or judicial, and epideictic. Yet, even as he provided order to existing rhetorical theories, Aristotle generalized the definition of rhetoric to be the ability to identify the appropriate means of persuasion in a given situation based upon the art of rhetoric (&quot;technê&quot;). This made rhetoric applicable to all fields, not just politics. Aristotle viewed the enthymeme based upon logic (especially, based upon the syllogism) as the basis of rhetoric.

Aristotle also outlined generic constraints that focused the rhetorical art squarely within the domain of public political practice. He restricted rhetoric to the domain of the contingent or probable: those matters that admit multiple legitimate opinions or arguments.

Since the time of Aristotle, logic has changed. For example, modal logic has undergone a major development that also modifies rhetoric.

The contemporary neo-Aristotelian and neo-Sophistic positions on rhetoric mirror the division between the Sophists and Aristotle. Neo-Aristotelians generally study rhetoric as political discourse, while the neo-Sophistic view contends that rhetoric cannot be so limited. Rhetorical scholar Michael Leff characterizes the conflict between these positions as viewing rhetoric as a &quot;thing contained&quot; versus a &quot;container&quot;. The neo-Aristotelian view threatens the study of rhetoric by restraining it to such a limited field, ignoring many critical applications of rhetorical theory, criticism, and practice. Simultaneously, the neo-Sophists threaten to expand rhetoric beyond a point of coherent theoretical value.

In more recent years, people studying rhetoric have tended to enlarge its object domain beyond speech. Kenneth Burke asserted humans use rhetoric to resolve conflicts by identifying shared characteristics and interests in symbols. People engage in identification, either to assign themselves or another to a group. This definition of rhetoric as identification broadens the scope from strategic and overt political persuasion to the more implicit tactics of identification found in an immense range of sources. Burke focused on the interplay of identification and division, maintaining that identification compensates for an original division by preventing a strict separation between objects, people, and spaces. This is achieved by assigning to them common properties through linguistic symbols.

Among the many scholars who have since pursued Burke&#x27;s line of thought, James Boyd White sees rhetoric as a broader domain of social experience in his notion of constitutive rhetoric. Influenced by theories of social construction, White argues that culture is &quot;reconstituted&quot; through language. Just as language influences people, people influence language. Language is socially constructed, and depends on the meanings people attach to it. Because language is not rigid and changes depending on the situation, the very usage of language is rhetorical. An author, White would say, is always trying to construct a new world and persuading his or her readers to share that world within the text.

People engage in rhetoric any time they speak or produce meaning. Even in the field of science, via practices which were once viewed as being merely the objective testing and reporting of knowledge, scientists persuade their audience to accept their findings by sufficiently demonstrating that their study or experiment was conducted reliably and resulted in sufficient evidence to support their conclusions.

The vast scope of rhetoric is difficult to define. Political discourse remains the paradigmatic example for studying and theorizing specific techniques and conceptions of persuasion or rhetoric.

===As a civic art===
Throughout European History, rhetoric meant persuasion in public and political settings such as assemblies and courts. Because of its associations with democratic institutions, rhetoric is commonly said to flourish in open and democratic societies with rights of free speech, free assembly, and political enfranchisement for some portion of the population. Those who classify rhetoric as a civic art believe that rhetoric has the power to shape communities, form the character of citizens, and greatly affect civic life.

Rhetoric was viewed as a civic art by several of the ancient philosophers. Aristotle and Isocrates were two of the first to see rhetoric in this light. In &quot;Antidosis&quot;, Isocrates states, &quot;We have come together and founded cities and made laws and invented arts; and, generally speaking, there is no institution devised by man which the power of speech has not helped us to establish.&quot; With this statement he argues that rhetoric is a fundamental part of civic life in every society and that it has been necessary in the foundation of all aspects of society. He further argues in &quot;Against the Sophists&quot; that rhetoric, although it cannot be taught to just anyone, is capable of shaping the character of man. He writes, &quot;I do think that the study of political discourse can help more than any other thing to stimulate and form such qualities of character.&quot; Aristotle, writing several years after Isocrates, supported many of his arguments and argued for rhetoric as a civic art.

In the words of Aristotle, in the &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, rhetoric is &quot;...the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion&quot;. According to Aristotle, this art of persuasion could be used in public settings in three different ways: &quot;A member of the assembly decides about future events, a juryman about past events: while those who merely decide on the orator&#x27;s skill are observers. From this it follows that there are three divisions of oratory—(1) political, (2) forensic, and (3) the ceremonial oratory of display&quot;. Eugene Garver, in his critique of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, confirms that Aristotle viewed rhetoric as a civic art. Garver writes, &quot;&quot;Rhetoric&quot; articulates a civic art of rhetoric, combining the almost incompatible properties of and appropriateness to citizens.&quot; Each of Aristotle&#x27;s divisions plays a role in civic life and can be used in a different way to affect the .

Because rhetoric is a public art capable of shaping opinion, some of the ancients, including Plato found fault in it. They claimed that while it could be used to improve civic life, it could be used just as easily to deceive or manipulate. The masses were incapable of analyzing or deciding anything on their own and would therefore be swayed by the most persuasive speeches. Thus, civic life could be controlled by whoever could deliver the best speech. Plato explores the problematic moral status of rhetoric twice: in &quot;Gorgias&quot; and in &quot;The Phaedrus&quot;, a dialogue best-known for its commentary on love.

More trusting in the power of rhetoric to support a republic, the Roman orator Cicero argued that art required something more than eloquence. A good orator needed also to be a good man, a person enlightened on a variety of civic topics. He describes the proper training of the orator in his major text on rhetoric, &quot;De Oratore&quot;, which he modeled on Plato&#x27;s dialogues.

Modern works continue to support the claims of the ancients that rhetoric is an art capable of influencing civic life. In &quot;Political Style&quot;, Robert Hariman claims that &quot;questions of freedom, equality, and justice often are raised and addressed through performances ranging from debates to demonstrations without loss of moral content&quot;. James Boyd White argues that rhetoric is capable not only of addressing issues of political interest but that it can influence culture as a whole. In his book, &quot;When Words Lose Their Meaning&quot;, he argues that words of persuasion and identification define community and civic life. He states that words produce &quot;the methods by which culture is maintained, criticized, and transformed&quot;.

Rhetoric remains relevant as a civic art. In speeches, as well as in non-verbal forms, rhetoric continues to be used as a tool to influence communities from local to national levels.

===As a political tool===
Political parties employ &quot;manipulative rhetoric&quot; to advance their party-line goals and lobbyist agendas. They use it to portray themselves as champions of compassion, freedom, and culture, all while implementing policies that appear to contradict these claims. It serves as a form of political propaganda, presented to sway and maintain public opinion in their favor, and garner a positive image, potentially at the expense of suppressing dissent or criticism. An example of this is the government&#x27;s actions in freezing bank accounts and regulating internet speech, ostensibly to protect the vulnerable and preserve freedom of expression, despite contradicting values and rights.

Going back to the fifth century BCE, the term rhetoric originated in Ancient Greece. During this period, a new government (democracy) had been formed and as speech was the main method of information, an effective communication strategy was needed. Sophists, a group of intellectuals from Sicily, taught the ancient Greeks the art of persuasive speech in order to be able to navigate themselves in the court and senate. This new technique was then used as an effective method of speech in political speeches and throughout government. Consequently people began to fear that persuasive speech would overpower truth. However, Aristotle argued that speech can be used to classify, study, and interpret speeches and as a useful skill. Aristotle believed that this technique was an art, and that persuasive speech could have truth and logic embedded within it. In the end, rhetoric speech still remained popular and was used by many scholars and philosophers.

===As a course of study===
The study of rhetoric trains students to speak and/or write effectively, and to critically understand and analyze discourse. It is concerned with how people use symbols, especially language, to reach agreement that permits coordinated effort.

Rhetoric as a course of study has evolved since its ancient beginnings, and has adapted to the particular exigencies of various times, venues, and applications ranging from architecture to literature. Although the curriculum has transformed in a number of ways, it has generally emphasized the study of principles and rules of composition as a means for moving audiences.

Rhetoric began as a civic art in Ancient Greece where students were trained to develop tactics of oratorical persuasion, especially in legal disputes. Rhetoric originated in a school of pre-Socratic philosophers known as the Sophists . Demosthenes and Lysias emerged as major orators during this period, and Isocrates and Gorgias as prominent teachers. Modern teachings continue to reference these rhetoricians and their work in discussions of classical rhetoric and persuasion.

Rhetoric was taught in universities during the Middle Ages as one of the three original liberal arts or trivium (along with logic and grammar). During the medieval period, political rhetoric declined as republican oratory died out and the emperors of Rome garnered increasing authority. With the rise of European monarchs, rhetoric shifted into courtly and religious applications. Augustine exerted strong influence on Christian rhetoric in the Middle Ages, advocating the use of rhetoric to lead audiences to truth and understanding, especially in the church. The study of liberal arts, he believed, contributed to rhetorical study: &quot;In the case of a keen and ardent nature, fine words will come more readily through reading and hearing the eloquent than by pursuing the rules of rhetoric.&quot; Poetry and letter writing became central to rhetorical study during the Middle Ages. After the fall of the Roman republic, poetry became a tool for rhetorical training since there were fewer opportunities for political speech. Letter writing was the primary way business was conducted both in state and church, so it became an important aspect of rhetorical education.

Rhetorical education became more restrained as style and substance separated in 16th-century France, and attention turned to the scientific method. Influential scholars like Peter Ramus argued that the processes of invention and arrangement should be elevated to the domain of philosophy, while rhetorical instruction should be chiefly concerned with the use of figures and other forms of the ornamentation of language. Scholars such as Francis Bacon developed the study of &quot;scientific rhetoric&quot; which rejected the elaborate style characteristic of classical oration. This plain language carried over to John Locke&#x27;s teaching, which emphasized concrete knowledge and steered away from ornamentation in speech, further alienating rhetorical instruction—which was identified wholly with such ornamentation—from the pursuit of knowledge.

In the 18th century, rhetoric assumed a more social role, leading to the creation of new education systems (predominantly in England): &quot;Elocution schools&quot; in which girls and women analyzed classic literature, most notably the works of William Shakespeare, and discussed pronunciation tactics.

The study of rhetoric underwent a revival with the rise of democratic institutions during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Hugh Blair was a key early leader of this movement. In his most famous work, &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot;, he advocates rhetorical study for common citizens as a resource for social success. Many American colleges and secondary schools used Blair&#x27;s text throughout the 19th century to train students of rhetoric.

Political rhetoric also underwent renewal in the wake of the U.S. and French revolutions. The rhetorical studies of ancient Greece and Rome were resurrected as speakers and teachers looked to Cicero and others to inspire defenses of the new republics. Leading rhetorical theorists included John Quincy Adams of Harvard, who advocated the democratic advancement of rhetorical art. Harvard&#x27;s founding of the Boylston Professorship of Rhetoric and Oratory sparked the growth of the study of rhetoric in colleges across the United States. Harvard&#x27;s rhetoric program drew inspiration from literary sources to guide organization and style, and studies the rhetoric used in political communication to illustrate how political figures persuade audiences. William G. Allen became the first American college professor of rhetoric, at New-York Central College, 1850–1853.

Debate clubs and lyceums also developed as forums in which common citizens could hear speakers and sharpen debate skills. The American lyceum in particular was seen as both an educational and social institution, featuring group discussions and guest lecturers. These programs cultivated democratic values and promoted active participation in political analysis.

Throughout the 20th century, rhetoric developed as a concentrated field of study, with the establishment of rhetorical courses in high schools and universities. Courses such as public speaking and speech analysis apply fundamental Greek theories (such as the modes of persuasion: , , and ) and trace rhetorical development through history. Rhetoric earned a more esteemed reputation as a field of study with the emergence of Communication Studies departments and of Rhetoric and Composition programs within English departments in universities, and in conjunction with the linguistic turn in Western philosophy. Rhetorical study has broadened in scope, and is especially used by the fields of marketing, politics, and literature.

Another area of rhetoric is the study of cultural rhetorics, which is the communication that occurs between cultures and the study of the way members of a culture communicate with each other. These ideas can then be studied and understood by other cultures, in order to bridge gaps in modes of communication and help different cultures communicate effectively with each other. James Zappen defines cultural rhetorics as the idea that rhetoric is concerned with negotiation and listening, not persuasion, which differs from ancient definitions. Some ancient rhetoric was disparaged because its persuasive techniques could be used to teach falsehoods. Communication as studied in cultural rhetorics is focused on listening and negotiation, and has little to do with persuasion.

====Canons====
Rhetorical education focused on five canons. The serve as a guide to creating persuasive messages and arguments:

; &quot;inventio&quot; (invention) : the process that leads to the development and refinement of an argument.
; &quot;dispositio&quot; (disposition, or arrangement) : used to determine how an argument should be organized for greatest effect, usually beginning with the &quot;exordium&quot;
; &quot;elocutio&quot; (style) : determining how to present the arguments
; &quot;memoria&quot; (memory) : the process of learning and memorizing the speech and persuasive messages
; &quot;pronuntiatio&quot; (presentation) and &quot;actio&quot; (delivery) : the gestures, pronunciation, tone, and pace used when presenting the persuasive arguments—the Grand Style.

Memory was added much later to the original four canons.

===Music===
During the Renaissance rhetoric enjoyed a resurgence, and as a result nearly every author who wrote about music before the Romantic era discussed rhetoric. Joachim Burmeister wrote in 1601, &quot;there is only little difference between music and the nature of oration&quot;. Christoph Bernhard in the latter half of the century said &quot;...until the art of music has attained such a height in our own day, that it may indeed be compared to a rhetoric, in view of the multitude of figures&quot;.

===Knowledge===
Epistemology and rhetoric have been compared to one another for decades, but the specifications of their similarities have gone undefined. Since scholar Robert L. Scott stated that, &quot;rhetoric is epistemic,&quot; rhetoricians and philosophers alike have struggled to concretely define the expanse of implications these words hold. Those who have identified this inconsistency maintain the idea that Scott&#x27;s relation is important, but requires further study.

The root of the issue lies in the ambiguous use of the term rhetoric itself, as well as the epistemological terms knowledge, certainty, and truth. Though counterintuitive and vague, Scott&#x27;s claims are accepted by some academics, but are then used to draw different conclusions. Sonja K. Foss, for example, takes on the view that, &quot;rhetoric creates knowledge,&quot; whereas James Herrick writes that rhetoric assists in people&#x27;s ability to form beliefs, which are defined as knowledge once they become widespread in a community.

It is unclear whether Scott holds that certainty is an inherent part of establishing knowledge, his references to the term abstract. He is not the only one, as the debate&#x27;s persistence in philosophical circles long predates his addition of rhetoric. There is an overwhelming majority that does support the concept of certainty as a requirement for knowledge, but it is at the definition of certainty where parties begin to diverge. One definition maintains that certainty is subjective and feeling-based, the other that it is a byproduct of justification.

The more commonly accepted definition of rhetoric claims it is synonymous with persuasion. For rhetorical purposes, this definition, like many others, is too broad. The same issue presents itself with definitions that are too narrow. Rhetoricians in support of the epistemic view of rhetoric have yet to agree in this regard.

Philosophical teachings refer to knowledge as a justified true belief. However, the Gettier Problem explores the room for fallacy in this concept. Therefore, the Gettier Problem impedes the effectivity of the argument of Richard A. Cherwitz and James A. Hikins, who employ the justified true belief standpoint in their argument for rhetoric as epistemic. Celeste Condit Railsback takes a different approach, drawing from Ray E. McKerrow&#x27;s system of belief based on validity rather than certainty.

William D. Harpine refers to the issue of unclear definitions that occurs in the theories of &quot;rhetoric is epistemic&quot; in his 2004 article &quot;What Do You Mean, Rhetoric is Epistemic?&quot;. In it, he focuses on uncovering the most appropriate definitions for the terms &quot;rhetoric&quot;, &quot;knowledge&quot;, and &quot;certainty&quot;. According to Harpine, certainty is either objective or subjective. Although both Scotts and Cherwitz and Hikins theories deal with some form of certainty, Harpine believes that knowledge is not required to be neither objectively nor subjectively certain. In terms of &quot;rhetoric&quot;, Harpine argues that the definition of rhetoric as &quot;the art of persuasion&quot; is the best choice in the context of this theoretical approach of rhetoric as epistemic. Harpine then proceeds to present two methods of approaching the idea of rhetoric as epistemic based on the definitions presented. One centers on Alston&#x27;s view that one&#x27;s beliefs are justified if formed by one&#x27;s normal doxastic while the other focuses on the causal theory of knowledge. Both approaches manage to avoid Gettier&#x27;s problems and do not rely on unclear conceptions of certainty.

In the discussion of rhetoric and epistemology, comes the question of ethics. Is it ethical for rhetoric to present itself in the branch of knowledge? Scott rears this question, addressing the issue, not with ambiguity in the definitions of other terms, but against subjectivity regarding certainty. Ultimately, according to Thomas O. Sloane, rhetoric and epistemology exist as counterparts, working towards the same purpose of establishing knowledge, with the common enemy of subjective certainty.

==History and development==
Rhetoric is a persuasive speech that holds people to a common purpose and therefore facilitates collective action. During the fifth century BCE, Athens had become active in metropolis and people all over there. During this time the Greek city state had been experimenting with a new form of government – democracy, &quot;demos&quot;, &quot;the people&quot;. Political and cultural identity had been tied to the city area – the citizens of Athens formed institutions to the red processes: are the Senate, jury trials, and forms of public discussions, but people needed to learn how to navigate these new institutions. With no forms of passing on the information, other than word of mouth the Athenians needed an effective strategy to inform the people. A group of wandering Sicilian&#x27;s later known as the Sophists, began teaching the Athenians persuasive speech, with the goal of navigating the courts and senate. The sophists became speech teachers known as &quot;Sophia;&quot; Greek for &quot;wisdom&quot; and root for philosophy, or &quot;love of wisdom&quot; – the sophists came to be common term for someone who sold wisdom for money. Although there is no clear understanding why the Sicilians engaged to educating the Athenians persuasive speech. It is known that the Athenians did, indeed rely on persuasive speech, more during public speak, and four new political processes, also increasing the sophists trainings leading too many victories for legal cases, public debate, and even a simple persuasive speech. This ultimately led to concerns rising on falsehood over truth, with highly trained, persuasive speakers, knowingly, misinforming.

Rhetoric has its origins in Mesopotamia. Some of the earliest examples of rhetoric can be found in the Akkadian writings of the princess and priestess Enheduanna (). As the first named author in history, Enheduanna&#x27;s writing exhibits numerous rhetorical features that would later become canon in Ancient Greece. Enheduanna&#x27;s &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna,&quot; includes an exordium, argument, and peroration, as well as elements of , , and , and repetition and metonymy. She is also known for describing her process of invention in &quot;The Exaltation of Inanna,&quot; moving between first- and third-person address to relate her composing process in collaboration with the goddess Inanna, reflecting a mystical enthymeme in drawing upon a Cosmic audience.

Later examples of early rhetoric can be found in the Neo-Assyrian Empire during the time of Sennacherib ().

In ancient Egypt, rhetoric had existed since at least the Middle Kingdom period (). The five canons of eloquence in ancient Egyptian rhetoric were silence, timing, restraint, fluency, and truthfulness. The Egyptians held eloquent speaking in high esteem. Egyptian rules of rhetoric specified that &quot;knowing when not to speak is essential, and very respected, rhetorical knowledge&quot;, making rhetoric a &quot;balance between eloquence and wise silence&quot;. They also emphasized &quot;adherence to social behaviors that support a conservative status quo&quot; and they held that &quot;skilled speech should support, not question, society&quot;.

In ancient China, rhetoric dates back to the Chinese philosopher, Confucius (). The tradition of Confucianism emphasized the use of eloquence in speaking.

The use of rhetoric can also be found in the ancient Biblical tradition.

===Ancient Greece===
In Europe, organized thought about public speaking began in ancient Greece.

In ancient Greece, the earliest mention of oratorical skill occurs in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, in which heroes like Achilles, Hector, and Odysseus were honored for their ability to advise and exhort their peers and followers (the or army) to wise and appropriate action. With the rise of the democratic , speaking skill was adapted to the needs of the public and political life of cities in ancient Greece. Greek citizens used oratory to make political and judicial decisions, and to develop and disseminate philosophical ideas. For modern students, it can be difficult to remember that the wide use and availability of written texts is a phenomenon that was just coming into vogue in Classical Greece. In Classical times, many of the great thinkers and political leaders performed their works before an audience, usually in the context of a competition or contest for fame, political influence, and cultural capital. In fact, many of them are known only through the texts that their students, followers, or detractors wrote down. was the Greek term for &quot;orator&quot;: A was a citizen who regularly addressed juries and political assemblies and who was thus understood to have gained some knowledge about public speaking in the process, though in general facility with language was often referred to as , &quot;skill with arguments&quot; or &quot;verbal artistry&quot;.

Possibly the first study about the power of language may be attributed to the philosopher Empedocles (d. ), whose theories on human knowledge would provide a basis for many future rhetoricians. The first written manual is attributed to Corax and his pupil Tisias. Their work, as well as that of many of the early rhetoricians, grew out of the courts of law; Tisias, for example, is believed to have written judicial speeches that others delivered in the courts.

Rhetoric evolved as an important art, one that provided the orator with the forms, means, and strategies for persuading an audience of the correctness of the orator&#x27;s arguments. Today the term &quot;rhetoric&quot; can be used at times to refer only to the form of argumentation, often with the pejorative connotation that rhetoric is a means of obscuring the truth. Classical philosophers believed quite the contrary: the skilled use of rhetoric was essential to the discovery of truths, because it provided the means of ordering and clarifying arguments.

====Sophists====
Teaching in oratory was popularized in by itinerant teachers known as sophists, the best known of whom were Protagoras (), Gorgias (), and Isocrates (). Aspasia of Miletus is believed to be one of the first women to engage in private and public rhetorical activities as a Sophist. The Sophists were a disparate group who travelled from city to city, teaching in public places to attract students and offer them an education. Their central focus was on , or what we might broadly refer to as discourse, its functions and powers. They defined parts of speech, analyzed poetry, parsed close synonyms, invented argumentation strategies, and debated the nature of reality. They claimed to make their students better, or, in other words, to teach virtue. They thus claimed that human excellence was not an accident of fate or a prerogative of noble birth, but an art or &quot;&quot; that could be taught and learned. They were thus among the first humanists.

Several Sophists also questioned received wisdom about the gods and the Greek culture, which they believed was taken for granted by Greeks of their time, making these Sophists among the first agnostics. For example, some argued that cultural practices were a function of convention or rather than blood or birth or . They argued further that the morality or immorality of any action could not be judged outside of the cultural context within which it occurred. The well-known phrase, &quot;Man is the measure of all things&quot; arises from this belief. One of the Sophists&#x27; most famous, and infamous, doctrines has to do with probability and counter arguments. They taught that every argument could be countered with an opposing argument, that an argument&#x27;s effectiveness derived from how &quot;likely&quot; it appeared to the audience (its probability of seeming true), and that any probability argument could be countered with an inverted probability argument. Thus, if it seemed likely that a strong, poor man were guilty of robbing a rich, weak man, the strong poor man could argue, on the contrary, that this very likelihood (that he would be a suspect) makes it unlikely that he committed the crime, since he would most likely be apprehended for the crime. They also taught and were known for their ability to make the weaker (or worse) argument the stronger (or better). Aristophanes famously parodies the clever inversions that sophists were known for in his play &quot;The Clouds&quot;.

The word &quot;sophistry&quot; developed negative connotations in ancient Greece that continue today, but in ancient Greece, Sophists were popular and well-paid professionals, respected for their abilities and also criticized for their excesses.

According to William Keith and Christian Lundberg, as the Greek society shifted towards more democratic values, the Sophists were responsible for teaching the newly democratic Greek society the importance of persuasive speech and strategic communication for its new governmental institutions.

====Isocrates====
Isocrates (), like the Sophists, taught public speaking as a means of human improvement, but he worked to distinguish himself from the Sophists, whom he saw as claiming far more than they could deliver. He suggested that while an art of virtue or excellence did exist, it was only one piece, and the least, in a process of self-improvement that relied much more on native talent, desire, constant practice, and the imitation of good models. Isocrates believed that practice in speaking publicly about noble themes and important questions would improve the character of both speaker and audience while also offering the best service to a city. Isocrates was an outspoken champion of rhetoric as a mode of civic engagement. He thus wrote his speeches as &quot;models&quot; for his students to imitate in the same way that poets might imitate Homer or Hesiod, seeking to inspire in them a desire to attain fame through civic leadership. His was the first permanent school in Athens and it is likely that Plato&#x27;s Academy and Aristotle&#x27;s Lyceum were founded in part as a response to Isocrates. Though he left no handbooks, his speeches (&quot;Antidosis&quot; and &quot;Against the Sophists&quot; are most relevant to students of rhetoric) became models of oratory and keys to his entire educational program. He was one of the canonical &quot;Ten Attic Orators&quot;. He influenced Cicero and Quintilian, and through them, the entire educational system of the west.

====Plato====

Plato () outlined the differences between true and false rhetoric in a number of dialogues—particularly the &quot;Gorgias&quot; and &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, dialogues in which Plato disputes the sophistic notion that the art of persuasion (the Sophists&#x27; art, which he calls &quot;rhetoric&quot;), can exist independent of the art of dialectic. Plato claims that since Sophists appeal only to what seems probable, they are not advancing their students and audiences, but simply flattering them with what they want to hear. While Plato&#x27;s condemnation of rhetoric is clear in the &quot;Gorgias&quot;, in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot; he suggests the possibility of a true art wherein rhetoric is based upon the knowledge produced by dialectic. He relies on a dialectically informed rhetoric to appeal to the main character, Phaedrus, to take up philosophy. Thus Plato&#x27;s rhetoric is actually dialectic (or philosophy) &quot;turned&quot; toward those who are not yet philosophers and are thus unready to pursue dialectic directly. Plato&#x27;s animosity against rhetoric, and against the Sophists, derives not only from their inflated claims to teach virtue and their reliance on appearances, but from the fact that his teacher, Socrates, was sentenced to death after Sophists&#x27; efforts.

Some scholars, however, see Plato not as an opponent of rhetoric but rather as a nuanced rhetorical theorist who dramatized rhetorical practice in his dialogues and imagined rhetoric as more than just oratory.

==== Aristotle ====

Aristotle: Rhetoric is an antistrophes to dialectic. &quot;Let rhetoric [be defined as] an ability [dynamis], in each [particular] case, to see the available means of persuasion.&quot; &quot;Rhetoric is a counterpart of dialectic&quot; — an art of practical civic reasoning, applied to deliberative, judicial, and &quot;display&quot; speeches in political assemblies, lawcourts, and other public gatherings.

Aristotle () was a student of Plato who set forth an extended treatise on rhetoric that still repays careful study today. In the first sentence of &quot;The Art of Rhetoric&quot;, Aristotle says that &quot;rhetoric is the of dialectic&quot;. As the &quot; of a Greek ode responds to and is patterned after the structure of the &quot; (they form two sections of the whole and are sung by two parts of the chorus), so the art of rhetoric follows and is structurally patterned after the art of dialectic because both are arts of discourse production. While dialectical methods are necessary to find truth in theoretical matters, rhetorical methods are required in practical matters such as adjudicating somebody&#x27;s guilt or innocence when charged in a court of law, or adjudicating a prudent course of action to be taken in a deliberative assembly.

For Plato and Aristotle, dialectic involves persuasion, so when Aristotle says that rhetoric is the of dialectic, he means that rhetoric as he uses the term has a domain or scope of application that is parallel to, but different from, the domain or scope of application of dialectic. Claude Pavur explains that &quot;[t]he Greek prefix &#x27;anti&#x27; does not merely designate opposition, but it can also mean &#x27;in place of&#x27;&quot;.

Aristotle&#x27;s treatise on rhetoric systematically describes civic rhetoric as a human art or skill (). It is more of than it is an interpretive theory with a rhetorical tradition. Aristotle&#x27;s art of rhetoric emphasizes persuasion as the purpose of rhetoric. His definition of rhetoric as &quot;the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion&quot;, essentially a mode of discovery, limits the art to the inventional process; Aristotle emphasizes the logical aspect of this process. A speaker supports the probability of a message by logical, ethical, and emotional proofs.

Aristotle identifies three steps or &quot;offices&quot; of rhetoric—invention, arrangement, and style—and three different types of rhetorical proof:
; : Aristotle&#x27;s theory of character and how the character and credibility of a speaker can influence an audience to consider him/her to be believable—there being three qualities that contribute to a credible ethos: perceived intelligence, virtuous character, and goodwill
; : the use of emotional appeals to alter the audience&#x27;s judgment through metaphor, amplification, storytelling, or presenting the topic in a way that evokes strong emotions in the audience
; : the use of reasoning, either inductive or deductive, to construct an argument

Aristotle emphasized &quot;enthymematic reasoning&quot; as central to the process of rhetorical invention, though later rhetorical theorists placed much less emphasis on it. An &quot;enthymeme&quot; follows the form of a syllogism, however it excludes either the major or minor premise. An enthymeme is persuasive because the audience provides the missing premise. Because the audience participates in providing the missing premise, they are more likely to be persuaded by the message.

Aristotle identified three different types or genres of civic rhetoric:
; Forensic (also known as judicial) : concerned with determining the truth or falseness of events that took place in the past and issues of guilt—for example, in a courtroom
; Deliberative (also known as political) : concerned with determining whether or not particular actions should or should not be taken in the future—for example, making laws
; Epideictic (also known as ceremonial) : concerned with praise and blame, values, right and wrong, demonstrating beauty and skill in the present—for example, a eulogy or a wedding toast

Another Aristotelian doctrine was the idea of topics (also referred to as common topics or commonplaces). Though the term had a wide range of application (as a memory technique or compositional exercise, for example) it most often referred to the &quot;seats of argument&quot;—the list of categories of thought or modes of reasoning—that a speaker could use to generate arguments or proofs. The topics were thus a heuristic or inventional tool designed to help speakers categorize and thus better retain and apply frequently used types of argument. For example, since we often see effects as &quot;like&quot; their causes, one way to invent an argument (about a future effect) is by discussing the cause (which it will be &quot;like&quot;). This and other rhetorical topics derive from Aristotle&#x27;s belief that there are certain predictable ways in which humans (particularly non-specialists) draw conclusions from premises. Based upon and adapted from his dialectical Topics, the rhetorical topics became a central feature of later rhetorical theorizing, most famously in Cicero&#x27;s work of that name.

===India===

&quot;India&#x27;s Struggle for Independence&quot; offers a vivid description of the culture that sprang up around the newspaper in village India of the early 1870s:
This reading and discussion was the focal point of origin of the modern Indian rhetorical movement. Much before this, ancients such as Kautilya, Birbal, and the like indulged in a great deal of discussion and persuasion.

Keith Lloyd argued that much of the recital of the Vedas can be likened to the recital of ancient Greek poetry. Lloyd proposed including the &quot;Nyāya Sūtras&quot; in the field of rhetorical studies, exploring its methods within their historical context, comparing its approach to the traditional logical syllogism, and relating it to modern perspectives of Stephen Toulmin, Kenneth Burke, and Chaim Perelman.

 is a Sanskrit word which means &quot;just&quot; or &quot;right&quot; and refers to &quot;the science of right and wrong reasoning&quot;.
 is also a Sanskrit word which means string or thread. Here sutra refers to a collection of aphorism in the form of a manual. Each sutra is a short rule usually consisted of one or two sentences. An example of a sutra is: &quot;Reality is truth, and what is true is so, irrespective of whether we know it is, or are aware of that truth.&quot; The &quot;Nyāya Sūtras&quot; is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Aksapada Gautama. It is the foundational text of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy. It is estimated that the text was composed between and . The text may have been composed by more than one author, over a period of time. Radhakrishan and Moore placed its origin in the &quot;though some of the contents of the Nyaya Sutra are certainly a post-Christian era&quot;. The ancient school of Nyaya extended over a period of one thousand years, beginning with Gautama about and ending with Vatsyayana about .

Nyaya provides insight into Indian rhetoric. Nyaya presents an argumentative approach with which a rhetor can decide about any argument. In addition, it proposes an approach to thinking about cultural tradition which is different from Western rhetoric. Whereas Toulmin emphasizes the situational dimension of argumentative genre as the fundamental component of any rhetorical logic; Nyaya views this situational rhetoric .

Some of India&#x27;s famous rhetors include Kabir Das, Rahim Das, Chanakya, and Chandragupt Maurya.

===Rome===

====Cicero====

For the Romans, oration became an important part of public life. Cicero () was chief among Roman rhetoricians and remains the best known ancient orator and the only orator who both spoke in public and produced treatises on the subject. &quot;Rhetorica ad Herennium&quot;, formerly attributed to Cicero but now considered to be of unknown authorship, is one of the most significant works on rhetoric and is still widely used as a reference today. It is an extensive reference on the use of rhetoric, and in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it achieved wide publication as an advanced school text on rhetoric.

Cicero charted a middle path between the competing Attic and Asiatic styles to become considered second only to Demosthenes among history&#x27;s orators. His works include the early and very influential &quot;De Inventione&quot; (On Invention, often read alongside &quot;Ad Herennium&quot; as the two basic texts of rhetorical theory throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance), &quot;De Oratore&quot; (a fuller statement of rhetorical principles in dialogue form), &quot;Topics&quot; (a rhetorical treatment of common topics, highly influential through the Renaissance), &quot;Brutus&quot; (a discussion of famous orators), and &quot;Orator&quot; (a defense of Cicero&#x27;s style). Cicero also left a large body of speeches and letters which would establish the outlines of Latin eloquence and style for generations.

The rediscovery of Cicero&#x27;s speeches (such as the defense of Archias) and letters (to Atticus) by Italians like Petrarch helped to ignite the Renaissance.

Cicero championed the learning of Greek (and Greek rhetoric), contributed to Roman ethics, linguistics, philosophy, and politics, and emphasized the importance of all forms of appeal (emotion, humor, stylistic range, irony, and digression in addition to pure reasoning) in oratory. But perhaps his most significant contribution to subsequent rhetoric, and education in general, was his argument that orators learn not only about the specifics of their case (the &quot;hypothesis&quot;) but also about the general questions from which they derived (the &quot;theses&quot;). Thus, in giving a speech in defense of a poet whose Roman citizenship had been questioned, the orator should examine not only the specifics of that poet&#x27;s civic status, he should also examine the role and value of poetry and of literature more generally in Roman culture and political life. The orator, said Cicero, needed to be knowledgeable about all areas of human life and culture, including law, politics, history, literature, ethics, warfare, medicine, and even arithmetic and geometry. Cicero gave rise to the idea that the &quot;ideal orator&quot; be well-versed in all branches of learning: an idea that was rendered as &quot;liberal humanism&quot;, and that lives on today in liberal arts or general education requirements in colleges and universities around the world.

====Quintilian====


Quintilian () began his career as a pleader in the courts of law; his reputation grew so great that Vespasian created a chair of rhetoric for him in Rome. The culmination of his life&#x27;s work was the &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; (&quot;Institutes of Oratory,&quot; or alternatively, &quot;The Orator&#x27;s Education&quot;), a lengthy treatise on the training of the orator, in which he discusses the training of the &quot;perfect&quot; orator from birth to old age and, in the process, reviews the doctrines and opinions of many influential rhetoricians who preceded him.

In the &quot;Institutes&quot;, Quintilian organizes rhetorical study through the stages of education that an aspiring orator would undergo, beginning with the selection of a nurse. Aspects of elementary education (training in reading and writing, grammar, and literary criticism) are followed by preliminary rhetorical exercises in composition (the ) that include maxims and fables, narratives and comparisons, and finally full legal or political speeches. The delivery of speeches within the context of education or for entertainment purposes became widespread and popular under the term &quot;declamation&quot;.

This work was available only in fragments in medieval times, but the discovery of a complete copy at the Abbey of St. Gall in 1416 led to its emergence as one of the most influential works on rhetoric during the Renaissance.

Quintilian&#x27;s work describes not just the art of rhetoric, but the formation of the perfect orator as a politically active, virtuous, publicly minded citizen. His emphasis was on the ethical application of rhetorical training, in part in reaction against the tendency in Roman schools toward standardization of themes and techniques. At the same time that rhetoric was becoming divorced from political decision making, rhetoric rose as a culturally vibrant and important mode of entertainment and cultural criticism in a movement known as the &quot;Second Sophistic&quot;, a development that gave rise to the charge (made by Quintilian and others) that teachers were emphasizing style over substance in rhetoric.

===Medieval to Enlightenment===
After the breakup of the western Roman Empire, the study of rhetoric continued to be central to the study of the verbal arts. However the study of the verbal arts went into decline for several centuries, followed eventually by a gradual rise in formal education, culminating in the rise of medieval universities. Rhetoric transmuted during this period into the arts of letter writing () and sermon writing (). As part of the , rhetoric was secondary to the study of logic, and its study was highly scholastic: students were given repetitive exercises in the creation of discourses on historical subjects () or on classic legal questions ().

Although he is not commonly regarded as a rhetorician, St. Augustine (354–430) was trained in rhetoric and was at one time a professor of Latin rhetoric in Milan. After his conversion to Christianity, he became interested in using these &quot;pagan&quot; arts for spreading his religion. He explores this new use of rhetoric in &quot;De doctrina Christiana&quot;, which laid the foundation of what would become homiletics, the rhetoric of the sermon. Augustine asks why &quot;the power of eloquence, which is so efficacious in pleading either for the erroneous cause or the right&quot;, should not be used for righteous purposes.

One early concern of the medieval Christian church was its attitude to classical rhetoric itself. Jerome (d. 420) complained, &quot;What has Horace to do with the Psalms, Virgil with the Gospels, Cicero with the Apostles?&quot; Augustine is also remembered for arguing for the preservation of pagan works and fostering a church tradition that led to conservation of numerous pre-Christian rhetorical writings.

Rhetoric would not regain its classical heights until the Renaissance, but new writings did advance rhetorical thought. Boethius (–524), in his brief &quot;Overview of the Structure of Rhetoric&quot;, continues Aristotle&#x27;s taxonomy by placing rhetoric in subordination to philosophical argument or dialectic. The introduction of Arab scholarship from European relations with the Muslim empire (in particular Al-Andalus) renewed interest in Aristotle and Classical thought in general, leading to what some historians call the 12th century Renaissance. A number of medieval grammars and studies of poetry and rhetoric appeared.

Late medieval rhetorical writings include those of St. Thomas Aquinas (–1274), Matthew of Vendôme (&quot;Ars Versificatoria&quot;, ), and Geoffrey of Vinsauf (&quot;Poetria Nova&quot;, 1200–1216). Pre-modern female rhetoricians, outside of Socrates&#x27; friend Aspasia, are rare; but medieval rhetoric produced by women either in religious orders, such as Julian of Norwich (d. 1415), or the very well-connected Christine de Pizan (–), did occur although it was not always recorded in writing.

In his 1943 Cambridge University doctoral dissertation in English, Canadian Marshall McLuhan (1911–1980) surveys the verbal arts from approximately the time of Cicero down to the time of Thomas Nashe (1567–). His dissertation is still noteworthy for undertaking to study the history of the verbal arts together as the trivium, even though the developments that he surveys have been studied in greater detail since he undertook his study. As noted below, McLuhan became one of the most widely publicized communication theorists of the 20th century.

Another interesting record of medieval rhetorical thought can be seen in the many animal debate poems popular in England and the continent during the Middle Ages, such as &quot;The Owl and the Nightingale&quot; (13th century) and Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Parliament of Fowls&quot;.

===Sixteenth century===
Renaissance humanism defined itself broadly as disfavoring medieval scholastic logic and dialectic and as favoring instead the study of classical Latin style and grammar and philology and rhetoric.

One influential figure in the rebirth of interest in classical rhetoric was Erasmus (–1536). His 1512 work, &quot;De Duplici Copia Verborum et Rerum&quot; (also known as &quot;&quot;), was widely published (it went through more than 150 editions throughout Europe) and became one of the basic school texts on the subject. Its treatment of rhetoric is less comprehensive than the classic works of antiquity, but provides a traditional treatment of (matter and form). Its first book treats the subject of , showing the student how to use schemes and tropes; the second book covers . Much of the emphasis is on abundance of variation ( means &quot;plenty&quot; or &quot;abundance&quot;, as in copious or cornucopia), so both books focus on ways to introduce the maximum amount of variety into discourse. For instance, in one section of the &quot;De Copia&quot;, Erasmus presents two hundred variations of the sentence &quot;Always, as long as I live, I shall remember you&quot; (&quot;&quot;) Another of his works, the extremely popular &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot;, also had considerable influence on the teaching of rhetoric in the later 16th century. Its orations in favour of qualities such as madness spawned a type of exercise popular in Elizabethan grammar schools, later called adoxography, which required pupils to compose passages in praise of useless things.

Juan Luis Vives (1492–1540) also helped shape the study of rhetoric in England. A Spaniard, he was appointed in 1523 to the Lectureship of Rhetoric at Oxford by Cardinal Wolsey, and was entrusted by Henry VIII to be one of the tutors of Mary. Vives fell into disfavor when Henry VIII divorced Catherine of Aragon and left England in 1528. His best-known work was a book on education, &#x27;, published in 1531, and his writings on rhetoric included &#x27; (1533), &#x27; (1533), and a treatise on letter writing, &#x27; (1536).

It is likely that many well-known English writers were exposed to the works of Erasmus and Vives (as well as those of the Classical rhetoricians) in their schooling, which was conducted in Latin (not English), often included some study of Greek, and placed considerable emphasis on rhetoric.

The mid-16th century saw the rise of vernacular rhetorics—those written in English rather than in the Classical languages. Adoption of works in English was slow, however, due to the strong scholastic orientation toward Latin and Greek. Leonard Cox&#x27;s &quot;The Art or Crafte of Rhetoryke&quot; (; second edition published in 1532) is the earliest text on rhetorics in English; it was, for the most part, a translation of the work of Philipp Melanchthon. Thomas Wilson&#x27;s &#x27; (1553) presents a traditional treatment of rhetoric, for instance, the standard five canons of rhetoric. Other notable works included Angel Day&#x27;s &#x27; (1586, 1592), George Puttenham&#x27;s &#x27; (1589), and Richard Rainholde&#x27;s &#x27; (1563).

During this same period, a movement began that would change the organization of the school curriculum in Protestant and especially Puritan circles and that led to rhetoric losing its central place. A French scholar, Petrus Ramus (1515–1572), dissatisfied with what he saw as the overly broad and redundant organization of the trivium, proposed a new curriculum. In his scheme of things, the five components of rhetoric no longer lived under the common heading of rhetoric. Instead, invention and disposition were determined to fall exclusively under the heading of dialectic, while style, delivery, and memory were all that remained for rhetoric. Ramus was martyred during the French Wars of Religion. His teachings, seen as inimical to Catholicism, were short-lived in France but found a fertile ground in the Netherlands, Germany, and England.

One of Ramus&#x27; French followers, Audomarus Talaeus (Omer Talon) published his rhetoric, &quot;Institutiones Oratoriae&quot;, in 1544. This work emphasized style, and became so popular that it was mentioned in John Brinsley&#x27;s (1612) &quot;; &quot; as being the &quot;&quot;. Many other Ramist rhetorics followed in the next half-century, and by the 17th century, their approach became the primary method of teaching rhetoric in Protestant and especially Puritan circles. John Milton (1608–1674) wrote a textbook in logic or dialectic in Latin based on Ramus&#x27; work.

Ramism could not exert any influence on the established Catholic schools and universities, which remained loyal to Scholasticism, or on the new Catholic schools and universities founded by members of the Society of Jesus or the Oratorians, as can be seen in the Jesuit curriculum (in use up to the 19th century across the Christian world) known as the . If the influence of Cicero and Quintilian permeates the , it is through the lenses of devotion and the militancy of the Counter-Reformation. The was indeed imbued with a sense of the divine, of the incarnate logos, that is of rhetoric as an eloquent and humane means to reach further devotion and further action in the Christian city, which was absent from Ramist formalism. The Ratio is, in rhetoric, the answer to Ignatius Loyola&#x27;s practice, in devotion, of &quot;spiritual exercises&quot;. This complex oratorical-prayer system is absent from Ramism.

===Seventeenth century===
In New England and at Harvard College (founded 1636), Ramus and his followers dominated. However, in England, several writers influenced the course of rhetoric during the 17th century, many of them carrying forward the dichotomy that had been set forth by Ramus and his followers during the preceding decades. This century also saw the development of a modern, vernacular style that looked to English, rather than to Greek, Latin, or French models.

Francis Bacon (1561–1626), although not a rhetorician, contributed to the field in his writings. One of the concerns of the age was to find a suitable style for the discussion of scientific topics, which needed above all a clear exposition of facts and arguments, rather than an ornate style. Bacon in his &quot;The Advancement of Learning&quot; criticized those who are preoccupied with style rather than &quot;the weight of matter, worth of subject, soundness of argument, life of invention, or depth of judgment&quot;. On matters of style, he proposed that the style conform to the subject matter and to the audience, that simple words be employed whenever possible, and that the style should be agreeable.

Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) also wrote on rhetoric. Along with a shortened translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Hobbes also produced a number of other works on the subject. Sharply contrarian on many subjects, Hobbes, like Bacon, also promoted a simpler and more natural style that used figures of speech sparingly.

Perhaps the most influential development in English style came out of the work of the Royal Society (founded in 1660), which in 1664 set up a committee to improve the English language. Among the committee&#x27;s members were John Evelyn (1620–1706), Thomas Sprat (1635–1713), and John Dryden (1631–1700). Sprat regarded &quot;fine speaking&quot; as a disease, and thought that a proper style should &quot;reject all amplifications, digressions, and swellings of style&quot; and instead &quot;return back to a primitive purity and shortness&quot;.

While the work of this committee never went beyond planning, John Dryden is often credited with creating and exemplifying a new and modern English style. His central tenet was that the style should be proper &quot;to the occasion, the subject, and the persons&quot;. As such, he advocated the use of English words whenever possible instead of foreign ones, as well as vernacular, rather than Latinate, syntax. His own prose (and his poetry) became exemplars of this new style.

===Eighteenth century===
Arguably one of the most influential schools of rhetoric during the 18th century was Scottish Belletristic rhetoric, exemplified by such professors of rhetoric as Hugh Blair whose &quot;Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres&quot; saw international success in various editions and translations, and Lord Kames with his influential &quot;Elements of Criticism&quot;.

Another notable figure in 18th century rhetoric was Maria Edgeworth, a novelist and children&#x27;s author whose work often parodied the male-centric rhetorical strategies of her time. In her 1795 &quot;An Essay on the Noble Science of Self-Justification,&quot; Edgeworth presents a satire of Enlightenment rhetoric&#x27;s science-centrism and the Belletristic Movement. She was called &quot;the great Maria&quot; by Sir Walter Scott, with whom she corresponded, and by modern scholars is noted as &quot;a transgressive and ironic reader&quot; of the 18th century rhetorical norms.

== Modern ==
At the turn of the 20th century, there was a revival of rhetorical study manifested in the establishment of departments of rhetoric and speech at academic institutions, as well as the formation of national and international professional organizations. The early interest in rhetorical studies was a movement away from elocution as taught in English departments in the United States, and an attempt to refocus rhetorical studies from delivery-only to civic engagement and a &quot;rich complexity&quot; of the nature of rhetoric.

By the 1930s, advances in mass media technology led to a revival of the study of rhetoric, language, persuasion, and political rhetoric and its consequences. The linguistic turn in philosophy also contributed to this revival. The term rhetoric came to be applied to media forms other than verbal language, e.g. visual rhetoric, &quot;temporal rhetorics&quot;, and the &quot;temporal turn&quot; in rhetorical theory and practice.

The rise of advertising and of mass media such as photography, telegraphy, radio, and film brought rhetoric more prominently into people&#x27;s lives. The discipline of rhetoric has been used to study how advertising persuades, and to help understand the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories on social media.

=== Notable theorists ===
; Kenneth Burke : Burke was a rhetorical theorist, philosopher, and poet. Many of his works are central to modern rhetorical theory: &quot;Counterstatement&quot; (1931), &quot;A Grammar of Motives&quot; (1945), &quot;A Rhetoric of Motives&quot; (1950), and &quot;Language as Symbolic Action&quot; (1966). Among his influential concepts are &quot;identification&quot;, &quot;consubstantiality&quot;, and the &quot;dramatistic pentad&quot;. He described rhetoric as &quot;the use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in beings that by nature respond to symbols&quot;. In relation to Aristotle&#x27;s theory, Aristotle was more interested in constructing rhetoric, while Burke was interested in &quot;debunking&quot; it.
; The Groupe μ : This interdisciplinary team contributed to the renovation of the in the context of poetics and modern linguistics, significantly with &quot;Rhétorique générale&quot; and &quot;Rhétorique de la poésie&quot; (1977).
; Marshall McLuhan : McLuhan was a media theorist whose theories and whose choice of objects of study are important to the study of rhetoric. McLuhan&#x27;s book &quot;The Mechanical Bride&quot; was a compilation of exhibits of ads and other materials from popular culture with short essays involving rhetorical analyses of the persuasive strategies in each item. McLuhan later shifted the focus of his rhetorical analysis and began to consider how communication media themselves affect us as persuasive devices. His famous dictum &quot;the medium is the message&quot; highlights the significance of the medium itself. This shift in focus led to his two most widely known books, &quot;The Gutenberg Galaxy&quot; and &quot;Understanding Media&quot;. These books represent an inward turn to attending to one&#x27;s consciousness in contrast to the more outward orientation of other rhetoricians toward sociological considerations and symbolic interaction. No other scholar of the history and theory of rhetoric was as widely publicized in the 20th century as McLuhan.
; Chaïm Perelman : Perelman was among the most important argumentation theorists of the 20th century. His chief work is the &quot;Traité de l&#x27;argumentation—la nouvelle rhétorique&quot; (1958), with Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, which was translated into English as &quot;The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation&quot;. Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca move rhetoric from the periphery to the center of argumentation theory. Among their most influential concepts are &quot;dissociation&quot;, &quot;the universal audience&quot;, &quot;quasi-logical argument&quot;, and &quot;presence&quot;.
; I. A. Richards : Richards was a literary critic and rhetorician. His &quot;The Philosophy of Rhetoric&quot; is an important text in modern rhetorical theory. In this work, he defined rhetoric as &quot;a study of misunderstandings and its remedies&quot;, and introduced the influential concepts &quot;tenor&quot; and &quot;vehicle&quot; to describe the components of a metaphor—the main idea and the concept to which it is compared.
; Stephen Toulmin : Toulmin was a philosopher whose &quot;Uses of Argument&quot; is an important text in modern rhetorical theory and argumentation theory.
; Richard M. Weaver : Weaver was a rhetorical and cultural critic known for his contributions to the new conservatism. He focused on the ethical implications of rhetoric in his books &quot;Language is Sermonic&quot; and &quot;The Ethics of Rhetoric&quot;. According to Weaver there are four types of argument, and through the argument type a rhetorician habitually uses a critic can discern their worldview. Those who prefer the argument from genus or definition are idealists. Those who argue from similitude, such as poets and religious people, see the connectedness between things. The argument from consequence sees a cause and effect relationship. Finally the argument from circumstance considers the particulars of a situation and is an argument preferred by liberals.

===Methods of analysis===

====Criticism seen as a method====
Rhetoric can be analyzed by a variety of methods and theories. One such method is criticism. When those using criticism analyze instances of rhetoric what they do is called rhetorical criticism . According to rhetorical critic Jim A. Kuypers, &quot;The use of rhetoric is an art, and as such, it does not lend itself well to scientific methods of analysis. Criticism is an art as well, and as such is particularly well suited for examining rhetorical creations.&quot; He asserts that criticism is a method of generating knowledge just as the scientific method is a method for generating knowledge: 
Edwin Black wrote on this point that, &quot;Methods, then, admit of varying degrees of personality. And criticism, on the whole, is near the indeterminate, contingent, personal end of the methodological scale. In consequence of this placement, it is neither possible nor desirable for criticism to be fixed into a system, for critical techniques to be objectified, for critics to be interchangeable for purposes of replication, or for rhetorical criticism to serve as the handmaiden of quasi-scientific theory.&quot;

Jim A. Kuypers sums this idea of criticism as art in the following manner: &quot;In short, criticism is an art, not a science. It is not a scientific method; it uses subjective methods of argument; it exists on its own, not in conjunction with other methods of generating knowledge (i.e., social scientific or scientific)... [I]nsight and imagination top statistical applications when studying rhetorical action.&quot;

===Strategies=== 
&quot;Rhetorical strategies&quot; are the efforts made by authors or speakers to persuade or inform their audiences. According to James W. Gray, there are various argument strategies used in writing. He describes four of these as argument from analogy, argument from absurdity, thought experiments, and inference to the best explanation.

===Criticism===
Modern rhetorical criticism explores the relationship between text and context; that is, how an instance of rhetoric relates to circumstances. Since the aim of rhetoric is to be persuasive, the level to which the rhetoric in question persuades its audience is what must be analyzed, and later criticized. In determining the extent to which a text is persuasive, one may explore the text&#x27;s relationship with its audience, purpose, ethics, argument, evidence, arrangement, delivery, and style.

In his &quot;Rhetorical Criticism: A Study in Method&quot;, Edwin Black states, &quot;It is the task of criticism not to measure... discourses dogmatically against some parochial standard of rationality but, allowing for the immeasurable wide range of human experience, to see them as they really are.&quot; While &quot;as they really are&quot; is debatable, rhetorical critics explain texts and speeches by investigating their rhetorical situation, typically placing them in a framework of speaker/audience exchange. The antithetical view places the rhetor at the center of creating that which is considered the extant situation; i.e., the agenda and spin.

====Additional theoretical approaches====
Following the neo-Aristotelian approaches to criticism, scholars began to derive methods from other disciplines, such as history, philosophy, and the social sciences. The importance of critics&#x27; personal judgment while the analytical dimension of criticism began to gain momentum. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, methodological pluralism replaced the singular neo-Aristotelian method. Methodological rhetorical criticism is typically done by deduction, in which is used to examine a specific case of rhetoric. include:
; Ideological criticism : &quot;engages rhetoric as it suggests the beliefs, values, assumptions, and interpretations held by the rhetor or the larger culture&quot;
: Ideological criticism also treats ideology as an artifact of discourse, one that is embedded in key terms (called &quot;ideographs&quot;) as well as material resources and discursive embodiment.
; Cluster criticism : &quot;seeks to help the critic understand the rhetor&#x27;s worldview&quot; (developed by Kenneth Burke)
: This means identifying terms that are &quot;clustered&quot; around key symbols in the rhetorical artifact and the patterns in which they appear.
; Frame analysis : &quot;looks for how rhetors construct an interpretive lens in their discourse&quot;
: In short, how they make certain facts more noticeable than others. It is particularly useful for analyzing products of the news media.
; Genre criticism : &quot;assumes certain situations call for similar needs and expectations within the audience, therefore calling for certain types of rhetoric&quot;
: It studies rhetoric in different times and locations, looking at similarities in the rhetorical situation and the rhetoric that responds to them. Examples include eulogies, inaugural addresses, and declarations of war.
; Narrative criticism : &quot;narratives help organize experiences in order to endow meaning to historical events and transformations&quot;
: Narrative criticism focuses on the story itself and how the construction of the narrative directs the interpretation of the situation.

By the mid-1980s the study of rhetorical criticism began to move away from precise methodology towards conceptual issues. Conceptually-driven criticism operates more through abduction, according to scholar James Jasinski, who argues that this type of criticism can be thought of as a back-and-forth between the text and the concepts, which are being explored at the same time. The concepts remain &quot;works in progress&quot;, and understanding develops through the analysis of a text.

Criticism is considered rhetorical when it focuses on the way some types of discourse react to situational exigencies—problems or demands—and constraints. Modern rhetorical criticism concerns how the rhetorical case or object persuades, defines, or constructs the audience. In modern terms, rhetoric includes, but it is not limited to, speeches, scientific discourse, pamphlets, literary work, works of art, and pictures. Contemporary rhetorical criticism has maintained aspects of early neo-Aristotelian thinking through close reading, which attempts to explore the organization and stylistic structure of a rhetorical object. Using close textual analysis means rhetorical critics use the tools of classical rhetoric and literary analysis to evaluate the style and strategy used to communicate the argument.

====Purpose of criticism====
Rhetorical criticism serves several purposes. For one, it hopes to help form or improve public taste. It helps educate audiences and develops them into better judges of rhetorical situations by reinforcing ideas of value, morality, and suitability. Rhetorical criticism can thus contribute to the audience&#x27;s understanding of themselves and society.

According to Jim A. Kuypers, a second purpose for performing criticism should be to enhance our appreciation and understanding. &quot;[W]e wish to enhance both our own and others&#x27; understanding of the rhetorical act; we wish to share our insights with others, and to enhance their appreciation of the rhetorical act. These are not hollow goals, but quality of life issues. By improving understanding and appreciation, the critic can offer new and potentially exciting ways for others to see the world. Through understanding we also produce knowledge about human communication; in theory this should help us to better govern our interactions with others.&quot; Criticism is a humanizing activity in that it explores and highlights qualities that make us human.

== Animal rhetoric ==

Rhetoric is practiced by social animals in a variety of ways. For example, birds use song, various animals warn members of their species of danger, chimpanzees have the capacity to deceive through communicative keyboard systems, and deer stags compete for the attention of mates. While these might be understood as rhetorical actions (attempts at persuading through meaningful actions and utterances), they can also be seen as rhetorical fundamentals shared by humans and animals. The study of animal rhetoric has been called &quot;biorhetorics&quot;.

The self-awareness required to practice rhetoric might be difficult to notice and acknowledge in some animals. However, some animals are capable of acknowledging themselves in a mirror, and therefore, they might be understood to be self-aware and therefore, argue philosophers such as Diane Davis, are able to engage with rhetoric when practicing some form of language.

Anthropocentrism plays a significant role in human-animal relationships, reflecting and perpetuating binaries in which humans assume they are beings that have extraordinary qualities while they regard animals as beings that lack those qualities. This dualism is manifested in other forms as well, such as reason and sense, mind and body, ideal and phenomenal in which the first category of each pair (reason, mind, and ideal) represents and belongs to only humans. By becoming aware of and overcoming these dualistic conceptions including the one between humans and animals, humans will be able to more easily engage with and communicate with animals, with the understanding that animals are capable of reciprocating communication. The relationship between humans and animals (as well as the rest of the natural world) is often defined by the human rhetorical act of naming and categorizing animals through scientific and folk labeling. The act of naming partially defines the rhetorical relationships between humans and animals, though both may engage in rhetoric beyond human naming and categorizing.

Some animals have a sort of which enables them to &quot;learn and receive instruction&quot; with rudimentary understanding of some significant signs. Those animals practice deliberative, judicial, and epideictic rhetoric deploying , , and with gesture and preen, sing and growl. Since animals offer models of rhetorical behavior and interaction that are physical, even instinctual, but perhaps no less artful, transcending our accustomed focus on verbal language and consciousness concepts will help people interested in rhetoric and communication to promote human-animal rhetoric.

== Comparative rhetoric ==
Comparative rhetoric is a practice and methodology that developed in the late twentieth century to broaden the study of rhetoric beyond the dominant rhetorical tradition that has been constructed and shaped in western Europe and the U.S. As a research practice, comparative rhetoric studies past and present cultures across the globe to reveal diversity in the uses of rhetoric and to uncover rhetorical perspectives, practices, and traditions that have been historically underrepresented or dismissed. As a methodology, comparative rhetoric constructs a culture&#x27;s rhetorical perspectives, practices, and traditions on their own terms, in their own contexts, as opposed to using European or American theories, terminology, or framing.

Comparative rhetoric is comparative in that it illuminates how rhetorical traditions relate to one another, while seeking to avoid binary depictions or value judgments. This can reveal issues of power within and between cultures as well as new or under-recognized ways of thinking, doing, and being that challenge or enrich the dominant Euro-American tradition and provide a fuller account of rhetorical studies.

Robert T. Oliver is credited as the first scholar who recognized the need to study non-Western rhetorics in his 1971 publication &quot;Communication and Culture in Ancient India and China&quot;. George A. Kennedy has been credited for the first cross-cultural overview of rhetoric in his 1998 publication &quot;Comparative Rhetoric: An Historical and Cross-cultural Introduction&quot;. Though Oliver&#x27;s and Kennedy&#x27;s works contributed to the birth of comparative rhetoric, given the newness of the field, they both used Euro-American terms and theories to interpret non-Euro-American cultures&#x27; practices.

LuMing Mao, Xing Lu, Mary Garrett, Arabella Lyon, Bo Wang, Hui Wu, and Keith Lloyd have published extensively on comparative rhetoric, helping to shape and define the field. In 2013, LuMing Mao edited a special issue on comparative rhetoric in &quot;Rhetoric Society Quarterly&quot;, focusing on comparative methodologies in the age of globalization. In 2015, LuMing Mao and Bo Wang coedited a symposium featuring position essays by a group of leading scholars in the field. In their introduction, Mao and Wang emphasize the fluid and cross-cultural nature of rhetoric, &quot;Rhetorical knowledge, like any other knowledge, is heterogeneous, multidimentional, and always in the process of being created.&quot; The symposium includes &quot;A Manifesto: The What and How of Comparative Rhetoric&quot;, demonstrating the first collective effort to identify and articulate comparative rhetoric&#x27;s definition, goals, and methodologies. The tenets of this manifesto are engaged within many later works that study or utilize comparative rhetoric.

== Automatic detection of rhetorical figures ==
As natural language processing has developed, so has interest in automatically detecting rhetorical figures. The major focus has been to detect specific figures, such as chiasmus, epanaphora, and epiphora using classifiers trained with labeled data. A major shortcoming to achieving high accuracy with these systems is the shortage of labeled data for these tasks, but with recent advances in language modeling, such as few-shot learning, it may be possible to detect more rhetorical figures with less data.

<text>Wilhelm Richard Wagner ( ; ; 22 May 181313 February 1883) was a German composer, theatre director, essayist, and conductor who is chiefly known for his operas (or, as some of his mature works were later known, &quot;music dramas&quot;). Unlike most opera composers, Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works. Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Carl Maria von Weber and Giacomo Meyerbeer, Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (&quot;total work of art&quot;), whereby he sought to synthesise the poetic, visual, musical and dramatic arts, with music subsidiary to drama. The drama was to be presented as a continuously sung narrative, without conventional operatic structures like arias and recitatives. He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852. Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the 16-hour, four-opera cycle &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; (&quot;The Ring of the Nibelung,&quot; also known simply as &quot;The Ring&quot;).

Wagner&#x27;s compositions, particularly those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting tonal centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music; his &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; is regarded as an important precursor towards modern music. As he matured, he softened his ideological stance against traditional operatic forms (ie. arias, ensembles and choruses), reintroducing them into his last few stage works, including &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; (&quot;The Mastersingers of Nuremberg&quot;) and &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

To properly present his vision of the works, Wagner had his own opera house built to his specifications: the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, which featured many innovative design elements intended to immerse the audience in the drama. The premieres of &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot; took place there, and his most important stage works are performed at the annual Bayreuth Festival. The early success of the festival was secured by the efforts of his wife, Cosima Wagner, and has since been maintained by their descendants, attracting audiences from around the world.

Wagner&#x27;s unorthodox operas, essays, and personal dealings engendered considerable controversy during his lifetime, and continue to do so. Declared a &quot;genius&quot; by some and a &quot;disease&quot; by others, his music is widely performed, but his views on religion, politics, and social life are debated—most notably on the extent to which his antisemitism finds expression in his stage and prose works. The effect of his ideas can be traced in many of the arts throughout the 20th century; his influence spread beyond composition into conducting, philosophy, literature, the visual arts and theatre.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Richard Wagner was born on 22 May 1813 to an ethnic German family in Leipzig, then part of the Confederation of the Rhine. His family lived at No 3, the Brühl (&quot;The House of the Red and White Lions&quot;) in Leipzig&#x27;s Jewish quarter. He was baptised at St. Thomas Church. He was the ninth child of Carl Friedrich Wagner, a clerk in the Leipzig police service, and his wife, , the daughter of a baker. Wagner&#x27;s father Carl died of typhoid fever six months after Richard&#x27;s birth. Afterwards, his mother Johanna lived with Carl&#x27;s friend, the actor and playwright Ludwig Geyer. In August 1814 Johanna and Geyer probably married, although no documentation of this has been found in the Leipzig church registers. She and her family moved to Geyer&#x27;s residence in Dresden. Until he was fourteen, Wagner was known as Wilhelm Richard Geyer. He almost certainly thought that Geyer was his biological father.

Geyer&#x27;s love of the theatre came to be shared by his stepson, and Wagner took part in his performances. In his autobiography &quot;Mein Leben&quot; Wagner recalled once playing the part of an angel. In late 1820, Wagner was enrolled at Pastor Wetzel&#x27;s school at Possendorf, near Dresden, where he received some piano instruction from his Latin teacher. He struggled to play a proper scale at the keyboard and preferred playing theatre overtures by ear. Following Geyer&#x27;s death in 1821, Richard was sent to the Kreuzschule, the boarding school of the Dresdner Kreuzchor, at the expense of Geyer&#x27;s brother. At the age of nine he was hugely impressed by the Gothic elements of Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s opera &quot;Der Freischütz,&quot; which he saw Weber conduct. At this period Wagner entertained ambitions as a playwright. His first creative effort, listed in the &quot;Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis&quot; (the standard listing of Wagner&#x27;s works) as WWV 1, was a tragedy called &quot;Leubald&quot;. Begun when he was in school in 1826, the play was strongly influenced by Shakespeare and Goethe. Wagner was determined to set it to music and persuaded his family to allow him music lessons.

By 1827, the family had returned to Leipzig. Wagner&#x27;s first lessons in harmony were taken during 1828–1831 with . In January 1828 he first heard Beethoven&#x27;s 7th Symphony and then, in March, the same composer&#x27;s 9th Symphony, both at the Gewandhaus. Beethoven became a major inspiration, and Wagner wrote a piano transcription of the 9th Symphony. He was also greatly impressed by a performance of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Requiem.&quot; Wagner&#x27;s early piano sonatas and his first attempts at orchestral overtures date from this period.

In 1829 he saw a performance by dramatic soprano Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient, who became his ideal of the fusion of drama and music in opera. In &quot;Mein Leben&quot; Wagner wrote, &quot;When I look back across my entire life I find no event to place beside this in the impression it produced on me,&quot; and claimed that the &quot;profoundly human and ecstatic performance of this incomparable artist&quot; kindled in him an &quot;almost demonic fire&quot;.

In 1831, Wagner enrolled at the Leipzig University, where he became a member of the Saxon student fraternity. He took composition lessons with the Thomaskantor Theodor Weinlig. Weinlig was so impressed with Wagner&#x27;s musical ability that he refused any payment for his lessons. He arranged for his pupil&#x27;s Piano Sonata in B-flat major (which was consequently dedicated to him) to be published as Wagner&#x27;s Op. 1. A year later, Wagner composed his Symphony in C major, a Beethovenesque work performed in Prague in 1832 and at the Leipzig Gewandhaus in 1833. He then began to work on an opera, &quot;Die Hochzeit&quot; (&quot;The Wedding&quot;), which he never completed.

=== Early career and marriage (1833–1842) ===

In 1833, Wagner&#x27;s brother Albert managed to obtain for him a position as choirmaster at the theatre in Würzburg. In the same year, at the age of 20, Wagner composed his first complete opera, &quot;Die Feen&quot; (&quot;The Fairies&quot;). This work, which imitated the style of Weber, went unproduced until half a century later, when it was premiered in Munich shortly after the composer&#x27;s death in 1883.

Having returned to Leipzig in 1834, Wagner held a brief appointment as musical director at the opera house in Magdeburg during which he wrote &quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot; (&quot;The Ban on Love&quot;), based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;. This was staged at Magdeburg in 1836 but closed before the second performance; this, together with the financial collapse of the theatre company employing him, left the composer in bankruptcy. Wagner had fallen for one of the leading ladies at Magdeburg, the actress Christine Wilhelmine &quot;Minna&quot; Planer, and after the disaster of &quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot; he followed her to Königsberg, where she helped him to get an engagement at the theatre. The two married in Tragheim Church on 24 November 1836. In May 1837, Minna left Wagner for another man, and this was only the first débâcle of a tempestuous marriage. In June 1837, Wagner moved to Riga (then in the Russian Empire), where he became music director of the local opera; having in this capacity engaged Minna&#x27;s sister Amalie (also a singer) for the theatre, he presently resumed relations with Minna during 1838.

By 1839, the couple had amassed such large debts that they fled Riga on the run from creditors. Debts plagued Wagner for most of his life. Initially the pair took a stormy sea passage to London, from which Wagner drew the inspiration for his opera &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; (&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;), with a plot based on a sketch by Heinrich Heine. The Wagners settled in Paris in September 1839 and stayed there until 1842. Wagner made a scant living by writing articles and short novelettes such as &quot;A pilgrimage to Beethoven&quot;, which sketched his growing concept of &quot;music drama&quot;, and &quot;An end in Paris&quot;, where he depicts his own miseries as a German musician in the French metropolis. He also provided arrangements of operas by other composers, largely on behalf of the Schlesinger publishing house. During this stay he completed his third and fourth operas &quot;Rienzi&quot; and &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot;.

=== Dresden (1842–1849) ===

Wagner had completed &quot;Rienzi&quot; in 1840. With the strong support of Giacomo Meyerbeer, it was accepted for performance by the Dresden Court Theatre (&quot;Hofoper&quot;) in the Kingdom of Saxony, and in 1842 Wagner moved to Dresden. His relief at returning to Germany was recorded in his &quot;Autobiographic Sketch&quot; of 1842, where he wrote that, en route from Paris, &quot;For the first time I saw the Rhine—with hot tears in my eyes, I, poor artist, swore eternal fidelity to my German fatherland.&quot; &quot;Rienzi&quot; was staged to considerable acclaim on 20 October.

Wagner lived in Dresden for the next six years, eventually being appointed the Royal Saxon Court Conductor. During this period, he staged there &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; (2 January 1843) and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (19 October 1845), the first two of his three middle-period operas. Wagner also mixed with artistic circles in Dresden, including the composer Ferdinand Hiller and the architect Gottfried Semper.

Wagner&#x27;s involvement in left-wing politics abruptly ended his welcome in Dresden. Wagner was active among socialist German nationalists there, regularly receiving such guests as the conductor and radical editor August Röckel and the Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. He was also influenced by the ideas of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Ludwig Feuerbach. Widespread discontent came to a head in 1849, when the unsuccessful May Uprising in Dresden broke out, in which Wagner played a minor supporting role. Warrants were issued for the revolutionaries&#x27; arrest. Wagner had to flee, first visiting Paris and then settling in Zürich where he at first took refuge with a friend, Alexander Müller.

=== In exile: Switzerland (1849–1858) ===

Wagner was to spend the next twelve years in exile from Germany. He had completed &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, the last of his middle-period operas, before the Dresden uprising, and now wrote desperately to his friend Franz Liszt to have it staged in his absence. Liszt conducted the premiere in Weimar in August 1850.

Nevertheless, Wagner was in grim personal straits, isolated from the German musical world and without any regular income. In 1850, Julie, the wife of his friend Karl Ritter, began to pay him a small pension which she maintained until 1859. With help from her friend Jessie Laussot, this was to have been augmented to an annual sum of 3,000 thalers per year, but the plan was abandoned when Wagner began an affair with Mme. Laussot. Wagner even plotted an elopement with her in 1850, which her husband prevented. Meanwhile, Wagner&#x27;s wife Minna, who had disliked the operas he had written after &quot;Rienzi&quot;, was falling into a deepening depression. Wagner fell victim to ill health, according to Ernest Newman &quot;largely a matter of overwrought nerves&quot;, which made it difficult for him to continue writing.

Wagner&#x27;s primary published output during his first years in Zürich was a set of essays. In &quot;The Artwork of the Future&quot; (1849), he described a vision of opera as &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; (total work of art), in which music, song, dance, poetry, visual arts and stagecraft were unified. &quot;Judaism in Music&quot; (1850) was the first of Wagner&#x27;s writings to feature antisemitic views. In this polemic Wagner asserted—often with vulgar, abusive language—that Jews lived as &quot;outsiders&quot; amid European societies and were disconnected from the national spirit (&quot;Volksgeist&quot;) of these countries, thus capable of producing only shallow and artificial imitations of European art music, despite having achieved technical proficiency in its study. According to Wagner, Jews such as Meyerbeer commercialised music catered to the masses in order to achieve fame and financial success, rather than creating genuine works of art.

In &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; (1851), Wagner described the aesthetics of music drama that he was using to create the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. Before leaving Dresden, Wagner had drafted a scenario that eventually became &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. He initially wrote the libretto for a single opera, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Siegfried&#x27;s Death&quot;), in 1848. After arriving in Zürich, he expanded the story with &quot;Der junge Siegfried&quot; (&quot;Young Siegfried&quot;), which explored the hero&#x27;s background. He completed the text of the cycle by writing the libretti for &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (&quot;The Valkyrie&quot;) and &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; (&quot;The Rhine Gold&quot;) and revising the other libretti to conform to his new concept, completing them in 1852. The concept of opera expressed in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot; and in other essays effectively renounced all the operas he had previously written through &quot;Lohengrin.&quot; Partly in an attempt to explain his change of views, Wagner published in 1851 the autobiographical &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot;. This included his first public announcement of what was to become the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle:
I shall never write an &quot;Opera&quot; more. As I have no wish to invent an arbitrary title for my works, I will call them Dramas ...

I propose to produce my myth in three complete dramas, preceded by a lengthy Prelude (Vorspiel)...

At a specially-appointed Festival, I propose, some future time, to produce those three Dramas with their Prelude, &quot;in the course of three days and a fore-evening&quot; [emphasis in original].

Wagner began composing the music for &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; between November 1853 and September 1854, following it immediately with &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (written between June 1854 and March 1856). He began work on the third &quot;Ring&quot; drama, which he now called simply &quot;Siegfried&quot;, probably in September 1856, but by June 1857 he had completed only the first two acts. He decided to put the work aside to concentrate on a new idea: &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, based on the Arthurian love story &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot;.
One source of inspiration for &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; was the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, notably his &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot;, to which Wagner had been introduced in 1854 by his poet friend Georg Herwegh. Wagner later called this the most important event of his life. His personal circumstances certainly made him an easy convert to what he understood to be Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy, sometimes categorised as &quot;philosophical pessimism&quot;. He remained an adherent of Schopenhauer for the rest of his life.

One of Schopenhauer&#x27;s doctrines was that music held a supreme role in the arts as a direct expression of the world&#x27;s essence, namely, blind, impulsive will. This doctrine contradicted Wagner&#x27;s view, expressed in &quot;Opera and Drama&quot;, that the music in opera had to be subservient to the drama. Wagner scholars have argued that Schopenhauer&#x27;s influence caused Wagner to assign a more commanding role to music in his later operas, including the latter half of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, which he had yet to compose. Aspects of Schopenhauerian doctrine found their way into Wagner&#x27;s subsequent libretti.

A second source of inspiration was Wagner&#x27;s infatuation with the poet-writer Mathilde Wesendonck, the wife of the silk merchant . Wagner met the Wesendoncks, who were both great admirers of his music, in Zürich in 1852. From May 1853 onwards Wesendonck made several loans to Wagner to finance his household expenses in Zürich, and in 1857 placed a cottage on his estate at Wagner&#x27;s disposal, which became known as the &quot;Asyl&quot; (&quot;asylum&quot; or &quot;place of rest&quot;). During this period, Wagner&#x27;s growing passion for his patron&#x27;s wife inspired him to put aside work on the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle (which was not resumed for the next twelve years) and begin work on &quot;Tristan&quot;. While planning the opera, Wagner composed the &quot;Wesendonck Lieder&quot;, five songs for voice and piano, setting poems by Mathilde. Two of these settings are explicitly subtitled by Wagner as &quot;studies for &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;&quot;.

Among the conducting engagements that Wagner undertook for revenue during this period, he gave several concerts in 1855 with the Philharmonic Society of London, including one before Queen Victoria. The Queen enjoyed his &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; overture and spoke with Wagner after the concert, writing in her diary that Wagner was &quot;short, very quiet, wears spectacles &amp; has a very finely-developed forehead, a hooked nose &amp; projecting chin.&quot;

=== In exile: Venice and Paris (1858–1862) ===
Wagner&#x27;s uneasy affair with Mathilde collapsed in 1858, when Minna intercepted a letter to Mathilde from him. After the resulting confrontation with Minna, Wagner left Zürich alone, bound for Venice, where he rented an apartment in the Palazzo Giustinian, while Minna returned to Germany. Wagner&#x27;s attitude to Minna had changed; the editor of his correspondence with her, John Burk, has said that she was to him &quot;an invalid, to be treated with kindness and consideration, but, except at a distance, [was] a menace to his peace of mind.&quot; Wagner continued his correspondence with Mathilde and his friendship with her husband Otto, who maintained his financial support of the composer. In an 1859 letter to Mathilde, Wagner wrote, half-satirically, of &quot;Tristan&quot;: &quot;Child! This Tristan is turning into something &quot;terrible&quot;. This final act!!!—I fear the opera will be banned ... only mediocre performances can save me! Perfectly good ones will be bound to drive people mad.&quot;
In November 1859, Wagner once again moved to Paris to oversee production of a new revision of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, staged thanks to the efforts of Princess Pauline von Metternich, whose husband, Richard von Metternich, was the Austrian ambassador in Paris. The performances of the Paris &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in 1861 were a notable fiasco. This was partly a consequence of the conservative tastes of the Jockey Club, which organised demonstrations in the theatre to protest at the presentation of the ballet feature in Act 1 (instead of its traditional location in the second act); but the opportunity was also exploited by those who wanted to use the occasion as a veiled political protest against the pro-Austrian policies of Napoleon III. It was during this visit that Wagner met the French poet Charles Baudelaire, who wrote an appreciative brochure, &quot;&quot;. The opera was withdrawn after the third performance and Wagner left Paris soon after. He had sought a reconciliation with Minna during this Paris visit, and although she joined him there, the reunion was not successful and they again parted from each other when Wagner left.

=== Return and resurgence (1862–1871) ===
The political ban that had been placed on Wagner in the North German Confederation after he had fled Dresden was fully lifted in 1862. The composer settled in Biebrich, on the Rhine near Wiesbaden in Hesse. Here Minna visited him for the last time: they parted irrevocably, though Wagner continued to give financial support to her while she lived in Dresden until her death in 1866.
In Biebrich, Wagner, at last, began work on &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot;, his only mature comedy. Wagner wrote a first draft of the libretto in 1845, and he had resolved to develop it during a visit he had made to Venice with the Wesendoncks in 1860, where he was inspired by Titian&#x27;s painting &quot;The Assumption of the Virgin&quot;. Throughout this period (1861–1864) Wagner sought to have &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; produced in Vienna. Despite many rehearsals, the opera remained unperformed, and gained a reputation as being &quot;impossible&quot; to sing, which added to Wagner&#x27;s financial problems.

Wagner&#x27;s fortunes took a dramatic upturn in 1864, when King Ludwig II succeeded to the throne of Bavaria at the age of 18. The young king, an ardent admirer of Wagner&#x27;s operas, had the composer brought to Munich. The King, who was homosexual, expressed in his correspondence a passionate personal adoration for the composer, and Wagner in his responses had no scruples about feigning reciprocal feelings. Ludwig settled Wagner&#x27;s considerable debts and proposed to stage &quot;Tristan&quot;, &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, the &quot;Ring&quot;, and the other operas Wagner planned. Wagner also began to dictate his autobiography, &quot;Mein Leben&quot;, at the King&#x27;s request. Wagner noted that his rescue by Ludwig coincided with news of the death of his earlier mentor (but later supposed enemy) Giacomo Meyerbeer, and regretted that &quot;this operatic master, who had done me so much harm, should not have lived to see this day.&quot;

After grave difficulties in rehearsal, &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; premiered at the National Theatre Munich on 10 June 1865, the first Wagner opera premiere in almost 15 years. (The premiere had been scheduled for 15 May, but was delayed by bailiffs acting for Wagner&#x27;s creditors, and also because the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, was hoarse and needed time to recover.) The conductor of this premiere was Hans von Bülow, whose wife, Cosima, had given birth in April that year to a daughter, named Isolde, a child not of Bülow but of Wagner.

Cosima was 24 years younger than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the daughter of the Countess Marie d&#x27;Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter&#x27;s involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless the two men were friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also toyed with the idea of abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.
Ludwig installed Wagner at the Villa Tribschen, beside Switzerland&#x27;s Lake Lucerne. &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; was completed at Tribschen in 1867, and premiered in Munich on 21 June the following year. At Ludwig&#x27;s insistence, &quot;special previews&quot; of the first two works of the &quot;Ring&quot;, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, were performed at Munich in 1869 and 1870, but Wagner retained his dream, first expressed in &quot;A Communication to My Friends&quot;, to present the first complete cycle at a special festival with a new, dedicated, opera house.

Minna died of a heart attack on 25 January 1866 in Dresden. Wagner did not attend the funeral. Following Minna&#x27;s death Cosima wrote to Hans von Bülow several times asking him to grant her a divorce, but Bülow refused to concede this. He consented only after she had two more children with Wagner: another daughter, named Eva, after the heroine of &quot;Meistersinger&quot;, and a son Siegfried, named after the hero of the &quot;Ring&quot;. The divorce was finally sanctioned, after delays in the legal process, by a Berlin court on 18 July 1870. Richard and Cosima&#x27;s wedding took place on 25 August 1870. On Christmas Day of that year, Wagner arranged a surprise performance (its premiere) of the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot; for Cosima&#x27;s birthday. The marriage to Cosima lasted to the end of Wagner&#x27;s life.

Wagner, settled into his new-found domesticity, turned his energies towards completing the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. He had not abandoned polemics: he republished his 1850 pamphlet &quot;Judaism in Music&quot;, originally issued under a pseudonym, under his own name in 1869, extending the introduction and adding a lengthy final section. The publication led to several public protests at early performances of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; in Vienna and Mannheim.

=== Bayreuth (1871–1876) ===
In 1871, Wagner decided to move to Bayreuth, which was to be the location of his new opera house. The town council donated a large plot of land—the &quot;Green Hill&quot;—as a site for the theatre. The Wagners moved to the town the following year, and the foundation stone for the Bayreuth Festspielhaus (&quot;Festival Theatre&quot;) was laid. Wagner initially announced the first Bayreuth Festival, at which for the first time the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle was presented complete, for 1873, but since Ludwig had declined to finance the project, the start of building was delayed and the proposed date for the festival was deferred. To raise funds for the construction, &quot;Wagner societies&quot; were formed in several cities, and Wagner began touring Germany conducting concerts. By the spring of 1873, only a third of the required funds had been raised; further pleas to Ludwig were initially ignored, but early in 1874, with the project on the verge of collapse, the King relented and provided a loan. The full building programme included the family home, &quot;Wahnfried&quot;, into which Wagner, with Cosima and the children, moved from their temporary accommodation on 18 April 1874. The theatre was completed in 1875, and the festival was scheduled for the following year. Commenting on the struggle to finish the building, Wagner remarked to Cosima: &quot;Each stone is red with my blood and yours.&quot;
For the design of the Festspielhaus, Wagner appropriated some of the ideas of his former colleague, Gottfried Semper, which he had previously solicited for a proposed new opera house in Munich. Wagner was responsible for several theatrical innovations at Bayreuth; these include darkening the auditorium during performances, and placing the orchestra in a pit out of view of the audience.

The Festspielhaus finally opened on 13 August 1876 with &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, at last taking its place as the first evening of the complete &quot;Ring&quot; cycle; the 1876 Bayreuth Festival therefore saw the premiere of the complete cycle, performed as a sequence as the composer had intended. The 1876 Festival consisted of three full &quot;Ring&quot; cycles (under the baton of Hans Richter). At the end, critical reactions ranged between that of the Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, who thought the work &quot;divinely composed&quot;, and that of the French newspaper , which called the music &quot;the dream of a lunatic&quot;. The disillusioned included Wagner&#x27;s (then) friend Friedrich Nietzsche, who, having published his eulogistic essay &quot;Richard Wagner in Bayreuth&quot; before the festival as part of his &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot;, was bitterly disappointed by what he saw as Wagner&#x27;s pandering to increasingly exclusivist German nationalism; his breach with Wagner began at this time. The festival firmly established Wagner as an artist of European, and indeed world, importance: attendees included Kaiser Wilhelm I, the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, Anton Bruckner, Camille Saint-Saëns and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.

Wagner was far from satisfied with the Festival; Cosima recorded that months later his attitude towards the productions was &quot;Never again, never again!&quot; Moreover, the festival finished with a deficit of about 150,000 marks. The expenses of Bayreuth and of Wahnfried meant that Wagner still sought further sources of income by conducting or taking on commissions such as the &quot;Centennial March&quot; for America, for which he received $5,000.

=== Last years (1876–1883) ===
Following the first Bayreuth Festival, Wagner began work on &quot;Parsifal&quot;, his final opera. The composition took four years, much of which Wagner spent in Italy for health reasons. From 1876 to 1878 Wagner also embarked on the last of his documented emotional liaisons, this time with Judith Gautier, whom he had met at the 1876 Festival. Wagner was also much troubled by problems of financing &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and by the prospect of the work being performed by other theatres than Bayreuth. He was once again assisted by the liberality of King Ludwig, but was still forced by his personal financial situation in 1877 to sell the rights of several of his unpublished works (including the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot;) to the publisher Schott.
Wagner wrote several articles in his later years, often on political topics, and often reactionary in tone, repudiating some of his earlier, more liberal, views. These include (1880) and &quot;Heroism and Christianity&quot; (1881), which were printed in the journal &quot;Bayreuther Blätter&quot;, published by his supporter Hans von Wolzogen. Wagner&#x27;s sudden interest in Christianity at this period, which infuses &quot;Parsifal&quot;, was contemporary with his increasing alignment with German nationalism, and required on his part, and the part of his associates, &quot;the rewriting of some recent Wagnerian history&quot;, so as to represent, for example, the &quot;Ring&quot; as a work reflecting Christian ideals. Many of these later articles, including &quot;What is German?&quot; (1878, but based on a draft written in the 1860s), repeated Wagner&#x27;s antisemitic preoccupations.

Wagner completed &quot;Parsifal&quot; in January 1882, and a second Bayreuth Festival was held for the new opera, which premiered on 26 May. Wagner was by this time extremely ill, having suffered a series of increasingly severe angina attacks. During the sixteenth and final performance of &quot;Parsifal&quot; on 29 August, he entered the pit unseen during act 3, took the baton from conductor Hermann Levi, and led the performance to its conclusion.

After the festival, the Wagner family journeyed to Venice for the winter. Wagner died of a heart attack at the age of 69 on 13 February 1883 at Ca&#x27; Vendramin Calergi, a 16th-century palazzo on the Grand Canal. The legend that the attack was prompted by an argument with Cosima over Wagner&#x27;s supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in &quot;Parsifal&quot; at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence. After a funerary gondola bore Wagner&#x27;s remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.

== Works ==
Wagner&#x27;s musical output is listed by the &quot;Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis&quot; (WWV) as comprising 113 works, including fragments and projects. The first complete scholarly edition of his musical works in print was commenced in 1970 under the aegis of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts and the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur of Mainz, and is presently under the editorship of Egon Voss. It will consist of 21 volumes (57 books) of music and 10 volumes (13 books) of relevant documents and texts. As at October 2017, three volumes remain to be published. The publisher is Schott Music.

=== Operas ===
Wagner&#x27;s operatic works are his primary artistic legacy. Unlike most opera composers, who generally left the task of writing the libretto (the text and lyrics) to others, Wagner wrote his own libretti, which he referred to as &quot;poems&quot;.

From 1849 onwards, he urged a new concept of opera often referred to as &quot;music drama&quot; (although he later rejected this term), in which all musical, poetic and dramatic elements were to be fused together—the &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot;. Wagner developed a compositional style in which the importance of the orchestra is equal to that of the singers. The orchestra&#x27;s dramatic role in the later operas includes the use of leitmotifs, musical phrases that can be interpreted as announcing specific characters, locales, and plot elements; their complex interweaving and evolution illuminate the progression of the drama. These operas are still, despite Wagner&#x27;s reservations, referred to by many writers as &quot;music dramas&quot;.

==== Early works (to 1842) ====
Wagner&#x27;s earliest attempts at opera were often uncompleted. Abandoned works include a pastoral opera based on Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Die Laune des Verliebten&quot; (&quot;The Infatuated Lover&#x27;s Caprice&quot;), written at the age of 17, &quot;Die Hochzeit&quot; (&quot;The Wedding&quot;), on which Wagner worked in 1832, and the singspiel &quot;Männerlist größer als Frauenlist&quot; (&quot;Men are More Cunning than Women&quot;, 1837–1838). &quot;Die Feen&quot; (&quot;The Fairies&quot;, 1833) was not performed in the composer&#x27;s lifetime, and &quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot; (&quot;The Ban on Love&quot;, 1836) was withdrawn after its first performance. &quot;Rienzi&quot; (1842) was Wagner&#x27;s first opera to be successfully staged. The compositional style of these early works was conventional—the relatively more sophisticated &quot;Rienzi&quot; showing the clear influence of Grand Opera &quot;à la&quot; Spontini and Meyerbeer—and did not exhibit the innovations that would mark Wagner&#x27;s place in musical history. Later in life, Wagner said that he did not consider these works to be part of his , and they have been performed only rarely in the last hundred years, although the overture to &quot;Rienzi&quot; is an occasional concert-hall piece. &quot;Die Feen&quot;, &quot;Das Liebesverbot&quot;, and &quot;Rienzi&quot; were performed at both Leipzig and Bayreuth in 2013 to mark the composer&#x27;s bicentenary.

==== &quot;Romantic operas&quot; (1843–1851) ====

Wagner&#x27;s middle stage output began with &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; (&quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;, 1843), followed by &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; (1845) and &quot;Lohengrin&quot; (1850). These three operas are sometimes referred to as Wagner&#x27;s &quot;romantic operas&quot;. They reinforced the reputation, among the public in Germany and beyond, that Wagner had begun to establish with &quot;Rienzi&quot;. Although distancing himself from the style of these operas from 1849 onwards, he nevertheless reworked both &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; on several occasions. These three operas are considered to represent a significant developmental stage in Wagner&#x27;s musical and operatic maturity as regards thematic handling, portrayal of emotions and orchestration. They are the earliest works included in the Bayreuth canon, the mature operas that Cosima staged at the Bayreuth Festival after Wagner&#x27;s death in accordance with his wishes. All three (including the differing versions of &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;) continue to be regularly performed throughout the world and have been frequently recorded. They were also the operas by which his fame spread during his lifetime.

==== &quot;Music dramas&quot; (1851–1882) ====

===== Starting the &quot;Ring&quot; =====

Wagner&#x27;s late dramas are considered his masterpieces. &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, commonly referred to as the &quot;Ring&quot; or &quot;&quot;Ring&quot; cycle&quot;, is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of Germanic mythology—particularly from the later Norse mythology—notably the Old Norse &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and &quot;Volsunga Saga&quot;, and the Middle High German &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;. Wagner specifically developed the libretti for these operas according to his interpretation of &quot;Stabreim&quot;, highly alliterative rhyming verse-pairs used in old Germanic poetry. They were also influenced by Wagner&#x27;s concepts of ancient Greek drama, in which tetralogies were a component of Athenian festivals, and which he had amply discussed in his essay &quot;Oper und Drama&quot;.

The first two components of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle were &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; (&quot;The Rhinegold&quot;), which was completed in 1854, and &quot;Die Walküre&quot; (&quot;The Valkyrie&quot;), which was finished in 1856. In &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, with its &quot;relentlessly talky &#x27;realism&#x27; [and] the absence of lyrical &#x27;numbers, Wagner came very close to the musical ideals of his 1849–1851 essays. &quot;Die Walküre&quot;, which contains what is virtually a traditional aria (Siegmund&#x27;s &quot;Winterstürme&quot; in the first act), and the quasi-choral appearance of the Valkyries themselves, shows more &quot;operatic&quot; traits, but has been assessed by Barry Millington as &quot;the music drama that most satisfactorily embodies the theoretical principles of &#x27;Oper und Drama&#x27;... A thoroughgoing synthesis of poetry and music is achieved without any notable sacrifice in musical expression.&quot;

===== &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; =====
While composing the opera &quot;Siegfried&quot;, the third part of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, Wagner interrupted work on it and between 1857 and 1864 wrote the tragic love story &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and his only mature comedy &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; (&quot;The Mastersingers of Nuremberg&quot;), two works that are also part of the regular operatic canon.

&quot;Tristan&quot; is often granted a special place in musical history; many see it as the beginning of the move away from conventional harmony and tonality and consider that it lays the groundwork for the direction of classical music in the 20th century. Wagner felt that his musico-dramatical theories were most perfectly realised in this work with its use of &quot;the art of transition&quot; between dramatic elements and the balance achieved between vocal and orchestral lines. Completed in 1859, the work was given its first performance in Munich, conducted by Bülow, in June 1865.

&quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; was originally conceived by Wagner in 1845 as a sort of comic pendant to &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. Like &quot;Tristan&quot;, it was premiered in Munich under the baton of Bülow, on 21 June 1868, and became an immediate success. Millington describes &quot;Meistersinger&quot; as &quot;a rich, perceptive music drama widely admired for its warm humanity&quot;, but its strong German nationalist overtones have led some to cite it as an example of Wagner&#x27;s reactionary politics and antisemitism.

===== Completing the &quot;Ring&quot; =====
When Wagner returned to writing the music for the last act of &quot;Siegfried&quot; and for &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; (&quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;) as the final part of the &quot;Ring&quot;, his style had changed once more to something more recognisable as &quot;operatic&quot; than the aural world of &quot;Rheingold&quot; and &quot;Walküre&quot;, though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs. This was in part because the libretti of the four &quot;Ring&quot; operas had been written in reverse order, so that the book for &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; was conceived more &quot;traditionally&quot; than that of &quot;Rheingold&quot;; still, the self-imposed strictures of the &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; had become relaxed. The differences also result from Wagner&#x27;s development as a composer during the period in which he wrote &quot;Tristan&quot;, &quot;Meistersinger&quot; and the Paris version of &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;. From Act 3 of &quot;Siegfried&quot; onwards, the &quot;Ring&quot; becomes more chromatic melodically, more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs.

Wagner took 26 years from writing the first draft of a libretto in 1848 until he completed &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; in 1874. The &quot;Ring&quot; takes about 15 hours to perform and is the only undertaking of such size to be regularly presented on the world&#x27;s stages.

===== &quot;Parsifal&quot; =====
Wagner&#x27;s final opera, &quot;Parsifal&quot; (1882), which was his only work written especially for his Bayreuth Festspielhaus and which is described in the score as a &quot;Bühnenweihfestspiel&quot; (&quot;festival play for the consecration of the stage&quot;), has a storyline suggested by elements of the legend of the Holy Grail. It also carries elements of Buddhist renunciation suggested by Wagner&#x27;s readings of Schopenhauer. Wagner described it to Cosima as his &quot;last card&quot;. It remains controversial because of its treatment of Christianity, its eroticism, and its expression, as perceived by some commentators, of German nationalism and antisemitism. Despite the composer&#x27;s own description of the opera to King Ludwig as &quot;this most Christian of works&quot;, Ulrike Kienzle has commented that &quot;Wagner&#x27;s turn to Christian mythology, upon which the imagery and spiritual contents of &quot;Parsifal&quot; rest, is idiosyncratic and contradicts Christian dogma in many ways.&quot; Musically the opera has been held to represent a continuing development of the composer&#x27;s style, and Millington describes it as &quot;a diaphanous score of unearthly beauty and refinement&quot;.

=== Non-operatic music ===
Apart from his operas, Wagner composed relatively few pieces of music. These include his Symphony in C major (written at the age of 19), the &quot;Faust Overture&quot; (the only completed part of an intended symphony on the subject), some concert overtures, and choral and piano pieces. His most commonly performed work that is not an extract from an opera is the &quot;Siegfried Idyll&quot; for chamber orchestra, which has several motifs in common with the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. The &quot;Wesendonck Lieder&quot; are also often performed, either in the original piano version or with orchestral accompaniment. More rarely performed are the &quot;American Centennial March&quot; (1876), and &quot;Das Liebesmahl der Apostel&quot; (&quot;The Love Feast of the Apostles&quot;), a piece for male choruses and orchestra composed in 1843 for the city of Dresden.

After completing &quot;Parsifal&quot;, Wagner expressed his intention to turn to the writing of symphonies, and several sketches dating from the late 1870s and early 1880s have been identified as work towards this end. The overtures and certain orchestral passages from Wagner&#x27;s middle- and late-stage operas are commonly played as concert pieces. For most of these, Wagner wrote or rewrote short passages to ensure musical coherence. The &quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; from &quot;Lohengrin&quot; is frequently played as the bride&#x27;s processional wedding march in English-speaking countries.

=== Prose writings ===
Wagner was an extremely prolific writer, authoring many books, poems, and articles, as well as voluminous correspondence. His writings covered a wide range of topics, including autobiography, politics, philosophy, and detailed analyses of his own operas.

Wagner planned for a collected edition of his publications as early as 1865; he believed that such an edition would help the world understand his intellectual development and artistic aims. The first such edition was published between 1871 and 1883, but was doctored to suppress or alter articles that were an embarrassment to him (e.g. those praising Meyerbeer), or by altering dates on some articles to reinforce Wagner&#x27;s own account of his progress. Wagner&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Mein Leben&quot; was originally published for close friends only in a very small edition (15–18 copies per volume) in four volumes between 1870 and 1880. The first public edition (with many passages suppressed by Cosima) appeared in 1911; the first attempt at a full edition (in German) appeared in 1963.

There have been modern complete or partial editions of Wagner&#x27;s writings, including a centennial edition in German edited by Dieter Borchmeyer (which, however, omitted the essay &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; and &quot;Mein Leben&quot;). The English translations of Wagner&#x27;s prose in eight volumes by William Ashton Ellis (1892–1899) are still in print and commonly used, despite their deficiencies. The first complete historical and critical edition of Wagner&#x27;s prose works was launched in 2013 at the Institute for Music Research at the University of Würzburg; this will result in at least eight volumes of text and several volumes of commentary, totalling over 5,000 pages. It was originally anticipated that the project will be completed by 2030.

A complete edition of Wagner&#x27;s correspondence, estimated to amount to between 10,000 and 12,000 items, is underway under the supervision of the University of Würzburg. As of January 2021, 25 volumes have appeared, covering the period to 1873.

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Influence on music ===

Wagner&#x27;s later musical style introduced new ideas in harmony, melodic process (leitmotif) and operatic structure. Notably from &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; onwards, he explored the limits of the traditional tonal system, which gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to atonality in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of &quot;Tristan&quot;, which include the so-called Tristan chord.
Wagner inspired great devotion. For a long period, many composers were inclined to align themselves with or against Wagner&#x27;s music. Anton Bruckner and Hugo Wolf were greatly indebted to him, as were César Franck, Henri Duparc, Ernest Chausson, Jules Massenet, Richard Strauss, Alexander von Zemlinsky, Hans Pfitzner and many others. Gustav Mahler was devoted to Wagner and his music: he sought him out on his 1875 visit to Vienna at the age of 15, and became a renowned Wagner conductor; his compositions were seen by Richard Taruskin as extending Wagner&#x27;s &quot;maximalization&quot; of &quot;the temporal and the sonorous&quot; in music to the world of the symphony. The harmonic revolutions of Claude Debussy and Arnold Schoenberg (both of whose &quot;oeuvres&quot; contain examples of tonal and atonal modernism) have often been traced back to &quot;Tristan&quot; and &quot;Parsifal&quot;. The Italian form of operatic realism known as verismo owed much to the Wagnerian concept of musical form.

Wagner made a major contribution to the principles and practice of conducting. His essay &quot;About Conducting&quot; (1869) advanced Hector Berlioz&#x27;s technique of conducting and claimed that conducting was a means by which a musical work could be re-interpreted, rather than simply a mechanism for achieving orchestral unison. He exemplified this approach in his own conducting, which was significantly more flexible than the disciplined approach of Felix Mendelssohn; in his view, this also justified practices that were later frowned upon, such as the rewriting of scores. Wilhelm Furtwängler felt that Wagner and Bülow, through their interpretative approach, inspired a whole new generation of conductors (including Furtwängler himself).

Among those from the late 20th century and beyond claiming inspiration from Wagner&#x27;s music are the German band Rammstein; Jim Steinman, who wrote songs for Meat Loaf, Bonnie Tyler, Air Supply, Celine Dion and others; and the electronic composer Klaus Schulze, whose 1975 album &quot;Timewind&quot; consists of two 30-minute tracks, &quot;Bayreuth Return&quot; and &quot;Wahnfried 1883&quot;. Joey DeMaio of the band Manowar has described Wagner as &quot;the father of heavy metal&quot;. The Slovenian group Laibach created the 2009 suite &quot;VolksWagner&quot;, using material from Wagner&#x27;s operas. Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound recording technique was, it has been claimed, heavily influenced by Wagner.

=== Influence on literature, philosophy and the visual arts ===

Wagner&#x27;s influence on literature and philosophy is significant. Millington has commented:[Wagner&#x27;s] protean abundance meant that he could inspire the use of literary motif in many a novel employing interior monologue; ... the Symbolists saw him as a mystic hierophant; the Decadents found many a frisson in his work.Friedrich Nietzsche was a member of Wagner&#x27;s inner circle during the early 1870s. Nietzche&#x27;s first published work, &quot;The Birth of Tragedy&quot;, proposed Wagner&#x27;s music as the Dionysian &quot;rebirth&quot; of European culture in opposition to Apollonian rationalist &quot;decadence&quot;. Nietzsche broke with Wagner following the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, believing that Wagner&#x27;s final phase represented a pandering to Christian pieties and a surrender to the new German Reich. Nevertheless, in &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, Nietzsche alluded to Wagner as the &quot;old sorcerer&quot;, a reference to the captivating power of Wagner&#x27;s music. Nietzsche expressed his displeasure with the later Wagner in &quot;The Case of Wagner&quot; and &quot;Nietzsche contra Wagner&quot;.

The poets Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Verlaine worshipped Wagner. Édouard Dujardin, whose influential novel &quot;Les Lauriers sont coupés&quot; is in the form of an interior monologue inspired by Wagnerian music, founded a journal dedicated to Wagner, &quot;La Revue wagnérienne&quot;, to which J. K. Huysmans and Téodor de Wyzewa contributed. In a list of major cultural figures influenced by Wagner, Bryan Magee includes D. H. Lawrence, Aubrey Beardsley, Romain Rolland, Gérard de Nerval, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Rainer Maria Rilke and several others.

In the 20th century, W. H. Auden once called Wagner &quot;perhaps the greatest genius that ever lived&quot;, while Thomas Mann and Marcel Proust were heavily influenced by him and discussed Wagner in their novels. He is also discussed in some of the works of James Joyce, as well as W. E. B. Du Bois, who featured &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot;. Wagnerian themes inhabit T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, which contains lines from &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; and &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;; and Verlaine&#x27;s poem on &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

Many of Wagner&#x27;s concepts, including his speculation about dreams, predated their investigation by Sigmund Freud. Wagner had publicly analysed the Oedipus myth before Freud was born in terms of its psychological significance, insisting that incestuous desires are natural and normal, and perceptively exhibiting the relationship between sexuality and anxiety. Georg Groddeck considered the &quot;Ring&quot; as the first manual of psychoanalysis.

=== Influence on cinema ===
Wagner&#x27;s concept of the use of leitmotifs and the integrated musical expression which they can enable has influenced many 20th and 21st century film scores. The critic Theodor Adorno has noted that the Wagnerian leitmotif &quot;leads directly to cinema music where the sole function of the leitmotif is to announce heroes or situations so as to allow the audience to orient itself more easily&quot;. Film scores citing Wagnerian themes include the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short &quot;What&#x27;s Opera, Doc?&quot; and Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, which both feature a version of the Ride of the Valkyries; Trevor Jones&#x27;s soundtrack to John Boorman&#x27;s film &quot;Excalibur&quot;; and the 2011 films &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot; (dir. David Cronenberg) and &quot;Melancholia&quot; (dir. Lars von Trier). Hans-Jürgen Syberberg&#x27;s 1977 film &quot;&quot;″s visual style and set design are strongly inspired by &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, musical excerpts from which are frequently used in the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

=== Opponents and supporters ===
Not all reaction to Wagner was positive. For a time, German musical life divided into two factions, supporters of Wagner and supporters of Johannes Brahms; the latter, with the support of the powerful critic Eduard Hanslick (of whom Beckmesser in &quot;Meistersinger&quot; is in part a caricature), championed traditional forms and led the conservative front against Wagnerian innovations. They were supported by the conservative leanings of some German music schools, including the conservatories at Leipzig under Ignaz Moscheles and at Cologne under the direction of Ferdinand Hiller. Another Wagner detractor was the French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan, who wrote to Hiller after attending Wagner&#x27;s Paris concert on 25 January 1860, at which Wagner conducted the overtures to &quot;Der fliegende Holländer&quot; and &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, the preludes to &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, and six other extracts from &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and &quot;Lohengrin&quot;: &quot;I had imagined that I was going to meet music of an innovative kind but was astonished to find a pale imitation of Berlioz ... I do not like all the music of Berlioz while appreciating his marvellous understanding of certain instrumental effects ... but here he was imitated and caricatured ... Wagner is not a musician, he is a disease.&quot;

Even those who, like Debussy, opposed Wagner (&quot;this old poisoner&quot;) could not deny his influence. Indeed, Debussy was one of many composers, including Tchaikovsky, who felt the need to break with Wagner precisely because his influence was so unmistakable and overwhelming. &quot;Golliwogg&#x27;s Cakewalk&quot; from Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; piano suite contains a deliberately tongue-in-cheek quotation from the opening bars of &quot;Tristan&quot;. Others who proved resistant to Wagner&#x27;s operas included Gioachino Rossini, who said &quot;Wagner has wonderful moments, and dreadful quarters of an hour.&quot; In the 20th century Wagner&#x27;s music was parodied by Paul Hindemith and Hanns Eisler, among others.

Wagner&#x27;s followers (known as Wagnerians or Wagnerites) have formed many societies dedicated to Wagner&#x27;s life and work.

=== Film and stage portrayals ===
Wagner has been the subject of many biographical films. The earliest was a silent film made by Carl Froelich in 1913 and featured in the title role the composer Giuseppe Becce, who also wrote the score for the film (as Wagner&#x27;s music, still in copyright, was not available). Other film portrayals of Wagner include: Alan Badel in &quot;Magic Fire&quot; (1955), Lyndon Brook in &quot;Song Without End&quot; (1960), Trevor Howard in &quot;Ludwig&quot; (1972), Paul Nicholas in &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975), and Richard Burton in &quot;Wagner&quot; (1983).

Jonathan Harvey&#x27;s opera &quot;Wagner Dream&quot; (2007) intertwines the events surrounding Wagner&#x27;s death with the story of Wagner&#x27;s uncompleted opera outline &quot;Die Sieger (The Victors)&quot;.

=== Bayreuth Festival ===

Since Wagner&#x27;s death, the Bayreuth Festival, which has become an annual event, has been successively directed by his widow, his son Siegfried, the latter&#x27;s widow Winifred Wagner, their two sons Wieland and Wolfgang Wagner, and, presently, two of the composer&#x27;s great-granddaughters, Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Katharina Wagner. Since 1973, the festival has been overseen by the Richard-Wagner-Stiftung (Richard Wagner Foundation), the members of which include some of Wagner&#x27;s descendants.

== Views ==


Wagner&#x27;s operas, writings, politics, beliefs and unorthodox lifestyle made him a controversial figure during his lifetime. Following his death, debate about his ideas and their interpretation, particularly in Germany during the 20th century, has continued.

=== Racism and antisemitism ===
Wagner&#x27;s hostile writings on Jews, including &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;, correspond to some existing trends of thought in Germany during the 19th century. Despite his very public views on this topic, throughout his life Wagner had Jewish friends, colleagues and supporters. There have been frequent suggestions that antisemitic stereotypes are represented in Wagner&#x27;s operas. The characters of Alberich and Mime in the &quot;Ring&quot;, Sixtus Beckmesser in &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, and Klingsor in &quot;Parsifal&quot; are sometimes claimed as Jewish representations, though they are not identified as such in the librettos of these operas. The topic is further complicated by claims, which may have been credited by Wagner, that he himself was of Jewish ancestry, via his supposed father Geyer; however, there is no evidence that Geyer had Jewish ancestors.

Some biographers have noted that Wagner in his final years developed an interest in the racialist philosophy of Arthur de Gobineau, notably Gobineau&#x27;s belief that Western society was doomed because of miscegenation between &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;inferior&quot; races. According to Robert Gutman, this theme is reflected in the opera &quot;Parsifal&quot;. Other biographers (such as Lucy Beckett) believe that this is not true, as the original drafts of the story date back to 1857 and Wagner had completed the libretto for &quot;Parsifal&quot; by 1877, but he displayed no significant public interest in Gobineau until 1880.

=== Other interpretations ===
Wagner&#x27;s ideas are amenable to socialist interpretations; many of his ideas on art were being formulated at the time of his revolutionary inclinations in the 1840s. Thus, for example, George Bernard Shaw wrote in &quot;The Perfect Wagnerite&quot; (1883):

[Wagner&#x27;s] picture of Niblunghome under the reign of Alberic is a poetic vision of unregulated industrial capitalism as it was made known in Germany in the middle of the 19th century by Engels&#x27;s book &quot;The Condition of the Working Class in England&quot;.

Left-wing interpretations of Wagner also inform the writings of Theodor Adorno among other Wagner critics. Walter Benjamin gave Wagner as an example of &quot;bourgeois false consciousness&quot;, alienating art from its social context. György Lukács contended that the ideas of the early Wagner represented the ideology of the &quot;true socialists&quot; (&quot;wahre Sozialisten&quot;), a movement referenced in Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; as belonging to the left wing of German bourgeois radicalism and associated with Feuerbachianism and Karl Theodor Ferdinand Grün, while Anatoly Lunacharsky said about the later Wagner: &quot;The circle is complete. The revolutionary has become a reactionary. The rebellious petty bourgeois now kisses the slipper of the Pope, the keeper of order.&quot;

The writer Robert Donington has produced a detailed, if controversial, Jungian interpretation of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle, described as &quot;an approach to Wagner by way of his symbols&quot;, which, for example, sees the character of the goddess Fricka as part of her husband Wotan&#x27;s &quot;inner femininity&quot;. Millington notes that Jean-Jacques Nattiez has also applied psychoanalytical techniques in an evaluation of Wagner&#x27;s life and works.

=== Nazi appropriation ===
Adolf Hitler was an admirer of Wagner&#x27;s music and saw in his operas an embodiment of his own vision of the German nation; in a 1922 speech he claimed that Wagner&#x27;s works glorified &quot;the heroic Teutonic nature ... Greatness lies in the heroic.&quot; Hitler visited Bayreuth frequently from 1923 onwards and attended the productions at the theatre. There continues to be debate about the extent to which Wagner&#x27;s views might have influenced Nazi thinking. Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855–1927), who married Wagner&#x27;s daughter Eva in 1908 but never met Wagner, was the author of &quot;The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century&quot;, approved by the Nazi movement. Chamberlain met Hitler several times between 1923 and 1927 in Bayreuth, but cannot credibly be regarded as a conduit of Wagner&#x27;s own views. The Nazis used those parts of Wagner&#x27;s thought that were useful for propaganda and ignored or suppressed the rest.

While Bayreuth presented a useful front for Nazi culture, and Wagner&#x27;s music was used at many Nazi events, the Nazi hierarchy as a whole did not share Hitler&#x27;s enthusiasm for Wagner&#x27;s operas and resented attending these lengthy epics at Hitler&#x27;s insistence. Some Nazi ideologists, most notably Alfred Rosenberg, rejected &quot;Parsifal&quot; as excessively Christian and pacifist.

 has researched evidence that indicates that it is possible that Wagner&#x27;s music was used at the Dachau concentration camp in 1933–1934 to &quot;reeducate&quot; political prisoners by exposure to &quot;national music&quot;. There has been no evidence to support claims, sometimes made, that his music was played at Nazi death camps during the Second World War, and Pamela Potter has noted that Wagner&#x27;s music was explicitly off-limits in the camps.

Because of the associations of Wagner with antisemitism and Nazism, the performance of his music in the State of Israel has been a source of controversy.

<doc id="25453" wikidata="Q271707" url="?curid=25453" title="Rheology">
<text>Rheology (; ) is the study of the flow of matter, primarily in a fluid (liquid or gas) state but also as &quot;soft solids&quot; or solids under conditions in which they respond with plastic flow rather than deforming elastically in response to an applied force. Rheology is the branch of physics that deals with the deformation and flow of materials, both solids and liquids.

The term &quot;&quot; was coined by Eugene C. Bingham, a professor at Lafayette College, in 1920 from a suggestion by a colleague, Markus Reiner. The term was inspired by the aphorism of Heraclitus (often mistakenly attributed to Simplicius), (, &#x27;everything flows&#x27;) and was first used to describe the flow of liquids and the deformation of solids. It applies to substances that have a complex microstructure, such as muds, sludges, suspensions, and polymers and other glass formers (e.g., silicates), as well as many foods and additives, bodily fluids (e.g., blood) and other biological materials, and other materials that belong to the class of soft matter such as food.

Newtonian fluids can be characterized by a single coefficient of viscosity for a specific temperature. Although this viscosity will change with temperature, it does not change with the strain rate. Only a small group of fluids exhibit such constant viscosity. The large class of fluids whose viscosity changes with the strain rate (the relative flow velocity) are called non-Newtonian fluids.

Rheology generally accounts for the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids by characterizing the minimum number of functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strain or strain rates. For example, ketchup can have its viscosity reduced by shaking (or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of different layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity), but water cannot. Ketchup is a shear-thinning material, like yogurt and emulsion paint (US terminology latex paint or acrylic paint), exhibiting thixotropy, where an increase in relative flow velocity will cause a reduction in viscosity, for example, by stirring. Some other non-Newtonian materials show the opposite behavior, rheopecty (viscosity increasing with relative deformation), and are called shear-thickening or dilatant materials. Since Sir Isaac Newton originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with strain-rate-dependent viscosity is also often called &quot;Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics&quot;.

The experimental characterisation of a material&#x27;s rheological behaviour is known as &quot;rheometry&quot;, although the term &quot;rheology&quot; is frequently used synonymously with rheometry, particularly by experimentalists. Theoretical aspects of rheology are the relation of the flow/deformation behaviour of material and its internal structure (e.g., the orientation and elongation of polymer molecules) and the flow/deformation behaviour of materials that cannot be described by classical fluid mechanics or elasticity.

== Scope ==

In practice, rheology is principally concerned with extending continuum mechanics to characterize the flow of materials that exhibit a combination of elastic, viscous and plastic behavior by properly combining elasticity and (Newtonian) fluid mechanics. It is also concerned with predicting mechanical behavior (on the continuum mechanical scale) based on the micro- or nanostructure of the material, e.g. the molecular size and architecture of polymers in solution or the particle size distribution in a solid suspension.
Materials with the characteristics of a fluid will flow when subjected to a stress, which is defined as the force per area. There are different sorts of stress (e.g. shear, torsional, etc.), and materials can respond differently under different stresses. Much of theoretical rheology is concerned with associating external forces and torques with internal stresses, internal strain gradients, and flow velocities.

Rheology unites the seemingly unrelated fields of plasticity and non-Newtonian fluid dynamics by recognizing that materials undergoing these types of deformation are unable to support a stress (particularly a shear stress, since it is easier to analyze shear deformation) in static equilibrium. In this sense, a solid undergoing plastic deformation is a fluid, although no viscosity coefficient is associated with this flow. Granular rheology refers to the continuum mechanical description of granular materials.

One of the major tasks of rheology is to establish by measurement the relationships between strains (or rates of strain) and stresses, although a number of theoretical developments (such as assuring frame invariants) are also required before using the empirical data. These experimental techniques are known as rheometry and are concerned with the determination of well-defined &quot;rheological material functions&quot;. Such relationships are then amenable to mathematical treatment by the established methods of continuum mechanics.

The characterization of flow or deformation originating from a simple shear stress field is called shear rheometry (or shear rheology). The study of extensional flows is called extensional rheology. Shear flows are much easier to study and thus much more experimental data are available for shear flows than for extensional flows.

== Viscoelasticity ==

* Fluid and solid character are relevant at long times:We consider the application of a constant stress (a so-called &quot;creep experiment&quot;):
** if the material, after some deformation, eventually resists further deformation, it is considered a solid
** if, by contrast, the material flows indefinitely, it is considered a fluid
* By contrast, &quot;elastic and viscous&quot; (or intermediate, viscoelastic) behaviour is relevant at short times (&quot;transient behaviour&quot;):We again consider the application of a constant stress:
** if the material deformation strain increases linearly with increasing applied stress, then the material is linear elastic within the range it shows recoverable strains. Elasticity is essentially a time independent processes, as the strains appear the moment the stress is applied, without any time delay.
** if the material deformation strain rate increases linearly with increasing applied stress, then the material is viscous in the Newtonian sense. These materials are characterized due to the time delay between the applied constant stress and the maximum strain.
** if the materials behaves as a combination of viscous and elastic components, then the material is viscoelastic. Theoretically such materials can show both instantaneous deformation as elastic material and a delayed time dependent deformation as in fluids.
* Plasticity is the behavior observed after the material is subjected to a &quot;yield stress&quot;:A material that behaves as a solid under low applied stresses may start to flow above a certain level of stress, called the &quot;yield stress&quot; of the material. The term &quot;plastic solid&quot; is often used when this plasticity threshold is rather high, while &quot;yield stress fluid&quot; is used when the threshold stress is rather low. However, there is no fundamental difference between the two concepts.

== Dimensionless numbers ==

=== Deborah number ===

On one end of the spectrum we have an inviscid or a simple Newtonian fluid and on the other end, a rigid solid; thus the behavior of all materials fall somewhere in between these two ends. The difference in material behavior is characterized by the level and nature of elasticity present in the material when it deforms, which takes the material behavior to the non-Newtonian regime. The non-dimensional Deborah number is designed to account for the degree of non-Newtonian behavior in a flow. The Deborah number is defined as the ratio of the characteristic time of relaxation (which purely depends on the material and other conditions like the temperature) to the characteristic time of experiment or observation. Small Deborah numbers represent Newtonian flow, while non-Newtonian (with both viscous and elastic effects present) behavior occurs for intermediate range Deborah numbers, and high Deborah numbers indicate an elastic/rigid solid. Since Deborah number is a relative quantity, the numerator or the denominator can alter the number. A very small Deborah number can be obtained for a fluid with extremely small relaxation time or a very large experimental time, for example.
=== Reynolds number ===

In fluid mechanics, the Reynolds number is a measure of the ratio of inertial forces (formula_1) to viscous forces (formula_2) and consequently it quantifies the relative importance of these two types of effect for given flow conditions. Under low Reynolds numbers viscous effects dominate and the flow is laminar, whereas at high Reynolds numbers inertia predominates and the flow may be turbulent. However, since rheology is concerned with fluids which do not have a fixed viscosity, but one which can vary with flow and time, calculation of the Reynolds number can be complicated.

It is one of the most important dimensionless numbers in fluid dynamics and is used, usually along with other dimensionless numbers, to provide a criterion for determining dynamic similitude. When two geometrically similar flow patterns, in perhaps different fluids with possibly different flow rates, have the same values for the relevant dimensionless numbers, they are said to be dynamically similar.

Typically it is given as follows:

:formula_3

where:
* &quot;u&quot;s – mean flow velocity, [m s−1]
* &quot;L&quot; – characteristic length, [m]
* &quot;μ&quot; – (absolute) dynamic fluid viscosity, [N s m−2] or [Pa s]
* &quot;ν&quot; – kinematic fluid viscosity: formula_4, [m2 s−1]
* &quot;ρ&quot; – fluid density, [kg m−3].

== Measurement ==
Rheometers are instruments used to characterize the rheological properties of materials, typically fluids that are melts or solution. These instruments impose a specific stress field or deformation to the fluid, and monitor the resultant deformation or stress. Instruments can be run in steady flow or oscillatory flow, in both shear and extension.

== Applications ==

Rheology has applications in materials science, engineering, geophysics, physiology, human biology and pharmaceutics. Materials science is utilized in the production of many industrially important substances, such as cement, paint, and chocolate, which have complex flow characteristics. In addition, plasticity theory has been similarly important for the design of metal forming processes. The science of rheology and the characterization of viscoelastic properties in the production and use of polymeric materials has been critical for the production of many products for use in both the industrial and military sectors.
Study of flow properties of liquids is important for pharmacists working in the manufacture of several dosage forms, such as simple liquids, ointments, creams, pastes etc. The flow behavior of liquids under applied stress is of great relevance in the field of pharmacy. Flow properties are used as important quality control tools to maintain the superiority of the product and reduce batch to batch variations.

=== Materials science ===

==== Polymers ====

Examples may be given to illustrate the potential applications of these principles to practical problems in the processing and use of rubbers, plastics, and fibers. Polymers constitute the basic materials of the rubber and plastic industries and are of vital importance to the textile, petroleum, automobile, paper, and pharmaceutical industries. Their viscoelastic properties determine the mechanical performance of the final products of these industries, and also the success of processing methods at intermediate stages of production.

In viscoelastic materials, such as most polymers and plastics, the presence of liquid-like behaviour depends on the properties of and so varies with rate of applied load, i.e., how quickly a force is applied. The silicone toy &#x27;Silly Putty&#x27; behaves quite differently depending on the time rate of applying a force. Pull on it slowly and it exhibits continuous flow, similar to that evidenced in a highly viscous liquid. Alternatively, when hit hard and directly, it shatters like a silicate glass.

In addition, conventional rubber undergoes a glass transition (often called a &quot;rubber-glass transition&quot;). E.g. The Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster was caused by rubber O-rings that were being used well below their glass transition temperature on an unusually cold Florida morning, and thus could not flex adequately to form proper seals between sections of the two solid-fuel rocket boosters.

==== Biopolymers ====
==== Sol-gel ====

With the viscosity of a sol adjusted into a proper range, both optical quality glass fiber and refractory ceramic fiber can be drawn which are used for fiber-optic sensors and thermal insulation, respectively. The mechanisms of hydrolysis and condensation, and the rheological factors that bias the structure toward linear or branched structures are the most critical issues of sol-gel science and technology.

=== Geophysics ===
The scientific discipline of geophysics includes study of the flow of molten lava and study of debris flows (fluid mudslides). This disciplinary branch also deals with solid Earth materials which only exhibit flow over extended time-scales. Those that display viscous behaviour are known as rheids. For example, granite can flow plastically with a negligible yield stress at room temperatures (i.e. a viscous flow). Long-term creep experiments (~10 years) indicate that the viscosity of granite and glass under ambient conditions are on the order of 1020 poises.

=== Physiology ===

Physiology includes the study of many bodily fluids that have complex structure and composition, and thus exhibit a wide range of viscoelastic flow characteristics. In particular there is a specialist study of blood flow called hemorheology. This is the study of flow properties of blood and its elements (plasma and formed elements, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets). Blood viscosity is determined by plasma viscosity, hematocrit (volume fraction of red blood cell, which constitute 99.9% of the cellular elements) and mechanical behaviour of red blood cells. Therefore, red blood cell mechanics is the major determinant of flow properties of blood.(The ocular Vitreous humor is subject to rheologic observations, particularly during studies of age-related vitreous liquefaction, or synaeresis.)

The leading characteristic for hemorheology has been shear thinning in steady shear flow. Other non-Newtonian rheological characteristics that blood can demonstrate includes pseudoplasticity, viscoelasticity, and thixotropy.

==== Red blood cell aggregation ====
There are two current major hypotheses to explain blood flow predictions and shear thinning responses. The two models also attempt to demonstrate the drive for reversible red blood cell aggregation, although the mechanism is still being debated. There is a direct effect of red blood cell aggregation on blood viscosity and circulation. The foundation of hemorheology can also provide information for modeling of other biofluids. The bridging or &quot;cross-bridging&quot; hypothesis suggests that macromolecules physically crosslink adjacent red blood cells into rouleaux structures. This occurs through adsorption of macromolecules onto the red blood cell surfaces. The depletion layer hypothesis suggests the opposite mechanism. The surfaces of the red blood cells are bound together by an osmotic pressure gradient that is created by depletion layers overlapping. The effect of rouleaux aggregation tendency can be explained by hematocrit and fibrinogen concentration in whole blood rheology. Some techniques researchers use are optical trapping and microfluidics to measure cell interaction in vitro.

==== Disease and diagnostics ====
Changes to viscosity has been shown to be linked with diseases like hyperviscosity, hypertension, sickle cell anemia, and diabetes. Hemorheological measurements and genomic testing technologies act as preventative measures and diagnostic tools.

Hemorheology has also been correlated with aging effects, especially with impaired blood fluidity, and studies have shown that physical activity may improve the thickening of blood rheology.

=== Zoology ===

Many animals make use of rheological phenomena, for example sandfish that exploit the granular rheology of dry sand to &quot;swim&quot; in it or land gastropods that use snail slime for adhesive locomotion. Certain animals produce specialized endogenous complex fluids, such as the sticky slime produced by velvet worms to immobilize prey or the fast-gelling underwater slime secreted by hagfish to deter predators.

=== Food rheology ===

Food rheology is important in the manufacture and processing of food products, such as cheese and gelato. An adequate rheology is important for the indulgence of many common foods, particularly in the case of sauces, dressings, yogurt, or fondue.

Thickening agents, or thickeners, are substances which, when added to an aqueous mixture, increase its viscosity without substantially modifying its other properties, such as taste. They provide body, increase stability, and improve suspension of added ingredients. Thickening agents are often used as food additives and in cosmetics and personal hygiene products. Some thickening agents are gelling agents, forming a gel. The agents are materials used to thicken and stabilize liquid solutions, emulsions, and suspensions. They dissolve in the liquid phase as a colloid mixture that forms a weakly cohesive internal structure. Food thickeners frequently are based on either polysaccharides (starches, vegetable gums, and pectin), or proteins.

=== Concrete rheology ===
Concrete&#x27;s and mortar&#x27;s workability is related to the rheological properties of the fresh cement paste. The mechanical properties of hardened concrete increase if less water is used in the concrete mix design, however reducing the water-to-cement ratio may decrease the ease of mixing and application. To avoid these undesired effects, superplasticizers are typically added to decrease the apparent yield stress and the viscosity of the fresh paste. Their addition highly improves concrete and mortar properties.

=== Filled polymer rheology ===
The incorporation of various types of fillers into polymers is a common means of reducing cost and to impart certain desirable mechanical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties to the resulting material. The advantages that filled polymer systems have to offer come with an increased complexity in the rheological behavior.

Usually when the use of fillers is considered, a compromise has to be made between the improved mechanical properties in the solid state on one side and the increased difficulty in melt processing, the problem of achieving uniform dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix and the economics of the process due to the added step of compounding on the other. The rheological properties of filled polymers are determined not only by the type and amount of filler, but also by the shape, size and size distribution of its particles. The viscosity of filled systems generally increases with increasing filler fraction. This can be partially ameliorated via broad particle size distributions via the Farris effect. An additional factor is the stress transfer at the filler-polymer interface. The interfacial adhesion can be substantially enhanced via a coupling agent that adheres well to both the polymer and the filler particles. The type and amount of surface treatment on the filler are thus additional parameters affecting the rheological and material properties of filled polymeric systems.

It is important to take into consideration wall slip when performing the rheological characterization of highly filled materials, as there can be a large difference between the actual strain and the measured strain.

== Rheologist ==

A rheologist is an interdisciplinary scientist or engineer who studies the flow of complex liquids or the deformation of soft solids. It is not a primary degree subject; there is no qualification of rheologist as such. Most rheologists have a qualification in mathematics, the physical sciences (e.g. chemistry, physics, geology, biology), engineering (e.g. mechanical, chemical, materials science, plastics engineering and engineering or civil engineering), medicine, or certain technologies, notably materials or food. Typically, a small amount of rheology may be studied when obtaining a degree, but a person working in rheology will extend this knowledge during postgraduate research or by attending short courses and by joining a professional association.

<text>A rifle is a long-barreled firearm designed for accurate shooting and higher stopping power, with a barrel that has a helical or spiralling pattern of grooves (rifling) cut into the bore wall. In keeping with their focus on accuracy, rifles are typically designed to be held with both hands and braced firmly against the shooter&#x27;s shoulder via a buttstock for stability during shooting. Rifles are used in warfare, law enforcement, hunting and target shooting sports.

The invention of rifling separated such firearms from the earlier smoothbore weapons (e.g., arquebuses, muskets, and other long guns), greatly elevating their accuracy and general effectiveness. The raised areas of a barrel&#x27;s rifling are called &quot;lands&quot;; they make contact with and exert torque on the projectile as it moves down the bore, imparting a spin. When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin persists and lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile due to conservation of angular momentum, increasing accuracy and hence effective range. The class of firearm was originally termed the rifled gun, with the verb &quot;to rifle&quot; referring to the early modern machining process of creating grooves with cutting tools. By the 20th century, the weapon had become so common that the modern noun &quot;rifle&quot; is now often used for any log-shaped handheld ranged weapon designed for well-aimed discharge activated by a trigger.

Like all typical firearms, a rifle&#x27;s projectile (bullet) is propelled by the contained deflagration of a combustible propellant compound (originally black powder and now nitrocellulose and other smokeless powders), although other propulsive means are used, such as compressed air in air rifles, which are popular for vermin control, small game hunting, competitive target shooting and casual sport shooting (&quot;plinking&quot;).

==Terminology==
Historically, rifles only fired a single projectile with each squeeze of the trigger. Modern rifles are commonly classified as single-shot, bolt-action, semi-automatic, or automatic. Single-shot, bolt-action, and semi-automatic rifles are limited by their designs to fire a single shot for each trigger pull. Only automatic rifles are capable of firing more than one round per trigger squeeze; however, some automatic rifles are limited to fixed bursts of two, three, or more rounds per squeeze.

Modern automatic rifles overlap to some extent in design and function with machine guns. In fact, many light machine guns are adaptations of existing automatic rifle designs, such as the RPK and M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle. A military&#x27;s light machine guns are typically chambered for the same caliber ammunition as its service rifles. Generally, the difference between an automatic rifle and a machine gun comes down to weight, cooling system, and ammunition feed system. Rifles, with their relatively lighter components (which overheat quickly) and smaller capacity magazines, are incapable of sustained automatic fire in the way that machine guns are; they trade this capability in favor of increased mobility. Modern military rifles are fed by magazines, while machine guns are generally belt-fed. Many machine guns allow the operator to quickly exchange barrels in order to prevent overheating, whereas rifles generally do not. Most machine guns fire from an open bolt in order to reduce the danger of &quot;cook-off&quot;, while almost all rifles fire from a closed bolt for accuracy. Machine guns are often crewed by more than one soldier; the rifle is an individual weapon.

The term &quot;rifle&quot; is sometimes used to describe larger rifled crew-served weapons firing explosive shells, for example, recoilless rifles and naval rifles.

In many works of fiction &quot;rifle&quot; refers to any weapon that has a stock and is shouldered before firing, even if the weapon is not rifled or does not fire solid projectiles (e.g. &quot;laser rifle&quot;).

==Historical overview==
The origins of rifling are difficult to trace, but some of the earliest European experiments seem to have been carried out during the 15th century. Archers had long realized that a twist added to the tail feathers of their arrows gave them greater accuracy. Early muskets produced large quantities of smoke and soot, which had to be cleaned from the action and bore of the musket frequently, either through the action of repeated bore scrubbing, or a deliberate attempt to create &quot;soot grooves&quot; that would allow for more shots to be fired from the firearm. 

While many people contributed to the development of the concept of rifling and rifles, Friedrich Engels claimed it as a German invention in his extensive writings about the history of the rifle, and the evolution and use of the technology.

Some of the earliest examples of European grooved gun barrels were reportedly manufactured during 1440, and further developed by Gaspard Kollner of Vienna , although other scholars allege they were a joint effort between Kollner and Augustus Kotter of Nuremberg . Military commanders preferred smoothbore weapons for infantry use because rifles were much more prone to problems due to powder fouling the barrel and because they took longer to reload and fire than muskets.

Rifles were created as an improvement in the accuracy of smoothbore muskets. In the early 18th century, Benjamin Robins, an English mathematician, realized that an elongated bullet would retain the momentum and kinetic energy of a musket ball, but would slice through the air with greater ease. The black powder used in early muzzle-loading rifles quickly fouled the barrel, making loading slower and more difficult. The greater range of the rifle was considered to be of little practical use since the smoke from black powder quickly obscured the battlefield and made it almost impossible to aim the weapon from a distance. Since musketeers could not afford to take the time to stop and clean their barrels in the middle of a battle, rifles were limited to use by sharpshooters and non-military uses like hunting.

Muskets were smoothbore, large caliber weapons using spherical ammunition fired at relatively low velocity. Due to the high cost and great difficulty of precision manufacturing, and the need to load readily from the muzzle, the musket ball was a loose fit in the barrel. Consequently, on firing the ball bounced off the sides of the barrel when fired and the final direction on leaving the muzzle was unpredictable.

The performance of early muskets defined the style of warfare at the time. Due to the lack of accuracy, soldiers were deployed in long lines (thus line infantry) to fire at the opposing forces. Precise aim was thus not necessary to hit an opponent. Muskets were used for comparatively rapid, imprecisely aimed volley fire, and the average soldier could be easily trained to use them.

In the Province of Pennsylvania USA, one of the most successful early rifles, the long rifle, was developed over the course of the 18th century. Compared to the more common Brown Bess, these Pennsylvania and Kentucky rifles had a tighter bore with no space between bullet and barrel, and still used balls instead of conical bullets. The balls the long rifle used were smaller, allowing the production of more rounds for a given amount of lead. These rifles also had longer barrels, allowing more accuracy, which were rifled with a helical groove. These first started appearing sometime before 1740, one early example being made by Jacob Dickert, a German immigrant. By 1750 there were a number of such manufacturers in the area. The longer barrel was a departure by local gunsmiths from their German roots, allowing bullets to achieve a higher speed (as the burning gunpowder was contained longer) before emerging from the barrel.

During the 1700s (18th century), colonial settlers, particularly those immigrating from Germany and Switzerland, adapted and improved upon their European rifles. The improved long rifles were used for precise shooting, aiming, and firing at individual targets, instead of the musket&#x27;s use for imprecise fire. During the American Revolution, the colonist troops favoured these more accurate rifles while their use was resisted by the British and Hessian troops.

By the time of the American Revolutionary War, these rifles were commonly used by frontiersmen, and Congress authorized the establishment of ten companies of riflemen. One of the most critical units was Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen, led by Daniel Morgan. This sharpshooting unit eventually proved itself integral to the Battle of Saratoga, and in the southern states where General Morgan commanded as well. Taking advantage of the rifle&#x27;s improved accuracy, Morgan&#x27;s sharpshooters picked off cannoneers and officers, reducing the impact of enemy artillery. This kind of advantage was considered pivotal in many battles, such as the battles of Cowpens, Saratoga, and King&#x27;s Mountain.

Later during the Napoleonic Wars, the British 95th Regiment (Green Jackets) and 60th Regiment, (Royal American), as well as sharpshooters and riflemen during the War of 1812, used the rifle to great effect during skirmishing. Because of a slower loading time than a musket, they were not adopted by the whole army. Since rifles were used by sharpshooters who did not routinely fire over other men&#x27;s shoulders, long length was not required to avoid the forward line. A shorter length made a handier weapon in which tight-fitting balls did not have to be rammed so far down the barrel.

The invention of the Minié ball in the 1840s solved the slow loading problem, and in the 1850s and 1860s rifles quickly replaced muskets on the battlefield. Many rifles, often referred to as rifled muskets, were very similar to the muskets they replaced, but the military also experimented with other designs. Breech-loading weapons proved to have a much faster rate of fire than muzzleloaders, causing military forces to abandon muzzle loaders in favor of breech-loading designs in the late 1860s. In the later part of the 19th century, rifles were generally single-shot, breech-loading guns, designed for aimed, discretionary fire by individual soldiers. Then, as now, rifles had a stock, either fixed or folding, to be braced against the shoulder when firing.

The adoption of cartridges and breech-loading in the 19th century was concurrent with the general adoption of rifles. In the early part of the 20th century, soldiers were trained to shoot accurately over long ranges with high-powered cartridges. World War I Lee–Enfield rifles (among others) were equipped with long-range &#x27;volley sights&#x27; for massed firing at ranges of up to . Individual shots were unlikely to hit, but a platoon firing repeatedly could produce a &#x27;beaten ground&#x27; effect similar to light artillery or machine guns.

Currently, rifles are the most common firearm in general use for hunting (with the exception of bird hunting, where shotguns are favored). Rifles derived from military designs have long been popular with civilian shooters.

==19th century==
During the Napoleonic Wars the British army established several experimental units known as &quot;Rifles&quot;, armed with the Baker rifle. These Rifle Regiments were deployed as skirmishers during the Peninsular War of 1807 to 1814 in Spain and Portugal, and proved more effective than skirmishers armed with muskets due to their accuracy and long range.

In Central Asia, Uzbeks, Kazakhs and Tadjiks in the course of the 19th century adopted a form of large-calibre rifle: the &quot;&quot; or &quot;karamultyk&quot;.

===Muzzle-loading===

Gradually, rifles appeared with cylindrical barrels cut with helical grooves, the surfaces between the grooves being &quot;lands&quot;. The innovation was shortly followed by the mass adoption of breech-loading weapons, as it was not practical to push an overbore bullet down through a rifled barrel. The dirt and grime from prior shots were pushed down ahead of a tight bullet or ball (which may have been a looser fit in the clean barrel before the first shot), and loading was far more difficult, as the lead had to be deformed to go down in the first place, reducing the accuracy due to deformation. Several systems were tried to deal with the problem, usually by resorting to an under-bore bullet that expanded upon firing.

The original muzzle-loading rifle, with a closely fitting ball to take the rifling grooves, was loaded with difficulty, particularly when foul, and for this reason was not generally used for military purposes. With the advent of rifling, the bullet itself did not initially change but was wrapped in a greased, cloth patch to grip the rifling grooves.

The first half of the 19th century saw a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet. In 1826 Henri-Gustave Delvigne, a French infantry officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne&#x27;s method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate.

Soon after, Louis-Etienne de Thouvenin invented the Carabine à tige, which had a stem at the bottom of the barrel that would deform and expand the base of the bullet when rammed, therefore enabling accurate contact with the rifling. However, the area around the stem clogged and got dirty easily.

====Minié system – the &quot;rifled musket&quot;====


The famous Minié system, invented by French Army Captain Claude-Étienne Minié, relied on a conical bullet (known as a Minié ball) with a hollow skirt at the base of the bullet. When fired, the skirt would expand from the pressure of the exploding charge and grip the rifling as the round was fired. The better seal gave more power, as less gas escaped past the bullet. Also, for the same bore (caliber) diameter a long bullet was heavier than a round ball. The extra grip also spun the bullet more consistently, which increased the range from about 50 yards for a smoothbore musket to about 300 yards for a rifle using the Minié system. The expanding skirt of the Minié ball also solved the problem that earlier tight-fitting bullets were difficult to load as black powder residue fouled the inside of the barrel. The Minié system allowed conical bullets to be loaded into rifles just as quickly as round balls in smooth bores, which allowed rifle muskets to replace muskets on the battlefield.

Minié system rifles, notably the U.S. Springfield and the British Enfield of the early 1860s featured prominently in the U.S. Civil War of 1861-1865, due to their enhanced power and accuracy. At the time of the Crimean War (1853-1856) the Minié rifle was considered the &quot;best in military use&quot;.

Over the 19th century, bullet design continued to evolve, the bullets becoming gradually smaller and lighter. By 1910 the standard blunt-nosed bullet had been replaced by the pointed, &#x27;spitzer&#x27; bullet, an innovation that increased range and penetration. Cartridge design evolved from simple paper tubes containing black powder and shot, to sealed brass cases with integral primers for ignition, and black powder was replaced by cordite, and then by other nitro-cellulose-based smokeless powder mixtures, propelling bullets to higher velocities than before.

The increased velocity meant that new problems arose, and so bullets went from using soft lead to harder lead, then to copper-jacketed, in order to better engage the spiral grooves without &quot;stripping&quot; them in the same way that a screw or bolt thread would be stripped if subjected to extreme forces.

===Breech loading===


From 1836, breech-loading rifles were introduced with the German Dreyse Needle gun, followed by the French Tabatière in 1857, by the British Calisher and Terry carbine made in Birmingham and later in 1864 by the better known British Snider–Enfield. Primitive chamber-locking mechanisms were soon replaced by bolt-action mechanisms, exemplified by the French Chassepot in 1866. Breech-loading was to have a major impact on warfare, as breech-loading rifles can be fired at a rate many times faster than muzzle-loaded rifles and - significantly - can be loaded from a prone rather than standing position. Firing prone (i.e., lying down) is more accurate than firing from a standing position, and a prone rifleman presents a much smaller target than a standing soldier. The higher accuracy and range, combined with reduced vulnerability generally benefited defense, while making the traditional battle between lines of standing and volleying infantrymen obsolete.

===Repeating rifle===
The mid-century drive for increased rates of fire led to the development of the first repeating rifles, a type of breechloader that can load multiple cartridges ahead of time to be stored on the weapon itself. This allowed for a continuous burst of fire during which the user could mechanically cycle in unused rounds without stopping to reload. Various enduring mechanisms would be invented, including bolt action, pump action, lever action, and revolving.

====Magazine-fed rifle====
Bolt, lever, and pump actions all allowed for the incorporation of a magazine to store pre-loaded shells. The Spencer repeating rifle was a breech-loading, manually-operated lever action rifle that was adopted by the United States. Over 20,000 were used during the American Civil War. It was the first adoption of a removable magazine-fed infantry rifle. The design was completed by Christopher Spencer in 1860. It used copper rimfire cartridges stored in a removable seven-round tube magazine, enabling the rounds to be fired one after another. A rifleman could exchange an emptied magazine for another.
The Winchester repeating rifle was invented in 1866 as a lever action.

====Revolving rifle====

Revolving rifles were an attempt to increase the rate of fire of rifles by combining them with the revolving firing mechanism that had been developed earlier for revolving pistols. Colt began experimenting with revolving rifles in the early-19th century, and other manufacturers like Remington later experimented with them as well. The Colt Revolving Rifle Model 1855, an early repeating rifle, became the first to be used by the U.S. Government and saw some limited action during the American Civil War. Revolvers, both rifles and pistols, tend to spray fragments of metal from the front of the cylinder.

==Modern==

In the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, military observers from Europe and the United States witnessed a major conflict fought with high velocity bolt-action rifles firing smokeless powder. The Battle of Mukden fought in 1905 consisted of nearly 343,000 Russian troops against over 281,000 Japanese troops. The Russian Mosin–Nagant Model 1891 in 7.62 mm was pitted against the Japanese Arisaka Type 30 bolt-action rifle in 6.5 mm; both had velocities well over .

Until the late 19th century rifles tended to be very long, some long rifles reaching approximately in length to maximize accuracy, making early rifles impractical for use by cavalry. However, following the advent of more powerful smokeless powder, a shorter barrel did not impair accuracy as much. As a result, cavalry saw limited, but noteworthy, usage in 20th-century conflicts.

The advent of the massed, rapid firepower of the machine gun, submachine gun and rifled artillery was so quick as to outstrip the development of any way to attack a trench defended by riflemen and machine gunners. The carnage of World War I was perhaps the greatest vindication and vilification of the rifle as a military weapon.

The M1 Garand was a semi-automatic rapid-fire rifle developed for modern warfare use in World War II.

During and after World War II it became accepted that most infantry engagements occurred at ranges of less than 300 m; the range and power of the large full-powered rifle cartridges were &quot;overkill&quot;, requiring weapons heavier than otherwise necessary. This led to Germany&#x27;s development of the 7.92×33mm (short) round, the MKb-42, and ultimately, the assault rifle. Today, an infantryman&#x27;s rifle is optimized for ranges of 300 m or less, and soldiers are trained to deliver individual rounds or bursts of fire within these distances. Typically, the application of accurate, long-range fire is the domain of the marksman and the sniper in warfare, and of enthusiastic target shooters in peacetime. The modern marksman rifle and sniper rifle are usually capable of accuracy better than 0.3 mrad at 100 yards (1 arcminute).

==3D printed rifle==

The Grizzly is a 3D printed .22-caliber rifle created around August 2013. It was created using a Stratasys Dimension 1200es printer. It was created by a Canadian only known by the pseudonym &quot;Matthew&quot; who told The Verge that he was in his late 20s, and his main job was making tools for the construction industry.

The original Grizzly fired a single shot before breaking. Grizzly 2.0 fired fourteen bullets before getting damaged due to the strain.

In October 2020, another 3D-printed 9mm rifle known as the &quot;FGC-9mm&quot; was created. It is reported that it can be made in 2 weeks with $500 of tools. A second model was later made in April 2021.

==Youth rifle==

A youth rifle is a rifle designed or modified for fitting children or other small-framed shooters. A youth rifle is often a single-shot .22 caliber rifle, or a bolt-action rifle, although some youth rifles are semi-automatic. They are usually very light, with a greatly shortened length of pull, which is necessary to accommodate children. Youth stocks are available for many popular rifles, such as the Ruger 10/22, a semi-automatic .22 LR rifle, allowing a youth rifle to be made from a standard rifle by simply changing the stock. The typical ages of shooters for such rifles vary from about age 5+.

==Technical aspects==

===Rifling===

The usual form of rifling was helical grooves in a round bore.

Some early rifled firearms had barrels with a twisted polygonal bore. The Whitworth rifle was the first such type designed to spin the round for accuracy. Bullets for these guns were made to match the shape of the bore so the bullet would grip the rifle bore and take a spin that way. These were generally large caliber weapons, and the ammunition still did not fit tightly in the barrel. Many different shapes and degrees of spiraling were used in experimental designs. One widely produced example was the Metford rifling in the Pattern 1888 Lee–Metford service rifle. Although uncommon, polygonal rifling is still used in some weapons today, one example being the Glock line of pistols (which fire standard bullets). Many of the early designs were prone to dangerous backfiring, which could lead to the destruction of the weapon and serious injury to the person firing it.

===Barrel wear===

As the bullet enters the barrel, it inserts itself into the rifling, a process that gradually wears down the barrel, and also causes the barrel to heat up more rapidly. Therefore, some machine guns are equipped with quick-change barrels that can be swapped every few thousand rounds, or in earlier designs, were water-cooled. Unlike older carbon steel barrels, which were limited to around 1,000 shots before the extreme heat caused accuracy to fade, modern stainless steel barrels for target rifles are much more resistant to wear, allowing many thousands of rounds to be fired before accuracy drops. (Many shotguns and small arms have chrome-lined barrels to reduce wear and enhance corrosion resistance. This is rare on rifles designed for extreme accuracy, as the plating process is difficult and liable to reduce the effect of the rifling.) Modern ammunition has a hardened lead core with a softer outer cladding or jacket, typically of an alloy of copper and nickel – cupro-nickel. Some ammunition is coated with molybdenum disulfide to further reduce internal friction – the so-called &#x27;moly-coated&#x27; bullet.

===Rate of fire===

Rifles were initially single-shot, muzzle-loading weapons. During the 18th century, breech-loading weapons were designed, which allowed the rifleman to reload while under cover, but defects in manufacturing and the difficulty in forming a reliable gas-tight seal prevented widespread adoption. During the 19th century, multi-shot repeating rifles using lever, pump or linear bolt actions became standard, further increasing the rate of fire and minimizing the fuss involved in loading a firearm. The problem of proper seal creation had been solved with the use of brass cartridge cases, which expanded in an elastic fashion at the point of firing and effectively sealed the breech while the pressure remained high, then relaxed back enough to allow for easy removal. By the end of the 19th century, the leading bolt-action design was that of Paul Mauser, whose action—wedded to a reliable design possessing a five-shot magazine—became a world standard through two world wars and beyond. The Mauser rifle was paralleled by Britain&#x27;s ten-shot Lee–Enfield and America&#x27;s 1903 Springfield Rifle models. The American M1903 closely copied Mauser&#x27;s original design.

===Range===

Barrel rifling dramatically increased the range and accuracy of the musket. Indeed, throughout its development, the rifle&#x27;s history has been marked by increases in range and accuracy. From the Minié rifle and beyond, the rifle has become ever more potent at long-range strikes.

In recent decades, large-caliber anti-materiel rifles, typically firing between 12.7 mm and 20 mm caliber cartridges, have been developed. The US Barrett M82A1 is probably the best-known such rifle. A second example is the AX50 by Accuracy International. These weapons are typically used to strike critical, vulnerable targets such as computerized command and control vehicles, radio trucks, radar antennae, vehicle engine blocks and the jet engines of enemy aircraft. Anti-materiel rifles can be used against human targets, but the much higher weight of rifle and ammunition, and the massive recoil and muzzle blast, usually make them less than practical for such use. The Barrett M82 is designed with a maximum effective range of , although it has a confirmed kill distance of in Afghanistan during Operation Anaconda in 2002. The record for the longest confirmed kill shot stands at , set by an unnamed soldier with Canada&#x27;s elite special operations unit Joint Task Force 2 using a McMillan TAC-50 sniper rifle.

===Bullet rotational speed (RPM)===

Bullets leaving a rifled barrel can spin at a rotational speed of over 100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm) (or over about 1.67 kilohertz, since 1 RPM = 1/60 Hz). The rotational speed depends both on the muzzle velocity of the bullet and the pitch of the rifling. Excessive rotational speed can exceed the bullet&#x27;s designed limits and the inadequate centripetal force will fail to keep the bullet from disintegrating in a radial fashion. The rotational speed of the bullet can be calculated by using the formula below.

*MV/ twist rate = rotational speed

Using metric units, the formula divides the number of millimeters in a meter (1000) by the barrel twist in millimeters (the length of travel along the barrel per full rotation). This number is then multiplied by the muzzle velocity in meters per second (m/s) and the number of seconds in a minute (60).
*MV (in m/s) × (1000 mm /twist) × 60 s/min = Bullet RPM
For example, using a barrel that has a twist rate of 190 mm with a muzzle velocity of 900 m/s:
*900 m/s × (1000 mm /(190 mm)) × 60 s/min = 284 210 RPM

Using imperial units, the formula divides the number of inches in a foot (12) by the rate of twist that the barrel has. This number is multiplied by the muzzle velocity (MV) and the number of seconds in a minute (60). For example, a bullet with a muzzle velocity of leaving a barrel that twists once per foot (1/12&quot;) would rotate at 180,000rpm.
*MV (in fps) × (12 in. /twist rate) × 60 s/min. = Bullet RPM
For example, using a barrel that has a twist rate of 1 turn in 8&quot; with a muzzle velocity of 3000 ft/s:
*3000 fps × (12&quot;/(8&quot;/rotation)) × 60 s/min. = 270,000 RPM

===Caliber===

Rifles may be chambered in a variety of calibers (bullet or barrel diameters), from as low as 4.4 mm (.17 inch) varmint calibers to as high as 20 mm (.80 caliber) in the case of the largest anti-tank rifles. The term caliber essentially refers to the width of the bullet fired through a rifle&#x27;s barrel. Armies have consistently attempted to find and procure the most lethal and accurate caliber for their firearms.

The standard calibers used by the world&#x27;s militaries tend to follow worldwide trends. These trends have significantly changed during the centuries of firearm design and re-design. Muskets were normally chambered for large calibers, such as .50 or .59 (12.7 mm or 15 mm), with the theory that these large bullets caused the most damage.

During World War I and II, most rifles were chambered in .30 caliber (7.62 mm), a combination of power and speed. Examples would be the .303 British Lee–Enfield, the American M1903 .30-06, and the German 8mm Mauser K98.

An exception was the Italian Modello 91 rifle, which used the 6.5×52mm Mannlicher–Carcano cartridge.

Detailed study of infantry combat during and after World War II revealed that most small-arms engagements occurred within 100 meters, meaning that the power and range of the traditional .30-caliber weapons (designed for engagements at 500 meters and beyond) were essentially wasted. The single greatest predictor of an individual soldier&#x27;s combat effectiveness was the number of rounds he fired. Weapons designers and strategists realized that service rifles firing smaller-caliber projectiles would allow troops to carry far more ammunition for the same weight. The lower recoil and more generous magazine capacities of small-caliber weapons also allow troops a much greater volume of fire, compared to historical battle rifles. Smaller, faster traveling, less stable projectiles have also demonstrated greater terminal ballistics and therein, a greater lethality than traditional .30-caliber rounds. Most modern service rifles fire a projectile of approximately 5.56 mm. Examples of firearms in this range are the American 5.56 mm M16 and the Russian 5.45×39mm AK-74.

<text>The Republic of Texas (), or simply Texas, was a country in North America. It existed for close to 10 years, from March 2, 1836, to February 19, 1846. Texas shared borders with Mexico, the Republic of the Rio Grande, and the United States. The Republic had engaged in some complex relations with various countries. The United States was one of the key players that recognized Texas&#x27;s independence. However, they hesitated to annex the Republic due to domestic affairs with Mexico. European powers (France and Britain) had extended their recognition and wanted to engage in trade with Texas. These relations were very significant and shaped Texas&#x27;s republic. This had led to the annexation by the U.S. which led to the Mexican–American War.

Much of its territory was controlled by Mexico or Comancheria; Mexico considered it a rebellious province during its entire existence. It was bordered by Mexico to the west and southwest, the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast, the two U.S. states of Louisiana and Arkansas to the east and northeast, and United States territories encompassing parts of the current U.S. states of Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico to the north and west. The Anglo-American residents of the area and of the republic were referred to as Texians, while Texans of Mexican descent were referred to as Tejanos.

The Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas declared its independence from Mexico during the Texas Revolution in 1835–1836, when the Centralist Republic of Mexico abolished autonomy from states of the Mexican federal republic. Major fighting ended on April 21, 1836, but the Mexican Congress refused to recognize the independence of the Republic of Texas, as the Treaties of Velasco was signed by Mexican President General Antonio López de Santa Anna under duress as prisoner of the Texians. The majority of the Mexican Congress did not approve the agreement.

Intermittent conflicts between Mexico and Texas continued into the 1840s. The United States recognized the Republic of Texas in March 1837 but declined to annex the territory at that time.

Texas was annexed by the United States on December 29, 1845, and was admitted to the Union as the 28th state on that day, with the transfer of power from the Republic to the new state of Texas formally taking place on February 19, 1846.
However, the United States inherited the southern and western border-disputes with Mexico, which had refused to recognize Texas&#x27;s independence or to accept U.S. offers to purchase the territory. Consequently, the annexation led to the Mexican–American War (1846–1848).

==Borders==
The Republic of Texas claimed borders based upon the Treaties of Velasco between the newly created Republic of Texas and General Antonio López de Santa Anna. The eastern boundary had been defined by the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819 between the United States and the Spanish Empire, which recognized the Sabine River as the eastern boundary of Spanish Texas and western boundary of the Missouri Territory.

Under that treaty, the United States had renounced its claim to Spanish land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande, which it claimed to have acquired as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

The southern and western boundary of the Republic of Texas with Mexico was disputed throughout the republic&#x27;s existence, since Mexico refused to acknowledge the independence of Texas. Texas claimed the Rio Grande as its southern boundary, while Mexico insisted that the Nueces River was the boundary. In practice, much of the disputed territory was occupied by the Comanche people and outside the control of either state. Texian claims included the eastern portions of New Mexico, which was administered by Mexico throughout this period.

==History==
===Spanish Texas===

During the late Spanish colonial era, Texas had been one of the &quot;Provincias Internas&quot;, and the region is known in the historiography as Spanish Texas. Though claimed by Spain, it was not formally colonized by the empire until competing French interests at Fort St. Louis were a catalyst for Spain to establish permanent settlements in the area.

The region was long occupied and claimed by the existing indigenous groups of Native Americans. During the period from the 1690s–1710s, sporadic missionary expeditions took place before the Spanish established San Antonio as a permanent civilian settlement.

Spanish colonization in Texas was a slow process. Nevertheless, Spain tried to establish missions and presidios to spread Catholicism. They encountered challenges, however, because these lands were heavily populated with indigenous people/populations. Despite this, the Spanish influence has left a long-lasting mark on Texas, shaping its cultural landscape and laying the foundation for future settlements.

Following defeats by the British in North America and Europe, in 1762 Bourbon France ceded to Bourbon Spain most of its claims to the interior of North America, including its claim to Texas, as well as the vast interior west of the Mississippi River, which became Spanish Louisiana. During the years 1799 to 1803, the height of the Napoleonic Empire in France, Spain returned Louisiana to France.

Following the loss of numerous troops and failure to suppress the revolution by slaves and free people of color in Saint-Domingue, Napoleon decided to abandon North America; he sold what became known as the Louisiana Purchase to the United States. The status of Texas during these transfers was unclear and was not resolved until 1819, when the Adams–Onís Treaty between Spain and the United States ceded Spanish Florida to the United States, and established a clear boundary between Texas and Louisiana.

Starting in 1810 with the outbreak of the Mexican War of Independence, New Spain sought a different relationship with the Spanish crown. Some Anglo Americans fought on the side of Mexico against Spain in filibustering expeditions. One of these, the Gutiérrez–Magee Expedition (also known as the Republican Army of the North), consisted of a group of about 130 Anglo Americans under the leadership of Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara. Gutiérrez de Lara initiated Mexico&#x27;s secession from Spain with efforts contributed by Augustus Magee. Bolstered by new recruits, and led by Samuel Kemper (who succeeded Magee after his death in battle in 1813), the expedition gained a series of victories against soldiers led by the Spanish governor, Manuel María de Salcedo.

Their victory at the Battle of Rosillo Creek convinced Salcedo to surrender on April 1, 1813; he was executed two days later. On April 6, 1813, the victorious Republican Army of the North drafted a constitution and declared the independent Republic of Texas, with Gutiérrez as its president. Soon disillusioned with the Mexican leadership, the Anglo Americans under Kemper returned to the United States.

The ephemeral Republic of Texas came to an end on August 18, 1813, with the Battle of Medina, where the Spanish Army crushed the Republican Army of the North. The harsh reprisals against the Texas rebels created a deep distrust of the Royal Spanish authorities. Veterans of the Battle of Medina became leaders of the Texas Revolution and signatories of the Texas Declaration of Independence from Mexico 20 years later.

After the failure of the expedition, there would be no serious push for a &quot;Republic of Texas&quot; for another six years, until 1819. That year Virginian filibuster James Long invaded Spanish Texas in an attempt to liberate the region. The Americans were eager to gain territory where they could extend slavery for agricultural and other development.

Eli Harris led 120 men across the Sabine River to Nacogdoches. Long followed two weeks later with an additional 75 men. On June 22, the combined force declared a new government, with Long as president and a 21-member Supreme Council. The following day, they issued a declaration of independence, modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence. The document cited several grievances, including &quot;Spanish rapacity&quot; and &quot;odious tyranny&quot; and promised religious freedom, freedom of the press, and free trade. The council allocated 10 square miles of land to each member of the expedition, and authorized the sale of additional land to raise cash for the fledgling government. Within a month, the expedition had grown to 300 members.

The new government established trading outposts near Anahuac along the Trinity River and the Brazos River. Long&#x27;s Republic of Texas also established the first English-language newspaper ever published in Texas, named the &quot;Texas Republican&quot;. It operated only for the month of August 1819.

Long contacted Jean Lafitte, a French pirate who ran a large smuggling operation on Galveston Island. His letter suggested that the new government establish an admiralty court at Galveston, and offered to appoint Lafitte governor of Galveston. Unbeknownst to Long, Lafitte was serving as a Spanish spy. While making numerous promises – and excuses – to Long, Lafitte gathered information about the expedition and passed it on to Spanish authorities. By July 16, the Spanish Consul in New Orleans had warned the viceroy in Mexico City that &quot;I am fully persuaded that the present is the most serious expedition that has threatened the Kingdom&quot;.

Lafitte failed to assist the expedition, which soon ran low on provisions. Long dispersed his men to forage for food. Discipline began to break down, and many men, including James Bowie, returned home. In early October, Lafitte reached an agreement with Long to make Galveston an official port for the new country and name Lafitte as governor. Within weeks, 500 Spanish troops arrived in Texas and marched on Nacogdoches. Long and his men withdrew. Over 40 of his men were captured. Long escaped to Natchitoches, Louisiana. Others fled to Galveston and settled along Bolivar Peninsula.

Undeterred in defeat, Long returned again in 1820. He joined the refugees at Bolivar Peninsula on April 6, 1820, leading more reinforcements. He continued to raise money to equip a second expedition. Fifty men attempted to join him from the United States, but they were arrested by American authorities as they tried to cross into Texas. The men who had joined Long were disappointed they were paid in scrip, and they gradually began to desert. By December 1820, Long commanded only 50 men.

With the aid of Ben Milam and others, Long revitalized the Supreme Council. He later broke with Milam. The expedition led an uncertain existence until September 19, 1821, when Long and 52 men marched inland to capture Presidio La Bahía. The town fell easily on October 4, but four days later Long was forced to surrender by Spanish troops. He was taken prisoner and sent to Mexico City; about six months later he was shot and killed by a guard, who reportedly was bribed to do so by José Félix Trespalacios. The Long Expeditions were ended.

===Mexican Texas===

These colonies were limited in quotas and to specific locations. Since Mexican independence had been ratified by Spain shortly thereafter, Austin later traveled to Mexico City to secure the support of the new country for his right to colonize. The establishment of Mexican Texas coincided with the Austin-led colonization, leading to animosity between Mexican authorities and the acceleration of American immigration to Texas. The First Mexican Empire was short-lived, being replaced by a republican form of government in 1823. In 1824, the sparsely populated territories of Texas and Coahuila were joined to form the state of Coahuila y Tejas. The capital was controversially located in southern Coahuila, the part farthest from Texas.

Mexico&#x27;s independence from Spain in 1821, had Texas become part of the newly formed Mexican state. During this period, Stephen F. Austin led a group of American settlers, known as the Old Three Hundred, who were granted permission to establish colonies in Texas. However, tensions between the Mexican government and these American settlers grew, fueled by cultural differences, economic disparities, and the issue of slavery. The Mexican government&#x27;s attempts to restrict American immigration and enforce its laws led to increased resentment among the settlers, culminating in the Texas Revolution.

Following Austin&#x27;s lead, additional groups of immigrants, known as Empresarios, continued to colonize Mexican Texas from the United States. A spike in the price of cotton, and the success of plantations in Mississippi encouraged large numbers of white Americans to migrate to Texas and obtain slaves to try to replicate the plantation business model. In the Law of April 6, 1830, Mexican President Anastasio Bustamante outlawed American immigration to Texas, following several conflicts with the Empresarios over the status of slavery, which had been abolished in Mexico in 1829, but which the Texians refused to end. Texians replaced slavery with long-term indentured servitude contracts signed by &quot;liberated&quot; slaves in the United States to work around the abolition of slavery. Angered at the interference of the Mexican government, the Empresarios held the Convention of 1832, which was the first formal step in what became the Texas Revolution.

===Texas Revolution===

By 1834, American immigrants in the area greatly outnumbered Mexicans. Following a series of minor skirmishes between Mexican authorities and the immigrants, the Mexican government increased its military presence in Texas throughout 1834 and early 1835. Mexico created a new constitution formalized under President Antonio Santa Anna, called Siete Leyes, and began to strengthen the central government. American immigrants described it as restoring pre-enlightened forms of governance, depriving them of their rights and liberties. They objected to mandatory Catholicism and when Santa Anna began enforcing anti-slavery laws, many feared religious coercion could be next.

In 1835, the central government split Coahuila y Tejas into two separate departments. The Texian leadership under Austin began to organize its own military, and hostilities broke out on October 2, 1835, at the Battle of Gonzales, the first engagement of the Texas Revolution. In November 1835, a provisional government known as the Consultation was established to oppose the Santa Anna regime (but stopped short of declaring independence from Mexico). On March 1, 1836, the Convention of 1836 came to order, and the next day declared independence from Mexico, establishing the Republic of Texas.

===Independent republic===
====Politics====

Sam Houston was elected as the new President of the Republic of Texas on September 5, 1836. The second Congress of the Republic of Texas convened a month later, in October 1836, at Columbia (now West Columbia). Stephen F. Austin, known as the &quot;Father of Texas&quot;, died December 27, 1836, after serving two months as Secretary of State for the new Republic.

In 1836, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia), before President Sam Houston moved the capital to Houston in 1837. The next president, Mirabeau B. Lamar, moved the capital to the new town of Austin in 1839.

The first flag of the republic was the &quot;Burnet Flag&quot; (a single gold star on an azure field), followed in 1839 by official adoption of the Lone Star Flag.

Internal politics of the Republic were focused on two factions. The nationalist faction, led by Lamar, advocated the continued independence of Texas, the expulsion of the Native Americans, and the expansion of Texas to the Pacific Ocean. Their opponents, led by Houston, advocated the annexation of Texas to the United States and peaceful coexistence with the Native Americans where possible. The Congress of the Republic of Texas even passed a resolution over Houston&#x27;s veto, claiming The Californias for Texas. The 1844 Republic of Texas presidential election split the electorate dramatically, with the newer western regions of the Republic preferring the nationalist candidate Edward Burleson, while the cotton country, particularly east of the Trinity River, went for Anson Jones.

====Armed conflicts====

The Comanche Indians, whose territory included northwest Texas, furnished the main tribal opposition to the Republic, manifested in multiple raids on Mexican, indigenous, and European settlements. In the late 1830s, Sam Houston negotiated peace between Texas and the Comanches. When Lamar ascended to presidency in 1838 he reversed the Houston administration&#x27;s policy towards the Native Americans. War soon resumed with the Comanches and Lamar ordered an invasion of Comancheria itself. In retaliation, the Comanches attacked Texas in a series of raids. After peace talks in 1840 ended with the massacre of 34 Comanche leaders in San Antonio, the Comanches launched a major attack deep into Texas, known as the Great Raid of 1840. Under command of Potsanaquahip (Buffalo Hump), 500 to 700 Comanche cavalry warriors swept down the Guadalupe River valley, killing and plundering all the way to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, where they sacked the towns of Victoria and Linnville. The Comanches retreated after being pursued by 186 rangers and were caught at the Battle of Plum Creek, in which they lost the plunder they had taken. Houston became president again in 1841 and, with both Texians and Comanches exhausted by war, a new peace was established.

Although Texas achieved self-government, Mexico refused to recognize its independence. On March 5, 1842, a Mexican force of over 500 men, led by Ráfael Vásquez, invaded Texas for the first time since the revolution. They soon headed back to the Rio Grande after briefly occupying San Antonio. About 1,400 Mexican troops, led by the French mercenary general Adrián Woll, launched a second attack and captured San Antonio on September 11, 1842. A Texas militia retaliated at the Battle of Salado Creek while simultaneously, a mile and a half away, Mexican soldiers massacred a militia of fifty-three Texas volunteers who had surrendered after a skirmish. That night, upon their defeat, the Mexican Army retreated from San Antonio, back to Mexico, while being pursued by Texas soldiers. The Texas Army took the city of Laredo, at which point they were given official orders from Sam Houston to return to San Antonio. Several soldiers ignored this order, and launched a failed battle to retake Ciudad Mier.

The Naval Battle of Campeche took place on April 30, 1843, and May 16, 1843. The battle featured the most advanced warships of its day, including the Mexican steamer &quot;Guadalupe&quot; and the equally formidable &quot;Montezuma&quot; which engaged a squadron of vessels from the Republic of Yucatan and the Republic of Texas. The latter force consisted of the Texas Navy flagship sloop-of-war &quot;Austin&quot;, commanded by Commodore Edwin Ward Moore, the brig &quot;Wharton&quot;, and several schooners and five gunboats from the Republic of Yucatán, commanded by former Texas Navy Captain James D. Boylan. Texas had declared its independence in 1836, but by 1843, Mexico had refused to recognize it. In Yucatán, a similar rebellion had begun and was fought off-and-on from 1836 to 1846. The battle ended in a combined Yucatecan and Texian victory. A scene from this battle is engraved on the cylinder of every Colt 1851 Navy, 1860 Army, and 1861 Navy revolver.

The Republic of Texas&#x27;s relationship with Native American tribes was something that always had conflict. Tribes like the Comanche and the Cherokee had a lot of the territory claimed by the Republic. This led to a lot of controversy between them. While some treaties were signed to establish peace between them, they often still violated the terms resulting in ongoing violence. The Republic faced challenges in maintaining a sufficient military force to help defend its borders against Native American tribes. There was limited resources so Texas finally came up with a treaty. They called it the Treaty of Tehuacana Creek that was signed in 1844.

Mexico&#x27;s attacks on Texas intensified conflicts between political factions, including an incident known as the Texas Archive War. To &quot;protect&quot; the Texas national archives, President Sam Houston ordered them removed from Austin. The archives were eventually returned to Austin, albeit at gunpoint. The Texas Congress admonished Houston for the incident, and this episode in Texas history solidified Austin as Texas&#x27;s seat of government for the Republic and the future state.

There were also domestic disturbances. The Regulator–Moderator War involved a land feud in Harrison and Shelby Counties in East Texas from 1839 to 1844. The feud eventually involved Nacogdoches, San Augustine, and other East Texas counties. Harrison County Sheriff John J. Kennedy and county judge Joseph U. Fields helped end the conflict, siding with the law-and-order party. Sam Houston ordered 500 militia to help end the feud.

==Criteria of citizenship==
Citizenship was not automatically granted to all previous inhabitants of Texas, and some residents were not allowed to continue living legally within the Republic without the consent of Congress. The Constitution of the Republic of Texas (1836) established different rights according to the race and ethnicity of each individual. Section 10 of the General Provisions of the Constitution stated that all persons who resided in Texas on the day of the Declaration of Independence were considered citizens of the Republic, excepting &quot;Africans, the descendants of Africans, and Indians.&quot; For white immigrants, Section 6 established to become citizens, they needed to reside in Texas for at least six months and take an oath of loyalty to the Republic; in contrast, under Section 9, African slaves brought to Texas were to remain slaves and could not be emancipated without the consent of Congress. Furthermore, the Congress was not allowed to make laws banning or restricting either slavery or the slavery trade. Section 9 also established that: &quot;No free person of African descent, either in whole or in part, shall be permitted to reside permanently in the Republic, without the consent of Congress.&quot;

The Republic of Texas experienced significant immigration from both the United States and Europe. Settlers from the Southern states brought their cultural and social norms, which included slavery. Slavery became a &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the Texan economy particularly in the agricultural part. The institution of slavery had fueled the economy but also was able to reinforce social inequality. While slavery was officially abolished in Mexico in 1829, many Texians continued to practice it. This led to tensions with the Mexican government.

Women in the Republic of Texas, while often marginalized, they still played crucial roles in society. They contributed to the economy through domestic labor, agriculture, and business. However, their legal rights were very limited and they faced significant social and economic obstacles. While some women were able to challenge traditional gender roles, the majority of them were still very confined.

The gain of these settlers had a huge impact on Texan society and it started to shape its economy, politics, and social structure over the years.

==Government==

In September 1836 Texas elected a Congress of 14 senators and 29 representatives. The Constitution allowed the first president to serve for two years and subsequent presidents for three years. To hold an office or vote, a man had to be a citizen of the Republic.

The first Congress of the Republic of Texas convened in October 1836 at Columbia (now West Columbia). Stephen F. Austin, often referred to as the &quot;Father of Texas&quot;, died on December 27, 1836, after serving just two months as the republic&#x27;s secretary of state. Due mainly to the ongoing war for independence, five sites served as temporary capitals of Texas in 1836: (Washington-on-the-Brazos, Harrisburg, Galveston, Velasco and Columbia). The capital was moved to the new city of Houston in 1837.

In 1839, a small pioneer settlement situated on the Colorado River in central Texas was chosen as the republic&#x27;s seventh and final capital. Incorporated under the name Waterloo, the town was renamed Austin shortly thereafter in honor of Stephen F. Austin.

The Republic of Texas established a robust legal system, including a Supreme Court to interpret and uphold the Constitution. The Constitution itself could be amended through a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress, followed by ratification by the people. Major constitutional changes during this period often related to issues of land grants, taxation, and the powers of the executive and legislative branches. The court system inaugurated by Congress included a Supreme Court consisting of a chief justice appointed by the president and four associate justices, elected by a joint ballot of both houses of Congress for four-year terms and eligible for re-election. The associates also presided over four judicial districts. Houston nominated James Collinsworth to be the first chief justice. The county-court system consisted of a chief justice and two associates, chosen by a majority of the justices of the peace in the county. Each county was also to have a sheriff, a coroner, justices of the peace, and constables to serve two-year terms. Congress formed 23 counties, whose boundaries generally coincided with the existing municipalities. In 1839, Texas became the first nation in the world to enact a homestead exemption, under which creditors cannot seize a person&#x27;s primary residence.

The Republic&#x27;s political landscape was marked by factionalism with two primary groups emerging, the War Party and the Peace Party. The War Party, led by figures like Mirabeau B. Lamar, advocated for a more aggressive stance against Native American tribes and Mexico which favoring expansion and military action. The Peace Party, associated with Sam Houston prioritized diplomacy, compromise, and a more cautious approach to foreign policy. These factions often clashed over key issues shaping the Republic&#x27;s domestic and foreign policies/affairs. &quot;Prior to this time, factions were the order of the day. Before the Revolution, there was the &quot;Peace Party&quot; and the &quot;War Party&quot;. Once the path to Rev­olution was clear, the &quot;Peace&quot; faction was subsumed by the &quot;War&quot; faction, and for a brief time, Texians seemed to agree with each oth­er, at least in terms of politics&quot; (65).

==Education==

President Anson Jones signed the charter for Baylor University in the fall of 1845. Henry Lee Graves was elected Baylor&#x27;s first president. It is believed to be the oldest university in Texas; however, Rutersville College was chartered in 1840 with land and the town of Rutersville. Chauncey Richardson was elected Rutersville first president. The college later became Southwestern University in Georgetown, Williamson county. University of Mary Hardin-Baylor was also chartered by the Republic of Texas in 1845, and received lands in Belton, Texas. Wesleyan College, chartered in 1844 and signed by president Sam Houston, another predecessor to Southwestern did not survive long due to competition from other colleges. Mirabeau Lamar signed a charter in 1844 for the Herman University for medicine but classes never started due to lack of funds. The University of San Augustine was chartered June 5, 1837, but did not open until 1842 when Marcus A. Montrose became president. There were as many as 150 students enrolled. However, attendance declined to 50 in 1845, and further situations including animosity and embittered factions in the community closed the university in 1847. Later it became the University of East Texas, and soon after that became the Masonic Institute of San Augustine in 1851. Guadalupe College at Gonzales was approved January 30, 1841; however, no construction efforts ensued for the next eleven years.

==Boundaries==
The Texian independence movement was one of many such movements faced by Mexico between 1835 and 1935.
The Texian leaders at first intended to extend their national boundaries to the Pacific Ocean, but ultimately decided to claim the Rio Grande as boundary, including much of New Mexico, which the Republic never controlled. They also hoped, after peace was made with Mexico, to run a railroad to the Gulf of California to give &quot;access to the East Indian, Peruvian and Chilean trade&quot;. When negotiating for the possibility of annexation to the U.S. in late 1836, the Texian government instructed its minister Wharton in Washington that if the boundary were an issue, Texas was willing to settle for a boundary at the watershed between the Nueces River and Rio Grande, and leave out New Mexico.

==Diplomatic relations and foreign trade==

During its existence, the Republic of Texas received diplomatic recognition from only six nations: Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the Republic of Yucatán, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Texas&#x27; status as a slaveholding country and Mexico&#x27;s claim on the territory caused significant problems in the foreign relations of Texas with other nations.

Although it was supported by the vast majority of Texians at the time of independence, annexation by the United States was prevented by the leadership of both major U.S. political parties, the Democrats and the Whigs, who opposed the introduction of a vast slave-holding region into a country already divided into pro- and anti-slavery sections and wished to avoid a war with Mexico.

On March 3, 1837, U.S. President Andrew Jackson appointed Alcée La Branche as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; to the Republic of Texas, thus officially recognizing Texas as an independent republic. France granted official recognition of Texas on September 25, 1839, appointing Alphonse Dubois de Saligny to serve as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot;. The French Legation was built in 1841, and still stands in Austin as the oldest frame structure in the city. Conversely, the Republic of Texas embassy in Paris was located in what is now the Hôtel de Vendôme, adjacent to the Place Vendôme in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.

The United Kingdom hesitated to grant official recognition to the Republic of Texas due to its own friendly relations with Mexico, but nevertheless admitted Texian goods into British ports. In London, opposite the gates to St. James&#x27;s Palace, the original Embassy of the Republic of Texas is now a hat shop but is clearly marked with a large plaque and there was a nearby restaurant in Trafalgar Square called the Texas Embassy Cantina, which closed in June 2012. A plaque on the exterior of 3 St. James&#x27;s Street in London notes that the upper floors of the building housed the Texas Legation.

The United Kingdom eventually recognized Texas in the 1840s after a cotton price crash, in a failed attempt to coerce Texas to give up slavery (replacing slave-produced cotton from southern U.S. states) and to stop expansion of the United States to the southwest. The cotton price crash of the 1840s bankrupted the Republic, increasing the urgency of finding foreign allies who could help prevent a reconquest by Mexico.

The Republic of Texas faced significant economic challenges, including the establishment of a stable financial system.While some banks were established, the lack of a centralized banking system and the volatility of the Texas dollar made financial transactions difficult. Private banking played a crucial role, but it was often unregulated and subject to fluctuations in the market.

==Presidents and Vice Presidents==

==Annexation by the U.S.==

On February 28, 1845, the U.S. Congress passed a bill that authorized the United States to annex the Republic of Texas. On March 1, U.S. President John Tyler signed the bill. The legislation set the date for annexation for December 29 of the same year. Faced with imminent American annexation of Texas, Charles Elliot and Alphonse de Saligny, the British and French ministers to Texas, were dispatched to Mexico City by their governments. Meeting with Mexico&#x27;s foreign secretary, they signed a &quot;Diplomatic Act&quot; in which Mexico offered to recognize an independent Texas with boundaries determined with French and British mediation. Texas President Anson Jones forwarded both offers to a specially elected convention meeting at Austin, and the American proposal was accepted with only one dissenting vote. The Mexican proposal was never put to a vote. Following the previous decree of President Jones, the proposal was then put to a vote throughout the republic.


On October 13, 1845, a large majority of voters in the republic approved both the American offer and the proposed constitution that specifically endorsed slavery and emigrants bringing slaves to Texas. This constitution was later accepted by the U.S. Congress, making Texas a U.S. state on the same day annexation took effect, December 29, 1845 (therefore bypassing a territorial phase). One of the motivations for annexation was the huge debts which the Republic of Texas government had incurred. As part of the Compromise of 1850, in return for $10,000,000 in Federal bonds, Texas dropped claims to territory that included parts of present-day Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Wyoming.

The resolution included two unique provisions: First, it said up to four additional states could be created from Texas&#x27; territory with the consent of the State of Texas and pursuant to the admissions process of the federal constitution. New states north of the Missouri Compromise Line would be free states, while those south of the line could opt to become slave states. Though the resolution did not make exceptions to the constitution, the U.S. Constitution does not require Congressional consent to the creation of new states to be &quot;ex post&quot; to applications, nor does the U.S. Constitution require applications to expire. Second, Texas did not have to surrender its public lands to the federal government. While Texas did cede all territory outside of its current area to the federal government in 1850, it did not cede any public lands within its current boundaries. Consequently, the lands in Texas that the federal government owns are those it subsequently purchased. This also means the state government controls oil reserves, which it later used to fund the state&#x27;s public university system through the Permanent University Fund. In addition, the state&#x27;s control over offshore oil reserves in Texas runs out to 3 nautical leagues (9 nautical miles, 10.357 statute miles, 16.668 km) rather than three nautical miles (3.45 statute miles, 5.56 km) as with other states.
