<text>Spider-Man is a superhero in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has been featured in comic books, television shows, films, video games, novels, and plays.

Spider-Man has the secret identity of Peter Benjamin Parker. Initially, Peter was depicted as a teenage high-school student and an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents, Richard and Mary Parker, died in a plane crash. Lee, Ditko, and later creators had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and young adulthood and gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and enemies such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Peter gets his superhuman spider powers and abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. These powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, durability, coordination, and balance; clinging to surfaces and ceilings like a spider; and detecting danger with his precognition ability called &quot;spider-sense&quot;. He builds wrist-mounted &quot;web-shooter&quot; devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design, which he uses both for fighting and travel, or &quot;web swinging&quot; across the city. Peter Parker initially used his powers for personal gain, but after his Uncle Ben was killed by a thief that he could have stopped but did not, Peter began to use his powers to fight crime as Spider-Man.

Before Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually relegated to the protagonist&#x27;s sidekick role. The Spider-Man comic series broke ground by featuring Peter Parker, a high school student from the Queens borough of New York City, as Spider-Man&#x27;s secret identity, whose &quot;self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness&quot; were issues to which young readers could relate. While Spider-Man was a quintessential sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes Bucky Barnes and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he had learned the lesson for himself that &quot;with great power comes great responsibility&quot; —a line included in a text box in the final panel of the first Spider-Man&#x27;s origin story, but later retroactively attributed to the late Uncle Ben Parker.

Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first and longest-lasting of which is &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Since his introduction, the main-continuity version of Peter has gone from a high school student to attending college to currently being somewhere in his late 20s. Peter has been a member of numerous superhero teams, most notably the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Doctor Octopus also took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a body swap plot in which Peter appears to die. Marvel has also published comic books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot;, which features the adventures of Miguel O&#x27;Hara, the Spider-Man of the future; &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;, which features the adventures of a teenage Peter Parker in the alternate universe; and &quot;Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man&quot;, which depicts a teenager named Miles Morales who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker&#x27;s apparent death. Miles later became a superhero in his own right and was brought into mainstream continuity during the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event, where he sometimes works alongside the mainline version of Peter.

Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. He has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated TV series: the first original animated series &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, with Paul Soles voicing the titular character, a live-action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and multiple series of films. Spider-Man was first portrayed in live-action by Danny Seagren in &quot;Spidey Super Stories&quot;, a recurring skit on &quot;The Electric Company&quot; from 1974 to 1977. In live-action films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire in Sam Raimi&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man&quot; trilogy, by Andrew Garfield in two films directed by Marc Webb, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Tom Holland. Reeve Carney originally starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;. Spider-Man was also voiced by Jake Johnson and Chris Pine in the animated film &quot;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&quot;, with the former reprising his role in the sequel, &quot;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse&quot;.

==Publication history==
===Creation and development===

In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify. As with Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to &quot;get out of his system&quot; what he felt was missing in comic books.

In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of whether or not this is true. Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the criminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man&#x27;s early years) and had through years of ceaseless struggle developed a &quot;sixth sense&quot;, which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;spider-sense&quot;.

Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with &quot;boy&quot;, Lee says he chose &quot;Spider-Man&quot; because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, and felt the name &quot;Spider-Boy&quot; would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes. He also decided to insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero with a red and blue costume that starts with an &quot;S&quot; and ends with &quot;man&quot; (although artist Steve Ditko intended the character to have an orange and purple costume).

At that time, Lee had to get only the consent of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman for the character&#x27;s approval. In a 1986 interview, Lee described in detail his arguments to overcome Goodman&#x27;s objections.

Goodman eventually agreed to a Spider-Man tryout in what Lee, in numerous interviews, recalled as what would be the final issue of the science-fiction and supernatural anthology series &quot;Amazing Adult Fantasy&quot;, which was renamed &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; for issue #15 (cover-dated August 1962, on sale June 5, 1962). In particular, Lee stated that the fact that it had already been decided that &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; would be canceled after issue #15 was the only reason Goodman allowed him to use Spider-Man. While this was the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that &quot;The Spider-Man ... will appear every month in &quot;Amazing&quot;.&quot;

Lee received Goodman&#x27;s approval for the name Spider-Man and the &quot;ordinary teen&quot; concept and approached artist Jack Kirby. As comics historian Greg Theakston recounts, Kirby told Lee about an unpublished character on which he had collaborated with Joe Simon in the 1950s, in which an orphaned boy living with an old couple finds a magic ring that granted him superhuman powers. Lee and Kirby &quot;immediately sat down for a story conference,&quot; Theakston writes, and Lee afterward directed Kirby to flesh out the character and draw some pages. Steve Ditko would be the inker. When Kirby showed Lee the first six pages, Lee recalled, &quot;I hated the way he was doing it! Not that he did it badly—it just wasn&#x27;t the character I wanted; it was too heroic&quot;. Lee turned to Ditko, who developed an art style Lee found satisfactory. Ditko recalled:
Although the interior artwork was by Ditko alone, Lee rejected Ditko&#x27;s cover art and commissioned Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked. As Lee explained in 2010, &quot;I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack&#x27;s covers.&quot;

In an early recollection of the character&#x27;s creation, Ditko described his and Lee&#x27;s contributions in a mail interview with Gary Martin published in &quot;Comic Fan&quot; #2 (Summer 1965): &quot;Stan Lee thought the name up. I did costume, web gimmick on wrist &amp; spider signal.&quot; At the time, Ditko shared a Manhattan studio with noted fetish artist Eric Stanton, an art-school classmate who, in a 1988 interview with Theakston, recalled that although his contribution to Spider-Man was &quot;almost nil&quot;, he and Ditko had &quot;worked on storyboards together and I added a few ideas. But the whole thing was created by Steve on his own ... I think I added the business about the webs coming out of his hands.&quot; Ditko claimed in a rare interview with Jonathan Ross that the costume was initially envisioned with an orange and purple color scheme, rather than the recognizable red and blue.

Kirby disputed Lee&#x27;s version of the story and claimed Lee had minimal involvement in the character&#x27;s creation. According to Kirby, the idea for Spider-Man had originated with Kirby and Joe Simon, who in the 1950s had developed a character called the Silver Spider for the Crestwood Publications comic &quot;Black Magic&quot;, but the character was left unused. Simon, in his 1990 autobiography, disputed Kirby&#x27;s account, asserting that &quot;Black Magic&quot; was not a factor and that Simon devised the name &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (later changed to &quot;The Silver Spider&quot;), while Kirby outlined the character&#x27;s story and powers. Simon later elaborated that his and Kirby&#x27;s character conception became the basis for Simon&#x27;s Archie Comics superhero, the Fly. Artist Steve Ditko stated that Lee liked the name Hawkman from DC Comics, and that &quot;Spider-Man&quot; was an outgrowth of that interest.

Simon concurred that Kirby had shown the original Spider-Man version to Lee, who liked the idea and assigned Kirby to draw sample pages of the new character, but disliked the results—in Simon&#x27;s description, &quot;Captain America with cobwebs&quot;. Writer Mark Evanier notes that Lee&#x27;s reasoning that Kirby&#x27;s character was too heroic seems unlikely—Kirby still drew the covers for &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 and the first issue of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. Evanier also disputes Kirby&#x27;s given reason that he was &quot;too busy&quot; to draw Spider-Man in addition to his other duties, since Kirby was, said Evanier, &quot;always busy&quot;. Neither Lee&#x27;s nor Kirby&#x27;s explanation explains why key story elements like the magic ring were dropped; Evanier states that the most plausible explanation for the sudden change was that Goodman, or one of his assistants, decided that Spider-Man, as drawn and envisioned by Kirby, was too similar to the Fly.

Author and Ditko scholar Blake Bell writes that it was Ditko who noted the similarities to the Fly. Ditko recalled that &quot;Stan called Jack about the Fly&quot;, adding that &quot;[d]ays later, Stan told me I would be penciling the story panel breakdowns from Stan&#x27;s synopsis.&quot; It was at this point that the entire concept of the strip went through a major overhaul. &quot;Out went the magic ring, adult Spider-Man and whatever legend ideas that Spider-Man story would have contained.&quot; Lee gave Ditko the premise of a teenager bitten by a spider and developing powers, where Ditko would expand upon to the point he became what Bell describes as &quot;the first work for hire artist of his generation to create and control the narrative arc of his series&quot;. On the issue of the initial creation, Ditko stated, &quot;I still don&#x27;t know whose idea was Spider-Man&quot;. Ditko did, however, view the published version of Spider-Man as a separate creation to the one he saw in the five pencilled pages that Kirby had completed. To support this, Ditko used the analogy of the Kirby/Marvel Thor, which was based on a name or idea of a character in Norse mythology: &quot;If Marvel&#x27;s Thor is a valid created work by Jack, his creation, then why isn&#x27;t Spider-Man by Stan and me valid created work, our creation?&quot;

Kirby noted in a 1971 interview that it was Ditko who &quot;got &quot;Spider-Man&quot; to roll, and the thing caught on because of what he did&quot;. Lee, while claiming credit for the initial idea, had acknowledged Ditko&#x27;s role, stating, &quot;If Steve wants to be called co-creator, I think he deserves [it]&quot;. He has further commented that Ditko&#x27;s costume design was key to the character&#x27;s success; since the costume completely covers Spider-Man&#x27;s body, people of all races could visualize themselves inside the costume and thus easily identify with the character.

===Commercial success===
A few months after Spider-Man&#x27;s introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel&#x27;s highest-selling comics. A solo ongoing series followed, beginning with &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually became Marvel&#x27;s top-selling series with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 &quot;Esquire&quot; poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was &quot;beset by woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us.&quot; Following Ditko&#x27;s departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita Sr. replaced him as penciller and would draw the series for the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character&#x27;s extra-length stories in the comics magazine &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It lasted for two issues and represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series&#x27; summer &quot;Annual&quot;s that began in 1964.

An early 1970s Spider-Man story ultimately led to the revision of the Comics Code Authority. Previously, the Code forbade the depiction of the use of illegal drugs, even negatively. However, in 1970, the Nixon administration&#x27;s Department of Health, Education, and Welfare asked Stan Lee to publish an anti-drug message in one of Marvel&#x27;s top-selling titles. Lee chose the top-selling &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man;&quot; issues #96–98 (May–July 1971) feature a story arc depicting the negative effects of drug use. In the story, Peter Parker&#x27;s friend Harry Osborn becomes addicted to pills. When Spider-Man fights the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn, Harry&#x27;s father), Spider-Man defeats him by revealing Harry&#x27;s drug addiction. While the story had a clear anti-drug message, the Comics Code Authority refused to issue its seal of approval. Marvel nevertheless published the three issues without the Comics Code Authority&#x27;s approval or seal. The issues sold so well that the industry&#x27;s self-censorship was undercut, and the Code was subsequently revised.

In 1972, a second monthly ongoing series starring Spider-Man began: &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, in which Spider-Man was paired with other superheroes and supervillains. From that point on, there have generally been at least two ongoing Spider-Man series at any time. In 1976, his second solo series, &quot;Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man&quot;, began running parallel to the main series. A third series featuring Spider-Man, &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot;, launched in 1985 to replace &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;. The launch of a fourth monthly title in 1990, the &quot;adjectiveless&quot; &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (with the storyline &quot;Torment&quot;), written and drawn by popular artist Todd McFarlane, debuted with several different covers, all with the same interior content. All four versions combined sold over three million copies, an industry record at the time. Several miniseries, one-shot issues, and loosely related comics have also been published, and Spider-Man makes frequent cameos and guest appearances in other comic book series. In 1996, &quot;The Sensational Spider-Man&quot; was created to replace &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot;.

In 1998, writer-artist John Byrne revamped the origin of Spider-Man in the 13-issue limited series &quot;Spider-Man: Chapter One&quot; (Dec. 1998–Oct. 1999), similar to Byrne&#x27;s adding details and some revisions to Superman&#x27;s origin in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;The Man of Steel&quot;. During that time, the original &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; ended with issue #441 (Nov. 1998), and &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; started with volume 2, #1 (Jan. 1999). In 2003, Marvel reintroduced the original numbering for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and what would have been volume 2, #59, became issue #500 (Dec. 2003).

When the main series &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; reached issue #545 (Dec. 2007), Marvel dropped its spin-off ongoing series and instead began publishing &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; three times monthly, beginning with #546–548 (all January 2008). The scheduling of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; lasted until November 2010, when the comic book expanded from 22 pages to 30 pages for each issue. Later on, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was published twice a month, beginning with #648–649 (both November 2010). The following year, Marvel launched &quot;Avenging Spider-Man&quot; as the first spin-off ongoing series in addition to &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, since the previous ones were canceled at the end of 2007. The &quot;Amazing&quot; series temporarily ended with issue #700 in December 2012 and was replaced by &quot;The Superior Spider-Man&quot;, which had Doctor Octopus serve as the new Spider-Man by taking over Peter Parker&#x27;s body. &quot;Superior&quot; was an enormous commercial success for Marvel, and ran for 31 issues before the real Peter Parker returned in a newly relaunched &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #1 in April 2014.

Following the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; crossover event, a number of Spider-Man-related titles were either relaunched or created as part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event. Among them, &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; was relaunched and primarily focuses on Peter Parker continuing to run Parker Industries and becomes a successful businessman who is operating worldwide.

==Fictional character biography==
===Early years===
In Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, Midtown High School student Peter Benjamin Parker is a science-whiz orphan living with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. As depicted in &quot;Amazing Fantasy&quot; #15 (Aug. 1962), he is bitten by a radioactive spider (erroneously classified as an insect in the panel) at a science exhibit and &quot;acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid&quot;. Along with heightened athletic abilities, Parker gains the ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his knack for science, he develops a gadget that lets him fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels. Initially seeking to capitalize on his new abilities, Parker dons a costume and, as &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, becomes a novelty television star. However, &quot;[h]e blithely ignores the chance to stop a fleeing thief, [and] his indifference ironically catches up with him when the same criminal later robs and kills his Uncle Ben.&quot; Spider-Man tracks and subdues the killer and learns, in the story&#x27;s next-to-last caption, &quot;With great power there must also come—great responsibility!&quot;

In the first issue of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (March 1963), despite his superpowers, Peter struggles to help his widowed Aunt May pay the rent, is taunted by Flash, and continues fighting crime and saving the city as Spider-Man, but his heroic deeds engender the editorial wrath of newspaper publisher of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, J. Jonah Jameson, holds a grudge against Spider-Man, and continues making false statements about Spider-Man despite his heroism. Peter gets hired as a freelance photographer by Mr. Jameson to take pictures of Spider-Man, with him being unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Spider-Man fights his enemies, including superpowered and non-superpowered supervillains—his archenemy and nemesis Green Goblin and then Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Chameleon, Lizard, Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, and Mysterio, defeating them one by one—but Peter finds juggling his personal and superhero life difficult. In time, Peter graduates from high school and enrolls at Empire State University (a fictional institution evoking the real-life Columbia University and New York University), where he meets roommate and best friend Harry Osborn and girlfriend Gwen Stacy, and Aunt May introduces him to Mary Jane Watson. As Peter deals with Harry&#x27;s drug problems, and Harry&#x27;s father, Norman Osborn, is revealed to be the Green Goblin, Peter attempts to give up his costumed identity for a while. Gwen Stacy&#x27;s father, New York City Police detective Captain George Stacy, is accidentally killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus (issue #90, November 1970).

===1970s===
In issue #121 (June 1973), the Green Goblin throws Gwen Stacy from a tower of either the Brooklyn Bridge (as depicted in the art) or the George Washington Bridge (as given in the text). She dies during Spider-Man&#x27;s rescue attempt, and Spider-Man swears revenge against his nemesis; a note on the letters page of issue #125 states: &quot;It saddens us to say that the whiplash effect she underwent when Spidey&#x27;s webbing stopped her so suddenly was, in fact, what killed her.&quot; The following issue, Spider-Man vengefully attacks and overpowers the Green Goblin, who kills himself accidentally in the ensuing battle with Spider-Man.

Working through his grief, Peter eventually develops tentative feelings toward Mary Jane, and the two &quot;become confidants rather than lovers&quot;. A romantic relationship eventually develops, with Parker proposing to her in issue #182 (July 1978), and being turned down an issue later. Peter went on to graduate from college in issue #185, and becomes involved with the shy Debra Whitman and the extroverted, flirtatious costumed thief Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat, whom he meets in issue #194 (July 1979).

===1980s===

From 1984 to 1988, Spider-Man wore a black costume with a white spider design on his chest. The new costume originated in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; miniseries on an alien planet where Spider-Man participates in a battle between Earth&#x27;s major superheroes and supervillains. He continues wearing the costume when he returns, starting in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #252. The change to a longstanding character&#x27;s design met with controversy, &quot;with many hardcore comics fans decrying it as tantamount to sacrilege. Spider-Man&#x27;s traditional red and blue costume was iconic, they argued, on par with those of his D.C. rivals Superman and Batman.&quot; The creators then revealed the costume was an alien symbiote, which Spider-Man rejects after a difficult struggle, though the symbiote returns several times as Venom for revenge. Peter proposes to Mary Jane in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #290 (July 1987), and she accepts two issues later, with the wedding taking place in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #21 (1987)—promoted with a real-life mock wedding using actors at Shea Stadium, with Stan Lee officiating, on June 5, 1987. David Michelinie, who scripted based on a plot by editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, said in 2007, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think they actually should [have gotten] married. ... I had actually planned another version, one that wasn&#x27;t used.&quot; Peter publishes a book of Spider-Man photographs called &quot;Webs&quot;, and returns to his Empire State University graduate studies in biochemistry in #310 (Dec. 1988).

===1990s===
In the controversial 1990s storyline the &quot;Clone Saga&quot;, a clone of Parker, created in 1970s comics by insane scientist Miles Warren, a.k.a. the Jackal, returns to New York City upon hearing of Aunt May&#x27;s health worsening. The clone had lived incognito as Ben Reilly, but now assumes the superhero guise the Scarlet Spider and allies with Parker. To the surprise of both, new tests indicate Ben is the original and Peter is the clone. Complicating matters, Mary Jane announces in &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; #220 (Jan. 1995) that she is pregnant with Peter&#x27;s baby. Later, however, a resurrected Green Goblin (Norman Osborn) has Mary Jane poisoned, causing premature labor and the death of her and Peter&#x27;s unborn daughter. It is later revealed that The Green Goblin switched the results of the clone test in an attempt to destroy Peter&#x27;s life by making him believe himself to be the clone. Ben is killed while saving Peter, in &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot; #75 (Dec. 1996), and his body immediately crumbles into dust, confirming Ben was the clone.

In issue #97 (Nov. 1998) of the second series titled &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot;, Parker learns his Norman Osborn kidnapped Aunt May and her apparent death in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #400 (April 1995) had been a hoax. Shortly afterward, in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; (vol. 2) #13 (#454, Jan. 2000), Mary Jane is killed in an airplane explosion. She is revealed to be alive in volume 2, issue #28 (#469, April 2001), but she and Peter are completely separated in the following issue.

===2000s===
&quot;Babylon 5&quot; creator J. Michael Straczynski began writing &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, illustrated by John Romita Jr., beginning with volume 2, #30 (#471, June 2001). Two issues later, Peter, now employed as a teacher at his old high school, meets the enigmatic Ezekiel Sims, who possesses similar spider powers and suggests that Peter, having gained such abilities, might not have been a fluke—that Parker has a connection to a totemic spider spirit. In vol. 2, #37 (#478, Jan. 2002), Aunt May discovers her nephew is Spider-Man. Peter and Mary Jane reconcile in (vol. 2) #50 (#491, April 2003), and in #512 (Nov. 2004)—the original issue numbering having returned with #500—Parker learns his late girlfriend Gwen Stacy had had two children with Norman Osborn.

He joins the superhero team The New Avengers in &quot;New Avengers&quot; #1–2. After a deranged, superpowered former high-school classmate destroys their respective homes, Peter, Mary Jane, and May move into Stark Tower, and Peter begins working as Tony Stark&#x27;s assistant while freelancing for &quot;The Daily Bugle&quot; and continuing his teacher career. In the 12-part 2005 story arc &quot;The Other&quot;, Peter undergoes a transformation that evolves his powers. In the comic &quot;Civil War&quot; #2 (June 2006), part of the company-wide crossover arc of that title, the U.S. government&#x27;s Superhuman Registration Act leads Spider-Man to reveal his true identity publicly. A growing unease about the Registration Act prompts him to escape with May and Mary Jane and joins the anti-registration underground.

In issue #537 (Dec. 2006), Aunt May is critically wounded from Wilson Fisk&#x27;s sniper, and enters into a coma. Peter, desperate to save her, exhausts all possibilities and makes a pact with the demon-lord Mephisto, who saves May&#x27;s life in exchange for Peter and Mary Jane agreeing to have their marriage and all memory of it disappear. In this changed reality, Spider-Man&#x27;s identity is secret once again, and in #545 (Jan. 2008), Mary Jane returns and is cold toward him. The controversial storyline &quot;One More Day&quot; rolled back much of the fictional continuity at the behest of editor-in-chief Joe Quesada, who said, &quot;Peter being single is an intrinsic part of the very foundation of the world of Spider-Man&quot;. It caused unusual public friction between Quesada and writer Straczynski, who &quot;told Joe that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the [story] arc&quot;, but was talked out of doing so. At issue with Straczynski&#x27;s climax to the arc, Quesada said, was

In this new continuity, designed to have very limited repercussions throughout the remainder of the Marvel Universe, Parker returns to work at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;, which has been renamed &quot;The DB&quot; under a new publisher. He soon switches to the alternative press paper &quot;The Front Line&quot;. J. Jonah Jameson becomes the Mayor of New York City in issue #591 (June 2008). Jonah&#x27;s estranged father, J. Jonah Jameson Sr., marries May in issue #600 (Sept. 2009).

During the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; by shape-shifting extraterrestrials, the Skrulls, Norman Osborn shoots and kills the Skrull queen Veranke. He leverages this widely publicized success, positioning himself as the new director of the S.H.I.E.L.D.-like paramilitary force H.A.M.M.E.R. to advance his agenda, while using his public image to start his own Dark Avengers. Norman, by himself, leads the Dark Avengers as the Iron Patriot, a suit of armor fashioned by himself after Iron Man&#x27;s armor with Captain America&#x27;s colors.

Harry is approached by Norman with the offer of a job within the Dark Avengers. It is later revealed that it is a ruse to coerce Harry into taking the American Son armor, whom Norman had planned to kill, in order to increase public sympathy. When Harry has the option of killing Norman, Spider-Man says to decapitate him, since Norman&#x27;s healing factor may repair a blow to the head. Spider-Man also cautions Harry that killing Norman will cause Harry to &quot;become the son Norman always wanted&quot;. Harry instead backs down, and turns away from his father forever.

===2010s===
At Loki&#x27;s suggestion, Norman Osborn creates a rationale to invade Asgard, claiming the world poses a national security threat. He is defeated, and ends up incarcerated in the Raft penitentiary. A conflict between Spider-Man and Doctor Octopus over Osborn&#x27;s son ends when it is revealed the child&#x27;s father is Harry, who leaves town to raise him. One of Doctor Octopus&#x27; Octobots swaps his and Spider-Man&#x27;s personality, causing Peter to become trapped in the Doctor&#x27;s dying body, while he in turn claimed Peter&#x27;s life for himself. Though Peter failed to reverse the change, he manages to establish a weak link with the Doctor&#x27;s mind, forcing him to relive all of his memories; Otto understands Peter&#x27;s ideals of power and responsibility and swears to carry on with Peter&#x27;s life with dignity as a &quot;Superior&quot; Spider-Man.

A portion of Peter survived in his original body in the form of a subconsciousness. Later, realizing that he failed in his role as the &quot;Superior&quot; Spider-Man, Otto willingly allows Peter to reclaim his body in order to defeat Osborn and save Anna Maria Marconi, Otto&#x27;s love. In the aftermath of these events, Peter began to amend the relationships damaged by Otto&#x27;s arrogance and negligence, both as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. He additionally took up the reins of Parker Industries, a small company founded by Otto after leaving Horizon Labs.

Peter soon learns a second person had been bitten by the radioactive spider, Cindy Moon. Spider-Man tracks her down and frees her from a bunker owned by the late Ezekiel Simms. Not long after rescuing Cindy, who went on to adopt her own heroine identity as Silk, Spider-Man encounters a contingent of spider-people from all over the Multiverse that banded together to fight the Inheritors, a group of psychic vampires who had begun to hunt down the spider-totems of other realities. During a mission to gather more recruits in 2099, the Spider-Army stumbled upon another party of spider-people led by an alternate version of Otto Octavius. Together, they neutralize the Inheritors.

Peter then stops a nefarious plan put forward by the Jackal. After the events of &quot;Go Down Swinging&quot;, Peter&#x27;s life was plagued with problems on both sides. As Spider-Man, Mayor Fisk publicly supports him, condemning all other vigilantes in order to isolate him from his superhero peers. As Peter Parker, his academic credentials were revoked after accusations of plagiarizing his doctoral dissertation from Octavius, resulting in Peter being fired from the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. Subsequently, Peter became romantically involved with Mary Jane. Briefly, Peter Parker and Spider-Man split into separate beings due to an accident involving the reverse-engineered Isotope Genome Accelerator. Peter eventually manages to reverse the process, and merges his two halves back together before the side-effects worsen and result in their death.

===2020s===

Kindred uses the resurrected Sin-Eater&#x27;s sins to possess Miles Morales, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Woman, Anya Corazon, and Julia Carpenter. Doctor Strange, who manages to restrain a possessed Silk, agrees to help Spider-Man. However, Peter dies when fighting Kindred. While dead, Peter&#x27;s consciousness remembers the fateful day of the start of &quot;One More Day&quot;; Kindred is willing to resurrect Peter.

==Personality and themes==
Sally Kempton for the &quot;Village Voice&quot; opined in 1965 that &quot;Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked inferiority complex, and a fear of women. He is antisocial, castration-ridden, racked with Oedipal guilt, and accident-prone ... [a] functioning neurotic&quot;. Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.

Cultural historian Bradford W. Wright notes:

The mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time; early 1960s Marvel stories often deal with the Cold War and communism. Wright writes:

==Powers, skills, and equipment==
Peter Parker has superhuman spider-powers and abilities derived from mutations resulting from the bite of a radioactive spider. Since the original Lee-Ditko stories, Spider-Man has had the ability to cling to walls. This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals force, though in the 2002 &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider&#x27;s feet. Spider-Man&#x27;s other powers include superhuman strength, speed, agility, and balance and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his &quot;spider-sense&quot;, which alerts him to danger.

Spider-Man has a healing factor that allows him to recover from injuries sustained during battle. In the aftermath of the 1989 &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot; storyline, Spider-Man was said to have &quot;superhuman recuperative abilities&quot; that sped up his recovery from the exhaustion he suffered in defeating the Tri-Sentinel.

The character was originally conceived by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko as intellectually gifted, and later writers have depicted his intellect at genius level. Academically brilliant, Peter has expertise in the fields of applied science, chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, mathematics, and mechanics.

With his talents, he sews his own costume to conceal his identity, and he constructs many devices that complement his powers, most notably mechanical web-shooters that allow him to shoot webs, swing at high speeds throughout the city, and navigate and trap his enemies with his webs, additionally with a spider-signal as a flashlight and a warning beacon to criminals. Thomas Fireheart&#x27;s scientists, world-renowned, are unable to replicate the fluid Parker created while in high school.

==Supporting cast==
Spider-Man has had a large range of supporting characters introduced in the comics that are essential in the issues and storylines that star him. After his parents died, Peter Parker was raised by his loving aunt, May Parker, and his uncle and father figure, Ben Parker. After Uncle Ben is murdered by a burglar, Aunt May is virtually Peter&#x27;s only family, and she and Peter are very close.

J. Jonah Jameson is the publisher of the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; and Peter Parker&#x27;s boss. A harsh critic of Spider-Man, he constantly features negative articles about the superhero in his newspaper. Despite his role as Jameson&#x27;s editor and confidant, Robbie Robertson is always depicted as a supporter of both Spider-Man and his alter ego Peter Parker.

Eugene &quot;Flash&quot; Thompson is commonly depicted as Peter Parker&#x27;s high school tormentor and bully, who idolizes Spider-Man, but is unaware that Spider-Man is Peter Parker. Later, he becomes a friend of Peter and adopts his own superhero identity, Agent Venom, after merging with the Venom symbiote. Meanwhile, Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn, is most commonly recognized as Peter&#x27;s best friend, although some versions depicted him as his rival.

=== Enemies ===

Writers and artists over the years have established a rogues gallery of supervillains to face Spider-Man, in comics and in other media. As with Spider-Man, the majority of the villains&#x27; powers originate with scientific accidents or the misuse of scientific technology, and many have animal-themed costumes or powers. The following Spider-Man villains are listed in the ordering of their original chronological appearance:

 Indicates a group. 

Unlike most superheroes, Spider-Man does not have a single villain with whom he has come into conflict the most. Instead, he is often regarded as having three archenemies:

# Doctor Octopus (a.k.a. Doc Ock) is a highly intelligent mad scientist who uses four mechanical appendages for both movement and combat. He has been described as Spider-Man&#x27;s greatest enemy, and the man Peter Parker might have become if he had not been raised with a sense of responsibility. Doc Ock is infamous for defeating him the first time in battle and for almost marrying Peter&#x27;s Aunt May. He is also the core leader of the Sinister Six, and at one point adopted the &quot;Master Planner&quot; alias. (&quot;If This Be My Destiny...!&quot;) Later depictions revealed him in Peter Parker&#x27;s body, where he was the titular character for a while.
# The Norman Osborn version of the Green Goblin is most commonly regarded as Spider-Man&#x27;s arch-enemy. While Norman is usually portrayed as an amoral industrialist and the head of the Oscorp scientific corporation, the Goblin is a psychopathic alternate personality, born after Norman&#x27;s exposore to some unstable chemicals that also increased his strength and agility. The Goblin is a Halloween-themed villain, dressing up like an actual goblin and utilizing a large arsenal of high tech weapons, including a glider and pumpkin-shaped explosives. Unlike most villains, who only aim to kill Spider-Man, the Goblin also targets his loved ones and shows no remorse in killing them as long as it caused pain to Spider-Man. His most infamous feat is killing Spider-Man&#x27;s girlfriend, in what became one of the most famous Spider-Man stories of all time and helped to end the Silver Age of Comic Books and begin the Bronze Age of Comic Books. While the Goblin was killed in the same story, he returned in the 1990s to plague Spider-Man once again, committing more heinous acts (such as being involved in the murder of Aunt May). He also came into conflict with other heroes, such as the Avengers. Norman is sometimes depicted as an enemy of Spider-Man, even when not being the Green Goblin.
# The Eddie Brock incarnation of Venom is often regarded as Spider-Man&#x27;s deadliest foe, and has been described as an evil mirror version of Spider-Man in many ways. He is also among Spider-Man&#x27;s most popular villains. Originally a reporter who grew to despise Spider-Man, Eddie later came into contact with the Venom symbiote, which had been rejected by Spider-Man. The symbiote merges with Eddie and gives him the same powers as Spider-Man, in addition to making him immune to the web-slinger&#x27;s &quot;spider-sense&quot;. Venom&#x27;s main goal is to ruin Peter Parker&#x27;s life and mentally confuse him in any way he can. The character has a sense of honor and justice, and later starred in his own comic book stories, where he is depicted as an antihero and has a desire to protect innocent people from harm. On several occasions, he and Spider-Man even put their differences aside and became allies.

=== Romantic interests ===
Peter Parker&#x27;s romantic interests range between his first crush, fellow high-school student Liz Allan, to having his first date with Betty Brant, secretary to the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson. After his breakup with Betty Brant, Peter eventually falls in love with his college girlfriend Gwen Stacy, daughter of New York City Police Department detective Captain George Stacy, both of whom are later killed by supervillain enemies of Spider-Man. Mary Jane Watson became Peter&#x27;s best friend and eventually his wife. Felicia Hardy, the Black Cat, is a reformed cat burglar who had been Spider-Man&#x27;s sole superhuman girlfriend and partner at one point.

=== Children ===
Over the course of the comics, Peter Parker had several biological children across different continuities, usually with Mary Jane Watson, including Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker) and Benjy Parker from the MC2 universe, and Spiderling (Annie Parker) from Earth-18119.

=== Alternate versions of Spider-Man ===
Within the Marvel Universe, there exists a multiverse with many variations of Spider-Man. An early character included in the 1980s is the fictional anthropomorphic animal parody of Spider-Man as a pig named Spider-Ham (Peter Porker). Many imprints of Spider-Men were created, like the futuristic version of Spider-Man in Marvel 2099 named Miguel O&#x27;Hara. In the Marvel Comics 2 imprint, Peter marries Mary Jane and has a daughter named Mayday Parker, who carries on Spider-Man&#x27;s legacy, while Marvel Noir has a 1930s version of Peter Parker. Other themed versions exist within the early 2000s, such as a Marvel Mangaverse version and an Indian version from &quot;Spider-Man: India&quot;, Pavitr Prabhakar.

&quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot; was a popular modern retelling of Spider-Man, Peter Parker. The version of Peter Parker would later be depicted as being killed off and replaced by a Black Hispanic Spider-Man named Miles Morales.

The storyline &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; brought back many alternate takes on Spider-Man and introduced many new ones, such as an alternate world where Gwen Stacy gets bitten by a radioactive spider instead, along with a British-themed version named Spider-UK, who is Billy Braddock from the Captain Britain Corps.

==Legacy==
In &quot;The Creation of Spider-Man&quot;, comic book writer-editor and historian Paul Kupperberg calls the character&#x27;s superpowers &quot;nothing too original&quot;; what was original was that outside his secret identity, he was a &quot;nerdy high school student&quot;. Going against typical superhero fare, Spider-Man included &quot;heavy doses of soap-opera and elements of melodrama&quot;. Kupperberg feels that Lee and Ditko had created something new in the world of comics: &quot;the flawed superhero with everyday problems&quot;. This idea spawned a comics revolution. The insecurity and anxieties in Marvel&#x27;s early 1960s comic books, such as &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;, &quot;The Fantastic Four&quot;, and &quot;The X-Men&quot; ushered in a new type of superhero, very different from the certain and all-powerful superheroes before them, and changed the public&#x27;s perception of them. After the comics depicted a real address in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, as May Parker&#x27;s residence, its residents received many letters from children to the superhero.

Spider-Man has become one of the most recognizable fictional characters in the world, and has been used to sell toys, games, cereal, candy, soap, and many other products. He has been used as the company mascot. When Marvel became the first comic book company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; announced &quot;Spider-Man is coming to Wall Street&quot;; the event was in turn promoted with an actor in a Spider-Man costume accompanying Stan Lee to the Stock Exchange. Since 1962, hundreds of millions of comics featuring the character have been sold around the world. Spider-Man is the world&#x27;s most profitable superhero. In 2014, global retail sales of licensed products related to Spider-Man reached approximately $1.3 billion. Comparatively, this amount exceeds the global licensing revenue of Batman, Superman, and the Avengers combined.
Spider-Man joined the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade from 1987 to 1998 as one of the balloon floats, designed by John Romita Sr., one of the character&#x27;s signature artists. A new, different Spider-Man balloon float also appeared from 2009 to 2014.

When Marvel wanted to issue a story dealing with the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks, the company chose the December 2001 issue of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;. In 2006, Spider-Man garnered major media coverage with the revelation of the character&#x27;s secret identity, an event detailed in a full-page story in the &quot;New York Post&quot; before the issue containing the story was even released.

In 2008, Marvel announced plans to release a series of educational comics the following year in partnership with the United Nations, depicting Spider-Man alongside the UN Peacekeeping Forces to highlight UN peacekeeping missions. A &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; article listed Spider-Man as one of the top 10 most intelligent fictional characters in American comics.

In 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States decided &quot;Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC&quot;, a case concerning royalties on a patent for an imitation web shooter. The opinion for the Court, by Justice Elena Kagan, included several Spider-Man references, concluding with the statement that &quot;with great power, there must also come—great responsibility&quot;.

Spider-Man has become a subject of scientific inquiry. In 1987, researchers at Loyola University conducted a study into the utility of Spider-Man comics for informing children and parents about issues relating to child abuse.

===Reception===
In 2005, Bravo&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Super Heroes, Vixens, and Villains&quot; TV series declared that Spider-Man was the number 1 superhero. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked him the fifth-greatest comic book character of all time. &quot;Wizard&quot; magazine placed Spider-Man as the third-greatest comic book character on their website. In 2011, Spider-Man placed third on IGN&#x27;s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time, behind DC Comics characters Superman and Batman, and sixth in their 2012 list of &quot;The Top 50 Avengers&quot;. In 2014, IGN identified Spider-Man the greatest Marvel Comics character of all time. A 2015 poll at Comic Book Resources named Spider-Man the greatest Marvel character of all time. IGN described him as the common everyman that represents many normal people, but also noted his uniqueness compared to many superheroes with his depicted flaws as a superhero. IGN wrote that despite being one of the most tragic superheroes of all time, he is &quot;one of the most fun and snarky superheroes in existence.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; praised Spider-Man&#x27;s always-present sense of humor and wisecracks in the face of the many tragedies he faces. The magazine website appraised the depiction of his &quot;iconic&quot; superhero poses, describing it as &quot;a top artist&#x27;s dream&quot;.

George Marston of &quot;Newsarama&quot; called Spider-Man&#x27;s origin the greatest origin story of all time, opining that &quot;Spider-Man&#x27;s origin combines all of the most classic aspects of pathos, tragedy and scientific wonder into the perfect blend for a superhero origin.&quot;

===Real-life comparisons===
Real-life people who have been compared to Spider-Man for their climbing feats include:

*In 1981, skyscraper-safety activist Dan Goodwin, wearing a Spider-Man suit, scaled the Sears Tower in Chicago, Illinois, the Renaissance Tower in Dallas, Texas, and the John Hancock Center in Chicago.
*Alain Robert, nicknamed &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, is a rock and urban climber who has scaled more than 70 tall buildings using his hands and feet, without using additional devices. He sometimes wears a Spider-Man suit during his climbs. In May 2003, he was paid approximately $18,000 to climb the Lloyd&#x27;s building to promote the premiere of the movie &quot;Spider-Man&quot; on the British television channel Sky Movies.
*&quot;The Human Spider&quot;, alias Bill Strother, scaled the Lamar Building in Augusta, Georgia, in 1921.
* In Argentina, criminals that climb buildings and trespass into private property through the open balconies are said to use the &quot;Spider-Man method&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;el Hombre Araña&quot;).

==In other media==

Spider-Man has appeared in comics, cartoons, films, video games, coloring books, novels, records, children&#x27;s books, and theme park rides.

Spider-Man also appeared in other print forms besides the comics, including novels, children&#x27;s books, and the daily newspaper comic strip &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, which debuted in January 1977, with the earliest installments written by Stan Lee and drawn by John Romita Sr. Spider-Man has been adapted to other media including games, toys, collectibles, and miscellaneous memorabilia, and has appeared as the main character in numerous computer and video games on over 15 gaming platforms.

The first &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film of the trilogy was released on May 3, 2002, followed by &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004) and &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot; (2007). A third sequel was originally scheduled to be released in 2011; however, Sony later decided to reboot the franchise with a new director and cast. The reboot, titled &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, was released on July 3, 2012, directed by Marc Webb, and starred Andrew Garfield as the new Spider-Man. It was followed by &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man 2&quot; (2014). In 2015, Sony and Disney made a deal for Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Tom Holland made his debut as Spider-Man in the MCU film &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016), before later starring in his standalone film &quot;Spider-Man: Homecoming&quot; (2017), directed by Jon Watts. Holland reprised his role as Spider-Man in &quot;&quot; (2018), &quot;&quot; (2019), &quot;Spider-Man: Far From Home&quot; (2019), and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot; (2021); Maguire and Garfield reprise their roles in the latter film.

Chris Pine also voiced another version of Peter Parker in &quot;Into the Spider-Verse&quot;. In 2021, Hudson Thames was cast as the voice of Spider-Man in animated anthology series &quot;What If...?&quot;, replacing Tom Holland. He later reprised the role for animated series &quot;Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; (2025).

Following a brief contract dispute over financial terms, in 2019, Sony and Disney reached a deal to allow Spider-Man to return to the MCU, with the two studios jointly producing Spider-Man films.

A Broadway musical, &quot;Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark&quot;, began previews on November 14, 2010, at the Foxwoods Theatre on Broadway, with the official opening night on June 14, 2011. The music and lyrics were written by Bono and The Edge of the rock group U2, with a book by Julie Taymor, Glen Berger, and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. &quot;Turn Off the Dark&quot; is currently the most expensive musical in Broadway history, costing an estimated $70 million. In addition, the show&#x27;s unusually high running costs are reported to have been about $1.2 million per week.

In the fine arts, since the Pop Art period of the 1960s, the character of Spider-Man has been &quot;appropriated&quot; by multiple visual artists and incorporated into contemporary artwork, including Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Mel Ramos, Vijay, Dulce Pinzon, Mr. Brainwash, and F. Lennox Campello.

<text>The history of Stockholm, capital of Sweden, for many centuries coincided with the development of what is today known as Gamla stan, the Stockholm Old Town.

== Origins ==

The name &#x27;Stockholm&#x27; easily splits into two distinct parts – Stock-holm, &quot;Log-islet&quot;, but as no serious explanation to the name has been produced, various myths and legends have attempted to fill in the gap. According to a 17th-century myth the population at the viking settlement Birka decided to found a new settlement, and to determine its location had a log bound with gold drifting in Lake Mälaren. It landed on present day Riddarholmen where today the Tower of Birger Jarl stands, a building, as a consequence, still often erroneously mentioned as the oldest building in Stockholm. The most established explanation for the name are logs driven into the strait passing north of today&#x27;s old town which dendrochronological examinations in the late 1970s dated to around 1000. While no solid proofs exists, it is often assumed the Three Crown Castle, which preceded the present Stockholm Palace, originated from these wooden structures, and that the medieval city quickly expanded around it in the mid 13th century. In a wider historical context, Stockholm can be thought of as the capital of the Lake Mälaren Region, and as such can trace its origin back to at least two much older cities: Birka (c. 790–975) and Sigtuna, which still exists but dominated the region c. 1000–1240 — a capital which has simply been relocated at a number of occasions.

== Middle Ages ==


The name Stockholm first appears in historical records in letters written by Birger Jarl and King Valdemar dated 1252. However, the two letters give no information about the appearance of the city and events during the following decades remain diffuse. While the absence of a perpendicular city plan in medieval Stockholm seems to indicate a spontaneous growth, it is known German merchants invited by Birger Jarl played an important role in the foundation of the city. Under any circumstance, during the end of the 13th century, Stockholm quickly grew to become not only the largest city in Sweden, but also the &quot;de facto&quot; Swedish political centre and royal residence. Thus, from its foundation, Stockholm has been the largest and most important Swedish city, inseparable from and dependent on the Swedish government. However, as late as the 16th century, reigns of Kings Eric XIV and John III, whose Swedish government often travelled with them elsewhere (see below), the city was still not what could be called a national capital in modern terms.
During the Kalmar Union (1397–1523), controlling Stockholm was crucial to anyone aspiring to control the kingdom, and the city was consequently repeatedly besieged by various Swedish-Danish factions. In 1452, a Danish fleet made a failed attack on the city. In 1471, Sten Sture the Elder defeated Christian I of Denmark at the Battle of Brunkeberg only to lose the city to Hans of Denmark in 1497. Sten Sture managed to seize power again in 1501 which resulted in a Danish blockade lasting 1502–1509 and eventually a short peace. Hans&#x27; son Christian II of Denmark finally conquered it in 1520 and had many leading nobles and burghers of Stockholm beheaded in the so-called Stockholm Bloodbath. When King Gustav Vasa finally besieged and conquered the city three years later, an event which ended the Kalmar Union and the Swedish Middle Ages, he noted every second building in the city was abandoned.

By the end of the 15th century, the population in Stockholm can be estimated to 5,000–7,000 people, which made it a relatively small town compared to several other contemporary European cities. On the other hand, it was far larger than any other city in Sweden. Many of its inhabitants were Germans and Finns, with the former forming a political and economic elite in the city.

During the Middle Ages, export was administered mostly by German merchants living by the squares Kornhamnstorg (&quot;Grain Harbour Square&quot;) and Järntorget (&quot;Iron Square&quot;) on the southern corner of the city. Regional peasantry supplied the city with food and raw materials, while the craftsmen in the city produced handicrafts, most of whom lived by the central square Stortorget or by the oldest two streets in Stockholm, the names of which still reflects their trade: Köpmangatan (&quot;Merchant Street&quot;) and Skomakargatan (&quot;Shoemaker Street&quot;) in the central part of the city. Other groups lived by the eastern or western thoroughfares, Västerlånggatan and Österlånggatan.

== Early Vasa era ==


After Gustav Vasa&#x27;s siege of Stockholm, he restored the privileges of the city which was beneficiary to the burghers of the city. The king maintained his control over the city by controlling the elections of aldermen and magistrates. By the mid-century, the numbers of officials increased in order to make the management of the city more professional and to ensure the state-controlled trade. Stockholm thus lost much of the independence it had had during the Middle Ages and became politically and financially bound to the state. During the reign of his sons (1561–1611), the city council remained escorted by a royal representative and both magistrates and aldermen were appointed by the king.

Gustav Vasa invited the clergyman Olaus Petri (1493–1552) to become the city secretary of Stockholm. With the two side by side, the new ideas of the Protestant Reformation could be quickly implemented, and sermons in the church were held in Swedish starting in 1525 and Latin was abolished in 1530. A consequence of this development was a need for separate churches for the numerous German and Finnish-speaking citizens and during the 1530 the still-existent German and Finnish parishes were created. The king was, however, not favourably disposed to older chapels and churches in the city, and he ordered churches and monasteries on the ridges surrounding the city to be demolished, together with the numerous charitable institutions.

Because Stockholm had a city wall, it was exempted from the tax paid by other Swedish cities. During the reign of Gustav Vasa the city&#x27;s fortifications were reinforced and in the Stockholm Archipelago, Vaxholm was created to guard the inlet from the Baltic. While the medieval structure of Stockholm remained mostly unaltered during the 16th century, the city&#x27;s social and economic importance grew to the extent that no king could permit the city to determine its own faith – the most important export item being bar iron and the most important destination Lübeck. During the reign of Vasa&#x27;s sons, trade led many Swedes to settle in the city, but the trade and the capital needed to control it was largely in the hands of the king and German merchants from Lübeck and Danzig. Throughout the era, Sweden could hardly claim the level of government and bureaucracy requisite to a capital in the modern sense, but Stockholm was the kingdom&#x27;s strongest bastion and the king&#x27;s main residence. As Eric XIV&#x27;s pretensions were on par with those of Renaissance princes on the continent, he afforded himself the largest court his finances could possibly support, and the royal castle was thus the biggest employer in the city.

Around 1560–80, most of the citizens, some 8.000 people, still lived on Stadsholmen. This central island was at this time densely settled and the city was now expanding on the ridges surrounding the city. Stockholm had no private palaces at this time and the only larger buildings were the castle, the church, and the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen. The surrounding ridges, unable to boast a single timber framed building, were mostly used for activities that either required a lot of space, produced odours, or could cause fire. Even though some burghers had secondary residences outside the city, the population living on the ridges, perhaps a quarter of the city&#x27;s population, were mostly poor, including the royal personnel occupying the ridges north of the city.

== Great Power era==

Following the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), Sweden was determined never to repeat the embarrassment experienced following the death of Gustavus II Adolphus (1594–1632) when Stockholm, still medieval in character, caused hesitation on whether to invite foreign statesmen for fear the lamentable appearance might undermine the nation&#x27;s authority. Therefore, Stockholm saw many ambitious city plans during the era, of which those for the ridges surrounding today&#x27;s old town still stands. In accordance to the mercantilism of the era, trade and industry was concentrated to cities where it was easier to control, and Stockholm was of central importance. In a letter in 1636, Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna (1583–1654) wrote that evolving the Swedish capital was a prerequisite for the nation&#x27;s power and strength and that this would bring all the other cities on their feet. Increased state intervention on city level was not unique to Sweden at this time, but it was probably more prominent in the case of Stockholm than anywhere else in Europe. To this end, the government of the city was reformed and the former volunteered magistrates gradually replaced by professionals with a theoretical education.

=== Population and city plans ===
The process of reshaping Stockholm was initiated by a major fire in 1625 which destroyed the south-western part of today&#x27;s old town. As a result, two new boulevard-like streets were created — Stora Nygatan and Lilla Nygatan — and along the eastern waterfront the medieval wall was replaced by a row of prestigious palaces — Skeppsbron.

For the ridges surrounding the city – Norrmalm, Östermalm, Kungsholmen, and Södermalm – new city plans were worked out to create wide and straight artery streets. The project was implemented so thoroughly, in several parts of the city no traces exist of the previous medieval structures. Many of the streets from this era are still extant, and some of those proposed have been realised with some minor modifications.

The population grew from less than 10,000 in the early 17th century to more than 50,000 in the mid-1670s.
The city&#x27;s income rose from 18,595 daler in 1635–36 to 81,480 daler in 1644. In 1642, approximately 60 per cent of that sum was spent on construction works.

===Trade===

Other Swedish cities were deprived of their export privileges by the so-called &quot;Bothnian Trade Coercion&quot; (&quot;Bottniska handelstvånget&quot;). Most Swedish cities were granted a trade monopoly over a limited surrounding area, but for Stockholm most of the lands surrounding the Gulf of Bothnia formed part of the city&#x27;s trade territory. However, the state-granted monopoly was not the only thing that favoured Stockholm at that time. It was one of the best natural harbours of the era and throughout the 17th century, countless foreign visitors marvelled at the sight of large ships &quot;with 60 or 70 cannons&quot; moored along the eastern quay next to the royal castle.

In contrast with other Swedish cities, all of which were self-supporting, Stockholm was completely dependent of the transit passing through the city—it had, for example, about the same number of domestic animals as Uppsala, which only had ten per cent the population of the capital. All goods brought into Stockholm had to pass through one of six customs stations, and approximately three-fourths of them were exported from the city. Half of the remaining items, mostly fishery products, were delivered from the Baltic, and corn came from the Lake Mälaren region. However, during the latter half of the century, the rapidly growing capital could not be supported by the Lake Mälaren region alone and therefore became dependent on corn imported from the provinces.

Sweden had played a passive role in international trade during the 16th century; German merchants and ships managed the export of Swedish primary products such as osmond iron, raw copper, and butter. This export was largely regarded as a means of securing the import of items not available in Sweden, such as salt, wine, and luxury goods demanded at the court. With the introduction of a mercantile doctrine around 1620, trade became a keystone to governmental income and the Swedish economy subsequently focused on export, not of raw materials, but of refined products. Over the entire period (c. 1590–1685), Stockholm&#x27;s share of the national economy remained stable at around two-thirds, but during the first half of the 17th century, export grew fourfold and import fivefold. Most goods were delivered to the Netherlands in the mid-17th century and to the UK in the early 18th century.

In the 17th century, the textile industry was developed with the establishments of the textile manufactures &quot;Paulinska manufakturerna&quot; (active 1673–1776) and the &quot;Barnängens manufaktur&quot; (active 1691–1826), which became two of the greatest sources of employments in the Swedish capital during the entire 18th-century.

== Age of Liberty (1718–1772) ==
Following the Greater Wrath and the Treaty of Nystad in 1722, Sweden&#x27;s role as a major European power was over, and the decades that followed brought even more disasters. Black death and the sufferings caused by the Great Northern Wars made Stockholm the capital of a shrinking nation, despair which would deepen even further when Sweden lost Finland in 1809. Notwithstanding Sweden&#x27;s partial recover of spirit with the union with Norway in 1814, during the period 1750–1850, Stockholm was a stagnating city, with a dwindling population and widespread unemployment, marked by ill-health, poverty, alcoholism, and rampant mortality. The Mälaren region lost in influence to the benefit of south-western Sweden, and as population and welfare dwindled in the capital, there was a leveling of social classes. Wars and alcohol abuse resulted in a surplus of women during the period, with widows outnumbering widowers six to one in 1850. Stockholm was marked by an absence of children, caused by the number of unmarried people and high infant mortality. Average length of life was limited to 44, but those who survived infancy were likely to get about as old as people do today, except those born to a life of hard labour.

A stratification into three social groups can be made for this era :
# individuals of rank and officers
# craftsmen, small-scale entrepreneurs, and officials
# journeymen, assistants, workers, soldiers, servants, paupers, and prisoners.
Women were associated with their husband&#x27;s status. However, as craftsmen saw their status sink with the introduction of industrialism, the proletarian class grew during the period. There also was an economic segregation in the city, with the present old town and the lower parts of Norrmalm being the wealthiest (more than 150% above average); the suburbs (today part of central Stockholm) were poor (50% below average).

During the 18th century, the Mercantile model introduced the previous century was further developed, with domestic production promoted by loans and bounties and import limited to raw materials not available in Sweden by tolls. The era saw the rise of the so-called &quot;Skeppsbro Nobility&quot; (&quot;Skeppsbroadeln&quot;), the wealthy wholesalers at Skeppsbron who made a fortune by delivering bar iron to the international market and by controlling the chartered companies. The most successful of them was the Swedish East India Company (1731–1813) which had its headquarters in Gothenburg, but was of significant importance to Stockholm because of the shipbuilding yards, the trade houses, and the exotic products imported by the company. Furthermore, before these ships left Stockholm some 100–150 men per ship were recruited, most of them in the city, and as a single trip to China would take 1–2 years the company had a huge impact on Stockholm during this era.

During the 18th century, several devastating fires destroyed entire neighbourhoods which resulted in building codes being introduced. They improved fire safety by prohibiting wooden buildings and further embellished the city by implementing the 17th-century city plans. In the old town, the new royal palace was gradually completed and the exterior of the Storkyrkan church was adopted to it. The skilled artists and craftsmen working for the royal court formed an elite which considerably raised the artistic standards in the capital.

== Gustavian era (1772–1809) ==


During the enlightened absolute monarchy of Gustav III Stockholm managed to maintain its role as the political centre of Sweden and developed culturally.

The king had a great interest for the city&#x27;s development. He created the Gustav Adolf square and had the Royal Opera inaugurated there in 1782 — in accordance to the original intentions of Tessin the Younger for a monumental square north of the palace. The façade of Arvfurstens palats on the opposite side is identical to the now replaced façade of the opera.

The neoclassical bridge Norrbro, designed by Erik Palmstedt (1741–1807) and was completed in ten years. It was a very ambitious project that caused the centre of the city to gradually move out of the medieval city.

The colourful and often burlesque descriptions of Stockholm by troubadour and composer Carl Michael Bellman are still popular.

The period ended as King Gustav IV Adolf was deposed in 1809 in a coup d&#x27;état. The loss of Finland that same year meant Stockholm ceased to be the geographical centre of the Swedish kingdom.

== Early industrial era (1809–1850) ==

For Stockholm, the early 19th century meant the only larger-scale projects to be realised were those initiated by the military which favoured a more stiff classicism, the local Swedish version of the Empire style (in Sweden named &quot;Karl Johansstil&quot; after King Charles XIV John). The architects dominating the era, Fredrik Blom and Carl Christoffer Gjörwell, both were commissioned by the military. Due to the general stagnation, few other constructions were realised — in average ten smaller residential buildings per year — additions which the ambitious city plans of the 17th century could easily handle.

During the later half of the 18th century real income dwindled to reach an all-time low in 1810 when it corresponded to roughly half that of the 1730s; public officials being those worst affected. Norrköping became the greatest manufacturing city of Sweden and Gothenburg developed into the key trading port because of its location on the North Sea.

Most people still lived within the present Old Town, with a growth along the eastern shore. Population also grew on the surrounding ridges, more so in the wealthy district Norrmalm and less so in the poor district Södermalm. However, many of the ridges surrounding the city were slums mostly rural in character without water and sewage and frequently ravaged by cholera.
== Late industrial era (1850–1910) ==

In the second half of the century, Stockholm regained its leading economic role. New industries emerged, and Stockholm transformed into an important trade and service centre, as well as a key gateway point within Sweden.

While steam engines were introduced in Stockholm in 1806 with the Eldkvarn mill, it took until the mid-19th century for industrialization to take off. Two factories, Ludvigsberg and Bolinder, constructed in the 1840s were followed by many others, and the economic development that succeeded resulted in some 800 new buildings being constructed 1850–70 — many of which were located in the Klara district and subsequently demolished in the Redevelopment of Norrmalm 1950–70.
During the 1850s and 1860s, gas works, sewage, and running water was introduced. Many streets were paved, including Skeppsbron and Strandvägen, and the railway brought Stockholm closer to continental Europe — an event which additionally lead to the creation of the first suburb Liljeholmen where railway workshops were located. As the railway was extended further north, Stockholm Central Station was inaugurated in 1871. The first horse-pulled trams were introduced in 1877. Long before the railway, steam engines became common on boats which resulted in many summertime residences being built around Stockholm. But the booming urban development was also notable in central Stockholm where several prominent Neo-Renaissance buildings were built, including the Academy of Music and Södra Teatern.


In 1866, a commission led by Albert Lindhagen produced a city plan for the ridges (&quot;malmarna&quot;) designed to offer citizens light, fresh air and access to Swedish nature by mean of parks and plantations. To this goal, he proposed a system of esplanades culminating in Sveavägen, a 2 km long and 70 m wide boulevard inspired by Champs Elysées. 1877–80 new city plans were finally passed for central Stockholm, which made the city well-prepared for the major expansion that followed. During the 1880s more than 2.000 buildings were added on the ridges and the population grew from 168.000 to 245.000. At the end of the century, less than 40 per cent of the residents were born in Stockholm.

While this demand for housing was mostly dealt with by private entrepreneurs who built on pure speculation, street width and building heights were strictly regulated by the new city plans which ensured the city that evolved was given a uniform design. A trend initiated by the Bünsow House at Strandvägen, the 1880s saw many monumental brick buildings evolve, including Gamla Riksarkivet and the Norstedt Building on Riddarholmen. Before the end of the decade, most new buildings were equipped with electricity and telephones were increasingly common. During the 1890s, the Neo-Renaissance plaster architecture was replaced by structures in brick and natural stone, largely inspired by French Renaissance architecture. Around what still was factories outside the customs of Stockholm, shacks whose sanitary conditions defied all description evolved. Before the end of the century, however, these were transformed into municipal societies, which facilitated regulation of health and construction, and by the turn of the century, the expansion had continued far beyond the city limits, with villa suburbs initiated by individuals adding a mix of purely speculative structures and more qualitative ambitions. The new century saw the introduction of Art Nouveau with the Central Post Office Building by Boberg (1898–1904) and Neo-Baroque with the Riksdag (1894–1906). Throughout the 1910s, trams were electrified and cars were rolling on the streets of Stockholm.

During this period, Stockholm further developed as a cultural and educational centre. In the 19th century, a number of scientific institutes opened in Stockholm, for example the Karolinska Institutet. The General Art and Industrial Exposition, an international exhibition of World&#x27;s Fair status, was held on the island of Djurgården in 1897.

== 20th century ==

In the late 20th century, Stockholm became a modern, technologically advanced and ethnically diverse city. Throughout the century, many industries shifted away from work-intensive activities into more high-technology and service-industry knowledge-based areas.

The city continued to expand and new districts were created, some with high proportions of immigrants. Meanwhile, the inner city (Norrmalm) went through a criticised as well as an admired wave of modernisation in the post-war period, the Redevelopment of Norrmalm, securing the city&#x27;s geographical center as the political and business center for the future.

In 1923 the Stockholm municipal government moved to a new building, the Stockholm City Hall. The Stockholm International Exhibition was held in 1930. In 1967 the city of Stockholm was integrated into Stockholm County.

===The &quot;Stockholm Initiative&quot; ===
On April 22, 1991, thirty world leaders gathered in Stockholm, among them Ingvar Carlsson, then Prime Minister of Sweden; Willy Brandt, Chair of the Socialist International and former Chancellor of Germany; Julius Nyerere, former President of Tanzania; Gro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway; Kalevi Sorsa, former prime minister of Finland; Edward Heath, former prime minister of the U. K.; and Benazir Bhutto, former prime minister of Pakistan.

<text>Apart from being a large city with an active cultural life, Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, houses many national cultural institutions. There are two UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the Stockholm County area: the Royal Palace Drottningholm (within Ekerö Municipality) and the Skogskyrkogården (The Woodland Cemetery). 

Stockholm was the 1998 European City of Culture.

== Literature ==
Authors connected to Stockholm include the poet and songwriter Carl Michael Bellman (1740–1795), novelist and dramatist August Strindberg (1849–1912), and novelist Hjalmar Söderberg (1869–1941), all of whom made Stockholm part of their works. Other authors with notable heritage in Stockholm were the Nobel Prize laureate Eyvind Johnson (1900–1976) and the popular poet and composer Evert Taube (1890–1976). The novelist Per Anders Fogelström (1917–1998) wrote a popular series of historical novels depicting life in Stockholm from the 19th to the mid-20th century.

== Architecture ==

The city&#x27;s oldest section is Gamla stan (Old Town), located on the original small islands of the city&#x27;s earliest settlements and still featuring the medieval street layout. Some notable buildings of Gamla Stan are the large German Church (&quot;Tyska kyrkan&quot;) and several mansions and palaces: the &quot;Riddarhuset&quot; (the House of Nobles), the Bonde Palace, the Tessin Palace and the Oxenstierna Palace. The oldest building in Stockholm is the Riddarholmskyrkan from the late 13th century. After a fire in 1697 when the original medieval castle was destroyed, Stockholm Palace was erected in a baroque style. Storkyrkan Cathedral, the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Stockholm, stands next to the castle. It was founded in the 13th century but is clad in a baroque exterior dating to the 18th century.

As early as the 15th century, the city had expanded outside of its original borders. Some pre-industrial, small-scale buildings from this era can still be found in Södermalm. During the 19th century and the age of industrialization Stockholm grew rapidly, with plans and architecture inspired by the large cities of the continent such as Berlin and Vienna. Notable works of this time period include public buildings such as the Royal Swedish Opera and private developments such as the luxury housing developments on Strandvägen.
In the 20th century, a nationalistic push spurred a new architectural style inspired by medieval and renaissance ancestry as well as influences of the Jugend / Art Nouveau style. A key landmark of Stockholm, the Stockholm City Hall, was erected 1911–1923 by architect Ragnar Östberg. Other notable works of these times are the Stockholm Public Library and the Forest Cemetery, Skogskyrkogården

Modernism characterized the style of the Stockholm International Exhibition (1930) and the development of the city as it grew in that decade. New residential areas sprang up such as the development on Gärdet while industrial development added to the growth, such as the KF manufacturing industries on Kvarnholmen located in the Nacka Municipality. In the 1950s, suburban development entered a new phase with the introduction of the Stockholm metro. The modernist developments of Vällingby and Farsta where internationally praised. In the 1960s this suburban development continued but with the aesthetic of the times, the industrialised and mass-produced blocks of flats received a large amount of criticism.

At the same time that this suburban development was happening the most central areas of the inner city were being redesigned. Sergels Torg, with its five high-rise office towers was created in the 1960s, followed by the total clearance of large areas to make room for new development projects. The most notable buildings from this period is the ensemble of the House of Culture, City Theatre and National Bank building, designed by architect Peter Celsing.

<text>Stephen R. Lawhead (born July 7, 1950) is an American writer known for his works of fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction, particularly Celtic historical fiction. He has written over 28 novels and numerous children&#x27;s and non-fiction books.

==Biography==
He was born to Robert Eugene Lawhead and Lois Rowena Bissell Lawhead at Good Samaritan Hospital, Kearney, Nebraska. In 1968, Lawhead graduated from Kearney High School and entered Kearney State College as an Art major. In 1969, while at Kearney State College, he wrote a weekly humour column for the college newspaper and was a frequent contributor of poetry and short stories to &quot;The Shore Anthology&quot; and &quot;The Antler&quot;. He paid his way through college largely through playing lead guitar in a college rock band named Mother Rush. Lawhead met Alice Slaikeu in 1971, and married her in 1972. He graduated from Kearney State College in 1973 with BA in Art and then went on to enroll in Northern Baptist Theological Seminary. During this time Lawhead also enrolled in a number of writing courses at nearby Wheaton College. His professional writing career began with five busy years as an editor and staff writer for Campus Life magazine. In 1980, Lawhead became the manager of the successful Christian rock act DeGarmo and Key and formed his own record company, Ariel Records. The demise of Ariel Records in 1981 prompted the beginning of Lawhead&#x27;s fiction-writing career.

In 1981, Lawhead began to author novels, initially fantasy and science fiction, completing his first trilogy, the &quot;Dragon King trilogy&quot;. In 1986, he moved to Oxford, England, to do research for The Pendragon Cycle, a reinterpretation of the legend of King Arthur in a Celtic setting combined with elements of Atlantis. Heavily rooted in the original Celtic source material which gave rise to the later and more familiar versions of the Arthurian legend, the series has received critical acclaim for its creative retelling of the Arthur legend and historical credibility.

The first book in the series, &quot;Taliesin&quot;, won the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association&#x27;s Gold Medallion Award for Fiction in 1988. Lawhead&#x27;s research for The Pendragon Cycle sparked an interest in Celtic history and culture, especially Celtic Christianity, topics which have featured prominently in his work ever since.

&quot;The Song of Albion&quot; trilogy prompted a return to England (Lawhead having left in 1987). This was a series of books set between the Celtic Otherworld and present-day Britain. In the 1990s, he published &quot;Byzantium&quot;, a work of pure historical fiction, followed by &quot;The Celtic Crusades&quot; trilogy, set at the time of the Crusades, and then &quot;Avalon: The Return of King Arthur&quot;, a stand-alone related to the &quot;Pendragon Cycle&quot;.

In 2003, Lawhead published the novel &quot;Patrick: Son of Ireland&quot;, a fictionalized account of the early years of Saint Patrick. In 2006, he published &quot;Hood&quot;, the first book in the &quot;King Raven Trilogy&quot; – a retelling of the Robin Hood legend, transferred to Wales. In 2008, the second book in the trilogy, &quot;Scarlet&quot;, won a Christy Award in the category of Visionary Fiction.

In 2003, Lawhead received an honorary doctorate from the University of Nebraska at Kearney.

Lawhead and his wife reside in Oxford, UK. He has two sons, Ross Lawhead, and Drake Lawhead.

<doc id="27951" wikidata="Q192998" url="?curid=27951" title="Servius Tullius">
<text>Servius Tullius was the legendary sixth king of Rome, and the second of its Etruscan dynasty. He reigned from 578 to 535 BC. Roman and Greek sources describe his servile origins and later marriage to a daughter of Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, Rome&#x27;s first Etruscan king, who was assassinated in 579 BC. The constitutional basis for his accession is unclear; he is variously described as the first Roman king to accede without election by the Senate, having gained the throne by popular and royal support; and as the first to be elected by the Senate alone, with support of the reigning queen but without recourse to a popular vote.

Several traditions describe Servius&#x27; father as divine. Livy depicts Servius&#x27; mother as a captured Latin princess enslaved by the Romans; her child is chosen as Rome&#x27;s future king after a ring of fire is seen around his head. The Emperor Claudius discounted such origins and described him as an originally Etruscan mercenary, named Mastarna, who fought for Caelius Vibenna.

Servius was a popular king, and one of Rome&#x27;s most significant benefactors. He had military successes against Veii and the Etruscans, and expanded the city to include the Quirinal, Viminal and Esquiline hills. He is traditionally credited with the institution of the Compitalia festivals, the building of temples to Fortuna and Diana and, less plausibly, the invention of Rome&#x27;s first true coinage.

Despite the opposition of Rome&#x27;s patricians, he expanded the Roman franchise and improved the lot and fortune of Rome&#x27;s lowest classes of citizens and non-citizens. According to Livy, he reigned for 44 years, until murdered by his daughter Tullia and son-in-law Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. In consequence of this &quot;tragic crime&quot; and his hubristic arrogance as king, Tarquinius was eventually removed. This cleared the way for the abolition of Rome&#x27;s monarchy and the founding of the Roman Republic, whose groundwork had already been laid by Servius&#x27; reforms.

==Background==
Before its establishment as a Republic, Rome was ruled by kings (Latin &quot;reges&quot;, singular &quot;rex&quot;). In Roman tradition, Rome&#x27;s founder Romulus was the first. Servius Tullius was the sixth, and his successor Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud) was the last. The nature of Roman kingship is unclear; most Roman kings were elected by the senate, as to a lifetime magistracy, but some claimed succession through dynastic or divine right. Some were native Romans, others were foreign. Later Romans had a complex ideological relationship with this distant past. In Republican mores and institutions kingship was abhorrent; and remained so, in name at least, during the Empire. On the one hand, Romulus was held to have brought Rome into being more-or-less at a stroke, so complete and purely Roman in its essentials that any acceptable change or reform thereafter must be clothed as restoration. On the other, Romans of the Republic and Empire saw each king as contributing in some distinctive and novel way to the city&#x27;s fabric and territories, or its social, military, religious, legal or political institutions. Servius Tullius has been described as Rome&#x27;s &quot;second founder&quot;, &quot;the most complex and enigmatic&quot; of all its kings, and a kind of &quot;proto-Republican magistrate&quot;.

===Ancient sources===
The oldest surviving source for the overall political developments of the Roman kingdom and Republic is Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De republica&quot; (&quot;On the State&quot;), written in 44 BC. The main literary sources for Servius&#x27; life and achievements are the Roman historian Livy (59 BC – AD 17), whose &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot; was generally accepted by the Romans as the standard, most authoritative account; Livy&#x27;s near contemporary Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and Plutarch (c. 46 – 120 AD); their own sources included works by Quintus Fabius Pictor, Diocles of Peparethus, Quintus Ennius and Cato the Elder. Livy&#x27;s sources probably included at least some official state records, he excluded what seemed implausible or contradictory traditions, and arranged his material within an overarching chronology. Dionysius and Plutarch offer various alternatives not found in Livy, and Livy&#x27;s own pupil, the etruscologist, historian and emperor Claudius, offered yet another, based on Etruscan tradition.

==Origins==

===Parentage and birth===
Most Roman sources name Servius&#x27; mother as Ocrisia, a young noblewoman taken at the Roman siege of Corniculum and brought to Rome, either pregnant by her husband, who was killed at the siege: or as a virgin. She was given to Tanaquil, wife of king Tarquinius, and though slave, was treated with the respect due her former status. In one variant, she became wife to a noble client of Tarquinius. In others, she served the domestic rites of the royal hearth as a Vestal Virgin, and on one such occasion, having damped the hearth flames with a sacrificial offering, she was penetrated and impregnated by a disembodied phallus that rose from the hearth. According to Tanaquil, this was a divine manifestation, either of the household Lar or Vulcan himself. Thus Servius was divinely fathered and already destined for greatness, despite his mother&#x27;s servile status; for the time being, Tanaquil and Ocrisia kept this a secret.

===Early life===
Servius&#x27; birth to a slave of the royal household would have made him a member of Tarquin&#x27;s extended domestic &quot;familia&quot;, and a slave himself. Livy describes Servius as a youth already holding an honourable position, as son of a living, noble mother and noble father. He is singled out for special favour when members of the royal household witness a nimbus of fire about his head while he sleeps, a sign of divine favour, and a great portent. In Livy&#x27;s version, Servius becomes a protégé of the royal family (&quot;like a son&quot;) through this event, and later marries their daughter Tarquinia. For Livy, this marriage undermines the traditional narrative in which Ocrisia, and thus her son Servius, are household slaves; Livy asserts that no slave, nor any of slave descent, could have been granted the great honour of marriage into Rome&#x27;s ruling family. 

Servius proves a loyal, responsible son-in-law. When given governmental and military responsibilities, he excels in both. Plutarch, citing Valerius Antias &quot;and his school&quot;, names Servius&#x27; wife as Gegania: the nimbus of fire appears around the sleeping Servius much later, when Gegania is dying; &quot;a token of his birth from fire&quot;.

==Reign==
In Livy&#x27;s account, Tarquinius Priscus had been elected king on the death of the previous king, Ancus Marcius, whose two sons were too young to inherit or offer themselves for election. When Servius&#x27; popularity and his marriage to Tarquinius&#x27; daughter made him a likely successor to the throne, these sons attempted to seize the throne for themselves. They hired two assassins, who attacked and severely wounded Tarquinius. Tanaquil immediately ordered the palace to be shut, and publicly announced from a palace window that Tarquinius had appointed Servius as regent; meanwhile, Tarquinius died of his wounds. When his death became public knowledge, the senate elected Servius as king, and the sons of Ancus fled to exile in Suessa Pometia. Livy describes this as the first occasion that the people of Rome were not involved in the election of the king. In Plutarch, Servius reluctantly consented to the kingship at the death-bed insistence of Tanaquil.

Early in his reign, Servius warred against Veii and the Etruscans. He is said to have shown valour in the campaign, and to have routed a great army of the enemy. His success helped him to cement his position at Rome. According to the &quot;Fasti Triumphales&quot;, Servius celebrated three triumphs over the Etruscans, including on 25 November 571 BC and 25 May 567 BC (the date of the third triumph is not legible on the &quot;Fasti&quot;).

===Servian reforms===

Most of the reforms credited to Servius extended voting rights to certain groups – in particular to Rome&#x27;s citizen-commoners (known in the Republican era as plebs), minor landholders previously disqualified from voting by ancestry, status or ethnicity. The same reforms simultaneously defined the fiscal and military obligations of all Roman citizens. As a whole, the so-called Servian reforms probably represent a long-drawn, complex and piecemeal process of populist policy and reform, extending from Servius&#x27; predecessors, Ancus Marcius and Tarquinius Priscus, to his successor Tarquinius Superbus, and into the Middle and Late Republic. Rome&#x27;s military and territorial expansion and consequent changes in its population would have made franchise regulation and reform an ongoing necessity, and their wholesale attribution to Servius &quot;cannot be taken at face value&quot;.

====Curiate reform and census====
Until the Servian reforms, the passing of laws and judgment was the prerogative of the &quot;comitia curiata&quot; (curiate assembly), made up from thirty curiae; Roman sources describe ten curiae for each of three aristocratic tribes or clans, each supposedly based on one of Rome&#x27;s central hills, and claiming patrician status by virtue of their descent from Rome&#x27;s founding families. These tribes comprised approximately 200 &quot;gentes&quot; (clans), each of which contributed one senator (&quot;elder&quot;) to the Senate. The senate advised the king, devised laws in his name, and was held to represent the entire &quot;populus Romanus&quot; (Roman people); but it could only debate and discuss. Its decisions had no force unless approved by the &quot;comitia curiata&quot;. By the time of Servius, if not long before, the tribes of the &quot;comitia&quot; were a minority of the population, ruling a multitude who had no effective voice in their own government.

Rome&#x27;s far more populous citizen-commoners could participate in this assembly in limited fashion, and perhaps offer their opinions on decisions but only the &quot;comitia curiata&quot; could vote. A minority thus exercised power and control over the majority. Roman tradition held that Servius formed a comitia centuriata of commoners to displace the &quot;comitia curiata&quot; as Rome&#x27;s central legislative body. This required his development of the first Roman census, making Servius the first Roman censor. For the purposes of the census, citizens assembled by tribe in the Campus Martius to register their social rank, household, property and income. This established an individual&#x27;s tax obligations, his ability to muster arms for military service when required to do so, and his assignment to a particular voting bloc.

The institution of the census and the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; are speculated as Servius&#x27; attempt to erode the civil and military power of the Roman aristocracy, and seek the direct support of his newly enfranchised citizenry in civil matters; if necessary, under arms. The &quot;comitia curiata&quot; continued to function through the Regal and Republican eras, but the Servian reform had reduced its powers to those of a largely symbolic &quot;upper house&quot;; its noble members were expected to do no more than ratify decisions of the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot;.

====Classes====
The census grouped Rome&#x27;s male citizen population in classes, according to status, wealth and age. Each class was subdivided into groups called &quot;centuriae&quot; (centuries), nominally of 100 men (Latin &quot;centum&quot; = 100) but in practice of variable number, further divided as &quot;seniores&quot; (men aged 46 – 60, of a suitable age to serve as &quot;home guards&quot; or city police) and &quot;iuniores&quot; (men aged 17 – 45, to serve as front–line troops when required). Adult male citizens were obliged, when called upon, to fulfill military service according to their means, which was supposedly assessed in archaic &quot;asses&quot;. A citizen&#x27;s wealth and class would, therefore, have defined their position in the civil hierarchies, and up to a point, within the military; but despite its apparent military character, and its possible origins as the mustering of the citizenry–at–arms, the system would have primarily served to determine the voting qualifications and wealth of individual citizens for taxation purposes, and the weight of their vote – wars were occasional but taxation was a constant necessity – and the comitia centuriata met whenever required to do so, in peace or war. Though each century had voting rights, the wealthiest had the most centuries, and voted first. Those beneath them were convened only in the event of deadlock or indecision; the lowest class was unlikely to vote at all.

The Roman army&#x27;s &quot;centuria&quot; system and its order of battle are thought to be based on the civilian classifications established by the census. The military selection process picked men from civilian &quot;centuriae&quot; and slipped them into military ones. Their function depended on their age, experience, and the equipment they could afford. The wealthiest class of &quot;iuniores&quot; (aged 17–45) were armed as hoplites, heavy infantry with helmet, greaves, breastplate, shields (&quot;clipeus&quot;), and spears (&quot;hastae&quot;). Each battle line in the phalanx formation was composed of a single class. Military specialists, such as trumpeters, were chosen from the 5th class. The highest officers were of aristocratic origin until the early Republic, when the first plebeian tribunes were elected by the plebeians from their own number. Cornell suggests that this centuriate system made the equites, who &quot;consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of patricians&quot; but voted after infantry of the first class, subordinate to the relatively low-status infantry.

===Tribal and boundary expansions===
The Servian reforms increased the number of tribes and expanded the city, which was protected by a new rampart, moat and wall. The enclosed area was divided into four administrative &quot;regiones&quot; (regions, or quarters); the Suburana, Esquilana, Collina and Palatina. Servius himself is said to have taken a new residence, on the Esquiline. The situation beyond the walls is unclear, but thereafter, membership of a Roman voting-tribe would have depended on residence rather than kinship, ancestry and inheritance. This would have brought significant numbers of urban and rural &quot;plebs&quot; into active political life; and a significant number of these would have been allocated to centuries of the first class, and therefore likely to vote. The city of Rome&#x27;s division into &quot;quarters&quot; remained in use until 7 BC, when Augustus divided the city into 14 new &quot;regiones&quot;. In modern Rome, an ancient portion of surviving wall is attributed to Servius, the remainder supposedly being rebuilt after the sack of Rome in 390/387 BC by the Gauls.

===Economy===
Some Roman historians believed Servius Tullius responsible for Rome&#x27;s earliest true, minted coinage, replacing an earlier and less convenient currency of raw bullion. This is unlikely, though he may have introduced the official stamping of raw currency. Money played a minimal role in the Roman economy, which was almost entirely agrarian at this time. Debt and debt bondage, however, were probably rife. The form of such debts would have had little resemblance to those of cash-debtors, compelled to pay interest to money-lenders on an advance of capital. Rather, wealthy landowners would make an &quot;advance loan&quot; of seed, foodstuffs or other essentials to tenants, clients and smallholders, in return for a promise of labour services or a substantial share of the crop. The terms of such &quot;loans&quot; compelled defaulters to sell themselves, or their dependants, to their creditor; or, if smallholders, to surrender their farm. Wealthy aristocratic landholders thus acquired additional farms and service for very little outlay. Dionysius claims that Servius paid such debts &quot;from his own purse&quot;, and forbade voluntary and compulsory debt bondage. In reality, these practices persisted well into the Republican era. Livy describes the distribution of land grants to poor and landless citizens by Servius and others as the political pursuit of popular support from citizens of little merit or worth.

===Religion===
Servius is credited with the construction of Diana&#x27;s temple on the Aventine Hill, to mark the foundation of the so-called Latin League; His servile birth-mythos, his populist leanings and his reorganisation of the &quot;vici&quot; appear to justify the Roman belief that he founded or reformed the Compitalia festivals (held to celebrate the Lares that watched over each local community), or allowed for the first time their attendance and service by non-citizens and slaves. His personal reputation and achievements may have led to his historical association with temples and shrines to Fortuna; some sources suggest that the two were connected during Servius&#x27; lifetime, via some form of &quot;sacred marriage&quot;. Plutarch explicitly identifies the &quot;Porta Fenestella&quot; (&quot;window gate&quot;) of the Royal palace as the window from which Tanaquil announced Servius&#x27; regency to the people; the goddess Fortuna was said to have passed through the same window, to become Servius&#x27; consort.

===Assassination===

In Livy&#x27;s history, Servius Tullius had two daughters, Tullia the Elder and Tullia the Younger. He arranged their marriage to the two sons of his predecessor, Lucius Tarquinius and Arruns Tarquinius. The younger Tullia and Lucius procured the murders of their respective siblings, married, and conspired to remove Servius Tullius. Tullia Minor encouraged Lucius Tarquinius to secretly persuade or bribe senators, and Tarquinius went to the senate-house with a group of armed men. Then he summoned the senators and gave a speech criticising Servius: for being a slave born of a slave; for failing to be elected by the Senate and the people during an interregnum, as had been the tradition for the election of kings of Rome; for being gifted the throne by a woman; for favouring the lower classes of Rome over the wealthy; for taking the land of the upper classes for distribution to the poor; and for instituting the census, which exposed the wealthy upper classes to popular envy.

When Servius Tullius arrived at the senate-house to defend his position, Tarquinius threw him down the steps and Servius was murdered in the street by Tarquin&#x27;s men. Soon after, Tullia drove her chariot over her father&#x27;s body. For Livy, Tarquinius&#x27; impious refusal to permit his father-in-law&#x27;s burial earned him the sobriquet &quot;Superbus&quot; (“arrogant” or “proud”), and Servius&#x27; death is a &quot;tragic crime&quot; (&quot;tragicum scelus&quot;), a dark episode in Rome&#x27;s history and just cause for the abolition of the monarchy. Servius thus becomes the last of Rome&#x27;s benevolent kings; the place of this outrage – which Livy seems to suggest as a crossroads – is known thereafter as &quot;Vicus Sceleratus&quot; (street of shame, infamy or crime). His murder is parricide, the worst of all crimes. This morally justifies Tarquin&#x27;s eventual expulsion and the abolition of Rome&#x27;s aberrant, &quot;un-Roman&quot; monarchy. Livy&#x27;s Republic is partly founded on the achievements and death of Rome&#x27;s last benevolent king.

==Historical appraisals==

===Birth===
Claims of divine ancestry and divine favour were often attached to charismatic individuals who rose &quot;as if from nowhere&quot; to become dynasts, tyrants and hero-founders in the ancient Mediterranean world. Yet all these legends offer the father as divine, the mother – virgin or not – as princess of a ruling house, never as slave. The disembodied phallus and its impregnation of a virgin slave of Royal birth are unique to Servius. Livy and Dionysius ignore or reject the tales of Servius&#x27; supernatural virgin birth; though his parents came from a conquered people, both are of noble stock. His ancestry is an accident of fate, and his character and virtues are entirely Roman. He acts on behalf of the Roman people, not for personal gain; these Roman virtues are likely to find favour with the gods, and win the rewards of good fortune.

The details of Servius&#x27; servile birth, miraculous conception and links with divine Fortuna were doubtless embellished after his own time, but the core may have been propagated during his reign. His unconstitutional and seemingly reluctant accession, and his direct appeal to the Roman masses over the heads of the senate may have been interpreted as signs of tyranny. Under these circumstances, an extraordinary personal charisma must have been central to his success. When Servius expanded Rome&#x27;s influence and boundaries, and reorganised its citizenship and armies, his &quot;new Rome&quot; was still centered on the &quot;Comitium&quot;, the &quot;Casa Romuli&quot; or &quot;hut&quot; of Romulus. Servius became a second Romulus, a benefactor to his people, part human, part divine; but his slave origins remain without parallel, and make him all the more remarkable: for Cornell, this is &quot;the most important single fact about him&quot;. The story of his servile birth evidently circulated far beyond Rome; Mithridates VI of Pontus sneered that Rome had made kings of &quot;servos vernasque Tuscorum&quot; (Etruscan slaves and domestic servants).

===Etruscan Servius===

Claudius&#x27; story of Servius as an Etruscan named &quot;Macstarna&quot; (title for &quot;dictator&quot; in Etruscan) was published as an incidental scholarly comment within the &quot;Oratio Claudii Caesaris&quot; of the Lugdunum Tablet. There is some support for this Etruscan version of Servius, in wall paintings at the François Tomb in Etruscan Vulci. They were commissioned some time in the second half of the 4th century BC. One panel shows heroic Etruscans putting foreign captives to the sword. The victims include an individual named Gneve Tarchunies Rumach, interpreted as a Roman named Gnaeus Tarquinius, although known Roman history records no Tarquinius of that praenomen. The victors include Aule and Caile Vipinas – known to the Romans as the Vibenna brothers – and their ally Macstrna [Macstarna], who seems instrumental in winning the day. Claudius was certain that Macstarna was simply another name for Servius Tullius, who started his career as an Etruscan ally of the Vibenna brothers and helped them settle Rome&#x27;s Caelian Hill. Claudius&#x27; account evidently drew on sources unavailable to his fellow-historians, or rejected by them. There may have been two different, Servius-like figures, or two different traditions about the same figure. &quot;Macstarna&quot; may have been the name of a once celebrated Etruscan hero, or more speculatively, an Etruscan rendering of Roman &quot;magister&quot; (magistrate). Claudius&#x27; &quot;Etruscan Servius&quot; seems less a monarch than a freelance Roman &quot;magister&quot;, an &quot;archaic condottiere&quot; who placed himself and his own band of armed clients at Vibenna&#x27;s service, and may later have seized, rather than settled Rome&#x27;s Caelian Hill. If the Etruscan Macstarna was identical with the Roman Servius, the latter may have been less monarch than some kind of proto-Republican magistrate given permanent office, perhaps a &quot;magister populi&quot;, a war-leader, or in Republican parlance, a &quot;dictator&quot;.

===Legacy===
Servius&#x27; political reforms and those of his successor Tarquinius Superbus undermined the bases of aristocratic power and transferred them in part to commoners. Rome&#x27;s ordinary citizens became a distinct force within Roman politics, entitled to participate in government and bear arms on its behalf, despite the opposition and resentment of Rome&#x27;s patricians and senate. Tarquinius was ousted by a conspiracy of patricians, not plebeians. Once in existence, the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; could not be unmade, or its powers reduced: as Republican Rome&#x27;s highest court of appeal, it had the capacity to overturn court decisions, and the Republican senate was constitutionally obliged to seek its approval. In time, the &quot;comitia centuriata&quot; legitimized the rise to power of a plebeian nobility, and plebeian consuls.

Servius&#x27; connections to the Lar and his reform of the vici connect him directly to the founding of Compitalia, instituted to publicly and piously honour his divine parentage – assuming the Lar as his father – to extend his domestic rites into the broader community, to mark his maternal identification with the lower ranks of Roman society and to assert his regal sponsorship and guardianship of their rights. Some time before the Augustan Compitalia reforms of 7 BC, Dionysius of Halicarnassus reports Servius&#x27; fathering by a Lar and his founding of Compitalia as ancient Roman traditions. In Servius, Augustus found ready association with a popular benefactor and refounder of Rome, whose reluctance to adopt kingship distanced him from its taints. Augustus brought the Compitalia and its essentially plebeian festivals, customs and political factions under his patronage and if need be, his censorial powers. He did not, however, trace his lineage and his re-founding to Servius – who even with part-divine ancestry still had servile connections – but with Romulus, patrician founding hero, ancestor of the divine Julius Caesar, descendant of Venus and Mars. Plutarch admires the Servian reforms for their imposition of good order in government, the military and public morality, and Servius himself as the wisest, most fortunate and best of all Rome&#x27;s kings.

<text>Susan B. Anthony (born Susan Anthony; February 15, 1820 – March 13, 1906) was an American social reformer and women&#x27;s rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. Born into a Quaker family committed to social equality, she collected anti-slavery petitions at the age of 17. In 1856, she became the New York state agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society.

In 1851, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who became her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, primarily in the field of women&#x27;s rights. Together they founded the New York Women&#x27;s State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from speaking at a temperance conference because she was female. During the Civil War they founded the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League, which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery. After the war, they initiated the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans. They began publishing a women&#x27;s rights newspaper in 1868 called &quot;The Revolution&quot;. A year later, they founded the National Woman Suffrage Association as part of a split in the women&#x27;s movement. The split was formally healed in 1890 when their organization merged with the rival American Woman Suffrage Association to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association, with Anthony as its key force. Anthony and Stanton began working with Matilda Joslyn Gage in 1876 on what eventually grew into the six-volume &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;. The interests of Anthony and Stanton diverged somewhat in later years, but the two remained close friends.

In 1872, Anthony was arrested in her hometown of Rochester, New York, for voting in violation of laws that allowed only men to vote. She was convicted in a widely publicized trial. Although she refused to pay the fine, the authorities declined to take further action. In 1878, Anthony and Stanton arranged for Congress to be presented with an amendment giving women the right to vote. Introduced by Sen. Aaron A. Sargent (), it later became known colloquially as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. It was eventually ratified as the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920.

Anthony traveled extensively in support of women&#x27;s suffrage, giving as many as 75 to 100 speeches per year and working on many state campaigns. She worked internationally for women&#x27;s rights, playing a key role in creating the International Council of Women, which is still active. She also helped to bring about the World&#x27;s Congress of Representative Women at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.

When she first began campaigning for women&#x27;s rights, Anthony was harshly ridiculed and accused of trying to destroy the institution of marriage. Public perception of her changed radically during her lifetime, however. Her 80th birthday was celebrated in the White House at the invitation of President William McKinley. She became the first female citizen to be depicted on U.S. coinage when her portrait appeared on the 1979 dollar coin.

==Early life==
Susan Anthony was born on February 15, 1820, to Daniel Anthony and Lucy Read Anthony in Adams, Massachusetts, the second-oldest of seven children. She was named for her maternal grandmother Susanah, and for her father&#x27;s sister Susan. In her youth, she and her sisters responded to a &quot;great craze for middle initials&quot; by adding middle initials to their own names. Anthony adopted &quot;B.&quot; as her middle initial because her namesake Aunt Susan had married a man named Brownell. Anthony never used the name Brownell herself, and did not like it.

Her family shared a passion for social reform. Her brothers Daniel and Merritt moved to Kansas to support the anti-slavery movement there. Merritt fought with John Brown against pro-slavery forces during the Bleeding Kansas crisis. Daniel eventually owned a newspaper and became mayor of Leavenworth. Anthony&#x27;s sister Mary, with whom she shared a home in later years, became a public school principal in Rochester, and a woman&#x27;s rights activist.
Anthony&#x27;s father was an abolitionist and a temperance advocate. A Quaker, he had a difficult relationship with his traditionalist congregation, which rebuked him for marrying a non-Quaker, and then disowned him for allowing a dance school to operate in his home. He continued to attend Quaker meetings anyway and became even more radical in his beliefs.
Anthony&#x27;s mother was a Baptist and helped raise their children in a more tolerant version of her husband&#x27;s religious tradition. Their father encouraged them all, girls as well as boys, to be self-supporting, teaching them business principles and giving them responsibilities at an early age.

When Anthony was six years old, her family moved to Battenville, New York, where her father managed a large cotton mill. Previously he had operated his own small cotton factory.

When she was seventeen, Anthony was sent to a Quaker boarding school in Philadelphia, where she unhappily endured its strict and sometimes humiliating atmosphere.
She was forced to end her studies after one term because her family was financially ruined during an economic downturn known as the Panic of 1837. They were forced to sell everything they had at an auction, but they were rescued by her maternal uncle, who bought most of their belongings and restored them to the family.
To assist her family financially, Anthony left home to teach at a Quaker boarding school.

In 1845, the family moved to a farm on the outskirts of Rochester, New York, purchased partly with the inheritance of Anthony&#x27;s mother, and the family became active in the anti-slavery movement. There they associated with a group of Quaker social reformers who had left their congregation because of the restrictions it placed on reform activities, and who in 1848 formed a new organization called the Congregational Friends. The Anthony farmstead soon became the Sunday afternoon gathering place for local activists, including Frederick Douglass, a former slave and a prominent abolitionist who became Anthony&#x27;s lifelong friend.

The Anthony family began to attend services at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester, which was associated with social reform. The Rochester Women&#x27;s Rights Convention of 1848 was held at that church in 1848, inspired by the Seneca Falls Convention, the first women&#x27;s rights convention, which was held two weeks earlier in a nearby town. Anthony&#x27;s parents and her sister Mary attended the Rochester convention and signed the Declaration of Sentiments that had been first adopted by the Seneca Falls Convention.

Anthony did not take part in either of these conventions because she had moved to Canajoharie in 1846 to be headmistress of the female department of the Canajoharie Academy. Away from Quaker influences for the first time in her life, at the age of 26 she began to replace her plain clothing with more stylish dresses, and she quit using &quot;thee&quot; and other forms of speech traditionally used by Quakers. She was interested in social reform, and she was distressed at being paid much less than men with similar jobs, but she was amused at her father&#x27;s enthusiasm over the Rochester women&#x27;s rights convention. She later explained, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t ready to vote, didn&#x27;t want to vote, but I did want equal pay for equal work.&quot;

When the Canajoharie Academy closed in 1849, Anthony took over the operation of the family farm in Rochester so her father could devote more time to his insurance business. She worked at this task for a couple of years but found herself increasingly drawn to reform activity. With her parents&#x27; support, she was soon fully engaged in reform work. For the rest of her life, she lived almost entirely on fees she earned as a speaker.

==Activism==
===Early social activism===
Anthony embarked on her career of social reform with energy and determination. Schooling herself in reform issues, she found herself drawn to the more radical ideas of people like William Lloyd Garrison, George Thompson and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Soon she was wearing the controversial Bloomer dress, consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Although she felt it was more sensible than the traditional heavy dresses that dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year because it gave her opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.

====Partnership with Elizabeth Cady Stanton====

In 1851, Anthony was introduced to Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who had been one of the organizers of the Seneca Falls Convention and had introduced the controversial resolution in support of women&#x27;s suffrage. Anthony and Stanton were introduced by Amelia Bloomer, a feminist and mutual acquaintance. Anthony and Stanton soon became close friends and co-workers, forming a relationship that was pivotal for them and for the women&#x27;s movement as a whole. After the Stantons moved from Seneca Falls to New York City in 1861, a room was set aside for Anthony in every house they lived in. One of Stanton&#x27;s biographers estimated that over her lifetime, Stanton probably spent more time with Anthony than with any other adult, including her own husband.

The two women had complementary skills. Anthony excelled at organizing, while Stanton had an aptitude for intellectual matters and writing. Anthony was dissatisfied with her own writing ability and wrote relatively little for publication. When historians illustrate her thoughts with direct quotes, they usually take them from her speeches, letters, and diary entries.

Because Stanton was homebound with seven children while Anthony was unmarried and free to travel, Anthony assisted Stanton by supervising her children while Stanton wrote. One of Anthony&#x27;s biographers said, &quot;Susan became one of the family and was almost another mother to Mrs. Stanton&#x27;s children.&quot; A biography of Stanton says that during the early years of their relationship, &quot;Stanton provided the ideas, rhetoric, and strategy; Anthony delivered the speeches, circulated petitions, and rented the halls. Anthony prodded and Stanton produced.&quot;
Stanton&#x27;s husband said, &quot;Susan stirred the puddings, Elizabeth stirred up Susan, and then Susan stirs up the world!&quot;
Stanton herself said, &quot;I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them.&quot;
By 1854, Anthony and Stanton &quot;had perfected a collaboration that made the New York State movement the most sophisticated in the country&quot;, according to Ann D. Gordon, a professor of women&#x27;s history.

====Temperance activities====
Temperance was very much a women&#x27;s rights issue at that time because of laws that gave husbands complete control of the family and its finances. A woman with a drunken husband had little legal recourse even if his alcoholism left the family destitute and he was abusive to her and their children. If she obtained a divorce, which was difficult to do, he could easily end up with sole guardianship of the children.

While teaching in Canajoharie, Anthony joined the Daughters of Temperance and in 1849 gave her first public speech at one of its meetings.
In 1852, she was elected as a delegate to the state temperance convention, but the chairman stopped her when she tried to speak, saying that women delegates were there only to listen and learn. Anthony and some other women immediately walked out and announced a meeting of their own, which created a committee to organize a women&#x27;s state convention. Largely organized by Anthony, the convention of 500 women met in Rochester in April and created the Women&#x27;s State Temperance Society, with Stanton as president and Anthony as state agent.

Anthony and her co-workers collected 28,000 signatures on a petition for a law to prohibit the sale of alcohol in New York State. She organized a hearing on that law before the New York legislature, the first that had been initiated in that state by a group of women. At the organization&#x27;s convention the following year, however, conservative members attacked Stanton&#x27;s advocacy of the right of a wife of an alcoholic to obtain a divorce. Stanton was voted out as president, whereupon she and Anthony resigned from the organization.

In 1853, Anthony attended the World&#x27;s Temperance Convention in New York City, which bogged down for three chaotic days in a dispute about whether women would be allowed to speak there.
Years later, Anthony observed, &quot;No advanced step taken by women has been so bitterly contested as that of speaking in public. For nothing which they have attempted, not even to secure the suffrage, have they been so abused, condemned and antagonized.&quot; After this period, Anthony focused her energy on abolitionist and women&#x27;s rights activities.

====Teachers&#x27; conventions====
When Anthony tried to speak at the New York State Teachers&#x27; Association meeting in 1853, her attempt sparked a half-hour debate among the men about whether it was proper for women to speak in public. Finally allowed to continue, Anthony said, &quot;Do you not see that so long as society says a woman is incompetent to be a lawyer, minister, or doctor, but has ample ability to be a teacher, that every man of you who chooses this profession tacitly acknowledges that he has no more brains than a woman.&quot;
At the 1857 teacher&#x27;s convention, she introduced a resolution calling for the admission of black people to public schools and colleges, but it was rejected as &quot;not a proper subject for discussion&quot;. When she introduced another resolution calling for males and females to be educated together at all levels, including colleges, it was fiercely opposed and decisively rejected. One opponent called the idea &quot;a vast social evil... the first step in the school which seeks to abolish marriage, and behind this picture I see a monster of social deformity.&quot;

Anthony continued to speak at state teachers&#x27; conventions for several years, insisting that women teachers should receive equal pay with men and serve as officers and committee members within the organization.

====Early women&#x27;s rights activities====
Anthony&#x27;s work for the women&#x27;s rights movement began at a time when that movement was already gathering momentum. Stanton had helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention in 1848, a local event that was the first women&#x27;s rights convention. In 1850, the first in a series of National Women&#x27;s Rights Conventions was held in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1852, Anthony attended her first National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, which was held in Syracuse, New York, where she served as one of the convention&#x27;s secretaries. According to Ida Husted Harper, Anthony&#x27;s authorized biographer, &quot;Miss Anthony came away from the Syracuse convention thoroughly convinced that the right which woman needed above every other, the one indeed which would secure to her all others, was the right of suffrage.&quot; Suffrage, however, did not become the main focus of her work for several more years.

A major hindrance to the women&#x27;s movement was a lack of money. Few women at that time had an independent source of income, and even those with employment generally were required by law to turn over their pay to their husbands.
Partly through the efforts of the women&#x27;s movement, a law had been passed in New York in 1848 that recognized some rights for married women, but that law was limited. In 1853, Anthony worked with William Henry Channing, her activist Unitarian minister, to organize a convention in Rochester to launch a state campaign for improved property rights for married women, which Anthony would lead. She took her lecture and petition campaign into almost every county in New York during the winter of 1855 despite the difficulty of traveling in snowy terrain in horse and buggy days.

When she presented the petitions to the New York State Senate Judiciary Committee, its members told her that men were actually the oppressed sex because they did such things as giving women the best seats in carriages. Noting cases in which the petition had been signed by both husbands and wives (instead of the husband signing for both, which was the standard procedure), the committee&#x27;s official report sarcastically recommended that the petitioners seek a law authorizing the husbands in such marriages to wear petticoats and the wives trousers.
The campaign finally achieved success in 1860 when the legislature passed an improved Married Women&#x27;s Property Act that gave married women the right to own separate property, enter into contracts and be the joint guardian of their children. The legislature rolled back much of this law in 1862, however, during a period when the women&#x27;s movement was largely inactive because of the American Civil War.

The women&#x27;s movement was loosely structured at that time, with few state organizations and no national organization other than a coordinating committee that arranged annual conventions.
Lucy Stone, who did much of the organizational work for the national conventions, encouraged Anthony to take over some of the responsibility for them. Anthony resisted at first, feeling that she was needed more in the field of anti-slavery activities. After organizing a series of anti-slavery meetings in the winter of 1857, Anthony told a friend that, &quot;the experience of the last winter is worth more to me than all my temperance and woman&#x27;s rights work, though the latter were the school necessary to bring me into the antislavery work.&quot;
During a planning session for the 1858 women&#x27;s rights convention, Stone, who had recently given birth, told Anthony that her new family responsibilities would prevent her from organizing conventions until her children were older. Anthony presided at the 1858 convention, and when the planning committee for national conventions was reorganized, Stanton became its president and Anthony its secretary.
Anthony continued to be heavily involved in anti-slavery work at the same time.

====Anti-slavery activities====
In 1837, at age 16, Anthony collected petitions against slavery as part of organized resistance to the newly established gag rule that prohibited anti-slavery petitions in the U.S. House of Representatives.
In 1851, she played a key role in organizing an anti-slavery convention in Rochester. She was also part of the Underground Railroad. An entry in her diary in 1861 read, &quot;Fitted out a fugitive slave for Canada with the help of Harriet Tubman.&quot;
In 1856, Anthony agreed to become the New York State agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society with the understanding that she would also continue her advocacy of women&#x27;s rights.
Anthony organized anti-slavery meetings throughout the state under banners that read &quot;No compromise with slaveholders. Immediate and Unconditional Emancipation.&quot;

In 1859, John Brown was executed for leading a violent raid on the U.S. arsenal at Harper&#x27;s Ferry in what was intended to be the beginning of an armed slave uprising. Anthony organized and presided over a meeting of &quot;mourning and indignation&quot; in Rochester&#x27;s Corinthian Hall on the day of his execution to raise money for Brown&#x27;s family.

She developed a reputation for fearlessness in facing down attempts to disrupt her meetings, but opposition became overwhelming on the eve of the Civil War. Mob action shut down her meetings in every town from Buffalo to Albany in early 1861. In Rochester, the police had to escort Anthony and other speakers from the building for their own safety. In Syracuse, according to a local newspaper, &quot;Rotten eggs were thrown, benches broken, and knives and pistols gleamed in every direction.&quot;

Anthony expressed a vision of a racially integrated society that was radical for a time when abolitionists were debating the question of what was to become of the slaves after they were freed, and when people like Abraham Lincoln were calling for African Americans to be shipped to newly established colonies in Africa. In a speech in 1861, Anthony said, &quot;Let us open to the colored man all our schools ... Let us admit him into all our mechanic shops, stores, offices, and lucrative business avocations ... let him rent such pew in the church, and occupy such seat in the theatre ... Extend to him all the rights of Citizenship.&quot;

The relatively small women&#x27;s rights movement of that time was closely associated with the American Anti-Slavery Society led by William Lloyd Garrison. The women&#x27;s movement depended heavily on abolitionist resources, with its articles published in their newspapers and some of its funding provided by abolitionists. There was tension, however, between leaders of the women&#x27;s movement and male abolitionists who, although supporters of increased women&#x27;s rights, believed that a vigorous campaign for women&#x27;s rights would interfere with the campaign against slavery. In 1860, when Anthony sheltered a woman who had fled an abusive husband, Garrison insisted that the woman give up the child she had brought with her, pointing out that the law gave husbands complete control of children. Anthony reminded Garrison that he helped slaves escape to Canada in violation of the law and said, &quot;Well, the law which gives the father ownership of the children is just as wicked and I&#x27;ll break it just as quickly.&quot;

When Stanton introduced a resolution at the National Woman&#x27;s Rights Convention in 1860 favoring more lenient divorce laws, leading abolitionist Wendell Phillips not only opposed it but attempted to have it removed from the record. When Stanton, Anthony, and others supported a bill before the New York legislature that would permit divorce in cases of desertion or inhuman treatment, Horace Greeley, an abolitionist newspaper publisher, campaigned against it in the pages of his newspaper.

Garrison, Phillips and Greeley had all provided valuable help to the women&#x27;s movement. In a letter to Lucy Stone, Anthony said, &quot;The Men, even the &quot;best&quot; of them, seem to think the Women&#x27;s Rights question should be waived for the present. So let us do our own work, and in our own way.&quot;

On February 13, 1928, Representative Charles Hillyer Brand gave a &quot;brief statement of the life and activities&quot; of Anthony—partly titled &quot;militant suffragist&quot;—in which he noted that in 1861, Anthony was &quot;persuaded to give up preparations for the annual women&#x27;s rights convention to concentrate on work to win the war, though she was not misled by the sophistry that the rights of women would be recognized after the war if they helped to end it.&quot;

===Women&#x27;s Loyal National League===
Anthony and Stanton organized the Women&#x27;s Loyal National League in 1863 to campaign for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would abolish slavery.
It was the first national women&#x27;s political organization in the United States. In the largest petition drive in the nation&#x27;s history up to that time, the League collected nearly 400,000 signatures to abolish slavery, representing approximately one out of every twenty-four adults in the Northern states.
The petition drive significantly assisted the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which ended slavery. Anthony was the chief organizer of this effort, which involved recruiting and coordinating some 2000 petition collectors.

The League provided the women&#x27;s movement with a vehicle for combining the fight against slavery with the fight for women&#x27;s rights by reminding the public that petitioning was the only political tool available to women at a time when only men were allowed to vote.
With a membership of 5000, it helped develop a new generation of women leaders, providing experience and recognition for not only Stanton and Anthony but also newcomers like Anna Dickinson, a gifted teenaged orator.
The League demonstrated the value of formal structure to a women&#x27;s movement that had resisted being anything other than loosely organized up to that point.
The widespread network of women activists who assisted the League expanded the pool of talent that was available to reform movements, including the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, after the war.

===American Equal Rights Association===
Anthony stayed with her brother Daniel in Kansas for eight months in 1865 to assist with his newspaper. She headed back east after she learned that an amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been proposed that would provide citizenship for African Americans but would also for the first time introduce the word &quot;male&quot; into the constitution. Anthony supported citizenship for blacks but opposed any attempt to link it with a reduction in the status of women. Her ally Stanton agreed, saying &quot;if that word &#x27;male&#x27; be inserted, it will take us a century at least to get it out.&quot;

Anthony and Stanton worked to revive the women&#x27;s rights movement, which had become nearly dormant during the Civil War. In 1866, they organized the Eleventh National Women&#x27;s Rights Convention, the first since the Civil War began. Unanimously adopting a resolution introduced by Anthony, the convention voted to transform itself into the American Equal Rights Association (AERA), whose purpose was to campaign for the equal rights of all citizens, especially the right of suffrage. The leadership of the new organization included such prominent activists as Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone, and Frederick Douglass.

The AERA&#x27;s drive for universal suffrage was resisted by some abolitionist leaders and their allies in the Republican Party. During the period before the 1867 convention to revise the New York state constitution, Horace Greeley, a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, &quot;This is a critical period for the Republican Party and the life of our Nation... I conjure you to remember that this is &#x27;the negro&#x27;s hour,&#x27; and your first duty now is to go through the State and plead his claims.&quot; Abolitionist leaders Wendell Phillips and Theodore Tilton met with Anthony and Stanton in the office of the National Anti-Slavery Standard, a leading abolitionist newspaper. The two men tried to convince the two women that the time had not yet come for women&#x27;s suffrage, that they should campaign not for voting rights for both women and African Americans in the revised state constitution but for voting rights for black men only. According to Ida Husted Harper, Anthony&#x27;s authorized biographer, Anthony &quot;was highly indignant and declared that she would sooner cut off her right hand than ask the ballot for the black man and not for woman.&quot; Anthony and Stanton continued to work for the inclusion of suffrage for both African Americans and women.

In 1867, the AERA campaigned in Kansas for referendums that would enfranchise both African Americans and women. Wendell Phillips, who opposed mixing those two causes, blocked the funding that the AERA had expected for their campaign.
After an internal struggle, Kansas Republicans decided to support suffrage for black men only and formed an &quot;Anti Female Suffrage Committee&quot; to oppose the AERA&#x27;s efforts.
By the end of summer, the AERA campaign had almost collapsed, and its finances were exhausted. Anthony and Stanton created a storm of controversy by accepting help during the last days of the campaign from George Francis Train, a wealthy businessman who supported women&#x27;s rights. Train antagonized many activists by attacking the Republican Party and openly disparaging the integrity and intelligence of African Americans.
There is reason to believe, however, that Anthony and Stanton hoped to draw the volatile Train away from his cruder forms of racism, and that he had actually begun to do so.

After the Kansas campaign, the AERA increasingly divided into two wings, both advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches. One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Anthony and Stanton, insisted that women and black men should be enfranchised at the same time and worked toward a politically independent women&#x27;s movement that would no longer be dependent on abolitionists. The AERA effectively dissolved after an acrimonious meeting in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath.

===&quot;The Revolution&quot;===
Anthony and Stanton began publishing a weekly newspaper called &quot;The Revolution&quot; in New York City in 1868. It focused primarily on women&#x27;s rights, especially suffrage for women, but it also covered other topics, including politics, the labor movement and finance. Its motto was &quot;Men, their rights and nothing more: women, their rights and nothing less.&quot;
One of its goals was to provide a forum in which women could exchange opinions on key issues from a variety of viewpoints. Anthony managed the business aspects of the paper while Stanton was co-editor along with Parker Pillsbury, an abolitionist and a supporter of women&#x27;s rights. Initial funding was provided by George Francis Train, the controversial businessman who supported women&#x27;s rights but who alienated many activists with his political and racial views.
In the aftermath of the Civil War, major periodicals associated with the radical social reform movements had either become more conservative or had quit publishing or soon would.
Anthony intended for &quot;The Revolution&quot; to partially fill that void, hoping to grow it eventually into a daily paper with its own printing press, all owned and operated by women. The funding Train had arranged for the newspaper, however, was less than Anthony had expected. Moreover, Train sailed for England after &quot;The Revolution&quot; published its first issue and was soon jailed for supporting Irish independence.

Train&#x27;s financial support eventually disappeared entirely. After twenty-nine months, mounting debts forced Anthony to transfer the paper to Laura Curtis Bullard, a wealthy women&#x27;s rights activist who gave it a less radical tone. The paper published its last issue less than two years later.
Despite its short life, &quot;The Revolution&quot; gave Anthony and Stanton a means for expressing their views during the developing split within the women&#x27;s movement. It also helped them promote their wing of the movement, which eventually became a separate organization.

===Attempted alliance with labor===
The National Labor Union (NLU), which was formed in 1866, began reaching out to farmers, African Americans and women, with the intention of forming a broad-based political party. &quot;The Revolution&quot; responded enthusiastically, declaring, &quot;The principles of the National Labor Union are our principles.&quot; It predicted that &quot;The producers—the working-men, the women, the negroes—are destined to form a triple power that shall speedily wrest the sceptre of government from the non-producers—the land monopolists, the bond-holders, the politicians.&quot;
Anthony and Stanton were seated as delegates to the NLU Congress in 1868, with Anthony representing the Working Women&#x27;s Association (WWA), which had recently been formed in the offices of &quot;The Revolution&quot;.

The attempted alliance did not last long. During a printers&#x27; strike in 1869, Anthony voiced approval of an employer-sponsored training program that would teach women skills that would enable them in effect to replace the strikers. Anthony viewed the program as an opportunity to increase employment of women in a trade from which women were often excluded by both employers and unions. At the next NLU Congress, Anthony was first seated as a delegate but then unseated because of strong opposition from those who accused her of supporting strikebreakers.

Anthony worked with the WWA to form all-female labor unions, but with little success. She accomplished more in her work with the joint campaign by the WWA and &quot;The Revolution&quot; to win a pardon for Hester Vaughn, a domestic worker who had been found guilty of infanticide and sentenced to death. Charging that the social and legal systems treated women unfairly, the WWA petitioned, organized a mass meeting at which Anthony was one of the speakers, and sent delegations to visit Vaughn in prison and to speak with the governor. Vaughn was eventually pardoned.

Originally with a membership that included over a hundred wage-earning women, the WWA evolved into an organization consisting almost entirely of journalists, doctors and other middle-class working women. Its members formed the core of the New York City portion of the new national suffrage organization that Anthony and Stanton were in the process of forming.

===Split in the women&#x27;s movement===
In May 1869, two days after the final AERA convention, Anthony, Stanton and others formed the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA). In November 1869, Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe and others formed the competing American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA). The hostile nature of their rivalry created a partisan atmosphere that endured for decades, affecting even professional historians of the women&#x27;s movement.

The immediate cause for the split was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. In one of her most controversial actions, Anthony campaigned against the amendment. She and Stanton called for women and African Americans to be enfranchised at the same time. They said that by effectively enfranchising all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an &quot;aristocracy of sex&quot; by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women. In 1873, Anthony said, &quot;An oligarchy of wealth, where the rich govern the poor; an oligarchy of learning, where the educated govern the ignorant; or even an oligarchy of race, where the Saxon rules the African, might be endured; but surely this oligarchy of sex, which makes the men of every household sovereigns, masters; the women subjects, slaves; carrying dissension, rebellion into every home of the Nation, cannot be endured.&quot;

The AWSA supported the amendment, but Lucy Stone, who became its most prominent leader, also made it clear that she believed that suffrage for women would be more beneficial to the country than suffrage for black men.

The two organizations had other differences as well. The NWSA was politically independent, but the AWSA at least initially aimed for close ties with the Republican Party, hoping that the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment would lead to a Republican push for women&#x27;s suffrage. The NWSA focused primarily on winning suffrage at the national level while the AWSA pursued a state-by-state strategy. The NWSA initially worked on a wider range of women&#x27;s issues than the AWSA, including divorce reform and equal pay for women.

Events soon removed much of the basis for the split in the women&#x27;s movement. In 1870, debate about the Fifteenth Amendment was made irrelevant when that amendment was officially ratified. In 1872, disgust with corruption in government led to a mass defection of abolitionists and other social reformers from the Republicans to the short-lived Liberal Republican Party. As early as 1875, Anthony began urging the NWSA to focus more exclusively on women&#x27;s suffrage rather than a variety of women&#x27;s issues. The rivalry between the two women&#x27;s groups was so bitter, however, that a merger proved to be impossible for twenty years. The AWSA, which was especially strong in New England, was the larger of the two organizations, but it began to decline in strength during the 1880s.
In 1890, the two organizations merged as the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), with Stanton as president but with Anthony as its effective leader. When Stanton retired from her post in 1892, Anthony became NAWSA&#x27;s president.

===National suffrage movement===
&quot;By the end of the Civil War,&quot; according to historian Ann D. Gordon, &quot;Susan B. Anthony occupied new social and political territory. She was emerging on the national scene as a female leader, something new in American history, and she did so as a single woman in a culture that perceived the spinster as anomalous and unguarded ... By the 1880s, she was among the senior political figures in the United States.&quot;

After the formation of the NWSA, Anthony dedicated herself fully to the organization and to women&#x27;s suffrage. She did not draw a salary from either it or its successor, the NAWSA, but on the contrary used her lecture fees to fund those organizations. There was no national office, the mailing address being simply that of one of the officers.

That Anthony had remained unmarried gave her an important business advantage in this work. A married woman at that time had the legal status of &quot;feme covert&quot;, which, among other things, excluded her from signing contracts (her husband could do that for her, if he chose). As Anthony had no husband, she was a &quot;feme sole&quot; and could freely sign contracts for convention halls, printed materials, etc.
Using fees she earned by lecturing, she paid off the debts she had accumulated while supporting &quot;The Revolution&quot;. With the press treating her as a celebrity, she proved to be a major draw. Over her career she estimated that she averaged 75 to 100 speeches per year. Travel conditions in the earlier days were sometimes appalling. Once she gave a speech from the top of a billiard table. On another occasion her train was snowbound for days, and she survived on crackers and dried fish.

Both Anthony and Stanton joined the lecture circuit about 1870, usually traveling from mid-autumn to spring. The timing was right because the nation was beginning to discuss women&#x27;s suffrage as a serious matter. Occasionally they traveled together but most often not. Lecture bureaus scheduled their tours and handled the travel arrangements, which generally involved traveling during the day and speaking at night, sometimes for weeks at a time, including weekends. Their lectures brought new recruits into the movement who strengthened suffrage organizations at the local, state and national levels. Their journeys during that decade covered a distance that was unmatched by any other reformer or politician.
Anthony&#x27;s other suffrage work included organizing national conventions, lobbying Congress and state legislatures, and participating in a seemingly endless series of state suffrage campaigns.

A special opportunity arose in 1876 when the U.S. celebrated its 100th birthday as an independent country. The NWSA asked permission to present a Declaration of Rights for Women at the official ceremony in Philadelphia, but was refused. Undaunted, five women, headed by Anthony, walked onto the platform during the ceremony and handed their Declaration to the startled official in charge. As they left, they handed out copies of it to the crowd. Spotting an unoccupied bandstand outside the hall, Anthony mounted it and read the Declaration to a large crowd. Afterwards she invited everyone to a NWSA convention at the nearby Unitarian church where speakers like Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton awaited them.

The work of all segments of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement began to show clear results. Women won the right to vote in Wyoming in 1869 and in Utah in 1870. Her lectures in Washington and four other states led directly to invitations for her to address the state legislatures there.

The Grange, a large advocacy group for farmers, officially supported women&#x27;s suffrage as early as 1885. The Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, the largest women&#x27;s organization in the country, also supported suffrage.

Anthony&#x27;s commitment to the movement, her spartan lifestyle, and the fact that she did not seek personal financial gain, made her an effective fund-raiser and won her the admiration of many who did not agree with her goals. As her reputation grew, her working and travel conditions improved. She sometimes had the use of the private railroad car of Jane Stanford, a sympathizer whose husband owned a major railroad. While lobbying and preparing for the annual suffrage conventions in Washington, she was provided with a free suite of rooms in the Riggs Hotel, whose owners supported her work.

To ensure continuity, Anthony trained a group of younger activists, who were known as her &quot;nieces,&quot; to assume leadership roles within the organization. Two of them, Carrie Chapman Catt and Anna Howard Shaw, served as presidents of the NAWSA after Anthony retired from that position.

====&quot;United States v. Susan B. Anthony&quot;====

The NWSA convention of 1871 adopted a strategy of urging women to attempt to vote, and then, after being turned away, to file suits in federal courts to challenge laws that prevented women from voting. The legal basis for the challenge would be the recently adopted Fourteenth Amendment, part of which reads: &quot;No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States&quot;.

Following the example set by Anthony and her sisters shortly before election day, a total of nearly fifty women in Rochester registered to vote in the presidential election of 1872. On election day, Anthony and fourteen other women from her ward convinced the election inspectors to allow them to cast ballots, but women in other wards were turned back. Anthony was arrested on November 18, 1872, by a U.S. Deputy Marshal and charged with illegally voting. The other women who had voted were also arrested but released pending the outcome of Anthony&#x27;s trial.
Anthony&#x27;s trial generated a national controversy and became a major step in the transition of the broader women&#x27;s rights movement into the women&#x27;s suffrage movement.

Anthony spoke throughout Monroe County, New York, where her trial was to be held and from where the jurors for her trial would be chosen. Her speech was entitled &quot;Is it a Crime for a U.S. Citizen to Vote?&quot; She said, &quot;We no longer petition Legislature or Congress to give us the right to vote. We appeal to women everywhere to exercise their too long neglected &#x27;citizen&#x27;s right to vote.
The U.S. Attorney arranged for the trial to be moved to the federal circuit court, which would soon sit in neighboring Ontario County with a jury drawn from that county&#x27;s inhabitants. Anthony responded by speaking throughout that county also before the trial began.

Responsibility for that federal circuit was in the hands of Justice Ward Hunt, who had recently been appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Hunt had never served as a trial judge; originally a politician, he had begun his judicial career by being elected to the New York Court of Appeals.

The trial, &quot;United States v. Susan B. Anthony&quot;, began on June 17, 1873, and was closely followed by the national press. Following a rule of common law at that time which prevented criminal defendants in federal courts from testifying, Hunt refused to allow Anthony to speak until the verdict had been delivered. On the second day of the trial, after both sides had presented their cases, Justice Hunt delivered his lengthy opinion, which he had put in writing. In the most controversial aspect of the trial, Hunt directed the jury to deliver a guilty verdict.

On the second day of the trial, Hunt asked Anthony if she had anything to say. She responded with &quot;the most famous speech in the history of the agitation for woman suffrage&quot;, according to Ann D. Gordon, a historian of the women&#x27;s movement.
Repeatedly ignoring the judge&#x27;s order to stop talking and sit down, she protested what she called &quot;this high-handed outrage upon my citizen&#x27;s rights&quot;, saying, &quot;you have trampled under foot every vital principle of our government. My natural rights, my civil rights, my political rights, my judicial rights, are all alike ignored.&quot;
She castigated Justice Hunt for denying her a trial by jury, but said that even if he had allowed the jury to discuss the case, she still would have been denied a trial by a jury of her peers because women were not allowed to be jurors.
When Justice Hunt sentenced Anthony to pay a fine of $100 (), she responded, &quot;I shall never pay a dollar of your unjust penalty&quot;, and she never did.
If Hunt had ordered her to be jailed until she paid the fine, Anthony could have taken her case to the Supreme Court. Hunt instead announced he would not order her taken into custody, closing off that legal avenue.

The U.S. Supreme Court in 1875 put an end to the strategy of trying to achieve women&#x27;s suffrage through the court system when it ruled in &quot;Minor v. Happersett&quot; that &quot;the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone&quot;. The NWSA decided to pursue the far more difficult strategy of campaigning for a constitutional amendment to achieve voting rights for women.

On August 18, 2020—the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment—President Donald Trump announced that he would pardon Anthony, 148 years after her conviction. The president of the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House wrote to &quot;decline&quot; the offer of a pardon on the principle that, to accept a pardon would wrongly &quot;validate&quot; the trial proceedings in the same manner that paying the $100 fine would have.

====&quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;====

Anthony and Stanton initiated the project of writing a history of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement in 1876. Anthony had for years saved letters, newspaper clippings, and other materials of historical value to the women&#x27;s movement. In 1876, she moved into the Stanton household in New Jersey along with several trunks and boxes of these materials to begin working with Stanton on the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;.

Anthony hated this type of work. In her letters, she said the project &quot;makes me feel growly all the time ... No warhorse ever panted for the rush of battle more than I for outside work. I love to make history but hate to write it.&quot;
The work absorbed much of her time for several years although she continued to work on other women&#x27;s suffrage activities. She acted as her own publisher, which presented several problems, including finding space for the inventory. She was forced to limit the number of books she was storing in the attic of her sister&#x27;s house because the weight was threatening to collapse the structure.

Originally envisioned as a modest publication that could be produced quickly, the history evolved into a six-volume work of more than 5700 pages written over a period of 41 years. The first three volumes, which cover the movement up to 1885, were published between 1881 and 1886 and were produced by Stanton, Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage. Anthony handled the production details and the extensive correspondence with contributors. Anthony published Volume 4, which covers the period from 1883 to 1900, in 1902, after Stanton&#x27;s death, with the help of Ida Husted Harper, Anthony&#x27;s designated biographer. The last two volumes, which bring the history up to 1920, were completed in 1922 by Harper after Anthony&#x27;s death.

The &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; preserves an enormous amount of material that might have been lost forever. Written by leaders of one wing of the divided women&#x27;s movement (Lucy Stone, their main rival, refused to have anything to do with the project), it does not, however, give a balanced view of events where their rivals are concerned. It overstates the role of Anthony and Stanton, and it understates or ignores the roles of Stone and other activists who did not fit into the historical narrative that Anthony and Stanton developed. Because it was for years the main source of documentation about the suffrage movement, historians have had to uncover other sources to provide a more balanced view.

===International women&#x27;s organizations===

====International Council of Women====
Anthony traveled to Europe in 1883 for a nine-month stay, linking up with Stanton, who had arrived a few months earlier. Together they met with leaders of European women&#x27;s movements and began the process of creating an international women&#x27;s organization.
The National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) agreed to host its founding congress. The preparatory work was handled primarily by Anthony and two of her younger colleagues in the NWSA, Rachel Foster Avery and May Wright Sewall. Delegates from fifty-three women&#x27;s organizations in nine countries met in Washington in 1888 to form the new association, which was called the International Council of Women (ICW). The delegates represented a wide variety of organizations, including suffrage associations, professional groups, literary clubs, temperance unions, labor leagues and missionary societies. The American Woman Suffrage Association, which had for years been a rival to the NWSA, participated in the congress. Anthony opened the first session of the ICW and presided over most events.

The ICW commanded respect at the highest levels. President Cleveland and his wife sponsored a reception at the White House for delegates to the ICW&#x27;s founding congress. The ICW&#x27;s second congress was an integral part of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. At its third congress in London in 1899, a reception for the ICW was held at Windsor Castle at the invitation of Queen Victoria. At its fourth congress in Berlin in 1904, Augusta Victoria, the German Empress, received the ICW leaders at her palace. Anthony played a prominent role on all four occasions.

Still active, ICW is associated with the United Nations.

====World&#x27;s Congress of Representative Women====
The World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, also known as the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, was held in 1893. It hosted several world congresses, each dealing with a specialized topic, such as religion, medicine and science. At almost the last moment, the U.S. Congress decided that the Exposition should also recognize the role of women. After it was over, one of the organizers of the Exposition&#x27;s congress of women revealed that Anthony had played a pivotal but hidden role in that last-minute decision. Fearing that a public campaign would rouse opposition, Anthony had worked quietly to organize support for this project among women of the political elite. Anthony increased the pressure by covertly initiating a petition that was signed by wives and daughters of Supreme Court judges, senators, cabinet members and other dignitaries.

A large structure called the Woman&#x27;s Building, designed by Sophia Hayden Bennett, was constructed to provide meeting and exhibition spaces for women at the Exposition. Two of Anthony&#x27;s closest associates were appointed to organize the women&#x27;s congress. They arranged for the International Council of Women to make its upcoming meeting part of the Exposition by expanding its scope and calling itself the World&#x27;s Congress of Representative Women. This week-long congress seated delegates from 27 countries. Its 81 sessions, many held simultaneously, were attended by over 150,000 people, and women&#x27;s suffrage was discussed at almost every session. Anthony spoke to large crowds at the Exposition.

&quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody invited her as a guest to his Wild West Show, located just outside the Exposition. When the show opened, he rode his horse directly to her and greeted her with dramatic flair. According to a co-worker, Anthony, &quot;for the moment as enthusiastic as a girl, waved her handkerchief at him, while the big audience, catching the spirit of the scene, wildly applauded.&quot;

====International Woman Suffrage Alliance====
After Anthony retired as president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, Carrie Chapman Catt, her chosen successor, began working toward an international women&#x27;s suffrage association, one of Anthony&#x27;s long-time goals. The existing International Council of Women could not be expected to support a campaign for women&#x27;s suffrage because it was a broad alliance whose more conservative members would object. In 1902, Catt organized a preparatory meeting in Washington, with Anthony as chair, that was attended by delegates from several countries. Organized primarily by Catt, the International Woman Suffrage Alliance was created in Berlin in 1904. The founding meeting was chaired by Anthony, who was declared to be the new organization&#x27;s honorary president and first member.
According to Anthony&#x27;s authorized biographer, &quot;no event ever gave Miss Anthony such profound satisfaction as this one&quot;.

Later renamed the International Alliance of Women, the organization is still active and is affiliated with the United Nations.

===Changing relationship with Stanton===
Anthony and Stanton worked together in a close and productive relationship. From 1880 to 1886, they were together almost every day working on the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;.
They referred to each other as &quot;Susan&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Stanton&quot;.
Anthony deferred to Stanton in other ways also, not accepting an office in any organization that would place her above Stanton.
In practice this generally meant that Anthony, although ostensibly holding a less important office, handled most of the organization&#x27;s daily activities.
Stanton sometimes felt the weight of Anthony&#x27;s determination and drive. When Stanton arrived at an important meeting in 1888 with her speech not yet written, Anthony insisted that Stanton stay in her hotel room until she had written it, and she placed a younger colleague outside her door to make sure she did so.
At Anthony&#x27;s 70th birthday celebration, Stanton teased her by saying, &quot;Well, as all women are supposed to be under the thumb of some man, I prefer a tyrant of my own sex, so I shall not deny the patent fact of my subjection.&quot;

Their interests began to diverge somewhat as they grew older. As the drive for women&#x27;s suffrage gained momentum, Anthony began to form alliances with more conservative groups, such as the Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union, the nation&#x27;s largest women&#x27;s organization and a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage.
Such moves irritated Stanton, who said, &quot;I get more radical as I get older, while she seems to grow more conservative.&quot; In 1895 Stanton published &quot;The Woman&#x27;s Bible&quot;, which attacked the use of the Bible to relegate women to an inferior status. It became a highly controversial best-seller. The NAWSA voted to disavow any connection with it despite Anthony&#x27;s strong objection that such a move was unnecessary and hurtful.
Even so, Anthony refused to assist with the book&#x27;s preparation, telling Stanton: &quot;You say &#x27;women must be emancipated from their superstitions before enfranchisement will have any benefit,&#x27; and I say just the reverse, that women must be enfranchised before they can be emancipated from their superstitions.&quot;
Despite such friction, their relationship continued to be close. When Stanton died in 1902, Anthony wrote to a friend: &quot;Oh, this awful hush! It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years. Always I have felt I must have Mrs. Stanton&#x27;s opinion of things before I knew where I stood myself. I am all at sea...&quot;

===Later life===
Having lived for years in hotels and with friends and relatives, Anthony agreed to settle into her sister Mary Stafford Anthony&#x27;s house in Rochester in 1891, at the age of 71.
Her energy and stamina, which sometimes exhausted her co-workers, continued at a remarkable level. At age 75, she toured Yosemite National Park on the back of a mule.

She remained as leader of the NAWSA and continued to travel extensively on suffrage work. She also engaged in local projects. In 1893, she initiated the Rochester branch of the Women&#x27;s Educational and Industrial Union. In 1898, she called a meeting of 73 local women&#x27;s societies to form the Rochester Council of Women. She played a key role in raising the funds required by the University of Rochester before they would admit women students, pledging her life insurance policy to close the final funding gap.

In 1896, she spent eight months on the California suffrage campaign, speaking as many as three times per day in more than 30 localities. In 1900, she presided over her last NAWSA convention. During the six remaining years of her life, Anthony spoke at six more NAWSA conventions and four congressional hearings, completed the fourth volume of the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot;, and traveled to eighteen states and to Europe. As Anthony&#x27;s fame grew, some politicians (certainly not all of them) were happy to be publicly associated with her. Her seventieth birthday was celebrated at a national event in Washington with prominent members of the House and Senate in attendance. Her eightieth birthday was celebrated at the White House at the invitation of President William McKinley.

==Death and legacy==
Susan B. Anthony died at the age of 86 of heart failure and pneumonia in her home in Rochester, New York, on March 13, 1906. She was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester. At her birthday celebration in Washington, D.C., a few days earlier, Anthony had spoken of those who had worked with her for women&#x27;s rights: &quot;There have been others also just as true and devoted to the cause—I wish I could name every one—but with such women consecrating their lives, failure is impossible!&quot; &quot;Failure is impossible&quot; quickly became a watchword for the women&#x27;s movement.

Anthony did not live to see the achievement of women&#x27;s suffrage at the national level, but she still expressed pride in the progress the women&#x27;s movement had made. At the time of her death, women had achieved suffrage in Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Idaho, and several larger states followed soon after. Legal rights for married women had been established in most states, and most professions had at least a few women members. 36,000 women were attending colleges and universities, up from zero a few decades earlier.&quot; Two years before she died, Anthony said, &quot;The world has never witnessed a greater revolution than in the sphere of woman during this fifty years&quot;.

Part of the revolution, in Anthony&#x27;s view, was in ways of thinking. In a speech in 1889, she noted that women had always been taught that their purpose was to serve men, but &quot;Now, after 40 years of agitation, the idea is beginning to prevail that women were created for themselves, for their own happiness, and for the welfare of the world.&quot; Anthony was sure that women&#x27;s suffrage would be achieved, but she also feared that people would forget how difficult it was to achieve it, as they were already forgetting the ordeals of the recent past:

Anthony&#x27;s death was widely mourned. Clara Barton, founder of the American Red Cross, said just before Anthony&#x27;s death, &quot;A few days ago someone said to me that every woman should stand with bared head before Susan B. Anthony. &#x27;Yes,&#x27; I answered, &#x27;and every man as well.&#x27; ... For ages he has been trying to carry the burden of life&#x27;s responsibilities alone... Just now it is new and strange and men cannot comprehend what it would mean but the change is not far away.&quot;

In her history of the women&#x27;s suffrage movement, Eleanor Flexner wrote, &quot;If Lucretia Mott typified the moral force of the movement, if Lucy Stone was its most gifted orator and Mrs. Stanton its most outstanding philosopher, Susan Anthony was its incomparable organizer, who gave it force and direction for half a century.&quot;

The Nineteenth Amendment, which prohibited the denial of suffrage because of sex, was colloquially known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. After it was ratified in 1920, the National American Woman Suffrage Association, whose character and policies were strongly influenced by Anthony, was transformed into the League of Women Voters, which is still an active force in U.S. politics.

Anthony&#x27;s papers are held in library collections of Harvard University and its Radcliffe Institute, Rutgers University, the Library of Congress, and Smith College. She is the author of a 6 volume work &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; (1881).

==Views==

===Views on religion===
Anthony was raised a Quaker, but her religious heritage was mixed. On her mother&#x27;s side, her grandmother was a Baptist and her grandfather was a Universalist. Her father was a radical Quaker who chafed under the restrictions of his more conservative congregation. When the Quakers split in the late 1820s into Orthodox and Hicksites, her family sided with the Hicksites, which Anthony described as &quot;the radical side, the Unitarian&quot;.

In 1848, three years after the Anthony family moved to Rochester, a group of about 200 Quakers withdrew from the Hicksite organization in western New York, partly because they wanted to work in social reform movements without interference from that organization. Some of them, including the Anthony family, began attending services at the First Unitarian Church of Rochester. When Susan B. Anthony returned home from teaching in 1849, she joined her family in attending services there, and she remained with the Rochester Unitarians for the rest of her life. Her sense of spirituality was strongly influenced by William Henry Channing, a nationally known minister of that church who also assisted her with several of her reform projects. Anthony was listed as a member of First Unitarian in a church history written in 1881.

Anthony, proud of her Quaker roots, continued to describe herself as a Quaker, however. She maintained her membership in the local Hicksite body but did not attend its meetings. She joined the Congregational Friends, an organization that was created by Quakers in western New York after the 1848 split among Quakers there. This group soon ceased to operate as a religious body, however, and changed its name to the Friends of Human Progress, organizing annual meetings in support of social reform that welcomed everyone, including &quot;Christians, Jews, Mahammedans, and Pagans&quot;.
 Anthony served as secretary of this group in 1857.

In 1859, during a period when Rochester Unitarians were gravely impaired by factionalism, Anthony unsuccessfully attempted to start a &quot;Free church in Rochester ... where no doctrines should be preached and all should be welcome.&quot;
She used as her model the Boston church of Theodore Parker, a Unitarian minister who helped to set the direction of his denomination by rejecting the authority of the Bible and the validity of miracles. Anthony later became close friends with William Channing Gannett, who became the minister of the Unitarian Church in Rochester in 1889, and with his wife Mary, who came from a Quaker background. William had been a national leader of the successful movement within the Unitarian denomination to end the practice of binding it by a formal creed, thereby opening its membership to non-Christians and even non-theists, a goal for the denomination that resembled Anthony&#x27;s goal for her proposed Free church.

After Anthony reduced her arduous travel schedule and made her home in Rochester in 1891, she resumed regular attendance at First Unitarian and also worked with the Gannetts on local reform projects. Her sister Mary Stafford Anthony, whose home had provided a resting place for Anthony during her years of frequent travel, had long played an active role in this church.

Her first public speech, delivered at a temperance meeting as a young woman, contained frequent references to God. She soon took a more distant approach, however. While in Europe in 1883, Anthony helped a desperately poor Irish mother of six children. Noting that &quot;the evidences were that &#x27;God&#x27; was about to add a No. 7 to her flock&quot;, she later commented, &quot;What a dreadful creature their God must be to keep sending hungry mouths while he withholds the bread to fill them!&quot;

Elizabeth Cady Stanton said that Anthony was an agnostic, adding, &quot;To her, work is worship ... Her belief is not orthodox, but it is religious.&quot;
Anthony herself said, &quot;Work and worship are one with me. I can not imagine a God of the universe made happy by my getting down on my knees and calling him &#x27;great.
When Anthony&#x27;s sister Hannah was on her death bed, she asked Susan to talk about the great beyond, but, Anthony later wrote, &quot;I could not dash her faith with my doubts, nor could I pretend a faith I had not; so I was silent in the dread presence of death.&quot;

When an organization offered to sponsor a women&#x27;s rights convention on the condition that &quot;no speaker should say anything which would seem like an attack on Christianity&quot;, Anthony wrote to a friend, &quot;I wonder if they&#x27;ll be as particular to warn all other speakers not to say anything which shall sound like an attack on liberal religion. They never seem to think we have any feelings to be hurt when we have to sit under their reiteration of orthodox cant and dogma.&quot;

===Views on marriage===

As a teen, Anthony went to parties, and she had offers of marriage when she was older, but there is no record of her ever having a serious romance.
Anthony loved children, however, and helped raise the children in the Stanton household. Referring to her niece, she wrote, &quot;The dear little Lucy engrosses most of my time and thoughts. A child one loves is a constant benediction to the soul, whether or not it helps to the accomplishment of great intellectual feats.&quot;

As a young worker in the women&#x27;s rights movement, Anthony expressed frustration when some of her co-workers began to marry and have children, sharply curtailing their ability to work for the understaffed movement. When Lucy Stone abandoned her pledge to stay single, Anthony&#x27;s scolding remarks caused a temporary rupture in their friendship. Journalists repeatedly asked Anthony to explain why she never married. She answered one by saying, &quot;It always happened that the men I wanted were those I could not get, and those who wanted me I wouldn&#x27;t have.&quot; To another, she answered, &quot;I never found the man who was necessary to my happiness. I was very well as I was.&quot; To a third she said, &quot;I never felt I could give up my life of freedom to become a man&#x27;s housekeeper. When I was young, if a girl married poor, she became a housekeeper and a drudge. If she married wealth she became a pet and a doll. Just think, had I married at twenty, I would have been a drudge or a doll for fifty-nine years. Think of it!&quot;

Anthony fiercely opposed laws that gave husbands complete control over the marriage. Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, the basis for the legal systems in most states at that time, stated that, &quot;By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law: that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage&quot;.

In a speech in 1877, Anthony predicted &quot;&quot;an epoch of single women&quot;. If women will not accept marriage &quot;with subjugation&quot;, nor men proffer it &quot;without&quot;, there is, there can be, &quot;no alternative&quot;. The woman who &quot;will not be ruled&quot; must live without marriage.&quot;

===Views on abortion===

Anthony showed little interest in the topic of abortion. Ann D. Gordon, who led the Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Papers project, an undertaking to collect and document materials written by those two co-workers, said that Anthony &quot;never voiced an opinion about the sanctity of fetal life ... and she never voiced an opinion about using the power of the state to require that pregnancies be brought to term.&quot; Lynn Sherr, author of a biography of Anthony, said that Anthony never stated her views on abortion, saying, &quot;I looked desperately for some kind of evidence one way or the other as to what her position was, and it just wasn&#x27;t there.&quot;

A dispute over Anthony&#x27;s views on abortion developed after 1989 when some members of the anti-abortion movement began to portray Anthony as &quot;an outspoken critic of abortion&quot;, citing various statements they said she had made. The anti-abortion advocacy group Susan B. Anthony List named itself after her on this basis. Gordon, Sherr and others contested this portrayal, saying these statements either were not made by Anthony, were not about abortion, or had been taken out of context.

==Commemoration==
===Halls of Fame===
In 1950, Anthony was inducted into the Hall of Fame for Great Americans. A bust of her that was sculpted by Brenda Putnam was placed there in 1952.

In 1973, Anthony was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

===Artwork===

The first memorial to Anthony was established by African Americans. In 1907, a year after Anthony&#x27;s death, a stained-glass window was installed at the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church in Rochester that featured her portrait and the words &quot;Failure is Impossible&quot;, a quote from her that had become a watchword for the women&#x27;s suffrage movement. It was installed through the efforts of Hester C. Jeffrey, the president of the Susan B. Anthony Club, an organization of African American women in Rochester. Speaking at the window&#x27;s dedication, Jeffrey said, &quot;Miss Anthony had stood by the Negroes when it meant almost death to be a friend of the colored people.&quot; This church had a history of involvement in issues of social justice: in 1847, Frederick Douglass printed the first editions of &quot;The North Star&quot;, his abolitionist newspaper, in its basement.
Anthony is commemorated along with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott in the &quot;Portrait Monument&quot; sculpture by Adelaide Johnson at the United States Capitol, unveiled in 1921. Originally kept on display in the crypt of the US Capitol, the sculpture was moved to its current location and more prominently displayed in the rotunda in 1997.
In 1922, sculptor Leila Usher donated a bas-relief of Susan B. Anthony to the National Woman&#x27;s Party, which was installed at their headquarters near Washington, DC. Usher was also responsible for the creation of a similar bronze medallion donated to Bryn Mawr College in 1901.

A sculpture by Ted Aub commemorating the introduction of Anthony to Elizabeth Cady Stanton by Amelia Bloomer on May 12, 1851, was unveiled In 1999. Called &quot;When Anthony Met Stanton&quot;, it consists of life-size bronze statues of the three women near Van Cleef Lake in Seneca Falls, New York, where the introduction occurred.

In 2001, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan, one of the world&#x27;s largest, added a sculpture honoring Anthony and three other heroes of the twentieth century: Martin Luther King Jr., Albert Einstein, and Mahatma Gandhi.

An installation artwork by Judy Chicago called &quot;The Dinner Party&quot;, first exhibited in 1979, features a place setting for Anthony.

A bronze sculpture of a locked ballot box flanked by two pillars marks the place where Anthony voted in 1872 in defiance of laws that prohibited women from voting. Called the 1872 Monument, it was dedicated in August 2009, on the 89th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment. Leading away from the 1872 Monument is the Susan B. Anthony Trail, which runs beside the 1872 Café, named for the year of Anthony&#x27;s vote.

Near the Susan B. Anthony Museum and House is the &quot;Let&#x27;s Have Tea&quot; sculpture of Anthony and Frederick Douglass created by Pepsy Kettavong.

On February 15, 2020, Google celebrated Anthony&#x27;s 200th birthday with a Google Doodle.

===Landmarks===
Anthony&#x27;s home in Rochester is a National Historic Landmark called the National Susan B. Anthony Museum and House. The house of her birth in Adams, Massachusetts, and her childhood home in Battenville, New York, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2007, the new Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge replaced the old Troup–Howell Bridge as the conveyor of expressway traffic on Interstate 490 through downtown Rochester.

===Documentary projects===
The Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony Papers project was an academic undertaking to collect and document all available materials written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Anthony. The project began in 1982 and has since been ended.

In 1999, Ken Burns and others produced the television documentary &quot;Not for Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady Stanton &amp; Susan B. Anthony&quot;.

===Banknotes, coins and stamps===
The US Post Office issued its first postage stamp honoring Anthony in 1936 on the 16th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ensured women&#x27;s right to vote. A second stamp honoring Anthony was issued in April 1958.
In 1979, the United States Mint began issuing the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin, the first US coin to honor a female citizen.

The US Treasury Department announced on April 20, 2016, that an image of Anthony would appear on the back of a newly designed $10 bill along with Lucretia Mott, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Alice Paul. The original plan was for a woman to appear on the front of the $10 bill, with Anthony under consideration for that position. The final plan, however, calls for Alexander Hamilton, the first US Secretary of the Treasury, to retain his current position there. Designs for new $5, $10 and $20 bills will be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of American women winning the right to vote via the 19th Amendment.

===Names of awards and organizations===
Since 1970, the Susan B. Anthony Award is given annually by the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women to honor &quot;grassroots activists dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls in New York City.&quot;

New York Radical Feminists, founded in 1969, was organized into small cells or &quot;brigades&quot; named after notable feminists of the past. The Stanton-Anthony Brigade was led by Anne Koedt and Shulamith Firestone.

In 1971, Zsuzsanna Budapest founded the Susan B. Anthony Coven #1 – the first feminist, women-only, witches&#x27; coven.

The Susan B. Anthony List is a non-profit organization that seeks to reduce and ultimately end abortion in the U.S.

===Other===

Susan B. Anthony Day is a commemorative holiday to celebrate the birth of Anthony and women&#x27;s suffrage in the United States. The holiday is February 15—Anthony&#x27;s birthday.

In 2016, Lovely Warren, the mayor of Rochester, put a red, white and blue sign next to Anthony&#x27;s grave on the day after Hillary Clinton obtained the nomination at the Democratic National Convention. The sign stated, &quot;Dear Susan B., we thought you might like to know that for the first time in history, a woman is running for president representing a major party. 144 years ago, your illegal vote got you arrested. It took another 48 years for women to finally gain the right to vote. Thank you for paving the way.&quot; The city of Rochester put pictures of the message on Twitter and requested that residents go to Anthony&#x27;s grave to sign it.

<doc id="27956" wikidata="Q1456" url="?curid=27956" title="South Carolina">
<text>South Carolina ( ) is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders North Carolina to the north and northeast, the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, and Georgia to the west and south across the Savannah River. Along with North Carolina, it makes up the Carolinas region of the East Coast. South Carolina is the 40th-largest and 23rd-most populous U.S. state with a recorded population of 5,118,425 according to the 2020 census. In , its GDP was $213.45 billion. South Carolina is composed of 46 counties. The capital is Columbia with a population of 136,632 in 2020; while its most populous city is Charleston with a 2020 population of 150,227. The Greenville-Spartanburg-Anderson, SC Combined Statistical Area is the most populous combined metropolitan area in the state, with an estimated 2023 population of 1,590,636.

South Carolina was named in honor of King Charles I of England, who first formed the English colony, with &quot;Carolus&quot; being Latin for &quot;Charles&quot;. In 1712 the Province of South Carolina was formed. One of the original Thirteen Colonies, South Carolina became a royal colony in 1719. During the American Revolutionary War, South Carolina was the site of major activity among the American colonies, with more than 200 battles and skirmishes fought within the state. South Carolina became the eighth state to ratify the U.S. Constitution on May 23, 1788. A slave state, it was the first state to vote in favor of secession from the Union on December 20, 1860. After the Civil War ended, the state was readmitted to the Union on July 9, 1868.

During the early-to-mid 20th century, the state started to see economic progress as many textile mills and factories were built across the state. The civil rights movement of the mid-20th century helped end segregation and legal discrimination policies within the state. Economic diversification in South Carolina continued to pick up speed during and in the ensuing decades after World War II. In the early 21st century, South Carolina&#x27;s economy is based on industries such as aerospace, agribusiness, automotive manufacturing, and tourism.

Within South Carolina from east to west are three main geographic regions, the Atlantic coastal plain, the Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge Mountains in the northwestern corner of Upstate South Carolina. South Carolina has primarily a humid subtropical climate, with hot, humid summers and mild winters. Areas in the Upstate have a subtropical highland climate. Along South Carolina&#x27;s eastern coastal plain are many salt marshes and estuaries. South Carolina&#x27;s southeastern Lowcountry contains portions of the Sea Islands, a chain of barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
===Precolonial period===
There is evidence of human activities in the area dating to about 50,000 years ago. At the time Europeans arrived, marking the end Pre-Columbian era around 1600, there were many separate Native American tribes, the largest being the Cherokee and the Catawba, with a total population being up to 20,000.

Up the rivers of the eastern coastal plain lived about a dozen tribes of Siouan background. Along the Savannah River were the Apalachee, Yuchi, and the Yamasee. Further west were the Cherokee, and along the Catawba River, the Catawba. These tribes were village-dwellers, relying on agriculture as their primary food source. The Cherokee lived in wattle and daub houses made with wood and clay, roofed with wood or thatched grass.

About a dozen or more separate small tribes summered on the coast harvesting oysters and fish, and cultivating corn, peas and beans. Travelling inland as much as mostly by canoe, they wintered on the coastal plain, hunting deer and gathering nuts and fruit. The names of these tribes survive in place names like Edisto Island, Kiawah Island, and the Ashepoo River.

===Exploration===

The Spanish were the first Europeans in the area. From June 24 to July 14, 1521, they explored the land around Winyah Bay. On October 8, 1526, they founded San Miguel de Gualdape, near present-day Georgetown, South Carolina. It was the first European settlement in what is now the contiguous United States. Established with five hundred settlers, it was abandoned eight months later by one hundred and fifty survivors. In 1540, Hernando de Soto explored the region and the main town of Cofitachequi, where he captured the queen of the Maskoki (Muscogee) and the Chelaque (Cherokee) who had welcomed him.

In 1562 French Huguenots established a settlement at what is now the Charlesfort-Santa Elena archaeological site on Parris Island. Many of these settlers preferred a natural life far from civilization and the atrocities of the Wars of Religion. The garrison lacked supplies, however, and the soldiers (as in the France Antarctique) soon ran away. The French returned two years later but settled in present-day Florida rather than South Carolina.

===Colonization===

Sixty years later, in 1629, King Charles I of England established the province of Carolana, an area covering what is now South and North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee. Carolana was granted to Sir Robert Heath, who intended to allow French Huguenots to settle there; however, King Charles refused to grant permission to settle to anyone who was not a member of the Anglican Church, leading to the failure of the colony. In 1663, King Charles II created the Province of Carolina by granting the same land to eight Lords Proprietors in return for their financial and political assistance in restoring him to the throne in 1660. Anthony Ashley Cooper, one of the Lord Proprietors, planned the Grand Model for the Province of Carolina and wrote the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, which laid the basis for the future colony. His utopia was inspired by John Locke, an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential of Enlightenment thinkers and commonly known as the &quot;Father of Liberalism&quot;.

The Carolina slave trade, which included both trading and direct raids by colonists, was the largest among the British colonies in North America. Between 1670 and 1715, between 24,000 and 51,000 captive Native Americans were exported from South Carolina – more than the number of Africans imported to the colonies of the future United States during the same period. Additional enslaved Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to other U.S. colonies. The historian Alan Gallay says, &quot;the trade in Indian slaves was at the center of the English empire&#x27;s development in the American South. The trade in Indian slaves was the most important factor affecting the South in the period 1670 to 1715&quot;.

In the 1670s, English planters from Barbados established themselves near what is now Charleston. Settlers from all over Europe built rice plantations in the South Carolina Lowcountry, east of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. Plantation labor was done by African slaves who formed the majority of the population by 1720. Another cash crop was the indigo plant, a plant source of blue dye, developed by Eliza Lucas.
Meanwhile, Upstate South Carolina, west of the Fall Line, was settled by small farmers and traders, who due to resource competition fought a number of wars with confederated Native American tribes westward. Colonists overthrew the proprietors&#x27; rule, seeking more direct representation. In 1712, the former Province of Carolina split into North and South Carolina. In 1719, South Carolina was officially made a royal colony.

South Carolina prospered from the fertility of the lowcountry and the harbors, such as at Charleston. It allowed religious toleration, encouraging settlement, and trade in deerskin, lumber, and beef thrived. Rice cultivation was developed on a large scale on the back of slave labor.

By the second half of the 1700s, South Carolina was one of the richest of the Thirteen Colonies.

===The American Revolution===
On March 26, 1776, the colony adopted the Constitution of South Carolina, electing John Rutledge as the state&#x27;s first president. In February 1778, South Carolina became the first state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, the initial governing document of the United States, and in May 1788, South Carolina ratified the United States Constitution, becoming the eighth state to enter the union.

During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), about a third of combat action took place in South Carolina, more than any other state. Inhabitants of the state endured being invaded by British forces and an ongoing civil war between loyalists and partisans that devastated the backcountry. It is estimated 25,000 slaves (30% of those in South Carolina) fled, migrated or died during the war.

===Antebellum===
America&#x27;s first census in 1790 put the state&#x27;s population at nearly 250,000. By the 1800 census, the population had increased 38 per cent to nearly 340,000 of which 146,000 were slaves. At that time South Carolina had the largest population of Jews in the sixteen states of the United States, mostly based in Savannah and Charleston, the latter being the country&#x27;s fifth largest city.

In the Antebellum period (before the Civil War) the state&#x27;s economy and population grew. Cotton became an important crop after the invention of the cotton gin. While nominally democratic, from 1790 until 1865, wealthy male landowners were in control of South Carolina. For example, a man was not eligible to sit in the State House of Representatives unless he possessed an estate of 500 acres of land and 10 Negroes, or at least 150 pounds sterling.

Columbia, the new state capital was founded in the center of the state, and the State Legislature first met there in 1790. The town grew after it was connected to Charleston by the Santee Canal in 1800, one of the first canals in the United States.

As dissatisfaction of the planters ruling class with the federal government grew, in the 1820s John C. Calhoun became a leading proponent of states&#x27; rights, limited government, nullification of the U.S. Constitution, and free trade. In 1832, the Ordinance of Nullification declared federal tariff laws unconstitutional and not to be enforced in the state, leading to the Nullification Crisis. The federal Force Bill was enacted to use whatever military force necessary to enforce federal law in the state, bringing South Carolina back into line.

An 1831 House Report from the Committee on Military Affairs noted that 

In the United States presidential election of 1860, voting was sharply divided, with the South voting for the Southern Democrats and the North for Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Republican Party. Lincoln was anti-slavery, did not acknowledge the right to secession, and would not yield federal property in Southern states. Southern secessionists believed Lincoln&#x27;s election meant long-term doom for their slavery-based agrarian economy and social system.

Lincoln was elected president on November 6, 1860. The state House of Representatives three days later passed the &quot;Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President a Hostile Act&quot;, and within weeks South Carolina became the first state to secede.

===Civil War 1861–1865===
On April 12, 1861, Confederate batteries began shelling the Union Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, and the American Civil War began. In November of that year, the Union attacked Port Royal Sound and soon occupied Beaufort County and the neighboring Sea Islands. For the rest of the war, this area served as a Union base and staging point for other operations. Whites abandoned their plantations, leaving behind about ten thousand enslaved people. Several Northern charities partnered with the federal government to help these people run the cotton farms themselves under the Port Royal Experiment. Workers were paid by the pound harvested and thus became the first enslaved people freed by the Union forces to earn wages.

Although the state was not a major battleground, the war ruined the state&#x27;s economy. More than 60,000 soldiers from South Carolina served in the war, with the state losing an estimated 18,000 troops. Though no regiments of Southern Unionists were formed in South Carolina due to a smaller unionist presence, the Upstate region of the state would be a haven for Confederate Army deserters and resisters, as they used the Upstate topography and traditional community relations to resist service in the Confederate ranks. At the end of the war in early 1865, the troops of General William Tecumseh Sherman marched across the state devastating plantations and most of Columbia. South Carolina would be readmitted to the Union on July 9, 1868.

===Reconstruction 1865–1877===
In &quot;Texas vs. White&quot; (1869), the Supreme Court ruled the ordinances of secession (including that of South Carolina) were invalid, and thus those states had never left the Union. However, South Carolina did not regain representation in Congress until that date.

Until the 1868 presidential election, South Carolina&#x27;s legislature, not the voters, chose the state&#x27;s electors for the presidential election. South Carolina was the last state to choose its electors in this manner. During Reconstruction, South Carolina maintained a majority-black government, which lasted until approximately 1876 when Democrats and former Confederates committed voter fraud to regain power. On October 19, 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant suspended habeas corpus in nine South Carolina counties under the authority of the Ku Klux Klan Act. Led by Grant&#x27;s Attorney General Amos T. Akerman, hundreds of Klansmen were arrested while 2,000 Klansmen fled the state. This was done to suppress Klan violence against African-American and white voters in the South. In the mid-to-late 1870s, white Democrats used paramilitary groups such as the Red Shirts to intimidate and terrorize black voters. They regained political control of the state under conservative white &quot;Redeemers&quot; and pro-business Bourbon Democrats. In 1877, the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the Compromise of 1877 that ended Reconstruction.

===Populist and agrarian movements===

The state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the Populist and Agrarian movements of the 1890s. A Republican-Populist biracial coalition took power away from White Democrats temporarily. To prevent that from happening again, Democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 which effectively disenfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes, residency, and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls. By 1896, only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls, although they constituted a majority of the state&#x27;s population. The 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement: the 782,509 African American citizens comprised more than 58% of the state&#x27;s population, but they were essentially without any political representation in the Jim Crow society.

The 1895 constitution overturned local representative government, reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government, effectively ruled by the General Assembly, through the legislative delegations for each county. As each county had one state senator, that person had considerable power. The counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975.

Governor &quot;Pitchfork Ben&quot; Tillman, a Populist, led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites, although he controlled Democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers. During the constitutional convention in 1895, he supported another man&#x27;s proposal that the state adopt a one-drop rule, as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known African ancestry.

Some members of the convention realized prominent white families with some African ancestry could be affected by such legislation. In terms similar to a debate in Virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal (which was dropped), George Dionysius Tillman said in opposition:
If the law is made as it now stands respectable families in Aiken, Barnwell, Colleton, and Orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified. At least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge. They have sent good soldiers to the Confederate Army, and are now landowners and taxpayers. Those men served creditably, and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way. It is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded Caucasian on the floor of this convention. Every member has in him a certain mixture of... colored blood. The pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose. It would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation, of scandal, horror, feud, and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote, perhaps obsolete trace of Negro blood. The doors would be open to scandal, malice and greed; to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that A or B had Negro blood in their veins. Any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his father.

The state postponed such a one-drop law for years. Virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924, forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as white.

===20th century===

Early in the 20th century, South Carolina developed a thriving textile industry. The state also converted its main agricultural base from cotton, to more profitable crops. It would attract large military bases during World War I, through its majority Democratic congressional delegation, part of the one-party Solid South following disfranchisement of blacks.

In the late 19th century, South Carolina would implement Jim Crow laws which enforced racial segregation policies until the 1960s. During the early-to-mid part of the 20th century, millions of African Americans left South Carolina and other southern states for jobs, opportunities, and relative freedom in U.S. cities outside the former Confederate states. In total from 1910 to 1970, 6.5 million blacks left the South in the Great Migration. By 1930, South Carolina had a white majority population for the first time since 1708. South Carolina was one of several states that initially rejected the Nineteenth Amendment (1920) giving women the right to vote. The South Carolina legislature later ratified the amendment on July 1, 1969.
The struggle of the civil rights movement took place in South Carolina, as they did in other Southern states and elsewhere within the country. South Carolina would experience a much less violent movement than other Deep South states. This tranquil transition from a Jim Crow society occurred because the state&#x27;s white and black leaders were willing to accept slow change, rather than being utterly unwilling to accept change at all. Other South Carolina political figures, like Sen. Strom Thurmond, on the other hand, were among the nation&#x27;s most radical and effective opponents of social equality and integration.

During the mid-to-late 20th century, South Carolina started to see economic progress first in the textile industry and then in manufacturing. Tourism also started to form into a major industry within the state during the 20th century, especially in areas such as Myrtle Beach and Charleston.

===21st century===

As the 21st century progresses, South Carolina has attracted new business by having a 5% corporate income tax rate, no state property tax, no local income tax, no inventory tax, no sales tax on manufacturing equipment, industrial power or materials for finished products; no wholesale tax, and no unitary tax on worldwide profits.

South Carolina was one of the first states to stop paying for &quot;early elective&quot; deliveries of babies, under either Medicaid and private insurance. The term early elective is defined as a labor induction or Cesarean section between 37 and 39 weeks. The change was intended to result in healthier babies and fewer costs for the state of South Carolina.

On November 20, 2014, South Carolina became the 35th state to legalize same-sex marriages, when a federal court ordered the change.

As of 2022, South Carolina had one of the lowest percentages among all states of women in state legislature, at 17.6% (only five states had a lower percentage; the national average is 30.7%; with the highest percentage being in Nevada at 61.9%).

==Geography==
===Regions===

The state can be divided into three natural geographic areas which then can be subdivided into five distinct cultural regions. The natural environment is divided from east to west by the Atlantic coastal plain, the Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Culturally, the coastal plain is split into the Lowcountry and the Pee Dee region. While, the upper Piedmont region is referred to as the Piedmont and the lower Piedmont region is referred to as the Midlands. The area surrounding the Blue Ridge Mountains is known as the Upstate. The Atlantic Coastal Plain makes up two-thirds of the state. Its eastern border is the Sea Islands, a chain of tidal and barrier islands. The border between the lowcountry and the upcountry is defined by the Atlantic Seaboard fall line, which marks the limit of navigable rivers.

Altogether, the state has a total area of , of which is land and (6.12%) is water.

===Atlantic Coastal Plain===

The Atlantic Coastal plain consists of sediments and sedimentary rocks that range in age from Cretaceous to Present. The terrain is relatively flat and the soil is composed predominantly of sand, silt, and clay. Areas with better drainage make excellent farmland, though some land is swampy. An unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of low-relief topographic depressions named Carolina bays. The bays tend to be oval, lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation. The eastern portion of the coastal plain contains many salt marshes and estuaries, as well as natural ports such as Georgetown and Charleston. The natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion.

The Sandhills or Carolina Sandhills is a wide region within the Atlantic Coastal Plain province, along the margin of this province. The Carolina Sandhills are interpreted as eolian (wind-blown) sand sheets and dunes that were mobilized episodically from approximately 75,000 to 6,000 years ago. Most of the published luminescence ages from the sand are coincident with the last glaciation, a time when the southeastern United States was characterized by colder air temperatures and stronger winds.

===Piedmont===
Much of Piedmont consists of Paleozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks, and the landscape has relatively low relief. Due to the changing economics of farming, much of the land is now reforested in loblolly pine for the lumber industry. These forests are part of the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. At the southeastern edge of Piedmont is the fall line, where rivers drop to the coastal plain. The fall line was an important early source of water power. Mills built to this resource encouraged the growth of several cities, including the capital, Columbia. The larger rivers are navigable up to the fall line, providing a trade route for mill towns.

The northwestern part of Piedmont is also known as the Foothills. The Cherokee Parkway is a scenic driving route through this area. This is where Table Rock State Park is located.

===Blue Ridge===

The Blue Ridge consists primarily of Precambrian metamorphic rocks, and the landscape has relatively high relief. The Blue Ridge Region contains an escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains that continues into North Carolina and Georgia as part of the southern Appalachian Mountains. Sassafras Mountain, South Carolina&#x27;s highest point at , is in this area. Also in this area is Caesars Head State Park. The environment here is that of the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests ecoregion. The Chattooga River, on the border between South Carolina and Georgia, is a favorite whitewater rafting destination.

===Lakes===
South Carolina has several major lakes covering over . All major lakes in South Carolina are human-made. The following are the lakes listed by size.
* Lake Marion 
* Lake Strom Thurmond (also known as Clarks Hill Lake) 
* Lake Moultrie 
* Lake Hartwell 
* Lake Murray 
* Russell Lake 
* Lake Keowee 
* Lake Wylie 
* Lake Wateree 
* Lake Greenwood 
* Lake Jocassee 
* Lake Bowen 

===Earthquakes===

South Carolina is the most seismically active state on the East Coast. Between July 1, 2021, and July 1, 2022, there were 74 recorded earthquakes in South Carolina, six of which exceeded a 3 magnitude. In 2021 and 2022, most of which were concentrated in Kershaw County and the coastal area of Charleston. The Charleston area demonstrates the greatest frequency of earthquakes in South Carolina. South Carolina averages 10–15 earthquakes a year below magnitude3 (FEMA). The Charleston earthquake of 1886 was the largest quake ever to hit the eastern United States. The 7.0–7.3 magnitude earthquake killed 60 people and destroyed much of the city. Faults in this region are difficult to study at the surface due to thick sedimentation on top of them. Many of the ancient faults are within plates rather than along plate boundaries.

===Climate===
South Carolina has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), although high-elevation areas in the Upstate area have fewer subtropical characteristics than areas on the Atlantic coastline. In the summer, South Carolina is hot and humid, with daytime temperatures averaging between in most of the state and overnight lows averaging on the coast and from inland. Winter temperatures are much less uniform in South Carolina. Coastal areas of the state have very mild winters, with high temperatures approaching an average of and overnight lows around 40 °F (5–8 °C). Inland, the average January overnight low is around in Columbia and temperatures well below freezing in the Upstate. While precipitation is abundant the entire year in almost the entire state, the coast tends to have a slightly wetter summer, while inland, the spring and autumn transitions tend to be the wettest periods and winter the driest season, with November being the driest month. The highest recorded temperature is in Johnston and Columbia on June 29, 2012, and the lowest recorded temperature is at Caesars Head on January 21, 1985.

Snowfall in South Carolina is minimal in the lower elevation areas south and east of Columbia. It is not uncommon for areas along the southernmost coast to not receive measurable snowfall for several years. In the Piedmont and Foothills, especially along and north of Interstate 85, measurable snowfall occurs one to three times in most years. Annual average total amounts range from 2 to 6 inches. The Blue Ridge Escarpment receives the most average total measurable snowfall; amounts range from 7 to 12 inches.

South Carolina averages around 50 days of thunderstorm activity a year. This is less than some of the states further south, and it is slightly less vulnerable to tornadoes than the states which border on the Gulf of Mexico. Some notable tornadoes have struck South Carolina, and the state averages around 14 tornadoes annually. Hail is common with many of the thunderstorms in the state, as there is often a marked contrast in temperature of warmer ground conditions compared to the cold air aloft.

====Hurricanes and tropical cyclones====
The state is occasionally affected by tropical cyclones. This is an annual concern during hurricane season, which lasts from June1 to November 30. The peak time of vulnerability for the southeast Atlantic coast is from early August to early October, during the Cape Verde hurricane season. Memorable hurricanes to hit South Carolina include Hazel (1954), Hugo (1989), and Florence (2018).

==== Climate change ====
South Carolina released its Climate, Energy, and Commerce Committee Final Report in 2008. The report recommends a voluntary economy-wide goal of reducing emissions to 5% below 1990 levels by 2020. Key policy recommendations in the report include developing renewable portfolio standards, increasing use of local agricultural products, and increasing advanced recycling and composting.

===Flora and fauna===
South Carolina is home to two dominant ecosystems, the bottomlands, which consist of floodplains and creeks, and the toplands. The floodplains contain large tracts of old and mature second growth cypress and tupelo forest. The uplands are home to longleaf pine, shortleaf pine, and mixed hardwood forests. The Longleaf Pine are an important part of South Carolina&#x27;s coastal ecosystem. They improve soil, water, and air quality while providing a habitat for deer and songbirds. These forests are endangered by logging for agriculture and development.

Oysters are a critical part of South Carolina&#x27;s coastal ecology. They serve a dual function, filtering the water and forming reefs that provide a habitat for small fish and crabs. Oysters are imperiled by overharvesting because young oysters need older oysters to latch on to as they age. South Carolina is home to many shorebirds including various sandpipers and ibises. The state serves as a stopover site for birds migrating farther south and a wintering ground for birds that do not fly as far south.

College teams represent their particular South Carolina institutions, and are the primary options for football, basketball and baseball attendance in the state. South Carolina is also a top destination for golf and water sports.

South Carolina is also home to one of NASCAR&#x27;s first tracks and its first paved speedway, Darlington Raceway, located northwest of Florence.

<doc id="27964" wikidata="Q9316" url="?curid=27964" title="Sikhism">
<text>Sikhism ( ) also known as Sikhi, is an Indian religion and philosophy that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent around the end of the 15th century CE. It is one of the most recently founded major religions and among the largest in the world with about 25–30million adherents, known as Sikhs.

Sikhism developed from the spiritual teachings of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the faith&#x27;s first guru, and the nine Sikh gurus who succeeded him. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh (1666–1708), named the Guru Granth Sahib, which is the central religious scripture in Sikhism, as his successor. This brought the line of human gurus to a close. Sikhs regard the Guru Granth Sahib as the 11th and eternally living guru.

The core beliefs and practices of Sikhism, articulated in the Guru Granth Sahib and other Sikh scriptures, include faith and meditation in the name of the one creator (&quot;Ik Onkar&quot;), the divine unity and equality of all humankind, engaging in selfless service to others (&quot;sevā&quot;), striving for justice for the benefit and prosperity of all (&quot;sarbat da bhala&quot;), and honest conduct and livelihood. Following this standard, Sikhism rejects claims that any particular religious tradition has a monopoly on absolute truth. As a consequence, Sikhs do not actively proselytize, although voluntary converts are generally accepted. Sikhism emphasizes meditation and remembrance as a means to feel God&#x27;s presence (&quot;simran&quot;), which can be expressed musically through &quot;kirtan&quot; or internally through &quot;naam japna&quot; (). Baptised Sikhs are obliged to wear the five Ks, which are five articles of faith which physically distinguish Sikhs from non-Sikhs. Among these include the &quot;kesh&quot; (uncut hair). Most religious Sikh men thus do not cut their hair but rather wear a turban.


The religion developed and evolved in times of religious persecution, gaining converts from both Hinduism and Islam. The Mughal emperors of India tortured and executed two of the Sikh gurus—Guru Arjan (1563–1605) and Guru Tegh Bahadur (1621–1675)—after they refused to convert to Islam. The persecution of the Sikhs triggered the founding of the &quot;Khalsa&quot; by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699 as an order to protect the freedom of conscience and religion, with members expressing the qualities of a &quot;sant-sipāhī&quot; (&quot;saint-soldier&quot;).

==Terminology==
The majority of Sikh scriptures were originally written in the alphabet of &quot;Gurmukhī&quot;, a script standardised by Guru Angad out of Laṇḍā scripts historically used in present-day Pakistan and North India. Adherents of Sikhism are known as &quot;Sikhs&quot;, meaning &quot;students&quot; or &quot;disciples&quot; of the guru. The English word &quot;Sikhism&quot; derives from the Punjabi word for the religion &quot;Sikhi&quot; ( &#x27;, , from ), which connotes the &quot;temporal path of learning&quot; and is rooted in the verb ().

Some Sikhs oppose the exonym term &quot;Sikhism&quot; as they claim the word was coined by the British colonists rather than by Sikhs themselves, and they instead prefer the endonym &quot;Sikhi&quot;. They argue that an &quot;-ism&quot; connotes a fixed and immutable worldview which is not congruent with the internally fluid nature of the Sikh philosophy.

==Philosophy and teachings==
The basis of Sikhism lies in the teachings of Guru Nanak and his successors. Sikhs emphasize the congruence between spiritual development and everyday moral conduct. Its founder, Guru Nanak, summarized this perspective by saying, &quot;Truth is the highest virtue, but higher still is truthful living.&quot; Sikhism lays emphasis on &quot;Ėk nūr te sab jag upjiā&quot;, &#x27;From the one light, the entire universe welled up.&#x27; Guru Nanak also emphasized his teachings to his disciples by giving them real-life examples.

===God===

Sikhism is a monotheistic and panentheistic religion. Sikhs believe that there exists only one God and that God is simultaneously within everything and is all-encompassing. The oneness of God is reflected by the phrase &quot;Ik Onkar&quot;. In Sikhism, the word for God is &quot;Waheguru&quot; (). The &quot;Waheguru&quot; is considered to be &quot;Nirankar&quot; (&quot;shapeless&quot;), &quot;Akal&quot; (&quot;timeless&quot;), &quot;Karta Purakh&quot; (&quot;the creator being&quot;), &quot;Akaal Purkh&quot; (&quot;beyond time and death&quot;) and &quot;Agam Agochar&quot; (&quot;incomprehensible and invisible&quot;).

In a literal sense, God has no gender in Sikhism, but, metaphorically, God is presented as masculine and God&#x27;s power as feminine. For example, Guru Gobind Singh refers to God as his father and God&#x27;s creative power as his mother. Similarly, another example is that the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;, the primary Sikh scripture, says that all humans are soul-brides who long to unite with their husband Lord. In addition, the gurus also wrote in the Guru Granth Sahib that there are many worlds on which the transcendental God has created life.

The Sikh scripture begins with God as &quot;Ik Onkar&quot; (), the &#x27;One Creator&#x27;, understood in the Sikh tradition as monotheistic unity of God. &quot;Ik onkar&quot; (sometimes capitalized) is more loosely rendered &#x27;the one supreme reality&#x27;, &#x27;the one creator&#x27;, &#x27;the all-pervading spirit&#x27;, and other ways of expressing a diffused but unified and singular sense of God and creation.

The traditional &quot;Mul Mantar&quot; goes from &quot;ik onkar&quot; until &quot;Nanak hosee bhee sach.&quot; The opening line of the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; and each subsequent &quot;raga&quot;, mentions &quot;ik onkar&quot;:

===Worldly Illusion===

&quot;Māyā&quot;, defined as a temporary illusion or &quot;unreality&quot;, is one of the core deviations from the pursuit of God and salvation: where worldly attractions give only illusory temporary satisfaction and pain that distracts from the process of the devotion of God. However, Nanak emphasized māyā as not a reference to the unreality of the world, but of its values. In Sikhism, the influences of ego, anger, greed, attachment, and lust, known as the &quot;pānj chor&quot; (&#x27;Five Thieves&#x27;), are believed to be particularly distracting and hurtful. Sikhs believe the world is currently in a state of &quot;Kali Yuga&quot; (&#x27;age of darkness&#x27;) because the world is led astray by the love of and attachment to &quot;māyā&quot;. The fate of people vulnerable to the five thieves is separation from God, and the situation may be remedied only after intensive and relentless devotion.

===Timeless Truth===
According to Guru Nanak, the supreme purpose of human life is to reconnect with &quot;Akal&quot; (&#x27;The Timeless One&#x27;). However, egotism is the biggest barrier in making this connection. Using the Guru&#x27;s teaching remembrance of &quot;nām&quot; (the divine Name of the Lord) leads to the end of egotism. Guru Nanak designated the word &quot;Guru&quot; (&#x27;teacher&#x27;) to mean the voice of &quot;the spirit&quot;: the source of knowledge and the guide to salvation. As &quot;ik onkar&quot; is universally immanent, &quot;Guru&quot; is indistinguishable from &quot;Akal&quot; and are one and the same.

===Liberation===
Guru Nanak&#x27;s teachings are founded not on a final destination of heaven or hell, but on a spiritual union with the &quot;Akal&quot;, which results in salvation or &quot;jivanmukti&quot; (&#x27;enlightenment/liberation within one&#x27;s lifetime&#x27;), a concept also found in Hinduism. Guru Gobind Singh makes it clear that human birth is obtained with great fortune, and therefore one needs to be able to make the most of this life.

Sikhs accept reincarnation and karma concepts found in Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism, but do not necessarily infer a metaphysical soteriology such as a state of &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;nirvana.&quot; Nevertheless, in Sikhism, both karma and liberation are &quot;modified by the concept of God&#x27;s grace&quot; (&quot;nadar, mehar, kirpa, karam&quot;, etc.). Guru Nanak states that &quot;the body takes birth because of karma, but salvation is attained through grace.&quot; To get closer to God, Sikhs: avoid the evils of &quot;maya&quot;; keep the everlasting truth in mind; practice &quot;shabad kirtan&quot; (musical recitation of hymns); meditate on &quot;naam&quot;; and serve humanity. Sikhs believe that being in the company of the &quot;satsang&quot; (association with &quot;sat&quot;, &#x27;true&#x27;, people) or &quot;sadh sangat&quot; is one of the key ways to achieve liberation from the cycles of reincarnation. The Sikh community may be seen to correspond to A.D. Smith&#x27;s definition of a politicized community, sharing common ancestry myths and historical memories of martyrdom and persecution under successive rulers.

===Power and Devotion (Miri and Piri)===

Miri Piri is a doctrine that has been practiced in Sikh religion since the seventeenth century. The doctrine of the &quot;Mir&quot; (social and political aspects of life) and the &quot;Pir&quot; (guides to spiritual aspect of life) was revealed by the first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, but propounded by the sixth guru of Sikhism, Guru Hargobind, on 12 June 1606. After the martyrdom of his father, Guru Hargobind was elevated to the Guruship and fulfilled the prophecy that was given by the primal figure of Sikh, Baba Buddha, that the guru will possess spiritual and temporal power. Guru Hargobind introduced the two swords of Miri and Piri symbolizing both worldly (social and political) and spiritual authority. The two kirpan of Miri and Piri are tied together with a khanda in center, so the combination of both is considered supreme. This means that all action informed or arising out of the spiritual heart completes one&#x27;s purpose and meaning in the world of action: spirituality.

Guru Nanak, the first Sikh guru and the founder of Sikhism, was a Bhakti saint. He taught that the most important form of worship is &quot;Bhakti&quot; (devotion to Waheguru). Guru Arjan, in the &quot;Sukhmani Sahib&quot;, recommended the true religion as one of loving devotion to God. The &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; includes suggestions on how a Sikh should perform constant Bhakti. Some scholars call Sikhism a Bhakti sect of Indian traditions, adding that it emphasises &quot;nirguni Bhakti&quot;, i.e. loving devotion to a divine without qualities or physical form. While Western scholarship generally places Sikhism as arising primarily within a Hindu Bhakti movement milieu while recognizing some Sufi Islamic influences, some Indian Sikh scholars disagree and state that Sikhism transcended the environment it emerged from. The basis of the latter analysis is that Bhakti traditions did not clearly disassociate from Vedic texts and their cosmologies and metaphysical worldview, while the Sikh tradition clearly did disassociate from the Vedic tradition.

Several Sikh sects outside the Punjab region of India, such as those found in Maharashtra and Bihar, practice &quot;aarti&quot; (the ceremonial use of lamps) during Bhakti observances in a Sikh gurdwara. However, most Sikh gurdwaras forbid &quot;aarti&quot; during their Bhakti practices. While emphasizing Bhakti, the Sikh gurus also taught that the spiritual life and secular householder life are intertwined, and not separate. This logically follows from the panentheistic nature of Sikh philosophy. In Sikh worldview, the everyday world is part of the Infinite Reality, increased spiritual awareness leads to increased and vibrant participation in the everyday world. Guru Nanak described living an &quot;active, creative, and practical life&quot; of &quot;truthfulness, fidelity, self-control and purity&quot; as being higher than the metaphysical truth.

The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, after Guru Arjan&#x27;s martyrdom, faced with oppression by the Islamic Mughal Empire, affirmed the philosophy that the political/temporal (&quot;Miri&quot;) and spiritual (&quot;Piri&quot;) realms are mutually coexistent. According to the ninth Sikh guru, Tegh Bahadur, the ideal Sikh should have both &quot;Shakti&quot; (power that resides in the temporal), and &quot;Bhakti&quot; (spiritual meditative qualities). This was developed into the concept of the &quot;saint soldier&quot; by the tenth Sikh guru, Gobind Singh.

The concept of humanity as elaborated by Guru Nanak refines and negates the &quot;monotheistic concept of self/God&quot;, declaring that &quot;monotheism becomes almost redundant in the movement and crossings of love&quot;. Sikh gurus have taught that the human&#x27;s goal is to end all dualities of &quot;self and other, I and not-I&quot;, attain the &quot;attendant balance of separation-fusion, self-other, action-inaction, attachment-detachment, in the course of daily life&quot;.

===Singing and Music===
Sikhs refer to the hymns of the gurus as &quot;Gurbani&quot; (). Shabad Kirtan is the singing of Gurbani. The entire verses of Guru Granth Sahib are written in a form of poetry and rhyme to be recited in thirty-one Ragas of the Classical Indian Music as specified. However, the exponents of these are rarely to be found amongst the Sikhs who are conversant with all the Ragas in the Guru Granth Sahib. Guru Nanak started the Shabad Kirtan tradition and taught that listening to kirtan is a powerful way to achieve tranquility while meditating, and singing of the glories of the Supreme Timeless One (God) with devotion is the most effective way to come in communion with the Supreme Timeless One. The three morning prayers for Sikhs consist of Japji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, and Tav-Prasad Savaiye. Baptised Sikhs (Amritdharis) rise early and meditate, then recite all the Five Banis of Nitnem, before breakfast. Five Banis consists of Jap Ji Sahib, Jaap Sahib, Tav-Prasad Savaiye, Chaupai Sahib, Anand Sahib and recitation of the banis paath is followed by Ardās in which Sarbat da Bhala principle is taught by gurus which literally means blessings for everyone, blessings to humankind in good faith without discrimination.

===Remembrance of the Divine Name===
A key practice by Sikhs is remembrance of the &quot;Naam&quot; (divine name) Waheguru. This contemplation is done through &quot;Nām Japna&quot; (repetition of the divine name) or &quot;Naam Simran&quot; (remembrance of the divine Name through recitation). The verbal repetition of the name of God or a sacred syllable has been an ancient established practice in religious traditions in India, however, Sikhism developed &quot;Naam-simran&quot; as an important Bhakti practice. Guru Nanak&#x27;s ideal is the total exposure of one&#x27;s being to the divine Name and a total conforming to Dharma or the &quot;Divine Order&quot;. Nanak described the result of the disciplined application of &quot;nām simraṇ&quot; as a &quot;growing towards and into God&quot; through a gradual process of five stages. The last of these is &quot;Sach Khaṇḍ&quot; (&quot;The Realm of Truth&quot;) the final union of the spirit with God.

===Service and Action===

The Sikh gurus taught that by constantly remembering the divine name (&quot;naam simran&quot;) and through selfless service (&quot;sēvā&quot;) the devotee overcomes egotism (&quot;Haumai&quot;). This, it states, is the primary root of five evil impulses and the cycle of birth and death.

Service in Sikhism takes three forms: &quot;Tan&quot; (physical service, i.e. labor), &quot;Man&quot; (mental service, such as dedicating your heart for service of others), and &quot;Dhan&quot; (material service, including financial support). Sikhism stresses &quot;kirat karō&quot;, that is, &quot;honest work&quot;. Sikh teachings also stress the concept of sharing, or &quot;vaṇḍ chakkō&quot;, giving to the needy for the benefit of the community.

===Justice and Equality===
Sikhism regards God as the true emperor, the king of all kings, the one who dispenses justice through the law of &quot;karma&quot;, a retributive model and divine grace.

The term for justice in the Sikh tradition is Niāyā. It is related to the term &quot;dharam&quot;, which in Sikhism connotes &#x27;moral order&#x27; and righteousness (derived, but distinct from the etymologically related Hindu concept of dharma). According to the tenth Sikh guru, Guru Gobind Singh, states Pashaura Singh (a professor of Sikh studies), &quot;one must first try all the peaceful means of negotiation in the pursuit of justice&quot; and if these fail then it is legitimate to &quot;draw the sword in defense of righteousness&quot;. Sikhism considers &quot;an attack on dharam is an attack on justice, on righteousness, and on the moral order generally&quot; and the dharam &quot;must be defended at all costs&quot;. The divine name is its antidote for pain and vices. Forgiveness is taught as a virtue in Sikhism, yet it also teaches its faithful to shun those with evil intentions and to pick up the sword to fight injustice and religious persecution.

Sikhism does not differentiate religious obligations by sex. God in Sikhism has no sex, and the Sikh scripture does not discriminate against women, nor bar them from any roles. Women in Sikhism have been in positions of leadership, including leading in wars and issuing orders or hukamnamas.

===Ten Gurus and Authority===
The term &quot;guru&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;gurū&quot;, meaning teacher, enlightener, guide, or mentor. The traditions and philosophy of Sikhism were established by ten gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous, resulting in the creation of the Sikh religion. Guru Nanak was the first guru and appointed a disciple as successor. Guru Gobind Singh was the final guru in human form. Before his death, Guru Gobind Singh decreed in 1708, that the Gurū Granth Sāhib would be the final and perpetual guru of the Sikhs.

Guru Nanak stated that his guru is God who is the same from the beginning of time to the end of time. Nanak said to be a God&#x27;s slave and servant, but maintained that he was only a guide and teacher. Nanak stated that the human guru is mortal, who is to be respected and loved but not worshipped. When &quot;guru&quot;, or satguru () is used in &quot;Gurbani&quot; it is often referring to the highest expression of truthfulness.

Guru Angad succeeded Guru Nanak. Later, an important phase in the development of Sikhism came with the third successor, Guru Amar Das. Guru Nanak&#x27;s teachings emphasised the pursuit of salvation; Guru Amar Das began building a cohesive community of followers with initiatives such as sanctioning distinctive ceremonies for birth, marriage, and death. Amar Das also established the &quot;manji&quot; (comparable to a diocese) system of clerical supervision.

The Sikh gurus established a mechanism which allowed the Sikh religion to react as a community to changing circumstances. The sixth guru, Guru Hargobind, was responsible for the creation of the concept of Akal Takht (&quot;throne of the timeless one&quot;), which serves as the supreme decision-making centre of Sikhism and sits opposite the Harmandir Sahib. The Akal Takht is located in the city of Amritsar. The leader is appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Pabandhak Committee (SPGC). The &quot;Sarbat Ḵẖālsā&quot; (a representative portion of the Khalsa Panth) historically gathers at the Akal Takht on special festivals such as Vaisakhi or Hola Mohalla and when there is a need to discuss matters that affect the entire Sikh nation. A &quot;gurmatā&quot; (literally, &#x27;guru&#x27;s intention&#x27;) is an order passed by the Sarbat Ḵẖālsā in the presence of the Gurū Granth Sāhib. A &quot;gurmatā&quot; may only be passed on a subject that affects the fundamental principles of Sikh religion; it is binding upon all Sikhs.

The word &quot;guru&quot; in Sikhism also refers to &quot;Akal Purkh&quot; (God), and God and &quot;guru&quot; can sometimes be synonymous in &quot;Gurbani&quot; (Sikh writings).

==Scripture==
There is one primary scripture for the Sikhs: the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;. It is sometimes synonymously referred to as the &quot;Ādi Granth&quot;. Chronologically, however, the &quot;Ādi Granth&quot; – literally, &#x27;First Volume&#x27; – refers to the version of the scripture created by Guru Arjan in 1604. The Guru Granth Sahib is the final expanded version of the scripture compiled by Guru Gobind Singh. While the Guru Granth Sahib is an unquestioned scripture in Sikhism, another important religious text, the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot;, does not enjoy universal consensus, but is considered a secondary scripture by many Sikhs.

===Ādi Granth===

The &quot;Ādi Granth&quot; was compiled primarily by Bhai Gurdas under the supervision of Guru Arjan between the years 1603 and 1604. It is written in the Gurmukhī script, which is a descendant of the Laṇḍā script used in the Punjab at that time. The Gurmukhī script was standardised by Guru Angad, the second guru of the Sikhs, for use in the Sikh scriptures and is thought to have been influenced by the Śāradā and Devanāgarī scripts. An authoritative scripture was created to protect the integrity of hymns and teachings of the Sikh gurus, and thirteen Hindu and two Muslim bhagats of the Bhakti movement sant tradition in medieval India. The thirteen Hindu &quot;bhagats&quot; whose teachings were entered into the text included Ramananda, Namdev, Pipa, Ravidas, Beni, Bhikhan, Dhanna, Jaidev, Parmanand, Sadhana, Sain, Sur, Trilochan, while the two Muslim &quot;bhagats&quot; were Kabir and Sufi saint Farid. However, the bhagats in context often spoke of transcending their religious labels, Kabir often attributed to being a Muslim states in the &quot;Ādi Granth&quot;, &quot;I am not Hindu nor Muslim.&quot; The gurus following on this message taught that different methods of devotion are for the same infinite God.

===Guru Granth Sahib===

The Guru Granth Sahib is the holy scripture of the Sikhs and is regarded as the living guru.

====Compilation====
The Guru Granth Sahib started as a volume of Guru Nanak&#x27;s poetic compositions. Prior to his death, he passed on his volume to the subsequent guru, Guru Angad. The final version of the Guru Granth Sahib was compiled by Guru Gobind Singh in 1678. It consists of the original Ādi Granth with the addition of Guru Tegh Bahadur&#x27;s hymns. The predominant bulk of Guru Granth Sahib consists of compositions by seven Sikh gurus: Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Das, Guru Ram Das, Guru Arjan, Guru Teg Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh. It also contains the traditions and teachings of thirteen Hindu Bhakti movement &quot;sants&quot; (saints) such as Ramananda, Namdev among others, and two Muslim saints namely Kabir and the Sufi Sheikh Farid.

The text comprises 6,000 &quot;śabads&quot; (line compositions), which are poetically rendered and set to rhythmic ancient north Indian classical music. The bulk of the scripture is classified into sixty &quot;rāgas&quot;, with each Granth rāga subdivided according to length and author. The hymns in the scripture are arranged primarily by the &quot;rāgas&quot; in which they are read.

====Language and script====

The main language used in the scripture is known as &quot;Sant Bhāṣā&quot;, a language related to both Punjabi and Hindi and used extensively across medieval northern India by proponents of popular devotional religion (bhakti). The text is printed in Gurumukhi script, believed to have been developed by Guru Angad. The language shares the Indo-European roots found in numerous regional languages of India.

====Teachings====
The vision in the Guru Granth Sahib, states Torkel Brekke, is a society based on divine justice without oppression of any kind.

:One God exists, truth by name, creative power, without fear, without enmity, timeless form, unborn, self-existent, by the guru&#x27;s grace.

====As guru====
The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh ji, named the Sikh scripture Guru Granth Sahib as his successor, terminating the line of human gurus and making the scripture the literal embodiment of the eternal, impersonal guru, serving as the spiritual guide for Sikhs.

The Guru Granth Sahib is installed in Sikh &quot;Gurdwara&quot; (temple); many Sikhs bow or prostrate before it on entering the temple. The Guru Granth Sahib is installed every morning and put to bed at night in many &quot;Gurdwaras&quot;. The Granth is revered as eternal &quot;gurbānī&quot; and the spiritual authority.

The copies of the Guru Granth Sahib are not regarded as material objects, but as living subjects which are alive. According to Myrvold, the Sikh scripture is treated with respect like a living person, in a manner similar to the Gospel in early Christian worship. Old copies of the Sikh scripture are not thrown away. Rather, funerary services are performed.

In India, the Guru Granth Sahib is officially recognised by the Supreme Court of India as a judicial person which can receive donations and own land. Yet, some Sikhs also warn that, without true comprehension of the text, veneration for the text can lead to bibliolatry, with the concrete form of the teachings becoming the object of worship instead of the teachings themselves.

====Relation to Hinduism and Islam====
The Sikh scriptures use Hindu terminology, with references to the Vedas, and the names of gods and goddesses in Hindu bhakti movement traditions, such as Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Parvati, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Rama, Krishna, but not to worship. It also refers to the spiritual concepts in Hinduism (&quot;Ishvara, Bhagavan, Brahman&quot;) and the concept of God in Islam (&quot;Allah&quot;) to assert that these are just &quot;alternate names for the Almighty One&quot;.

While the Guru Granth Sahib acknowledges the Vedas, Puranas and Quran, it does not imply a syncretic bridge between Hinduism and Islam, but emphasises focusing on nitnem banis like Japu (repeating mantra of the divine Name of God – Waheguru), instead of practices such as praying by prostrating on the ground to God towards a specific direction by Muslims, or Hindu rituals such as wearing thread; the former being, though, a disciplinary aspect of worship, given Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) is similarly emphasised in Islam.

===Dasam Granth===

The Dasam Granth is a scripture of Sikhs which contains texts attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. Scholars, on the other hand, attribute the work to after the guru&#x27;s death, being authored by an unknown poet. The &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; is important to a great number of Sikhs. However, it does not have the same authority as the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot;. Some compositions of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; like Jaap Sahib (Amrit Savaiye), and Benti Chaupai are part of the daily prayers (Nitnem) for Sikhs. The first verse of the ardās prayer is from Chandi di Var. The &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; is largely versions of Hindu mythology from the Puranas, secular stories from a variety of sources called &quot;Charitro Pakhyan&quot; – tales to protect careless men from perils of lust.

Many versions of &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; exist, and the authenticity of the &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; has in modern times become one of the most debated topics within Sikhism. The Akali Nihangs consider the Dasam and Sarbloh Granth as extensions of the Guru Granth Sahib. The text played a significant role in Sikh history, but in modern times parts of the text have seen antipathy and discussion among Sikhs.

=== Sarbloh Granth ===
The Sarbloh Granth is a scripture containing 6,500 poetic stanzas traditionally attributed to Guru Gobind Singh. Scholars, on the other hand, attribute the work to after the guru&#x27;s death, being authored by an unknown poet. This scripture contains, alongside various topics, the Sikh Art and Laws of War. This scripture is largely revered by Akali Nihangs with many non-Nihang Sikhs rejecting it as an authentic work of the 10th guru. According to Harbans Singh the authenticity of the work is rejected on the grounds of its writing style and mastery of poetry not matching up with Guru Gobind Singh&#x27;s &quot;Dasam Granth&quot; work. Also, the text makes mention of a work composed in 1719, much after the death of the Guru Gobind Singh. W. H. McLeod dates the work to the late 18th century and believes it was authored by an unknown poet and was mistakenly attributed to the tenth guru.

===Janamsakhis===
The Janamsākhīs (literally &quot;birth stories&quot;), are writings which profess to be biographies of Guru Nanak. Although not scripture in the strictest sense, they provide a hagiographic look at Guru Nanak&#x27;s life and the early start of Sikhism.

==Observances==
Observant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation of the divine name of God, Waheguru, and from a memory of specific passages from the Guru Granth Sahib, like the &quot;Japu&quot; (or &quot;Japjī&quot;, literally &quot;chant&quot;) hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptised Sikhs recite the five-morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the gurdwara (also &quot;gurduārā&quot;, meaning &quot;the doorway to God&quot;; sometimes transliterated as &quot;Gurudwara&quot;). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every country where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.

Worship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of the singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly prostrate before the holy scripture when entering a gurdwara. The recitation of the eighteenth century &quot;ardās&quot; is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ardās recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.

The gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of &quot;langar&quot; or the community meal. All gurdwaras are open to anyone of any faith for a free meal, which is always vegetarian. People eat together, and the kitchen is maintained and serviced by Sikh community volunteers.

===Sikh festivals/events===
Guru Amar Das chose festivals for celebration by Sikhs like Vaisakhi, wherein he asked Sikhs to assemble and share the festivities as a community.

Vaisakhi is one of the most important festivals of Sikhs, while other significant festivals commemorate the birth, lives of the gurus and Sikh martyrs. Historically, these festivals have been based on the moon calendar Bikrami calendar. In 2003, the SGPC, the Sikh organisation in charge of upkeep of the historical gurdwaras of Punjab, adopted Nanakshahi calendar. The new calendar is highly controversial among Sikhs and is not universally accepted. Sikh festivals include the following:

* Band Chor Diwas has been another important Sikh festival in its history. In recent years, instead of Diwali, the post-2003 calendar released by SGPC has named it the Bandi Chhor Divas.
* Hola Mohalla is a tradition started by Guru Gobind Singh. It starts the day after Sikhs celebrate Holi, sometimes referred to as &quot;Hola&quot;. Guru Gobind Singh modified Holi with a three-day Hola Mohalla extension festival of martial arts. The extension started the day after the Holi festival in Anandpur Sahib, where Sikh soldiers would train in mock battles, compete in horsemanship, athletics, archery and military exercises.

===Ceremonies and customs===
 
Sikhs have also supported and helped develop major pilgrimage traditions to sacred sites such as Harmandir Sahib, Anandpur Sahib, Fatehgarh Sahib, Patna Sahib, Hazur Nanded Sahib, Hemkund Sahib and others. Sikh pilgrims and Sikhs of other sects customarily consider these as holy and a part of their &quot;Tirath&quot;. The Hola Mohalla around the festival of Holi, for example, is a ceremonial and customary gathering every year in Anandpur Sahib attracting over 100,000 Sikhs. Major Sikh temples feature a &quot;sarovar&quot; where some Sikhs take a customary dip. Some take home the sacred water of the tank particularly for sick friends and relatives, believing that the waters of such sacred sites have restorative powers and the ability to purify one&#x27;s &quot;karma&quot;. The various gurus of Sikhism have had different approaches to pilgrimage.

Upon a child&#x27;s birth, the Guru Granth Sahib is opened at a random point and the child is named using the first letter on the top left hand corner of the left page. All boys are given the last name Singh, and all girls are given the last name Kaur (this was once a title which was conferred on an individual upon joining the Khalsa).

The Sikh marriage ritual includes the &quot;anand kāraj&quot; ceremony. The marriage ceremony is performed in front of the Guru Granth Sahib by a baptised Khalsa, Granthi of the Gurdwara. Its official recognition and adoption came in 1909, during the Singh Sabha Movement.

Upon death, the body of a Sikh is usually cremated. If this is not possible, any respectful means of disposing the body may be employed. The &quot;kīrtan sōhilā&quot; and &quot;ardās&quot; prayers are performed during the funeral ceremony (known as &quot;antim sanskār&quot;).

===Initiation and the Khalsa===

Khalsa (meaning &quot;pure and sovereign&quot;) is the collective name given by Guru Gobind Singh, to those Sikhs who have been fully initiated by taking part in a ceremony called &quot;ammrit sañcār&quot; (nectar ceremony). During this ceremony, sweetened water is stirred with a double-edged sword while liturgical prayers are sung; it is offered to the initiating Sikh, who ritually drinks it. Many Sikhs are not formally and fully initiated, as they do not undergo this ceremony, but do adhere to some components of Sikhism and identify as Sikhs. The initiated Sikh, who is believed to be reborn, is referred to as Amritdhari or Khalsa Sikh, while those who are not initiated or baptised are referred to as Kesdhari or Sahajdhari Sikhs.

The first time that this ceremony took place was on Vaisakhi, which fell on 30 March 1699 at Anandpur Sahib in Punjab. It was on that occasion that Gobind Singh baptised the Pañj Piārē – the five beloved ones, who in turn baptised Guru Gobind Singh himself. To males who initiated, the last name Singh, meaning &quot;lion&quot;, was given, while the last name Kaur, meaning &quot;princess&quot;, was given to baptised Sikh females.

Baptised Sikhs wear five items, called the five Ks (in Punjabi known as &quot;pañj kakkē&quot; or &quot;pañj kakār&quot;), at all times. The five items are: &quot;kēs&quot; (uncut hair), &quot;kaṅghā&quot; (small wooden comb), &quot;kaṛā&quot; (circular steel or iron bracelet), &quot;kirpān&quot; (sword/dagger), and &quot;kacchera&quot; (special undergarment). The five Ks have both practical and symbolic purposes.

==History==
Sikhism originated around the 15th century. Guru Nanak (1469–1539), the founder of Sikhism, was born in the village of &quot;Rāi Bhōi dī Talwandī&quot;, now called Nankana Sahib (in present-day Pakistan). His parents were Punjabi Khatri Hindus. According to the hagiography &quot;Puratan Janamsakhi&quot; composed more than two centuries after his death and probably based on oral tradition, Nanak as a boy was fascinated by religion and spiritual matters, spending time with wandering ascetics and holy men. His friend was Mardana, a Muslim. Together they would sing devotional songs all night in front of the public, and bathe in the river in the morning. One day, at the usual bath, Nanak went missing and his family feared he had drowned. Three days later he returned home, and declared: &quot;There is no Hindu, there is no Muslim&quot; (&quot;nā kōi hindū nā kōi musalmān&quot;). Thereafter, Nanak started preaching his ideas that form the tenets of Sikhism. In 1526, Guru Nanak at age 50, started a small commune in Kartarpur and his disciples came to be known as &quot;Sikhs&quot;. Although the exact account of his itinerary is disputed, hagiographic accounts state he made five major journeys, spanning thousands of miles: the first tour being east towards Bengal and Assam; the second south towards Andhra and Tamil Nadu; the third north to Kashmir, Ladakh, and Mount Sumeru in Tibet; and the fourth to Baghdad. In his last and final tour, he returned to the banks of the Ravi River to end his days.

There are two competing theories on Guru Nanak&#x27;s teachings. One, according to Cole and Sambhi, is based on hagiographical Janamsakhis, and states that Nanak&#x27;s teachings and Sikhism were a revelation from God, and not a social protest movement nor any attempt to reconcile Hinduism and Islam in the 15th century. The other states that Nanak was a guru. According to Singha, &quot;Sikhism does not subscribe to the theory of incarnation or the concept of prophethood. But it has a pivotal concept of Guru. He is not an incarnation of God, not even a prophet. He is an illumined soul.&quot; The second theory continues that hagiographical &quot;Janamsakhis&quot; were not written by Nanak, but by later followers without regard for historical accuracy, and contain numerous legends and myths created to show respect for Nanak. The term &quot;revelation&quot;, clarify Cole and Sambhi, in Sikhism is not limited to the teachings of Nanak, but is extended to all Sikh gurus, as well as the words of past, present and future men and women, who possess divine knowledge intuitively through meditation. The Sikh revelations include the words of non-Sikh bhagats, some who lived and died before the birth of Nanak, and whose teachings are part of the Sikh scriptures. The Adi Granth and successive Sikh gurus repeatedly emphasised, states Mandair, that Sikhism is &quot;not about hearing voices from God, but it is about changing the nature of the human mind, and anyone can achieve direct experience and spiritual perfection at any time&quot;.

===Historical influences===
The roots of the Sikh tradition are, states Louis Fenech, perhaps in the Sant-tradition of India whose ideology grew to become the Bhakti tradition. Furthermore, adds Fenech:
The development of Sikhism was influenced by the Bhakti movement; however, Sikhism was not simply an extension of the Bhakti movement. Sikhism, for instance, disagreed with some of the views of Bhakti saints Kabir and Ravidas. Sikhism developed while the region was being ruled by the Mughal Empire. Two of the Sikh gurus, Guru Arjan and Guru Tegh Bahadur, refused to convert to Islam and were tortured and executed by the Mughal rulers. The Islamic era persecution of Sikhs triggered the founding of the Khalsa, as an order for freedom of conscience and religion. A Sikh is expected to embody the qualities of a &quot;Sant-Sipāhī&quot; a saint-soldier.

===Growth of Sikhism===

After its inception, Sikhism grew as it gained converts among Hindus and Muslims in the Punjab region. In 1539, Guru Nanak chose his disciple Lahiṇā as a successor to the Guruship rather than either of his sons. Lahiṇā was named Guru Angad and became the second guru of the Sikhs. Nanak conferred his choice at the town of Kartarpur on the banks of the river Ravi. Sri Chand, Guru Nanak&#x27;s son was also a religious man, and continued his own commune of Sikhs. His followers came to be known as the Udasi Sikhs, the first parallel sect of Sikhism that formed in Sikh history. The Udasis believe that the Guruship should have gone to Sri Chand, since he was a man of pious habits in addition to being Nanak&#x27;s son.

Guru Angad, before joining Guru Nanak&#x27;s commune, worked as a &quot;pujari&quot; (priest) and religious teacher centered around Hindu goddess Durga. On Nanak&#x27;s advice, Guru Angad moved from Kartarpur to Khadur, where his wife Khivi and children were living, until he was able to bridge the divide between his followers and the Udasis. Guru Angad continued the work started by Guru Nanak and is widely credited for standardising the Gurmukhī script as used in the sacred scripture of the Sikhs.

Guru Amar Das became the third Sikh guru in 1552 at the age of 73. He adhered to the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism for much of his life, before joining the commune of Guru Angad. Goindval became an important centre for Sikhism during the Guruship of Guru Amar Das. He was a reformer, and discouraged veiling of women&#x27;s faces (a Muslim custom) as well as sati (a Hindu custom). He encouraged the Kshatriya people to fight in order to protect people and for the sake of justice, stating this is Dharma. Guru Amar Das started the tradition of appointing &quot;manji&quot; (zones of religious administration with an appointed chief called &quot;sangatias&quot;), introduced the &quot;dasvandh&quot; (tithe) system of revenue collection in the name of guru and as pooled community religious resource, and the famed &quot;langar&quot; tradition of Sikhism where anyone, without discrimination of any kind, could get a free meal in a communal seating. The collection of revenue from Sikhs through regional appointees helped Sikhism grow.

Guru Amar Das named his disciple and son-in-law Jēṭhā as the next guru, who came to be known as Guru Ram Das. The new guru faced hostilities from the sons of Guru Amar Das and therefore shifted his official base to lands identified by Guru Amar Das as Guru-ka-Chak. He moved his commune of Sikhs there and the place then was called Ramdaspur, after him. This city grew and later became Amritsar – the holiest city of Sikhism. Guru Ram Das expanded the &quot;manji&quot; organization for clerical appointments in Sikh temples, and for revenue collections to theologically and economically support the Sikh movement.

In 1581, Guru Arjan, the youngest son of Guru Ram Das, became the fifth guru of the Sikhs. The choice of successor, as throughout most of the history of Sikh guru successions, led to disputes and internal divisions among the Sikhs. The elder son of Guru Ram Das named Prithi Chand is remembered in the Sikh tradition as vehemently opposing Guru Arjan, creating a faction Sikh community which the Sikhs following Guru Arjan called as &quot;Minaas&quot; (literally, &quot;scoundrels&quot;).

Guru Arjan is remembered among Sikhs for many accomplishments. He built the first Harimandir Sahib (later to become the Golden Temple). He was a poet and created the first edition of Sikh sacred text known as the Ādi Granth (literally &quot;the first book&quot;) and included the writings of the first five gurus and other enlightened 13 Hindu and 2 Muslim Sufi saints. In 1606, he was tortured and killed by the Mughal emperor Jahangir, for refusing to convert to Islam. His martyrdom is considered a watershed event in the history of Sikhism.

===Political advancement===
After the martyrdom of Guru Arjan, his son Guru Hargobind at age eleven became the sixth guru of the Sikhs, and Sikhism dramatically evolved to become a political movement in addition to being religious. Guru Hargobind carried two swords, calling one spiritual and the other for temporal purpose, reflecting the concept of Miri Piri. According to the Sikh tradition, Guru Arjan asked his son Hargobind to start a military tradition to protect the Sikh people and always keep himself surrounded by armed Sikhs. The building of an armed Sikh militia began with Guru Hargobind. Guru Hargobind was soon arrested by the Mughals and kept in jail in Gwalior. It is unclear how many years he served in prison, with different texts stating it to be between 2 and 12. He married three women, built a fort to defend Ramdaspur and created a formal court called Akal Takht, now the highest Khalsa Sikh religious authority.

In 1644, Guru Hargobind named his grandson Har Rai as the guru. The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan attempted political means to undermine the Sikh tradition, by dividing and influencing the succession. The Mughal ruler gave land grants to Dhir Mal, a grandson of Guru Hargobind living in Kartarpur, and attempted to encourage Sikhs to recognise Dhir Mal as the rightful successor to Guru Hargobind. Dhir Mal issued statements in favour of the Mughal state and critical of his grandfather Guru Arjan. Guru Hargobind rejected Dhir Mal, the latter refused to give up the original version of the Adi Granth he had, and the Sikh community was divided.

Guru Har Rai is famed to have met Dara Shikoh during a time Dara Shikoh and his younger brother Aurangzeb were in a bitter succession fight. Aurangzeb summoned Guru Har Rai, who refused to go and sent his elder son Ram Rai instead. The emperor found a verse in the Sikh scripture insulting to Muslims, and Ram Rai agreed it was a mistake then changed it. Ram Rai thus pleased Aurangzeb, but displeased Guru Har Rai who excommunicated his elder son. He nominated his younger son Guru Har Krishan to succeed him in 1661. Aurangzeb responded by granting Ram Rai a jagir (land grant). Ram Rai founded a town there and enjoyed Aurangzeb&#x27;s patronage; the town came to be known as Dehradun, after &quot;Dehra&quot; referring to Ram Rai&#x27;s shrine. Sikhs who followed Ram Rai came to be known as Ramraiya Sikhs. However, according to rough estimates, there are around 120–150 million (12–15 crore) Guru Har Krishan became the eighth guru at the age of five, and died of smallpox before reaching the age of eight. No hymns composed by these three gurus are included in the Guru Granth Sahib.

Guru Tegh Bahadur, the uncle of Guru Har Krishan, became guru in 1665. Tegh Bahadur resisted the forced conversions of Kashmiri Pandits and non-Muslims to Islam, and was publicly beheaded in 1675 on the orders of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in Delhi for refusing to convert to Islam. His beheading traumatized the Sikhs. His body was cremated in Delhi, while the head was carried secretively by Sikhs and cremated in Anandpur. He was succeeded by his son, Gobind Rai, who militarised his followers by creating the Khalsa in 1699, and baptising the &quot;Pañj Piārē&quot;. From then on, he was known as Guru Gobind Singh, and Sikh identity was redefined into a political force resisting religious persecution.
====Sikh confederacy and the rise of the Khalsa====

Guru Gobind Singh inaugurated the Khalsa (the collective body of all initiated Sikhs) as the Sikh temporal authority in the year 1699. It created a community that combines its spiritual purpose and goals with political and military duties. Shortly before his death, Guru Gobind Singh proclaimed the Guru Granth Sahib to be the ultimate spiritual authority for the Sikhs.

After the Guru Gobind&#x27;s death, Banda Singh Bahadur became the commander-in-chief of the Khalsa. He organised the civilian rebellion and abolished or halted the Zamindari system in time he was active and gave the farmers proprietorship of their own land.

The Sikh empire, with its capital in Lahore, spread over almost comprising what is now northwestern Indian subcontinent. The Sikh Empire entered into a treaty with the colonial British powers, with each side recognizing Sutlej River as the line of control and agreeing not to invade the other side. Ranjit Singh&#x27;s most lasting legacy was the restoration and expansion of the Harmandir Sahib, most revered Gurudwara of the Sikhs, with marble and gold, from which the popular name of the &quot;Golden Temple&quot; is derived. After the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839, the Sikh Empire fell into disorder. Ranjit Singh had failed to establish a lasting structure for Sikh government or stable succession, and the Sikh Empire rapidly declined after his death. Factions divided the Sikhs, and led to Anglo-Sikh wars. The British defeated the confused and demoralised Khalsa forces, then disbanded them into destitution. The youngest son of Ranjit Singh, named Duleep Singh, ultimately succeeded, but he was arrested and exiled after the defeat of the Sikhs.

====Singh Sabha movement====

The Singh Sabha movement, a movement to revitalize Sikhism, also saw the resurgence of the Khalsa after their defeat in wars with the British – latterly in the Second Anglo-Sikh War – and the subsequent decline and corruption of Sikh institutions during colonial rule, and the proselytization of other faith groups in the Punjab. It was started in the 1870s, and after a period of interfactional rivalry, united under the Tat Khalsa to reinvigorate Sikh practice and institutions.

The last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire, Duleep Singh, converted to Christianity in 1853, a controversial but influential event in Sikh history. Along with his conversion, and after Sikh Empire had been dissolved and the region made a part of the colonial British Empire, proselytising activities of Christians, Brahmo Samajis, Arya Samaj, Muslim Anjuman-i-Islamia and Ahmadiyah sought to convert the Sikhs in northwestern Indian subcontinent into their respective faiths. These developments launched the Singh Sabha Movement.

The first meeting of the movement was in the Golden Temple, Amritsar in 1873, and it was largely launched by the Sanatan Sikhs, Gianis, priests, and granthis. Shortly thereafter, Nihang Sikhs began influencing the movement, followed by a sustained campaign by the Tat Khalsa, which had quickly gained dominance by the early 1880s. The movement became a struggle between Sanatan Sikhs and Tat Khalsa in defining and interpreting Sikhism.

Sanatan Sikhs led by Khem Singh Bedi – who claimed to be a direct descendant of Guru Nanak, Avtar Singh Vahiria and others supported a more inclusive approach which considered Sikhism as a reformed tradition of Hinduism, while Tat Khalsa campaigned for an exclusive approach to the Sikh identity, disagreeing with Sanatan Sikhs and seeking to modernize Sikhism. The Sikh Sabha movement expanded in north and northwest Indian subcontinent, leading to more than 100 Singh Sabhas. By the early decades of the 20th century, the influence of Tat Khalsa increased in interpreting the nature of Sikhism and their control over the Sikh gurdwaras. The Tat Khalsa banished Brahmanical practices including the use of the &quot;yagna&quot; fire, replaced by the &quot;Anand Karaj&quot; marriage ceremony in accordance with Sikh scripture, and the idols and the images of Sikh gurus from the Golden Temple in 1905, traditions which had taken root during the administration of the &quot;mahants&quot; during the 1800s. They undertook a sustained campaign to standardize how Sikh gurdwaras looked and ran, while looking to Sikh scriptures and the early Sikh tradition to purify the Sikh identity.

The spiritual successors of the Singh Sabha include the Akali movement of the 1920s, as well as the modern-day Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), a gurdwara administration body, and the Akali Dal political party.

====Partition of India====
Sikhs participated and contributed to the decades-long Indian independence movement in the first half of the 20th century. Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the land was partitioned into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. According to Banga, the partition was a watershed event in Sikh history. The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (&quot;Radcliffe Line&quot;). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the Muslim League demands and saw it as &quot;perpetuation of Muslim domination&quot; and anti-Sikh policies in what just a hundred years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. As such, Sikh organizations, including the Chief Khalsa Dewan and Shiromani Akali Dal led by Master Tara Singh, condemned the Lahore Resolution and the movement to create Pakistan, viewing it as inviting possible persecution; the Sikhs largely thus strongly opposed the partition of India. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition of colonial India and for the recognition of Sikhs as a third community.

When partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population. Along with Hindus, Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan. As a result, Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side, leaving behind their property and holy sites. However, the anti-Sikh violence was not one-sided. As Sikhs moved to the eastern side of the partition line, they engaged in reprisals against Muslims there, forcing them into Pakistan. Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite in West Punjab, however. They had the largest representation in West Punjab&#x27;s aristocracy, and there were nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs. Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of jhatka versus halal meat, the disputed ownership of Gurdwara Sahidganj in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government on switching from Indian Gurmukhi script to Arabic-Persian Nastaliq script in schools. During and after the Simla Conference in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as a third community, but ultimately relegated these demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss-style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that the entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan. The Sikh leaders then sought the original partition instead, and the Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.
Between March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh and property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places led to Tara Singh calling the situation in Punjab a &quot;civil war&quot;, while Lord Mountbatten stated &quot;civil war preparations were going on.&quot; The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala. In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil. Sikhs constituted only 4 million out of a total of 28 million in Punjab, and 6 million out of nearly 400 million in India; they did not constitute the majority, not even in a single district.

When the partition line was formally announced in August 1947, the violence was unprecedented, with Sikhs being one of the most affected religious community both in terms of deaths, as well as property loss, injury, trauma and disruption. Sikhs and Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of retaliatory violence against each other. Estimates range between 200,000 and 2 million deaths of Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims. There were numerous rapes of and mass suicides by Sikh women, they being taken captives, their rescues and above all a mass exodus of Sikhs from newly created Pakistan into newly independent India. The partition created the &quot;largest foot convoy of refugees recorded in [human] history, stretching over 100 kilometer long&quot;, states Banga, with nearly 300,000 people consisting of mostly &quot;distraught, suffering, injured and angry Sikhs&quot;. Sikh and Hindu refugees from Pakistan flooded into India, Muslim refugees from India flooded into Pakistan, each into their new homeland.

====Khalistan====

In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of Komagata Maru in Canada proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between an independent India and what would become Pakistan. These leaders, however, were largely ignored. The early 1980s witnessed some Sikh groups seeking an independent state named Khalistan carved out from India and Pakistan. The Golden Temple and Akal Takht were occupied by various militant groups in 1982. These included the Dharam Yudh Morcha led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, the Babbar Khalsa, the AISSF and the National Council of Khalistan. Between 1982 and 1983, there were Anandpur Resolution demand-related terrorist attacks against civilians in parts of India. By late 1983, the Bhindranwale led group had begun to build bunkers and observations posts in and around the Golden Temple, with militants involved in weapons training. In June 1984, the then Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi ordered Indian Army to begin Operation Blue Star against the militants. The fierce engagement took place in the precincts of Darbar Sahib and resulted in many deaths, including Bhindranwale. It also resulted in the destruction of the Sikh Reference Library, which was considered a national treasure that contained over a thousand rare manuscripts and the Akal Takht. Numerous soldiers, civilians and militants died in the cross fire. Within days of the Operation Bluestar, some 2,000 Sikh soldiers in India mutinied and attempted to reach Amritsar to liberate the Golden Temple. Within six months, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Sikh bodyguards Satwant and Beant Singh assassinated her. The assassination triggered the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. According to Donald Horowitz, while anti-Sikh riots led to much damage and deaths, many serious provocations by militants also failed to trigger ethnic violence in many cases throughout the 1980s. The Sikhs and their neighbors, for most part, ignored attempts to provoke riots and communal strife.

==Sikh people==


Estimates state that Sikhism has some 25–30 million followers worldwide. According to Pew Research, a think tank and research group based in Washington, DC, over 9-in-10 Sikhs are in India, but there are also sizable Sikh communities in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Within India, the Sikh population is found in every state and union territory, but it is predominantly found in the northwestern and northern states. Only in the state of Punjab do Sikhs constitute a majority (58% of the total, per 2011 census). In addition to Punjab, the states and union territories of India where Sikhs constitute more than 1.5% of its population are Chandigarh, Haryana, Delhi, Uttarakhand, and Jammu and Kashmir, all of which are in the northern half of India.

Canada is home to the largest proportion of Sikhs, as a ratio of the country&#x27;s total population, in the world, at 2.1%. Within Canada, Sikhs form 5.9% of the total population in the western province of British Columbia, representing the third-largest Sikh proportion amongst all global administrative divisions, behind only Punjab and Chandigarh in India. British Columbia, Manitoba, and Yukon hold the distinction of being three of the only four administrative divisions in the world with Sikhism as the second-most followed religion among the population.

Prior to the 1947 partition of British India, millions of Sikhs lived in what later became Pakistan. Likewise, Sikhism was founded in what is now Pakistan, and some of the gurus were born near Lahore and in other parts of Pakistan. During the partition, Sikhs and Hindus left the newly created Muslim-majority Pakistan and mostly moved to Hindu-majority India—with some moving to Muslim-majority Afghanistan—while numerous Muslims in India moved to Pakistan. According to 2017 news reports, only about 20,000 Sikhs remain in Pakistan, and their population is dwindling ( of the country&#x27;s estimated 200 million population).

===Sikh sects===

Sikh sects are sub-traditions within Sikhism that believe in an alternate lineage of gurus, or have a different interpretation of the Sikh scriptures, or believe in following a living guru, or hold other concepts that differ from the orthodox Khalsa Sikhs. The major historic sects of Sikhism have included Udasi, Nirmala, Nanakpanthi, Khalsa, Sahajdhari, Namdhari Kuka, Nirankari, and Sarvaria.

Sikhs originally had only five orders, or sampradas (not to be confused as deviant sects). These include:

Nihangs – the Sikh Panth&#x27;s warriors or armed troops. There are two main groups within this order: Buddha Dal, or the army of veterans, and Tarna Dal, or the army of youth. There are other smaller sub-orders connected to these two. The president of Buddha Dal, previously always served as the president of the Akaal Takht, which has jurisdiction over all things pertaining to the Akaali Nihang order. 

Nirmalas – scholars. Composed texts as well as traditionally studying a wide range of Indian and some non-Indian literature. They converse with other Dharmik pathways as well. The tenth guru also institutionalized them. Bhai Daya Singh Ji Samparda and Bhai Dharam Singh Ji Samparda, two of the Panj Pyare or cherished ones of the tenth guru, founded two Nirmala orders.

Udasis – an ascetic group that historically looked after Gurdwaras and carried out missionary activity. Although not promoting it to others, certain of their practices depart from the majority of Sikh beliefs. Baba Sri Chand, the eldest Sahibzada (son) of the first guru, Guru Nanak Dev, founded the order. Their Gurdev is Baba Sri Chand.

Sevapanthis – philanthropists who engage in charitable work/seva, or selfless service, without expecting payment. They also work on academic projects. Bhai Kahnaiya, a Sikh of the ninth and tenth guru, served as the first head of the order and is renowned for his wartime medical assistance to wounded enemy soldiers. Very few of them exist today. The environment in which they lived and with which they interacted was a predominantly Muslim one.

Gyaaniyan Samparda – the university of Sikhi, whilst technically not an order, it essentially serves as one. Made up from individuals belonging to all of the above sects. Many branches within this order.

The early Sikh sects were Udasis and Minas founded by Baba Sri Chand – the elder son of Guru Nanak, and Prithi Chand – the elder son of Guru Ram Das respectively, in parallel to the official succession of the Sikh gurus. Later on Ramraiya sect, founded by Ram Rai, grew in Dehradun with the patronage of Aurangzeb. Many splintered Sikh communities formed during the Mughal Empire era. Some of these sects were financially and administratively supported by the Mughal rulers in the hopes of gaining a more favorable and compliant citizenry.

After the collapse of Mughal Empire, and particularly during the rule of Ranjit Singh, Udasi Sikhs protected Sikh shrines, preserved the Sikh scripture and rebuilt those that were desecrated or destroyed during the Muslim–Sikh wars. However, Udasi Sikhs kept idols and images inside these Sikh temples. In the 19th century, Namdharis and Nirankaris sects were formed in Sikhism, seeking to reform and return to what each believed was the pure form of Sikhism.

All these sects differ from Khalsa orthodox Sikhs in their beliefs and practices, such as continuing to solemnize their weddings around fire and being strictly vegetarian. Many accept the concept of living gurus such as Guru Baba Dyal Singh. The Nirankari sect, though unorthodox, was influential in shaping the views of Tat Khalsa and the contemporary-era Sikh beliefs and practices. Another significant Sikh sect of the 19th century was the Radhasoami movement in Punjab led by Baba Shiv Dyal. Other contemporary era Sikhs sects include the 3HO, formed in 1971, which exists outside India, particularly in North America and Europe.

===Sikh castes===

According to Surinder Jodhka, the state of Punjab with a Sikh majority has the &quot;largest proportion of scheduled caste population in India&quot;. Although decried by Sikhism, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab. The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, &quot;have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or dalits; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar.&quot; The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity. According to Jodhka, due to economic mobility in contemporary Punjab, castes no longer mean an inherited occupation, nor are work relations tied to a single location.
In 1953, the government of India acceded to the demands of the Sikh leader, Master Tara Singh, to include Sikh Dalit castes in the list of scheduled castes. In the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, 20 of the 140 seats are reserved for low-caste Sikhs.

Over 60% of Sikhs belong to the Jat caste, which is an agrarian caste. Despite being very small in numbers, the mercantile Khatri and Arora castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community. Other common Sikh castes include Sainis, Ramgarhias (artisans), Brahmins, Ahluwalias (formerly brewers), Rajputs, Rai Sikh (Rai), Kambojs (rural caste), Labanas, Kumhars and the two Dalit castes, known in Sikh terminology as the Mazhabis (the Chuhras) and the Ravidasias (the Chamars).

===Sikh diaspora===
Sikhism is the fifth-largest amongst the world religions, and one of the youngest. Worldwide, there are 30 million Sikhs, which makes up 0.4% of the world&#x27;s population. Approximately 75% of Sikhs live in Punjab, where they constitute 57.7% of the state&#x27;s population. Large communities of Sikhs migrate to the neighboring states such as Indian State of Haryana which is home to the second largest Sikh population in India with 1.1 million Sikhs as per 2001 census, and large immigrant communities of Sikhs can be found across India. However, Sikhs only comprise about 1.7% of the Indian population.

Most Sikhs outside India live in the core Anglosphere, with 771,790 in Canada (2.1% Sikh), 524,140 in the United Kingdom (0.9% Sikh), 280,000 in the United States (0.1% Sikh), 210,400 in Australia (0.8% Sikh), and 40,908 in New Zealand (0.9% Sikh). While these communities are over 125 years old, most Sikhs in the West are first, second, or third-generation immigrants. the 2021 Canadian Census, more than half of Canada&#x27;s Sikhs can be found in one of four cities: Brampton (163,260), Surrey (154,415), Calgary (49,465), and Abbotsford (38,395).

Sikhs also migrated to East Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. These communities developed as Sikhs migrated out of Punjab to fill in gaps in imperial labour markets.

==Prohibitions in Sikhism==
Four major transgressions:
* Hair removal – Hair cutting, trimming, removing, shaving, plucking, threading, dyeing, or any other alteration from any body part is strictly forbidden.
* Eating Kutha meat. This is the absolute minimum required by all initiated Sikhs. Many Sikhs refrain from eating non-vegetarian food, and believe all should follow this diet. This is due to various social, cultural, political, and familial aspects. As such, there has always been major disagreement among Sikhs over the issue of eating non-vegetarian food. Sikhs following the rahit (code of conduct) of the Damdami Taksal and AKJ also subscribe to this view. The Akali Nihangs have traditionally eaten meat and are famous for performing Jhatka. Thus, there is a wide range of views that exist on the issue of a proper &quot;Sikh diet&quot; in the Panth. Nonetheless, all Sikhs agree with the minimum consensus that meat slaughtered via the Muslim (Halal) or Jewish (Shechita) methods is strictly against Sikh dogma and principles. The Akal Takht represents the final authority on controversial issues concerning the Sikh Panth (community or collective). The Hukamnama (edict or clarification), issued by Akal Takht Jathedar Sadhu Singh Bhaura dated 15 February 1980, states that eating meat does not go against the code of conduct of the Sikhs. Amritdhari Sikhs can eat meat as long as it is Jhatka meat.
* Adultery: Cohabiting with a person other than one&#x27;s spouse (sexual relations with anyone who you are not married to).
* Intoxication – Consumption of tobacco and intoxicants (hemp, opium, liquor, narcotics, cocaine, etc.) is not allowed. Cannabis is generally prohibited, but ritually consumed in edible form by some Sikhs. Some Sikh groups, like the Damdami Taksal, are even opposed to drinking caffeine in Indian tea. Indian tea is almost always served in Sikh Gurudwaras around the world. Some Akali Nihang groups consume cannabis-containing shaheedi degh (), purportedly to help in meditation. &quot;Sūkha parshaad&quot; (), &quot;Dry-sweet&quot;, is the term Akali Nihangs use to refer to it. It was traditionally crushed and consumed as a liquid, especially during festivals like Hola Mohalla. It is never smoked, as this practice is forbidden in Sikhism. In 2001, Jathedar Santa Singh, the leader of Budha Dal, along with 20 chiefs of Nihang sects, refused to accept the ban on consumption of&quot; shaheedi degh&quot; by the apex Sikh clergy of Akal Takht – in order to preserve their traditional practices. According to a recent BBC article, &quot;Traditionally they also drank shaheedi degh, an infusion of cannabis, to become closer with God&quot;. Baba Santa Singh was excommunicated and replaced with Baba Balbir Singh, who agreed to shun the consumption of &quot;bhang&quot;.

Other mentioned practices to be avoided, as per the Sikh Rehat Maryada:
* Piercing of the nose or ears for wearing ornaments is forbidden for Sikh men and women. However, this is a point of contention as it was common for Sikh men and women to wear during the Sikh Misl period.
* Female infanticide: A Sikh should not kill their daughter; nor should they maintain any relationship with a killer of daughter.
* A Sikh shall not steal, form dubious associations or engage in gambling.
* It is not proper for a Sikh woman to wear a veil, or keep her face hidden.
* Sikhs cannot wear any token of any other faith, nor participate in idol worship (Idolatry) according to the Guru Granth Sahib. Sikhs must not have their head bare or wear caps. They also cannot wear any ornaments piercing through any part of the body.
* Hereditary priest – Sikhism does not have priests, as they were abolished by Guru Gobind Singh. The only position he left was a Granthi to look after the Guru Granth Sahib; any Sikh is free to become Granthi or read from the Guru Granth Sahib.

<text>In chemistry, a structural isomer (or constitutional isomer in the IUPAC nomenclature) of a compound is another compound whose molecule has the same number of atoms of each element, but with logically distinct bonds between them. The term metamer was formerly used for the same concept.

For example, butanol , methyl propyl ether , and diethyl ether have the same molecular formula but are three distinct structural isomers.

The concept applies also to polyatomic ions with the same total charge. A classical example is the cyanate ion and the fulminate ion . It is also extended to ionic compounds, so that (for example) ammonium cyanate and urea are considered structural isomers, and so are methylammonium formate and ammonium acetate .

Structural isomerism is the most radical type of isomerism. It is opposed to stereoisomerism, in which the atoms and bonding scheme are the same, but only the relative spatial arrangement of the atoms is different. Examples of the latter are the enantiomers, whose molecules are mirror images of each other, and the &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; versions of 2-butene.

Among the structural isomers, one can distinguish several classes including skeletal isomers, positional isomers (or regioisomers), functional isomers, [[tautomer]]s, and structural isotopomers.

==Skeletal isomerism==
A skeletal isomer of a compound is a structural isomer that differs from it in the atoms and bonds that are considered to comprise the &quot;skeleton&quot; of the molecule. For organic compounds, such as alkanes, that usually means the carbon atoms and the bonds between them.

For example, there are three skeletal isomers of pentane: &quot;n&quot;-pentane (often called simply &quot;pentane&quot;), isopentane (2-methylbutane) and neopentane (dimethylpropane).

If the skeleton is acyclic, as in the above example, one may use the term chain isomerism.

==Position isomerism (regioisomerism)==
Position isomers (also positional isomers or regioisomers) are structural isomers that can be viewed as differing only on the position of a functional group, substituent, or some other feature on the same &quot;parent&quot; structure.

For example, replacing one of the 12 hydrogen atoms –H by a hydroxyl group –OH on the &quot;n&quot;-pentane parent molecule can give any of three different position isomers:
Another example of regioisomers are α-linolenic and γ-linolenic acids, both octadecatrienoic acids, each of which has three double bonds, but on different positions along the chain.

==Functional isomerism==
Functional isomers are structural isomers which have different functional groups, resulting in significantly different chemical and physical properties.

An example is the pair propanal H3C–CH2–C(=O)-H and acetone H3C–C(=O)–CH3: the first has a –C(=O)H functional group, which makes it an aldehyde, whereas the second has a C–C(=O)–C group, that makes it a ketone.

Another example is the pair ethanol H3C–CH2–OH (an alcohol) and dimethyl ether H3C–O–CH2H (an ether). In contrast, 1-propanol and 2-propanol are structural isomers, but not functional isomers, since they have the same significant functional group (the hydroxyl –OH) and are both alcohols.

Besides the different chemistry, functional isomers typically have very different infrared spectra. The infrared spectrum is largely determined by the vibration modes of the molecule, and functional groups like hydroxyl and esters have very different vibration modes. Thus 1-propanol and 2-propanol have relatively similar infrared spectra because of the hydroxyl group, which are fairly different from that of methyl ethyl ether.

==Structural isotopomers==

In chemistry, one usually ignores distinctions between isotopes of the same element. However, in some situations (for instance in Raman, NMR, or microwave spectroscopy) one may treat different isotopes of the same element as different elements. In the second case, two molecules with the same number of atoms of each isotope but distinct bonding schemes are said to be structural isotopomers.

Thus, for example, ethene would have no structural isomers under the first interpretation; but replacing two of the hydrogen atoms (1H) by deuterium atoms (2H) may yield any of two structural isotopomers (1,1-dideuteroethene and 1,2-dideuteroethene), if both carbon atoms are the same isotope. If, in addition, the two carbons are different isotopes (say, 12C and 13C), there would be three distinct structural isotopomers, since 1-13C-1,1-dideuteroethene would be different from 1-13C-2,2-dideuteroethene. And, in both cases, the 1,2-dideutero structural isotopomer would occur as two stereoisotopomers, &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot;.

==Structural equivalence and symmetry==
===Structural equivalence===
Two molecules (including polyatomic ions) A and B have the same structure if each atom of A can be paired with an atom of B of the same element, in a one-to-one way, so that for every bond in A there is a bond in B, of the same type, between corresponding atoms; and vice versa. This requirement applies also to complex bonds that involve three or more atoms, such as the delocalized bonding in the benzene molecule and other aromatic compounds.

Depending on the context, one may require that each atom be paired with an atom of the same isotope, not just of the same element.

Two molecules then can be said to be structural isomers (or, if isotopes matter, structural isotopomers) if they have the same molecular formula but do not have the same structure.

===Structural symmetry and equivalent atoms===
Structural symmetry of a molecule can be defined mathematically as a permutation of the atoms that exchanges at least two atoms but does not change the molecule&#x27;s structure. Two atoms then can be said to be structurally equivalent if there is a structural symmetry that takes one to the other.

Thus, for example, all four hydrogen atoms of methane are structurally equivalent, because any permutation of them will preserve all the bonds of the molecule.

Likewise, all six hydrogens of ethane () are structurally equivalent to each other, as are the two carbons; because any hydrogen can be switched with any other, either by a permutation that swaps just those two atoms, or by a permutation that swaps the two carbons and each hydrogen in one methyl group with a different hydrogen on the other methyl. Either operation preserves the structure of the molecule. That is the case also for the hydrogen atoms in cyclopentane, allene, 2-butyne, hexamethylenetetramine, prismane, cubane, dodecahedrane, etc.

On the other hand, the hydrogen atoms of propane are not all structurally equivalent. The six hydrogens attached to the first and third carbons are equivalent, as in ethane, and the two attached to the middle carbon are equivalent to each other; but there is no equivalence between these two equivalence classes.

===Symmetry and positional isomerism===
Structural equivalences between atoms of a parent molecule reduce the number of positional isomers that can be obtained by replacing those atoms for a different element or group. Thus, for example, the structural equivalence between the six hydrogens of ethane means that there is just one structural isomer of ethanol , not 6. The eight hydrogens of propane are partitioned into two structural equivalence classes (the six on the methyl groups, and the two on the central carbon); therefore there are only two positional isomers of propanol (1-propanol and 2-propanol). Likewise there are only two positional isomers of butanol, and three of pentanol or hexanol.

===Symmetry breaking by substitutions===
Once a substitution is made on a parent molecule, its structural symmetry is usually reduced, meaning that atoms that were formerly equivalent may no longer be so. Thus substitution of two or more equivalent atoms by the same element may generate more than one positional isomer.

The classical example is the derivatives of benzene. Its six hydrogens are all structurally equivalent, and so are the six carbons; because the structure is not changed if the atoms are permuted in ways that correspond to flipping the molecule over or rotating it by multiples of 60 degrees. Therefore, replacing any hydrogen by chlorine yields only one chlorobenzene. However, with that replacement, the atom permutations that moved that hydrogen are no longer valid. Only one permutation remains, that corresponds to flipping the molecule over while keeping the chlorine fixed. The five remaining hydrogens then fall into three different equivalence classes: the one opposite to the chlorine is a class by itself (called the &quot;para&quot; position), the two closest to the chlorine form another class (&quot;ortho&quot;), and the remaining two are the third class (&quot;meta&quot;). Thus a second substitution of hydrogen by chlorine can yield three positional isomers: 1,2- or &quot;ortho&quot;-, 1,3- or &quot;meta&quot;-, and 1,4- or &quot;para&quot;-dichlorobenzene.

For the same reason, there is only one phenol (hydroxybenzene), but three benzenediols; and one toluene (methylbenzene), but three toluols, and three xylenes.

On the other hand, the second replacement (by the same substituent) may preserve or even increase the symmetry of the molecule, and thus may preserve or reduce the number of equivalence classes for the next replacement. Thus, the four remaining hydrogens in &quot;meta&quot;-dichlorobenzene still fall into three classes, while those of &quot;ortho&quot;- fall into two, and those of &quot;para&quot;- are all equivalent again. Still, some of these 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 substitutions end up yielding the same structure, so there are only three structurally distinct trichlorobenzenes: 1,2,3-, 1,2,4-, and 1,3,5-.

If the substituents at each step are different, there will usually be more structural isomers. Xylenol, which is benzene with one hydroxyl substituent and two methyl substituents, has a total of 6 isomers:

==Isomer enumeration and counting==
Enumerating or counting structural isomers in general is a difficult problem, since one must take into account several bond types (including delocalized ones), cyclic structures, and structures that cannot possibly be realized due to valence or geometric constraints, and non-separable tautomers.

For example, there are nine structural isomers with molecular formula C3H6O having different bond connectivities. Seven of them are air-stable at room temperature, and these are given in the table below.

Two structural isomers are the enol tautomers of the carbonyl isomers (propionaldehyde and acetone), but these are not stable.

<text>In stereochemistry, stereoisomerism, or spatial isomerism, is a form of isomerism in which molecules have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space. This contrasts with structural isomers, which share the same molecular formula, but the bond connections or their order differs. By definition, molecules that are stereoisomers of each other represent the same structural isomer.

==Enantiomers==

Enantiomers, also known as optical isomers, are two stereoisomers that are related to each other by a reflection: they are mirror images of each other that are non-superposable. Human hands are a macroscopic analog of this. Every stereogenic center in one has the opposite configuration in the other. Two compounds that are enantiomers of each other have the same physical properties, except for the direction in which they rotate polarized light and how they interact with different enantiomers of other compounds. As a result, different enantiomers of a compound may have substantially different biological effects. Pure enantiomers also exhibit the phenomenon of optical activity and can be separated only with the use of a chiral agent. In nature, only one enantiomer of most chiral biological compounds, such as amino acids (except glycine, which is achiral), is present. Enantiomers differ by the direction they rotate polarized light: the amount of a chiral compound&#x27;s optical rotation in the (+) direction is equal to the amount of its enantiomer&#x27;s rotation in the (–) direction.

==Diastereomers==

Diastereomers are stereoisomers not related through a reflection operation. They are not mirror images of each other. These include meso compounds, &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomers, E-Z isomers, and non-enantiomeric optical isomers. Diastereomers seldom have the same physical properties. In the example shown below, the meso form of tartaric acid forms a diastereomeric pair with both levo- and dextro-tartaric acids, which form an enantiomeric pair.

The - and - labeling of the isomers above is not the same as the &quot;d&quot;- and &quot;l&quot;- labeling more commonly seen, explaining why these may appear reversed to those familiar with only the latter naming convention.

A Fischer projection can be used to differentiate between L- and D- molecules Chirality (chemistry). For instance, by definition, in a Fischer projection the penultimate carbon of D-sugars are depicted with hydrogen on the left and hydroxyl on the right. L-sugars will be shown with the hydrogen on the right and the hydroxyl on the left.

The other refers to Optical rotation, when looking at the source of light, the rotation of the plane of polarization may be either to the right (dextrorotary — d-rotary, represented by (+), clockwise), or to the left (levorotary — l-rotary, represented by (−), counter-clockwise) depending on which stereoisomer is dominant. For instance, sucrose and camphor are d-rotary whereas cholesterol is l-rotary.

==Cis–trans and E–Z isomerism==
Stereoisomerism about double bonds arises because rotation about the double bond is restricted, keeping the substituents fixed relative to each other. If the two substituents on at least one end of a double bond are the same, then there is no stereoisomer and the double bond is not a stereocenter, e.g. propene, CH3CH=CH2 where the two substituents at one end are both H.

Traditionally, double bond stereochemistry was described as either &quot;cis&quot; (Latin, on this side) or &quot;trans&quot; (Latin, across), in reference to the relative position of substituents on either side of a double bond. A simple example of &quot;cis&quot;–&quot;trans&quot; isomerism is the 1,2-disubstituted ethenes, like the dichloroethene (C2H2Cl2) isomers shown below.

Molecule I is &quot;cis&quot;-1,2-dichloroethene and molecule II is &quot;trans&quot;-1,2-dichloroethene. Due to occasional ambiguity, IUPAC adopted a more rigorous system wherein the substituents at each end of the double bond are assigned priority based on their atomic number. If the high-priority substituents are on the same side of the bond, it is assigned Z (Ger. &quot;zusammen&quot;, together). If they are on opposite sides, it is E (Ger. &quot;entgegen&quot;, opposite). Since chlorine has a larger atomic number than hydrogen, it is the highest-priority group. Using this notation to name the above pictured molecules, molecule I is (&quot;Z&quot;)-1,2-dichloroethene and molecule II is (&quot;E&quot;)-1,2-dichloroethene. It is not the case that Z and &quot;cis&quot;, or E and &quot;trans&quot;, are always interchangeable. Consider the following fluoromethylpentene:

The proper name for this molecule is either &quot;trans&quot;-2-fluoro-3-methylpent-2-ene because the alkyl groups that form the backbone chain (i.e., methyl and ethyl) reside across the double bond from each other, or (&quot;Z&quot;)-2-fluoro-3-methylpent-2-ene because the highest-priority groups on each side of the double bond are on the same side of the double bond. Fluoro is the highest-priority group on the left side of the double bond, and ethyl is the highest-priority group on the right side of the molecule.

The terms &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; are also used to describe the relative position of two substituents on a ring; &quot;cis&quot; if on the same side, otherwise &quot;trans&quot;.

==Conformers==
Conformational isomerism is a form of isomerism that describes the phenomenon of molecules with the same structural formula but with different shapes due to rotations about one or more bonds. Different conformations can have different energies, can usually interconvert, and are very rarely isolatable. For example, there exists a variety of Cyclohexane conformations (which cyclohexane is an essential intermediate for the synthesis of nylon–6,6) including a &quot;chair conformation&quot; where four of the carbon atoms form the &quot;seat&quot; of the chair, one carbon atom is the &quot;back&quot; of the chair, and one carbon atom is the &quot;foot rest&quot;; and a &quot;boat conformation&quot;, the boat conformation represents the energy maximum on a conformational itinerary between the two equivalent chair forms; however, it does not represent the transition state for this process, because there are lower-energy pathways. The conformational inversion of substituted cyclohexanes is a very rapid process at room temperature, with a half-life of 0.00001 seconds.

There are some molecules that can be isolated in several conformations, due to the large energy barriers between different conformations. 2,2&#x27;,6,6&#x27;-Tetrasubstituted biphenyls can fit into this latter category.

==Anomers==
Anomerism is an identity for single bonded ring structures where &quot;cis&quot; or &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; or &quot;E&quot; (geometric isomerism) needs to name the substitutions on a carbon atom that also displays the identity of chirality; so anomers have carbon atoms that have geometric isomerism and optical isomerism (enantiomerism) on one or more of the carbons of the ring. Anomers are named &quot;alpha&quot; or &quot;axial&quot; and &quot;beta&quot; or &quot;equatorial&quot; when substituting a cyclic ring structure that has single bonds between the carbon atoms of the ring for example, a hydroxyl group, a methyl hydroxyl group, a methoxy group or another pyranose or furanose group which are typical single bond substitutions but not limited to these. Axial geometric isomerism will be perpendicular (90 degrees) to a reference plane and equatorial will be 120 degrees away from the axial bond or deviate 30 degrees from the reference plane.

==Atropisomers==

Atropisomers are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the steric strain barrier to rotation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers.

==More definitions==
* A configurational stereoisomer is a stereoisomer of a reference molecule that has the opposite configuration at a stereocenter (e.g., R- vs S- or E- vs Z-). This means that configurational isomers can be interconverted only by breaking covalent bonds to the stereocenter, for example, by inverting the configurations of some or all of the stereocenters in a compound.
* An epimer is a diastereoisomer that has the opposite configuration at only one of the stereocenters.

==Le Bel-van&#x27;t Hoff rule==
Le Bel-van&#x27;t Hoff rule states that for a structure with &quot;n&quot; asymmetric carbon atoms, there is a maximum of 2&quot;n&quot; different stereoisomers possible. As an example, -glucose is an aldohexose and has the formula C6H12O6. Four of its six carbon atoms are stereogenic, which means -glucose is one of 24=16 possible stereoisomers.

<text>Sylvia Rosalind Pleadwell Sayer, Lady Sayer (6 March 1904 – 4 January 2000), was a passionate conservationist and environmental campaigner on behalf of Dartmoor, an area of mostly granite moorland in Devon in the south-west of England. She was chairman of the Dartmoor Preservation Association from 1951 to 1973, and remained deeply involved with the organisation until her death.

==Biography==

Sayer&#x27;s grandfather was Robert Burnard (1848–1920), who with Sabine Baring-Gould performed the first scientific excavations of ancient monuments on Dartmoor, including Grimspound; and who was one of the founding members in 1883 of the Dartmoor Preservation Association. He leased Huccaby House, on the West Dart River, near Hexworthy, from the Duchy of Cornwall and Sayer used to visit as a child.

Her mother was Olive Louise Munday (born Burnard; 1873–1960), Robert Burnard&#x27;s eldest daughter. Her father was the Principal Medical Officer at the Naval Hospital School in Greenwich. She attended Princess Helena College in Ealing, and then the Central School of Art in London. In 1925 she married Guy Sayer, who was a midshipman in the Royal Navy, and they spent some time in China. Three years later they bought Old Middle Cator, a dilapidated Dartmoor longhouse about two miles west of the village of Widecombe-in-the-Moor in Dartmoor. They had twin sons, Geoffrey and Oliver, born in 1930, and until World War Two the family travelled widely to meet the needs of Guy&#x27;s navy career. After VE Day, Guy was posted to the Far East and Sylvia settled at Cator and became interested in local politics, at first as a parish councillor for Widecombe, then as a Rural District Councillor and a member of the Dartmoor Sub-Committee of Devon County Council.

Lady Sayer acquired her title in 1959 when her husband was knighted on his retirement as the vice-admiral commanding the Reserve Fleet. After his retirement he spent much of his time helping his wife with her conservation work. She was chairman of the Dartmoor Preservation Association between 1951 and 1973, and after that, as its patron, she continued to attend virtually every meeting of its executive committee until 1999.

She lived at Cator almost until her death, moving to a nursing home in Chagford two weeks before. On 10 February 2000 a service of celebration for her life was held in the parish church of Widecombe-in-the-Moor. It was attended by over 300 people, including representatives of the Dartmoor National Park Authority, the Association of National Park Authorities, the Council for National Parks, the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), the Ramblers&#x27; Association, and the Duchy of Cornwall.

==Conservation work==
Sayer was described in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper in 1971 as &quot;a militant conservationist, who is a full-time thorn in the sides of those authorities and others who want to flood, fence, dig up, knock down and otherwise damage the Dartmoor national park.&quot; Crispin Gill wrote about her in his introduction to &quot;Dartmoor – A New Study&quot; published in 1970 as having &quot;roused the conscience of a [vast] number of people&quot; and he described her as an indefatigable worker with an enormous knowledge; he also referred to Henry Slesser&#x27;s description of her as &quot;the shield of the moor&quot;.

She regularly wrote letters to newspapers, both local and national, about matters related to Dartmoor. In her first published letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, in 1948, she expressed concerns about local authorities (specifically Devon County Council) seeking to subvert the implementation of Arthur Hobhouse&#x27;s recommendations for the creation of national parks by demanding that they retain their own planning powers. She noted that local authorities had been unable to control development by Government departments in areas such as Dartmoor, referring to the 32,800 acres held by the Admiralty and War Department and the 3,763 acres that had been taken by the Forestry Commission. She also referred to Dartmoor&#x27;s uniqueness in that most of it was owned by the Duchy of Cornwall which, as a department of the Crown, could basically do what it liked with its land. She urged that control of the soon-to-be-formed National Parks should be at the highest possible level within the Government so there would be a chance of exercising control over the Duchy and other Government departments.

The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 created the National Parks Commission whose first chairman was Sir Patrick Duff. Ten National Parks were created in the 1950s under this Act – Dartmoor National Park was the fourth to be created, in October 1951. It was administered by Dartmoor National Park Authority which was a special committee of Devon County Council and subsidiary to the County Planning Committee which could veto its recommendations. Sayer was a member of the committee from its formation, but she resigned in 1957 in protest at its failure to protect the moor as she would wish.

===TV mast===

As chairman of the Dartmoor Preservation Association (DPA), Sayer was heavily involved in all that organisation&#x27;s fights for what it saw as conservation issues. The first of these was against the proposed installation of a television transmitting mast on North Hessary Tor in the centre of the moor. When the Dartmoor Standing Committee voted in June 1952 to approve the application, Sayer complained that it had relied on the casting vote of the chairman in the absence of three members who would have voted against.

Continued objection from Sayer and the DPA, and the CPRE, led to a public enquiry which took place in September 1953. Sir Patrick Duff, the National Parks Commission chairman, was well briefed by Sayer and at the enquiry his case was mainly based on the damage the mast would do to the scenery of the moor. Although congratulatory letters were passed between all the main objectors after the enquiry, the ministry granted the planning application in January 1954, though with some minor provisos to minimise the impact. Although Duff had failed to stop the installation of the mast, Sayer rewarded him for his efforts with a painting of North Hessary Tor saying it was &quot;almost the last representation of that landscape that can be made while it is still unshadowed and unspoiled&quot;.

===The military===

From 1955 onwards Sayer kept up a correspondence about the military roads that lead across the northern moor from Okehampton Camp.

In 1966 she and her husband deliberately interrupted live-firing exercises on Dartmoor&#x27;s Royal Marines firing range to inspect and photograph any damage done to a prehistoric stone row. In February 1967 she disrupted a large-scale mock battle at Ringmoor Down that involved low-flying helicopters. She told the press that she did this to exercise her rights and to ensure that no damage was caused to ancient monuments, pointing out that the public could not be excluded from the area involved because it was not a firing area, and that sheep and ponies had been frightened away as the helicopters converged – &quot;it could have been pony trekkers and hikers and might have resulted in a serious accident&quot;, she said.

===Reservoirs===
In the late 1960s and early 1970s she was involved, as DPA chairman, with the disputes over the proposed construction of two new reservoirs on Dartmoor. The largest, which was to supply Plymouth, was known as &quot;Swincombe&quot; after the small River Swincombe that flows through Foxtor Mires, the proposed site of the reservoir. The proposal was eventually rejected in December 1970 at the Bill&#x27;s committee stage, and a reservoir known as Roadford Lake was built west of the moor near the village of Broadwoodwidger instead.

However, the Meldon Reservoir on the north-west edge of the moor was passed, despite claims that the water would be poisoned by arsenic and lead because of the presence of three disused mines and their spoil heaps in the area to be flooded. The dam was built in 1972, and in that year Sayer wrote a 62-page booklet entitled &quot;The Meldon Story&quot; that was published by the DPA. After expounding at length all the arguments made against building a dam at Meldon and in favour of an alternative site at Gorhuish, and the responses from the establishment, it ended with this statement:
===China clay workings===

Following these efforts, she concentrated on the two companies involved in the extraction of china clay in the south west of the moor. They had permission dating from 1951 to expand their pits and tips. Shaugh Moor is an adjacent area that is rich in ancient monuments and it was there that the companies planned to tip the vast quantities of spoil that is generated from clay extraction. At the time the area became known as &quot;Area Y&quot;, from an explanatory diagram that Sayer had drawn. The activism culminated in an adjournment debate in the House of Commons in which Janet Fookes, a Plymouth MP, argued against irreparably damaging the ancient landscape. In June 1978, the two companies agreed to share their waste tips, as Sayer had recommended, saving Shaugh Moor.

===Okehampton bypass===
In the 1970s there were plans to create a bypass for the A30 road around the town of Okehampton on the northern edge of Dartmoor. Two alternative routes were proposed: a northern one through agricultural land, or a southern one which would encroach on the National Park. After a public enquiry was held in 1979 and 1980 arguments continued for over five years with Sayer vigorously opposing the route through the moor. The matter was finally settled when the southern route was approved in December 1985 by the House of Lords. After the decision had been made, Sayer wrote a letter to Peter Bottomley, the then Minister of Transport that included the following extract:

===Other===
She opposed proposals to build a new Dartmoor Prison at Princetown in the centre of the moor in 1959. In the 1960s she complained about off-road car parking, and the poor treatment of Dartmoor ponies by those who only keep them for the subsidies they can obtain.

In 1983 she refused an invitation from the Prince of Wales to attend the launch of the Duchy of Cornwall&#x27;s management plan for Dartmoor, since it allowed for a continuance of military usage. She was also one of a deputation who met the Prince in 1990 to explain to him why they thought he should not renew the military licences for a further term. However, the licences were renewed that year until 2011.

==Legacy==

The DPA set up a Lady Sayer Land Purchase Fund after her retirement as chairman in 1973. It was used in 1984 to purchase 32 acres of land at Sharpitor, near Burrator Reservoir, in celebration of the successful fight against the Swincombe reservoir. As of March 2013 the fund held about £29,400.

On the centenary of her birth in 2004 John Bainbridge, the then chief executive of the DPA, revealed plans to memorialise Sayer by organising annual walks to some part of Dartmoor that she had saved, and also by holding an annual Sylvia Sayer lecture given by a prominent speaker.

Writing in 2009 in &quot;Dartmoor – A Statement of its Time&quot;, one of the New Naturalist series of books, Professor Ian Mercer (former Chief Officer of the Dartmoor National Park Authority), said of Sayer:
