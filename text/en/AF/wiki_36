<text>Rockall () is an uninhabitable granite islet in the North Atlantic Ocean. The United Kingdom claims that Rockall lies within its territorial sea and is part of its territory, but this claim is not recognised by Ireland. It and the nearby skerries of Hasselwood Rock and Helen&#x27;s Reef are the only emergent parts of the Rockall Plateau. The rock was formed by magmatism as part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province during the Paleogene.

It is west of Soay, St Kilda, Scotland; northwest of Tory Island, Ireland; and south of Iceland.
The nearest permanently inhabited place is North Uist, an island in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, to the east.

The United Kingdom claimed Rockall in 1955 and incorporated it as a part of Scotland in 1972. The UK does not make a claim to an extended exclusive economic zone (EEZ) based on Rockall, as it has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which says that &quot;rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf&quot;. However, such features are entitled to a territorial sea extending . Ireland&#x27;s position is that Rockall does not even generate a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea for the United Kingdom owing to the UK&#x27;s uncertain title to Rockall. Ireland does not recognise the UK&#x27;s claim, although it has never sought to claim sovereignty of Rockall for itself. The consistent position of successive Irish governments has been that Rockall and similar rocks and skerries have no significance for establishing legal claims to mineral rights in the adjacent seabed or to fishing rights in the surrounding seas.

==Etymology==
The origin and meaning of the islet&#x27;s name &quot;Rockall&quot; is uncertain. The Scottish Gaelic name for the islet, , may derive from an Old Norse name that may contain the element , meaning &#x27;mountain&#x27;. Coates has suggested that the name is from the Norse , meaning &#x27;foaming sea&#x27;, and , meaning &#x27;bald head&#x27;—a word which appears in other placenames in Scandinavian-speaking areas. Another idea is that it derives from the Gaelic , meaning &#x27;skerry of roaring&#x27; or &#x27;sea rock of roaring&#x27; (although can also be translated as &#x27;tearing&#x27; or &#x27;ripping&#x27;).

The Dutch mapmakers Petrus Plancius and , show an island called &quot;Rookol&quot; northwest of Ireland on their &quot;Map of New France and the Northern Atlantic Ocean&quot; (Amsterdam, ). The first literary reference to the island, which is called &quot;Rokol&quot;, is found in Martin Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Late Voyage to St. Kilda&quot;, published in 1698. This book gives an account of a voyage to the archipelago of St Kilda, and Martin states: &quot;... and from it lies Rokol, a small rock to the westward of St Kilda; the inhabitants of this place call it &quot;Rokabarra&quot;.&quot;

The name is also used in Scottish Gaelic folklore for a mythical rock which is supposed to appear three times, its last appearance being at the end of the world: &quot;&quot;. (&#x27;When Rocabarra returns, the world will likely come to be destroyed&#x27;).

Rockall&#x27;s name has also been used in Irish mythology; one story describes how legendary giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn McCool) scooped up a chunk of Ireland to fling at a Scottish rival. It instead missed and landed in the Irish Sea – the pebble left behind formed Rockall, while the clump became the Isle of Man and the void left behind filled with water and eventually became Lough Neagh.

==History==

The rock has been noted in written records since the late 16th century. In the 20th century, its location became relevant due to potential oil and fishing rights that might accrue to a nation recognised as having a legitimate claim to it.

In 1955 the British landed on Rockall and claimed it for the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom formally annexed the islet in 1972. According to Ian Mitchell, Rockall was &quot;terra nullius&quot; (owned by no one) until the 1955 British claim was made.

Rockall gives its name to one of the sea areas named in the shipping forecast provided by the British Meteorological Office.

Rockall has been a point of interest for adventurers and amateur radio operators, who have variously landed on or briefly occupied the islet. Fewer than 20 individuals have ever been confirmed to have landed on Rockall, and the longest known continuous occupation is 45 days (achieved in 2014 by a solo person). In a House of Commons debate in 1971, William Ross, Labour MP for Kilmarnock, said: &quot;More people have landed on the moon than have landed on Rockall&quot;

===Recorded visits to Rockall===

The earliest recorded date of landing on the island is often given as 8 July 1810, when a Royal Navy officer named Basil Hall led a small landing party from the frigate to the summit. However, research by James Fisher (see below), in the log of &quot;Endymion&quot; and elsewhere, indicates that the actual date for this first landing was on Sunday 8 September 1811.

The landing party left &quot;Endymion&quot; for the rock by boat. Whilst there, &quot;Endymion&quot;, which was taking depth measurements around Rockall, lost visual contact with the rock as a haze descended. The ship drifted away, leaving the landing party stranded. The expedition made a brief attempt to return to the ship, but could not find the frigate in the haze, and soon gave up and returned to Rockall. After the haze became a fog, the lookout sent to the top of Rockall spotted the ship again, but it turned away from Rockall before the expedition in their boats reached it. Finally, just before sunset, the frigate was again spotted from the top of Rockall, and the expedition was able to get back on board. The crew of &quot;Endymion&quot; reported that they had been searching for five or six hours, firing their cannon every ten minutes. Hall related this experience and other adventures in a book entitled &quot;Fragment of Voyages and Travels Including Anecdotes of a Naval Life&quot;.

The next landing, in the summer of 1862, was by a Mr Johns of whilst the ship was making a survey of the sea bed prior to the laying of a transatlantic telegraph cable. Johns managed to gain foothold on the island, but failed to reach the summit.

==== British annexation ====
On 18 September 1955, Rockall was annexed by the British Crown when Lieutenant-Commander Desmond Scott RN, Sergeant Brian Peel RM, Corporal AA Fraser RM, and James Fisher (a civilian naturalist and former Royal Marine), were winched onto the island by a Royal Navy helicopter from (coincidentally named after the man who first charted the island). The annexation of Rockall was announced by the Admiralty on 21 September 1955.

The expedition team cemented in a brass plaque on Hall&#x27;s Ledge and hoisted the Union Flag to stake the UK&#x27;s claim. The inscription on the plaque read:
 It was the final territorial expansion of the British empire.

The initial incentive for the annexation was the test-firing of the UK&#x27;s first guided nuclear weapon, the American-made Corporal missile. The missile was to be launched from South Uist and sent over the North Atlantic. The Ministry of Defence was concerned that the unclaimed island would provide an opportunity for the Soviet Union to spy on the test. Consequently, in April 1955 an order was issued to the Admiralty to seize the island and declare UK sovereignty, lest it become an outpost for foreign observers.

On 7 November 1955, J. Abrach Mackay, an 84-year- old local councillor and member of the Clan Mackay, made a protest about the annexation; he declared: &quot;My old father, God rest his soul, claimed that island for the Clan of Mackay in 1846 and I now demand that the Admiralty hand it back. It&#x27;s no&#x27; theirs.&quot; The British Government ignored the protest.

In 1971, Captain T. R. Kirkpatrick RE led the landing party on a government expedition named &quot;Operation Top Hat&quot; that was mounted from to establish that the rock was part of the United Kingdom and to prepare the islet for the installation of a light beacon. The landing party included Royal Engineers, Royal Marines and civilian members from the Institute of Geological Sciences in London. The party was landed by winch line from the Wessex 5 helicopters of the Royal Naval Air Services Commando Headquarters Squadron, commanded by Lt Cmdr Neil Foster RN. As well as collecting samples of the aegirine granite, &quot;rockallite&quot;, for later analysis in London, the top of the rock was blown off using a newly developed blasting technique, precision pre-splitting. This created a level area that was drilled to take the anchorages for the light beacon that was installed the following year. Two phosphor bronze plates were chased into the wall above Hall&#x27;s Ledge, each secured by four 80-tonne rock-anchor bolts; there was no evidence of the brass plate installed in 1955.

Establishing that the rock is part of the United Kingdom and its development as a light beacon facilitated the incorporation of the island into the District of Harris in the County of Inverness under the Island of Rockall Act 1972. It would have reinforced the UK Government&#x27;s claim with regard to seabed rights in the area at the time.

In 1978, eight members of the Dangerous Sports Club, including David Kirke, one of its founders, held a cocktail party on the island, allegedly leaving with the plaque.

Former SAS member and survival expert Tom McClean decided to live on the island from 26 May 1985 to 4 July 1985 to affirm the UK&#x27;s claim to the islet.

==== Waveland ====
In 1997, three members of the environmentalist organisation Greenpeace occupied the islet for 42 days, calling it Waveland, to protest against oil exploration. Greenpeace declared the island to be a &quot;new Global State&quot; (as a spoof micronation) and offered citizenship to anyone willing to take their pledge of allegiance. The British Government&#x27;s response was to state that &quot;Rockall is British territory. It is part of Scotland and anyone is free to go there and can stay as long as they please&quot; and otherwise ignore them. The 1955 plaque was unscrewed and refixed back to front, and subsequently it disappeared.

==== Recent visits ====
In June 2005 the first amateur radio (ham radio) activation of Rockall took place when the club station MS0IRC/P was set up and operated for a few hours on HF frequencies before they had to close down due to approaching bad weather. The Islands on the Air number EU-189 was issued to Rockall as a result of this activation.

In 2010, it was revealed that the plaque had gone missing. Andy Strangeway, a British adventurer, announced his intention to land on the island and affix a replacement plaque in June 2010. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, the local authority for Rockall, approved planning permission for the plaque. The 2010 expedition was cancelled, and Strangeway did not replace the plaque.

In October 2011 a group of amateur radio operators from Belgium travelled by ship to Rockall. Several of them climbed up the rocks and set up a radio station for some hours. They stayed overnight on top of the island. Radio contacts to all over the world were made using HF frequencies under the call sign &quot;MM0RAI/P&quot;.

In 2013 an occupation of the island by explorer Nick Hancock to raise money for the charity Help for Heroes was planned. The challenge was to land on Rockall and survive solo for 60 days. On 31 May 2013, Hancock, and a TV crew from BBC&#x27;s &quot;The One Show&quot;, sailed to the islet aboard &quot;Orca III&quot;, and he unsuccessfully attempted to land and survive on the islet, having landed for the first time the previous year on a reconnaissance expedition which coincided with Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The weather conditions at the time &quot;were not favourable&quot; according to a Maritime and Coastguard Agency official. Subsequently, Hancock postponed his challenge until 2014. On 5 June 2014 Hancock landed on Rockall to begin his 60-day survival attempt. Despite being forced to cut his 60-day goal short after losing supplies in a storm, Hancock did remain on the island for 45 days, beating McClean&#x27;s occupancy record by five days.

In May 2023 Cam Cameron, a science teacher and former Gordon Highlander, began an attempt to stay 60 days on Rockall to raise funds for military charities. He was accompanied to the rock by a radio operator, Adrian Styles, and Bulgarian mountaineer Emil Bergmann, both of whom planned to stay with him for a week and then leave. The group landed on Rockall on 30 May, having sailed from Inverkip on the Firth of Clyde. The attempt ended after 30 days when deteriorating weather conditions meant Cameron had to be rescued by HM Coastguard.

=== Circumnavigations ===
The &quot;Round Rockall&quot; sailing race, sponsored by Galway Bay Sailing Club, runs from Galway, Ireland, around Rockall and back. It was held in 2012 to coincide with the finish of the 2011–12 Volvo Ocean Race around the world.

The 2015–2016 Clipper Round the World Yacht Race race 12 from New York to Derry was extended around Rockall despite previous promises to crew from Sir Robin Knox-Johnston that this would not happen again after the race to Danang. In July, 2022, the 2019–2020 Clipper Round the world race (delayed for 2 years by COVID) was again extended on Leg 8 to go around Rockall before completing the leg at the mouth of the River Foyle in Ireland. The fleet had crossed the Atlantic in record time, and the City docks in Derry had no room for the fleet of 11 boats to berth. The race organizers sent the fleet around Rockall in order to extend the leg by approximately one day&#x27;s sailing time to clear the docks in Derry.

In 2017, the Safehaven Marine team led by Frank Kowalski set a world record for the Long Way Round Circumnavigation of Ireland via Rockall island. The Barracuda-style naval patrol, search and rescue vessel, &quot;Thunder Child&quot;, completed the route in 34 hours, 1 minute, and 47 seconds. Set in an anti-clockwise direction, the new record – the first of its kind – is now subject to ratification by Irish Sailing and the Union Internationale Motonautique, the world governing board for all powerboat activity.

==Geography==
Rockall is one of the few pinnacles of the surrounding Helen&#x27;s Reef; it is located west of the uninhabited islet of Soay, St Kilda, Scotland, and northwest of Tory Island, County Donegal, Ireland. Its location was precisely determined by Nick Hancock during his 2014 expedition. The surrounding elevated seabed is called the Rockall Bank, lying directly south from an area known as the Rockall Plateau. It is separated from the Outer Hebrides by the Rockall Trough, itself located within the Rockall Basin (also known as the &quot;Hatton Rockall Basin&quot;).

In 1956 the British scientist James Fisher referred to the island as &quot;the most isolated small rock in the oceans of the world&quot;. The neighbouring Hasselwood Rock and several other pinnacles of the surrounding Helen&#x27;s Reef are smaller, at half the size of Rockall or less, and equally remote, but those formations are legally not islands or points on land, as they are often submerged completely, only revealed momentarily above certain types of ocean surface waves.

Rockall is about wide and long at its base and rises sheer to a height of . It is often washed over by large storm waves, particularly in winter. There is a small ledge of , known as Hall&#x27;s Ledge, from the summit on the rock&#x27;s western face. It is the only named geographical location on the rock.
The nearest point on land from Rockall is , east at the uninhabited Scottish island of Soay in the St Kilda archipelago. The nearest inhabited area lies east at Hirta, the largest island in the St. Kilda group, which is populated intermittently at a single military base. The nearest permanently inhabited settlement is west of the headland of Aird an Rùnair, near the crofting township of Hogha Gearraidh on the island of North Uist at . North Uist is part of &quot;Na h-Eileanan Siar&quot; council area of Scotland.

The exact position of Rockall and the size and shape of the Rockall Bank were first charted in 1831 by Captain A. T. E. Vidal, a Royal Navy surveyor. The first scientific expedition to Rockall was led by Miller Christy in 1896 when the Royal Irish Academy sponsored a study of the flora and fauna. They chartered the &quot;Granuaile&quot;.

A detailed underwater mapping of the area around Rockall undertaken in 2011–2012 by Marine Scotland showed that Rockall itself is a minor pinnacle, whilst Helen&#x27;s Reef extends in a sweeping arc of fissures and ridges to the north-west of the islet. Between the islet and Helen&#x27;s Reef is a deeper trench much used by squid fishermen.

Rockall is located in the pathway of the warming and moderating Gulf Stream. Although the rock has no weather station, the isolated position makes for an extreme maritime climate without heat or cold extremes.

==Geology==
Rockall is made of a type of peralkaline granite that is relatively rich in sodium and potassium. Within this granite are darker bands richer in iron because they contain two iron-sodium silicate minerals called aegirine and riebeckite. The darker bands are a type of granite that geologists have named &quot;rockallite&quot;, although use of this term is now discouraged.

In 1975, a mineral new to science was discovered in a rock sample from Rockall. The mineral is called bazirite, named after the chemical elements barium and zirconium. Bazirite has the chemical formula BaZrSi3O9.

Rockall forms part of the deeply eroded Rockall Igneous Centre that was formed as part of the North Atlantic Igneous Province. It was formed approximately 52 ± 8 million years ago based on rubidium–strontium dating, as part of the breakup of Laurasia. Greenland and Europe separated and the northeast Atlantic Ocean was formed between them, eventually leaving Rockall as an isolated islet.

The RV &quot;Celtic Explorer&quot; surveyed the Rockall Bank in 2003. The Irish Light Vessel &quot;Granuaile&quot; (the same name as the steamer on the RIA 1896 botany survey) was chartered by the Geological Survey of Ireland, on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to conduct a seismic survey of the Rockall Bank and the Hatton Bank in July 2004, as part of the Irish National Seabed Survey.

== Ecology ==
The island&#x27;s only permanent multicellular inhabitants are common periwinkles and other marine molluscs. Small numbers of seabirds, mainly fulmars, northern gannets, black-legged kittiwakes, and common guillemots, use the rock for resting in summer, and gannets and guillemots occasionally breed successfully if the summer is calm with no storm waves washing over the rock. In total there have been just over twenty species of seabird and six other animal species observed (including the aforementioned molluscs) on or near the islet.

Cold-water coral biogenic reefs have been identified on the wider Rockall Bank, which are contributing features for the East Rockall Bank and North-West Rockall Bank SACs.

===Discovery of new species===
In December 2013 surveys by Marine Scotland discovered four new species of animal in the sea around Rockall. These are believed to live in an area where hydrocarbons are released from the sea bed, known as a cold seep. The discovery has raised the issue of restricting some forms of fishery to protect the sea bed. The species are:
* &quot;Volutopsius scotiae&quot; Frussen, McKay &amp; Drewery, 2013 – a sea snail about long
* &quot;Thyasira scotiana&quot; Zelaya, 2009 – a clam
* &quot;Isorropodon mackayi&quot; – a clam in the order Veneroida
* &quot;Antonbruunia sociabilis&quot; sp. – a marine worm in the order Phyllodocida

==Claims and ownership==
===Ireland===

Irish claims to Rockall are based on its proximity to the Irish mainland; however, the country has never formally claimed sovereignty over the rock. Although Rockall is closer to the UK coast than to the Irish coast, Ireland does not recognise the UK&#x27;s territorial claim to Rockall, &quot;which would be the basis for a claim to a 12-mile territorial sea&quot;.

Ireland regards Rockall as irrelevant when determining the boundaries of the exclusive economic zones (EEZ) as the rock is uninhabitable and in signing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1997, the UK has agreed that &quot;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf&quot;. In 1988, Ireland and the United Kingdom signed an EEZ boundary agreement, ignoring the rock per UNCLOS. With effect from 31 March 2014, the UK and Ireland published EEZ limits which include Rockall within the UK&#x27;s EEZ.

In October 2012, the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; published a picture of the Irish Navy ship &quot;LÉ Róisín&quot; sailing past Rockall conducting routine maritime security patrols, and claimed that it was exercising Ireland&#x27;s sovereign rights over the rock.

=== United Kingdom ===

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland claims Rockall along with a territorial sea around the islet inside the country&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The UK also claims &quot;a circle of UK sovereign airspace over the islet of Rockall&quot;.

The UK claimed Rockall on 18 September 1955 when &quot;Two Royal Marines and a civilian naturalist, led by Royal Navy officer Lieutenant Commander Desmond Scott, raised a Union flag on the islet and cemented a plaque into the rock&quot;. Prior to this Rockall was legally &quot;terra nullius&quot;. The British Island of Rockall Act 1972 (c. 2) formally annexed Rockall to the United Kingdom. In May 2017, declassified documents revealed that the 1955 decision to claim the rock as UK territory was motivated by worries that it could otherwise be used by &quot;hostile agents&quot; to spy on the future South Uist missile testing range.

The UK considers the rock administratively part of the Isle of Harris. A navigational beacon was installed on the island in 1982 and the UK declared that no ship would be allowed within a radius of the rock. However, in 1988, the United Kingdom and Ireland signed an EEZ boundary agreement for which &quot;the location of Rockall was irrelevant to the determination of the boundary&quot;. In 1997, the UK ratified the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which states that &quot;Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf&quot;. This limits territorial sea claims to a radius, and therefore allows free passage in waters beyond this. Under the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999 the area around it was declared to be under the jurisdiction of Scots law rather than English law.

As the rock lies within the United Kingdom&#x27;s EEZ, the UK has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources of the area, including jurisdiction over the protection and preservation of the marine environment.

Early in January 2021, after the UK left the EU and the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into force, the &quot;Northern Celt&quot;, an Irish fishing boat based out of Greencastle, County Donegal, was ordered to leave the 12-nautical-mile zone around Rockall by officers of Marine Scotland. Since 2021, fishing licences issued by the UK to EU vessels have excluded access to the 12 nautical mile zone around Rockall. In 2023, Irish Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine Charlie McConalogue stated that this action was costing the Irish fishing industry up to €7 million per year.

== Shipping disasters ==

There have been various disasters on the neighbouring Hasselwood Rock and Helen&#x27;s Reef (the latter having been named in 1830).

* 1686 – a Spanish, French or Spanish-French ship ran aground around Rockall. Several men of the crew, Spanish and French, were able to reach St. Kilda in a pinnace and saved their lives. Some details of this event were recounted by Martin Martin in his &quot;A late voyage to St Kilda&quot;, published in 1698. The ship was perhaps a fishing vessel based in the Bay of Biscay and bound for North Atlantic cod fisheries.
* 1812 – a survey vessel &quot;Leonidas&quot; foundered on Helen&#x27;s Reef.
* 1824 – Brigantine &quot;Helen&quot; of Dundee, bound for Quebec, foundered on Helen&#x27;s Reef with fatalities.
* 1904 – Danish ship SS &quot;Norge&quot; foundered on Hasselwood Rock with the loss of more than 635 of its 750 passengers. This led to a proposal by D. &amp; C. Stevenson for an unattended lightship to be moored close to the rock.

== In popular culture ==
* English poet Michael Roberts published a poem &quot;Rockall&quot; in his 1939 collection, &quot;Orion Marches&quot;. The poem describes a shipwrecked traveller on the rock.
* In the 1951 novel &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot; by Nicholas Monsarrat the island features as the place of the final act of HMS &quot;Saltash&quot;″s war. It is here the ship takes the surrender of two German U-boats on the last day of World War Two in Europe.
* The 1955 British landing, complete with the trappings such as hoisting the flag, caused a certain amount of popular amusement, with some seeing it as a sort of farcical end to imperial expansion. The satirists Flanders and Swann sang a successful piece entitled &quot;Rockall&quot;, playing on the similarity of the word to the vulgar expression &#x27;fuck all&#x27;, meaning &quot;nothing&quot;: &quot;The fleet set sail for Rockall, Rockall, Rockall, To free the isle of Rockall, From fear of foreign foe. We sped across the planet, To find this lump of granite, One rather startled gannet; In fact, we found Rockall.&quot;
* In &quot;The Goon Show&quot; episode &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Piano&quot; (first broadcast October 1955), Bluebottle lands on the piano as it is floating in the English Channel and cements a brass plate to it in the belief that it is Rockall. Rockall was the launching site for the prototype &quot;Jet propelled guided NAAFI&quot; in the &quot;Goon Show&quot; episode of the same name (January 1956).
* It has been suggested by several critics that Rockall is the rock that forms the setting for William Golding&#x27;s 1956 novel &quot;Pincher Martin&quot;. 
* &quot;The Master&quot;, a 1957 novel by T. H. White, is set inside Rockall. 
* David Frost, when hosting the 1962-1963 BBC satirical TV programme &quot;That Was the Week That Was&quot;, recited a list of the dwindling British colonial possessions, ending with the words, &quot;... and sweet Rockall.&quot;
* &quot;Storm Over Rockall&quot; was a 1965 novel by W. Howard Baker, part of a series of novels based on the espionage television series &quot;Danger Man&quot;.
* The Icelandic instrumental jazz-funk fusion band Mezzoforte&#x27;s track &quot;Rockall&quot; was a minor hit in Europe in 1983 and was used as a signature tune by several European radio chart shows.
* The Irish folk group The Wolfe Tones made Rockall the subject of their 1976 song &quot;Rock on, Rockall&quot;, which asserted an Irish claim to the island.
* ‘Ether’, the opening track of the English post-punk band Gang of Four&#x27;s 1979 debut album, &quot;Entertainment!&quot;, features the satirical line &quot;There may be oil under Rockall&quot;. The bulk of the song deals with the then ongoing Troubles in Northern Ireland and is critical of British actions there; the line alludes anticlimactically to the dispute between Ireland and the UK over Rockall.
* A club, The Rockall Club, has been established for people who have landed there.
* In series 2, episode 2, of the television series &quot;The Ambassador&quot;, &quot;Vacant Possession&quot; (first broadcast on 25 April 1999), an Irish protester lands on Rockall and claims it for his nation, sparking a diplomatic row.
* BBC Choice broadcast two series of a topical panel show titled &quot;Good Evening Rockall&quot; in which panellists put forward events to be included in a news bulletin ostensibly targeting the island. Sue Perkins hosted the second series.
* The duo and solo project of Runrig songwriters Calum and Rory MacDonald is called The Band from Rockall.
* Rockall is the only island claimed by Ireland that is not included on the course of the Round Ireland Yacht Race being excluded since the race&#x27;s inception in 1980.

<text>Roman numerals are a numeral system that originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers are written with combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet, each with a fixed integer value. The modern style uses only these seven:
The use of Roman numerals continued long after the decline of the Roman Empire. From the 14th century on, Roman numerals began to be replaced by Arabic numerals; however, this process was gradual, and the use of Roman numerals persisted in various places, including on clock faces. For instance, on the clock of Big Ben (designed in 1852), the hours from 1 to 12 are written as:

The notations and can be read as &quot;one less than five&quot; (4) and &quot;one less than ten&quot; (9), although there is a tradition favouring the representation of &quot;4&quot; as &quot;&quot; on Roman numeral clocks.

Other common uses include year numbers on monuments and buildings and copyright dates on the title screens of films and television programmes. , signifying &quot;a thousand, and a hundred less than another thousand&quot;, means 1900, so 1912 is written . For the years of the current (21st) century, indicates 2000; this year is (2025).

==Description==
Roman numerals use different symbols for each power of ten, and there is no zero symbol, in contrast with the place value notation of Arabic numerals (in which place-keeping zeros enable the same digit to represent different powers of ten).

This allows some flexibility in notation, and there has never been an official or universally accepted standard for Roman numerals. Usage varied greatly in ancient Rome and became thoroughly chaotic in medieval times. The more recent restoration of a largely &quot;classical&quot; notation has gained popularity among some, while variant forms are used by some modern writers as seeking more &quot;flexibility&quot;. Roman numerals may be considered legally binding expressions of a number, as in U.S. Copyright law (where an &quot;incorrect&quot; or ambiguous numeral may invalidate a copyright claim or affect the termination date of the copyright period).

===Standard form===
The following table displays how Roman numerals are usually written:&lt;br&gt;
 The numerals for 4 () and 9 () are written using subtractive notation, where the smaller symbol () is &quot;subtracted&quot; from the larger one (, or ), thus avoiding the clumsier and . Subtractive notation is also used for 40 (), 90 (), 400 () and 900 (). These are the only subtractive forms in standard use.

A number containing two or more decimal digits is built by appending the Roman numeral equivalent for each, from highest to lowest, as in the following examples:
*  &amp;numsp;&amp;numsp;39 = + = .
*  &amp;numsp;246 = + + = .
*  &amp;numsp;789 = + + = .
* 2,421 = + + + = .

Any missing place (represented by a zero in the place-value equivalent) is omitted, as in Latin (and English) speech:
*  &amp;numsp;160 = + = 
*  &amp;numsp;207 = + = 
* 1,009 = + = 
* 1,066 = + + = 

The largest number that can be represented in this manner is 3,999 (), but this is sufficient for the values for which Roman numerals are commonly used today, such as year numbers:
* 1776 = + + + = (the date written on the book held by the Statue of Liberty).
* 1918 = + + + = (the first year of the Spanish flu pandemic)
* 1944 = + + + = (erroneous copyright notice of the 1954 movie &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot;)
* = (this year)

Prior to the introduction of Arabic numerals in the West, ancient and medieval users of Roman numerals used various means to write larger numbers .

===Other forms===
Forms exist that vary in one way or another from the general standard represented above.

====Other additive forms====
While subtractive notation for 4, 40, and 400 (, , and ) has been the usual form since Roman times , additive notation to represent these numbers (, , and ) very frequently continued to be used, including in compound numbers like 24 (), 74 (), and 490 (). The additive forms for 9, 90, and 900 (, , and ) have also been used, although less often.

The two conventions could be mixed in the same document or inscription, even in the same numeral. For example, on the numbered gates to the Colosseum, is systematically used instead of , but subtractive notation is used for ; consequently, gate 44 is labelled .

Especially on tombstones and other funerary inscriptions, 5 and 50 have been occasionally written and instead of and , and there are instances such as and rather than or .

Modern clock faces that use Roman numerals still very often use for four o&#x27;clock but for nine o&#x27;clock, a practice that goes back to very early clocks such as the Wells Cathedral clock of the late 14th century. However, this is far from universal: for example, the clock on the Palace of Westminster tower (commonly known as Big Ben) uses a subtractive for 4 o&#x27;clock.

Several monumental inscriptions created in the early 20th century use variant forms for &quot;1900&quot; (usually written ). These vary from for 1910 as seen on Admiralty Arch, London, to the more unusual, if not unique for 1903, on the north entrance to the Saint Louis Art Museum.

====Other subtractive forms====
There are numerous historical examples of being used for 8; for example, was used by officers of the XVIII Roman Legion to write their number. The notation appears prominently on the cenotaph of their senior centurion Marcus Caelius ( – 9 AD). On the publicly displayed official Roman calendars known as Fasti, is used for the 18 days to the next Kalends, and for the 28 days in February. The latter can be seen on the sole extant pre-Julian calendar, the Fasti Antiates Maiores.
There are historical examples of other subtractive forms: for 17, for 18, for 97, for 98, and for 99. A possible explanation is that the word for 18 in Latin is literally &quot;two from twenty&quot;⁠while 98 is (two from hundred) and 99 is (one from hundred). However, the explanation does not seem to apply to and , since the Latin words for 17 and 97 were (seven ten) and (ninety seven), respectively.

The function in Microsoft Excel supports multiple subtraction modes depending on the &quot;&quot; setting. For example, the number &quot;499&quot; (usually ) can be rendered as , , or . The relevant Microsoft help page offers no explanation for this function other than to describe its output as &quot;more concise&quot;.

====Non-standard variants====
There are also historical examples of other additive and multiplicative forms, and forms which seem to reflect spoken phrases. Some of these variants may have been regarded as errors even by contemporaries.
* was how people associated with the XXII Roman Legion used to write their number. The practice may have been due to a common way to say &quot;twenty-second&quot; in Latin, namely (literally &quot;two and twentieth&quot;) rather than the &quot;regular&quot; (twenty second). Apparently, at least one ancient stonecutter mistakenly thought that the of &quot;22nd Legion&quot; stood for 18, and &quot;corrected&quot; it to .
* There are some examples of year numbers after 1000 written as two Roman numerals 1–99, e.g. 1613 as , corresponding to the common reading &quot;sixteen thirteen&quot; of such year numbers in English, or 1519 as as in French &quot;quinze-cent-dix-neuf&quot; (fifteen-hundred and nineteen), and similar readings in other languages.
* In some French texts from the 15th century and later, one finds constructions like for 99, reflecting the French reading of that number as (four-score and nineteen). Similarly, in some English documents one finds, for example, 77 written as &quot;&quot; (which could be read &quot;three-score and seventeen&quot;).
* A medieval accounting text from 1301 renders numbers like 13,573 as &quot;&quot;, that is, &quot;13×1000 + 5×100 + 3×20 + 13&quot;.
* Other numerals that do not fit the usual patterns – such as for 45, instead of the usual — may be due to scribal errors, or the writer&#x27;s lack of familiarity with the system, rather than being genuine variant usage.

====Non-numeric combinations====
As Roman numerals are composed of ordinary alphabetic characters, there may sometimes be confusion with other uses of the same letters. For example, &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;XL&quot; have other connotations in addition to their values as Roman numerals, while &quot;IXL&quot; more often than not is a gramogram of &quot;I excel&quot;, and is in any case not an unambiguous Roman numeral.

===Zero===
As a non-positional numeral system, Roman numerals have no &quot;place-keeping&quot; zeros. Furthermore, the system as used by the Romans lacked a numeral for the number zero itself (that is, what remains after 1 is subtracted from 1). The word (the Latin word meaning &quot;none&quot;) was used to represent 0, although the earliest attested instances are medieval. For instance Dionysius Exiguus used alongside Roman numerals in a manuscript from 525 AD. About 725, Bede or one of his colleagues used the letter , the initial of or of (the Latin word for &quot;nothing&quot;) for 0, in a table of epacts, all written in Roman numerals.

The use of to indicate &quot;none&quot; long survived in the historic apothecaries&#x27; system of measurement: used well into the 20th century to designate quantities in pharmaceutical prescriptions.

In later times, the Arabic numeral &quot;0&quot; has been used as a zero to open enumerations with Roman numbers. Examples include the 24-hour Shepherd Gate Clock from 1852 and tarot packs such as the 15th-century Sola Busca and the 20th century Rider–Waite packs.

===Fractions===

The base &quot;Roman fraction&quot; is , indicating . The use of (as in to indicate 7) is attested in some ancient inscriptions and also in the now rare apothecaries&#x27; system (usually in the form ): but while Roman numerals for whole numbers are essentially decimal, does not correspond to , as one might expect, but .

The Romans used a duodecimal rather than a decimal system for fractions, as the divisibility of twelve makes it easier to handle the common fractions of and than does a system based on ten . Notation for fractions other than is mainly found on surviving Roman coins, many of which had values that were duodecimal fractions of the unit . Fractions less than are indicated by a dot (·) for each &quot;twelfth&quot;, the source of the English words &quot;inch&quot; and &quot;ounce&quot;; dots are repeated for fractions up to five twelfths. Six twelfths (one half), is for &quot;half&quot;. &quot;Uncia&quot; dots were added to for fractions from seven to eleven twelfths, just as tallies were added to for whole numbers from six to nine. The arrangement of the dots was variable and not necessarily linear. Five dots arranged like (⁙) (as on the face of a die) are known as a quincunx, from the name of the Roman fraction/coin. The Latin words and are the source of the English words &quot;sextant&quot; and &quot;quadrant&quot;.

Each fraction from to had a name in Roman times; these corresponded to the names of the related coins:

Other Roman fractional notations included the following:

===Large numbers===
The Romans developed two main ways of writing large numbers, the and the , further extended in various ways in later times.

====&quot;Apostrophus&quot;====
Using the method, 500 is written as , while 1,000 is written as . This system of encasing numbers to denote thousands (imagine the s and s as parentheses) had its origins in Etruscan numeral usage.

Each additional set of and surrounding raises the value by a factor of ten: represents 10,000 and represents 100,000. Similarly, each additional to the right of raises the value by a factor of ten: represents 5,000 and represents 50,000. Numerals larger than do not occur.
* &#x27; = 500               &#x27; = 1,000
* &#x27; = 5,000         &#x27; = 10,000
* &#x27; = 50,000    &#x27; = 100,000

Sometimes (1000) is reduced to , (5,000) to ; (10,000) to ; (50,000) to ; and (100,000) to . It is likely (500) reduced to and (1000) influenced the later .

John Wallis is often credited with introducing the symbol for infinity , and one conjecture is that he based it on , since 1,000 was hyperbolically used to represent very large numbers.

====&quot;Vinculum&quot;====
Using the , conventional Roman numerals are multiplied by 1,000 by adding a &quot;bar&quot; or &quot;overline&quot;, thus:
* = 4,000
* = 25,000
The &quot;vinculum &quot;came into use in the late Republic, and it was a common alternative to the apostrophic ↀ during the Imperial era around the Roman world (M for &#x27;1000&#x27; was not in use until the Medieval period). It continued in use in the Middle Ages, though it became known more commonly as , and it appears in modern editions of classical and medieval Latin texts.

In an extension of the , a three-sided box (now sometimes printed as two vertical lines and a ) is used to multiply by 100,000, thus:
* p. = 1,332,000 paces (1,332 Roman miles).

 notation is distinct from the custom of adding an overline to a numeral simply to indicate that it is a number. Both usages can be seen on Roman inscriptions of the same period and general location, such as on the Antonine Wall.

==Origin==
The system is closely associated with the ancient city-state of Rome and the Empire that it created. However, due to the scarcity of surviving examples, the origins of the system are obscure and there are several competing theories, all largely conjectural.

===Etruscan numerals===

Rome was founded sometime between 850 and 750 BC. At the time, the region was inhabited by diverse populations of which the Etruscans were the most advanced. The ancient Romans themselves admitted that the basis of much of their civilization was Etruscan. Rome itself was located next to the southern edge of the Etruscan domain, which covered a large part of north-central Italy.

The Roman numerals, in particular, are directly derived from the Etruscan number symbols: , , , , and for 1, 5, 10, 50, and 100 (they had more symbols for larger numbers, but it is unknown which symbol represents which number). As in the basic Roman system, the Etruscans wrote the symbols that added to the desired number, from higher to lower value. Thus, the number 87, for example, would be written 50 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 = 𐌣𐌢𐌢𐌢𐌡𐌠𐌠 (this would appear as 𐌠𐌠𐌡𐌢𐌢𐌢𐌣 since Etruscan was written from right to left.)

The symbols and resembled letters of the Etruscan alphabet, but , , and did not. The Etruscans used the subtractive notation, too, but not like the Romans. They wrote 17, 18, and 19 as 𐌠𐌠𐌠𐌢𐌢, 𐌠𐌠𐌢𐌢, and 𐌠𐌢𐌢, mirroring the way they spoke those numbers (&quot;three from twenty&quot;, etc.); and similarly for 27, 28, 29, 37, 38, etc. However, they did not write 𐌠𐌡 for 4 (nor 𐌢𐌣 for 40), and wrote 𐌡𐌠𐌠, 𐌡𐌠𐌠𐌠 and 𐌡𐌠𐌠𐌠𐌠 for 7, 8, and 9, respectively.

===Early Roman numerals===
The early Roman numerals for 1, 10, and 100 were the Etruscan ones: , , and . The symbols for 5 and 50 changed from and to and at some point. The latter had flattened to (an inverted T) by the time of Augustus, and soon afterwards became identified with the graphically similar letter .

The symbol for 100 was written variously as or , and was then abbreviated to or , with (which matched the Latin letter &quot;C&quot;) finally winning out. It might have helped that &quot;C&quot; was the initial letter of , Latin for &quot;hundred&quot;.

The numbers 500 and 1000 were denoted by or overlaid with a box or circle. Thus, 500 was like a superimposed on a or , making it look like . It became or by the time of Augustus, under the graphic influence of the letter . It was later identified as the letter ; an alternative symbol for &quot;thousand&quot; was a , and half of a thousand or &quot;five hundred&quot; is the right half of the symbol, , and this may have been converted into .

The notation for 1000 was a circled or boxed : Ⓧ, , , and by Augustan times was partially identified with the Greek letter &quot;phi&quot;. Over time, the symbol changed to and . The latter symbol further evolved into , then , and eventually changed to under the influence of the Latin word &quot;mille&quot; &quot;thousand&quot;.

According to Paul Kayser, the basic numerical symbols were , , and (or ) and the intermediate ones were derived by taking half of those (half an is , half a is and half a is ). Then 𐌟 and ↆ developed as mentioned above.

===Classical Roman numerals===
The Colosseum was constructed in Rome in CE 72–80, and while the original perimeter wall has largely disappeared, the numbered entrances from (23) to (54) survive, to demonstrate that in Imperial times Roman numerals had already assumed their classical form: as largely standardised in current use. The most obvious anomaly (a common one that persisted for centuries) is the inconsistent use of subtractive notation - while is used for 40, is avoided in favour of : in fact, gate 44 is labelled .

==Use in the Middle Ages and Renaissance==
Lower case, or &quot;minuscule&quot;, letters were developed in the Middle Ages, well after the demise of the Western Roman Empire, and since that time lower-case versions of Roman numbers have also been commonly used: , , , , and so on.

Since the Middle Ages, a &quot; has sometimes been substituted for the final &quot; of a &quot;lower-case&quot; Roman numeral, such as &quot; for 3 or &quot; for 7. This &quot; can be considered a swash variant of &quot;. Into the early 20th century, the use of a final &quot;&quot; was still sometimes used in medical prescriptions to prevent tampering with or misinterpretation of a number after it was written.

Numerals in documents and inscriptions from the Middle Ages sometimes include additional symbols, which today are called &quot;medieval Roman numerals&quot;. Some simply substitute another letter for the standard one (such as &quot; for &quot;, or &quot; for &quot;), while others serve as abbreviations for compound numerals (&quot; for &quot;, or &quot; for &quot;). Although they are still listed today in some dictionaries, they are long out of use.

A superscript &quot;o&quot; (sometimes written directly above the symbol) was sometimes used as an ordinal indicator.

Chronograms, messages with dates encoded into them, were popular during the Renaissance era. The chronogram would be a phrase containing the letters , , , , , , and . By putting these letters together, the reader would obtain a number, usually indicating a particular year.

==Modern use==
By the 11th century, Arabic numerals had been introduced into Europe from al-Andalus, by way of Arab traders and arithmetic treatises. Roman numerals, however, proved very persistent, remaining in common use in the West well into the 14th and 15th centuries, even in accounting and other business records (where the actual calculations would have been made using an abacus). Replacement by their more convenient &quot;Arabic&quot; equivalents was quite gradual, and Roman numerals are still used today in certain contexts. A few examples of their current use are:
* Names of monarchs and popes, e.g. Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Pope Benedict XVI. These are referred to as regnal numbers and are usually read as ordinals; e.g. is pronounced &quot;the second&quot;. This tradition began in Europe sporadically in the Middle Ages, gaining widespread use in England during the reign of Henry VIII. Previously, the monarch was not known by numeral but by an epithet such as Edward the Confessor. Some monarchs (e.g. Charles IV of Spain, Louis XIV of France and William IV of Great Britain) seem to have preferred the use of instead of on their coinage (see illustration).
* Generational suffixes, particularly in the U.S., for people sharing the same name across generations, such as William Howard Taft IV. These are also usually read as ordinals.
* In the French Republican Calendar, initiated during the French Revolution, years were numbered by Roman numerals – from the year (1792) when this calendar was introduced to the year (1805) when it was abandoned.
* The year of production of films, television shows and other works of art within the work itself. Outside reference to the work will use regular Arabic numerals.
* Hour marks on timepieces. In this context, 4 is often written .
* The year of construction on building façades and cornerstones.
* Page numbering of prefaces and introductions of books, and sometimes of appendices and annexes, too.
* Book volume and chapter numbers, as well as the several acts within a play (e.g. Act , Scene 2).
* Sequels to some films, video games, and other works (as in &quot;Rocky II&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;).
* Outlines that use numbers to show hierarchical relationships.
* Occurrences of a recurring grand event, for instance:
** The Summer and Winter Olympic Games (e.g. the XXI Olympic Winter Games; the Games of the XXX Olympiad).
** The Super Bowl, the annual championship game of the National Football League (e.g. Super Bowl XLII; Super Bowl 50 was a one-time exception).
** WrestleMania, the annual professional wrestling event for WWE (e.g. WrestleMania XXX). This usage has also been inconsistent.

===Specific disciplines===
In astronautics, United States rocket model variants are sometimes designated by Roman numerals, e.g. Titan I, Titan II, Titan III, Saturn I, Saturn V.

In astronomy, the natural satellites or &quot;moons&quot; of the planets are designated by capital Roman numerals appended to the planet&#x27;s name. For example, Titan&#x27;s designation is Saturn .

In chemistry, Roman numerals are sometimes used to denote the groups of the periodic table, but this has officially been deprecated in favour of Arabic numerals. They are also used in the IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry, for the oxidation number of cations which can take on several different positive charges. They are also used for naming phases of polymorphic crystals, such as ice.

In education, school grades (in the sense of year-groups rather than test scores) are sometimes referred to by a Roman numeral; for example, &quot;grade &quot; is sometimes seen for &quot;grade 9&quot;.

In entomology, the broods of the thirteen- and seventeen-year periodical cicadas are identified by Roman numerals.

In graphic design, stylised Roman numerals may represent numeric values.

In law, Roman numerals are commonly used to help organize legal codes as part of an alphanumeric outline. 
* In numbering UK Acts of Parliament within a given year (a given session until 1963), local acts have lowercase Roman numerals, whereas public acts have plain Arabic numerals and personal acts have italic Arabic numerals.

In mathematics (including trigonometry, statistics, and calculus), when a graph includes negative numbers, its quadrants are named using , , , and . These quadrant names signify positive numbers on both axes, negative numbers on the x-axis, negative numbers on both axes, and negative numbers on the y-axis, respectively. The use of Roman numerals to designate quadrants avoids confusion, since Arabic numerals are used for the actual data represented in the graph.

In military unit designation, Roman numerals are often used to distinguish between units at different levels. This reduces possible confusion, especially when viewing operational or strategic level maps. In particular, army corps are often numbered using Roman numerals (for example, the American XVIII Airborne Corps or the Nazi III Panzerkorps) with Arabic numerals being used for divisions and armies.

In music, Roman numerals are used in several contexts:
* Movements are often numbered using Roman numerals.
* In Roman numeral analysis, harmonic function is identified using Roman numerals.
* Individual strings of stringed instruments, such as the violin, are often denoted by Roman numerals, with higher numbers denoting lower strings.

In pharmacy, Roman numerals were used with the now largely obsolete apothecaries&#x27; system of measurement: including to denote &quot;one half&quot; and to denote &quot;zero&quot;.

In photography, Roman numerals (with zero) are used to denote varying levels of brightness when using the Zone System.

In seismology, Roman numerals are used to designate degrees of the Mercalli intensity scale of earthquakes.

In sport the team containing the &quot;top&quot; players and representing a nation or province, a club or a school at the highest level in (say) rugby union is often called the &quot;1st &quot;, while a lower-ranking cricket or American football team might be the &quot;3rd &quot;.

In tarot, Roman numerals (with zero) are often used to denote the cards of the Major Arcana.

In Ireland, Roman numerals were used until the late 1980s to indicate the month on postage Franking. In documents, Roman numerals are sometimes still used to indicate the month to avoid confusion over day/month/year or month/day/year formats.

In theology and biblical scholarship, the Septuagint is often referred to as , as this translation of the Old Testament into Greek is named for the legendary number of its translators (&quot;septuaginta&quot; being Latin for &quot;seventy&quot;).

===Modern use in European languages other than English===
Some uses that are rare or never seen in English-speaking countries may be relatively common in parts of continental Europe and in other regions (e.g. Latin America) that use a European language other than English. For instance:

Capital or small capital Roman numerals are widely used in Romance languages to denote , e.g. the French &#x27; and the Spanish &#x27; (not &quot;&quot;) for &quot;18th century&quot;. Some Slavic and Turkic languages (especially in and adjacent to Russia) similarly favour Roman numerals (e.g. Russian , Azeri or Polish ). On the other hand, in Turkish and some Central European Slavic languages, like most Germanic languages, one writes &quot;18.&quot; (with a period) before the local word for &quot;century&quot; (e.g. Turkish , Czech ).

Mixed Roman and Arabic numerals are sometimes used in numeric representations of dates (especially in formal letters and official documents, but also on tombstones). The is written in Roman numerals, while the day is in Arabic numerals: &quot;4..1789&quot; and &quot;.4.1789&quot; both refer unambiguously to 4 June 1789.

Roman numerals are sometimes used to represent the in hours-of-operation signs displayed in windows or on doors of businesses, and also sometimes in railway and bus timetables. Monday, taken as the first day of the week, is represented by . Sunday is represented by . The hours of operation signs are tables composed of two columns where the left column is the day of the week in Roman numerals and the right column is a range of hours of operation from starting time to closing time. In the example case (left), the business opens from 10 AM to 7 PM on weekdays, 10 AM to 5 PM on Saturdays and is closed on Sundays. Note that the listing uses 24-hour time.

Roman numerals may also be used for floor numbering. For instance, apartments in central Amsterdam are indicated as 138-, with both an Arabic numeral (number of the block or house) and a Roman numeral (floor number). The apartment on the ground floor is indicated as .

In Italy, where roads outside built-up areas have kilometre signs, major roads and motorways also mark 100-metre subdivisionals, using Roman numerals from to for the smaller intervals. The sign thus marks 17.9 km.

Certain romance-speaking countries use Roman numerals to designate assemblies of their national legislatures. For instance, the composition of the Italian Parliament from 2018 to 2022 (elected in the 2018 Italian general election) is called the XVIII Legislature of the Italian Republic (or more commonly the &quot;XVIII Legislature&quot;).

A notable exception to the use of Roman numerals in Europe is in Greece, where Greek numerals (based on the Greek alphabet) are generally used in contexts where Roman numerals would be used elsewhere.

==Unicode==
The &quot;Number Forms&quot; block of the Unicode computer character set standard has a number of Roman numeral symbols in the range of code points from U+2160 to U+2188. This range includes both upper- and lowercase numerals, as well as pre-combined characters for numbers up to 12 (Ⅻ or ). One justification for the existence of pre-combined numbers is to facilitate the setting of multiple-letter numbers (such as VIII) on a single horizontal line in Asian vertical text. The Unicode standard, however, includes special Roman numeral code points for compatibility only, stating that &quot;[f]or most purposes, it is preferable to compose the Roman numerals from sequences of the appropriate Latin letters&quot;. The block also includes some symbols for large numbers, an old variant of &quot;&quot; (50) similar to the Etruscan character, the Claudian letter &quot;reversed C&quot;, etc.

<doc id="25661" wikidata="Q25177" url="?curid=25661" title="Rammstein">
<text>Rammstein (, &quot;ramming stone&quot;) is a German band formed in Berlin in 1994. The band&#x27;s lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.

After winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record demos and send them to different record labels, eventually signing with Motor Music. Working with producer Jacob Hellner, they released their debut album &quot;Herzeleid&quot; in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the band gained popularity through their live performances and the album eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful singles &quot;Engel&quot; and &quot;Du hast&quot; and the live album &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot; (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label Universal Music and released &quot;Mutter&quot; in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead single, &quot;Sonne&quot;, reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: &quot;Mein Teil&quot; and &quot;Amerika&quot;; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming their first No. 1 single.

Their fifth album, &quot;Rosenrot&quot;, was released in 2005, and the lead single, &quot;Benzin&quot;, reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album, &quot;Völkerball&quot;, was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album, &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot;, in 2009, with its lead single, &quot;Pussy&quot;, becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a controversial music video that featured hardcore pornography. The band then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years, releasing the &quot;Made in Germany&quot; greatest hits album as well as the &quot;Rammstein in Amerika&quot; and &quot;&quot; live albums. After a decade without new music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song &quot;Deutschland&quot;, which became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their untitled seventh studio album was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14 countries. While sheltering during COVID-19 lockdowns, the band spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, &quot;Zeit&quot;, which was released in April 2022.

Rammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature pyrotechnics, have contributed to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, the song &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot; forced its parent album &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; to be re-released in Germany with the song removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.

==History==

===Founding and &quot;Herzeleid&quot; (1989–1996)===

In 1989, East German guitarist Richard Kruspe escaped to West Berlin and started the band Orgasm Death Gimmick. At that time, he was heavily influenced by US music, especially of hard rock band Kiss. After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin, where Till Lindemann worked as a basket-weaver and played drums in the band First Arsch (loosely translated as &quot;First Arse&quot; or &quot;First Ass&quot;). At this time, Kruspe lived with Oliver Riedel of The Inchtabokatables and Christoph Schneider of Die Firma.

In 1992, Kruspe made his first trip to the United States with Till Lindemann and Oliver &quot;Ollie&quot; Riedel. He realized that he did not want to make US music and concentrated on creating a unique German sound. Kruspe, Riedel and Schneider started working together on a new project in 1993. Finding it difficult to write both music and lyrics, Kruspe persuaded Lindemann, whom he had overheard singing while he was working, to join the fledgling group.

The band co-existed with the members&#x27; previous projects for about a year and a half. Members would invest the money raised with Feeling B shows in new project. They recorded their first songs in a building that had been squatted by Feeling B frontman Aljoscha Rompe. A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive access to a professional recording studio for a whole week. Kruspe, Riedel, Schneider, and Lindemann entered and won the contest with a 4-track demo tape with demo versions of songs from &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, written in English. This sparked Paul Landers&#x27; attention, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein attempted to recruit Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz, who had played with Landers in Feeling B. Though initially hesitant, Lorenz eventually agreed to join the band.

Up to that point, the band was called Tempelprayers. The name Rammstein comes from an early idea of Schneider, Flake and Paul. They called themselves &quot;Rammstein-Flugschau&quot; (Rammstein Airshow) after the 1988 Ramstein air show disaster. They had that name already written inside their Robur LO during their time in Feeling B. Guitarist Paul Landers said the spelling of Ramstein with the extra &quot;m&quot; was a mistake. After the band became popular, the band members denied the connection to the air show disaster and said that their name was inspired by the giant doorstop-type devices found on old gates, called Rammsteine. The extra &quot;m&quot; in the band&#x27;s name makes it translate literally as &quot;ramming stone&quot;. In a 2019 feature, &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; explained that the band was named after one of their earliest songs, &quot;Ramstein&quot;, written after the air show disaster at the American airbase in Ramstein. According to the band, people started to refer to them as &quot;the band with the &#x27;Ramstein song&#x27;&quot; and later as the &quot;Ramstein band&quot;. Before agreeing on &quot;Rammstein&quot; name, the band also had other names in mind: Milch (milk), Erde (earth) or Mutter (mother).

Later, Rammstein was signed by Motor Music. Rammstein began to record their first studio album, &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, in March 1995 with producer Jacob Hellner. They released their first single &quot;Du riechst so gut&quot; that August and released the album in September. Throughout October, the newly minted band gathered their first few significant waves of fans while opening 15 shows across Germany for Project Pitchfork. Later in that November, they opened two shows for Clawfinger in Warsaw and Prague. In December, they headlined a 17-show tour of Germany which helped expand the fanbase they had initially established while opening for Project Pitchfork and Clawfinger. This helped to boost the band&#x27;s popularity and establish them as a credible live act. They went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single titled &quot;Seemann&quot; on 8 January. On 27 March 1996, Rammstein performed on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Hanging Out&quot; in London, their first performance in the UK. Their first major boost in popularity outside Germany came when Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor chose two Rammstein songs, &quot;Heirate mich&quot; and &quot;Rammstein&quot;, during his work as music director for the David Lynch 1997 film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. The soundtrack for the film was released in the U.S. in late 1996 and later throughout Europe in April 1997. In the middle of 1996, they headlined one tour of their own in small, sold-out venues. Rammstein went on to tour through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland from September to October 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 September called &quot;100 years of Rammstein&quot;. Guests to the concert included Moby, Bobo, and the Berlin Session Orchestra, while Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show.

===&quot;Sehnsucht&quot; and &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot; (1996–2000)===

Rammstein started recording &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. &quot;Engel&quot;, the first single from the album, was released on 1 April 1997 and reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named &quot;Engel – Fan Edition&quot;. This contained two previously unreleased songs, &quot;Feuerräder&quot; and &quot;Wilder Wein&quot;. Release of the second single from the album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; was &quot;Du hast&quot;, which hit the German single charts in August 1997 at No. 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer while &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached No. 1 in Germany after two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; and both &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; singles (&quot;Du hast&quot; and &quot;Engel&quot;) were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold-out shows throughout Europe in September and October. On 5 December 1997, they embarked on their first tour of the United States as the opening act for KMFDM. In July 1998, the band released a cover of the song &quot;Stripped&quot;, originally released by Depeche Mode in early 1986; it was included on the tribute album &quot;For the Masses&quot;, the Rammstein version obtained moderate success in Germany and Austria.

On 22–23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin, the biggest show the band had played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot;. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values Tour in September through to late October 1998. Continuing their success in the US, &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; received Gold record status there on 2 November. The band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for &quot;Best Rock Act&quot; and performed &quot;Du hast&quot; live on 12 November that year.

Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot; concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot; went to No. 2 in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999, the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively. Further popularity ensued when &quot;Du hast&quot; was included in &quot;The Matrix: Music from the Motion Picture&quot;.

===&quot;Mutter&quot; (2000–2002)===

Rammstein&#x27;s album &quot;Mutter&quot; was recorded in the south of France in May and June 2000, and mixed in Stockholm in October of that year. During December 2000, Rammstein released an MP3 version of &quot;Links 2-3-4&quot; as a teaser for their new album. 2001 was a busy year for Rammstein, as the band needed to finish off the Sehnsucht Tour ending in January and February with the band playing the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand and some concerts in Japan. January also heralded the shooting of the video for their upcoming single, &quot;Sonne&quot;, recorded in Potsdam at Babelsberger Filmstudios from 13 to 15 January 2001. The video was released on 29 January 2001. The single for &quot;Sonne&quot; was released on 12 February 2001 in Europe, featuring an instrumental version of the song, two remixes by Clawfinger and the song &quot;Adios&quot; from the upcoming album.

&quot;Mutter&quot; was released on 2 April 2001, sparking another Rammstein tour through Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. On 14 May, the second single from the album, &quot;Links 2 3 4&quot;, was released, along with a video of the single on 18 May. After a tour throughout Europe in June, the band then toured the U.S., Canada and Mexico from June to August 2001. &quot;Ich will&quot;, the third single from the album, was released on 10 September 2001 and a Tour edition of the &quot;Mutter&quot; album (the cover of which is red) was released, featuring alternative artwork and live versions of &quot;Ich will&quot;, &quot;Links 2 3 4&quot;, &quot;Sonne&quot; and &quot;Spieluhr&quot;.

From 8 to 12 January 2002, Rammstein traveled to Prague to participate in a minor scene for the film &quot;XXX&quot;. The band is seen in the opening scene, performing their song &quot;Feuer frei!&quot; in a concert. &quot;Feuer frei!&quot; was released across Europe as the first single from the &quot;XXX&quot; soundtrack on 14 October 2002. Rammstein released two remixes of the song. Furthermore, the single&#x27;s track listing included &quot;Du hast&quot; and &quot;Bück dich&quot; cover versions by Battery. The video for the single was edited by Rob Cohen and contains part of Rammstein&#x27;s performance at the beginning of the film and part snippets from the film itself.

===&quot;Reise, Reise&quot;, &quot;Rosenrot&quot;, and &quot;Völkerball&quot; (2003–2006)===

Rammstein recorded &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; (meaning &quot;journey, journey&quot;, or as a command &quot;travel, travel&quot;, but also an archaic Reveille) at the El Cortijo studio in southern Spain in November and December 2003; it was mixed at Toytown studio in Stockholm, Sweden in April and May 2004. The first single from the album was &quot;Mein Teil&quot;, released on 26 July. The video was shot in the Arena, in the Treptow district of Berlin. Outdoor shooting took place at the Deutsche Oper (Opera House) U-Bahn station on Bismarckstrasse. The director was Zoran Bihac, who also filmed the &quot;Links 2 3 4&quot; video. The video for the second single, &quot;Amerika&quot;, was filmed on 6 and 7 August 2004 in the ruins of the former cement works in Rüdersdorf, near Berlin, under the direction of Jörn Heitmann (who also directed the &quot;Ich Will&quot; music video, among others). The space suits for the Moon scenes were borrowed from Hollywood and 240 tons of ash were needed to create the Moon landscape. The video premiered on 20 August, while the single was released on 13 September.

&quot;Reise, Reise&quot; was released on 27 September 2004 and went straight into top 10 charts throughout Europe. According to the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, Rammstein were at that stage the most successful German-language band of all time. Rammstein toured Germany through November and some of December 2004, releasing the single &quot;Ohne dich&quot; on 22 November. In February 2005, Rammstein toured Europe again. By 28 February, Rammstein had played 21 concerts in front of more than 200,000 spectators in ten countries. It was on this tour that the band was faced with several lawsuits resulting from severe fire breathing accidents involving audience members. &quot;Keine Lust&quot; the fourth single from &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;, was released on 28 February 2005. From 27 May to 30 July 2005, Rammstein played music festivals across Europe. Footage from these concerts can be seen on Rammstein&#x27;s live DVD &quot;Völkerball&quot;, released in November 2006.

In August 2005, Rammstein revealed that the follow-up album to &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; would be called &quot;Rosenrot&quot;. Their first single from the album, &quot;Benzin&quot;, was released on 5 October, with its video premiere on 16 September. &quot;Rosenrot&quot; was released worldwide on 28 October. Directly following the release, the album continued the success of its predecessor, &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;, placing on top 10 charts in 20 countries. 16 December 2005 marked the release of the title track on &quot;Rosenrot&quot;. The video for &quot;Mann gegen Mann&quot; was released on 6 February 2006, with the single being released on 3 March. On 19 February 2006, Rammstein had an asteroid named after them, 110393 Rammstein.

On 17 November, the first Rammstein Live DVD since &quot;Live aus Berlin&quot; from 1998 was released. &quot;Völkerball&quot; shows concert performances by the band in England, France, Japan and Russia. The Special Edition is extended by a second DVD, which contains the documentaries &quot;Anaconda in the net&quot; by Mathilde Bonnefoy and the &quot;Making of the album Reise, Reise&quot; by the band&#x27;s guitarist Paul Landers. The limited edition was released as a large black-and-white photo-book with photos by Frederic Batier, who had accompanied the band through their recent tours. The photo-book edition contains two DVDs and two live albums.

===&quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; (2007–2011)===
The band took a hiatus in 2006 and began work again in 2007. The recording process reportedly took two years. In July 2009, the title track &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; leaked onto the internet, along with promotional materials. This led Universal Music to take action against certain fan sites. It was confirmed in August 2009 that the new album would have 11 tracks, and mixing of the album – which was taking place in Stockholm – had been completed. On 1 September 2009, it was confirmed on the band&#x27;s website that &quot;Pussy&quot; would be the first single from the album. On the same day, The Gauntlet posted a promotional video for it. The video also confirmed the album title, &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot;. Later, the title was confirmed again in an interview with Paul Landers for RockOne magazine. 46,7 The music video for &quot;Pussy&quot; was released on 16 September 2009, at 20:30 GMT, released especially for the adult website Visit-x. The video contains graphic scenes of male and female nudity as well as women engaging in sexual acts with the band members, although the actual sex scenes were performed by body doubles. The women featured in the video are German pornographic stars. Metal Hammer released an edited version of the video onto their website.

&quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot; was confirmed as the second single from the album by Landers and Lorenz in an interview for Radio Eins. Although censorship of the song in Germany prohibits any advertisement, broadcast or public display, the video to &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot; was released on 21 December 2009 on the adult website Visit-x, just like the video to &quot;Pussy&quot;, after advertisement on the band&#x27;s official German website; it depicts the band on stage in a similar configuration as on their 2009/10 tour. Any references to the video on the official website have since been deleted. In Europe, the single was released on 15 January 2010, and in the U.S. on 19 January 2010. Like the video &quot;Pussy,&quot; this video was also directed by Jonas Åkerlund. On 23 April 2010, Rammstein released their video &quot;Haifisch&quot; on the band&#x27;s MySpace page. Unlike the video for &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot;, it contains more of a narrative rather than a performance. The single was released during May and June 2010.
On 8 November 2009, Rammstein began the first leg of the Liebe ist für alle da Tour in Lisbon, Portugal. As part of their European summer tour, Rammstein performed at the 2010 Rock AM Ring Festival on 4–6 June 2010. They also headlined several shows across Europe on the Sonisphere Festival, including their first ever outdoor UK performance at Knebworth Park, performing the day before Iron Maiden. On Sunday 18 July 2010, Rammstein played in front of more than 130,000 people in Quebec City on the Plains of Abraham as the closing show for the Festival d&#x27;été de Québec. It was their first North American appearance in nine years. The band announced that their last tour dates of 2010 were to be in the Americas. After several South American dates, the band returned to the United States for a single show at the famous Madison Square Garden in New York City – their first US show in over ten years. The tickets sold out in a very short time (under 20 minutes).

They also performed at Bell Centre in Montreal, Canada on 9 December. This concert sold out within the first hour of tickets going on sale, indicating a high demand to see Rammstein in North America. The band then played at Big Day Out 2011 from 21 January to 6 February in New Zealand and Australia. The band also visited South Africa for the first time in early 2011 and played two sold-out concerts in Cape Town and Johannesburg respectively, indicating another territory eager for the opportunity to enjoy the band live. On 16 February 2011, Rammstein announced that, after the massive success of their sold out Madison Square Garden show on 11 December 2010, they would be touring North America after ten years.

Rammstein played in New Jersey (East Rutherford) Izod Center, Montreal Bell Centre, Toronto Air Canada Centre, Chicago Allstate Arena, Edmonton Rexall Place, Seattle Tacoma Dome, San Francisco (Oakland) Oracle Arena, Los Angeles The Forum, and Las Vegas Thomas and Mack Center, Mexico City&#x27;s Palacio de los Deportes, Guadalajara&#x27;s Arena VFG, and Monterrey&#x27;s Auditorio Banamex to a total of six US dates, three Canadian dates, and four Mexican dates. Tickets went on sale 25 and 26 February to great response, with many shows completely selling out, making this tour a complete success. On 20 April 2011, the band also won the Revolver Golden God Award for Best Live Band, their first US award.

===&quot;Made in Germany&quot;, video releases, and side projects (2011–2017)===
Rammstein released a greatest hits album titled &quot;Made in Germany 1995–2011&quot; on 2 December 2011. It contains one previously unreleased track, &quot;Mein Land&quot; which was released as a single on 11 November 2011 with another track, &quot;Vergiss uns nicht&quot;, that was released at a later date. The compilation is available in three different editions: The standard edition; this includes a CD with normal songs from their back catalog. Special edition; has the same CD from the standard edition and an extra CD with Rammstein songs that have been remixed by different artists such as Scooter. Finally, the super deluxe edition; has the two previously mentioned CDs and three DVDs with interviews and the making of videos from different music videos. The video for the song &quot;Mein Land&quot; was filmed on 23 May 2011 at Sycamore Beach in Malibu, California. It premiered on the band&#x27;s official website on 11 November 2011. A full European tour in support of &quot;Made in Germany&quot; began in November 2011 and spanned all the way to May 2012. It included a North American tour that began on 20 April 2012 in Sunrise, Florida and ended on 25 May 2012 in Houston, Texas that visited 21 cities throughout the US and Canada. The Swedish industrial band Deathstars supported the band during the first two legs of the European tour. DJ Joe Letz from Combichrist and Emigrate was the opening act for the North American Tour.

Rammstein, minus Till Lindemann, performed &quot;The Beautiful People&quot; with Marilyn Manson at the Echo Awards on 22 March 2012. On 21 September 2012, it was announced that Rammstein would be headlining Download Festival 2013, along with Iron Maiden and Slipknot. Twelve additional festival performances for summer 2013 were announced the same day, including Wacken Open Air festival and Rock Werchter. Rammstein announced new tour dates starting for spring 2013 in Europe, including a 2-day return to Kindl-Bühne Wuhlheide, the location of their first (official) live DVD, &quot;Live Aus Berlin&quot;. On 22 November 2012, Rammstein announced via Facebook that they will be releasing a video collection featuring all music videos entitled &quot;Videos 1995–2012&quot;, plus two unreleased music videos for &quot;Mein Herz Brennt&quot;, originally featured on the album &quot;Mutter&quot;. The first video premiered on the band&#x27;s Vimeo, while the second premiered on a promotional website. Both videos were directed by Zoran Bihac. The first was released on 7 December 2012, and featured the newly recorded piano version of &quot;Mein Herz Brennt&quot;. A single of the song was released on the same day, which included an edited version of the original and a new song titled &#x27;Gib Mir Deine Augen&#x27; as a b-side. The explicit version&#x27;s video leaked onto the internet on 11 December 2012 but was officially released on 14 December, in conjunction with the video collection DVD.

In July 2013, guitarist Paul Landers revealed in an interview the possibility of a Rammstein documentary and a live DVD. He indicated that the band may &quot;start thinking&quot; about a new album in 2014. In September 2014, band co-founder Richard Kruspe (then working with his side band, Emigrate) said the band was preparing some more live DVDs and that they were taking some time off from the studio. The band would meet again in 2015 to decide if the time was right to return to the studio. In May 2015, Lindemann confirmed in an interview with MusikUniverse that Rammstein would start pre-production on a possible new album in September of that year, and that production would most likely go on until 2017. According to Peter Tägtgren – who works with frontman Till Lindemann on their side-project Lindemann – Till would be regrouping with his Rammstein bandmates later in 2015 to start pre-production on a new full-length album, which normally takes two years to be released.

In early August 2015, Rammstein released a trailer for an upcoming project, titled &quot;In Amerika&quot;. On 15 August, the band announced &quot;Rammstein in Amerika&quot;, a video release that includes a 2010 concert at Madison Square Garden in New York City and a documentary made from archived footage recorded during the band&#x27;s career. Rammstein played several festivals in Europe and North America during 2016, and in November announced plans to perform at a similar string of European festivals in 2017. On 18 January 2017 Rammstein announced a new live video release titled &quot;Paris&quot;, a recording of a March 2012 concert that took place at Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris. It premiered on 23 March in selected cinemas, and was released worldwide on DVD/Blu-ray and CD on 19 May 2017.

===Untitled seventh album and &quot;Zeit&quot; (2017–present)===

In an interview in March 2017, Richard Kruspe said that Rammstein had about 35 new songs that were close to completion, though the release date of the band&#x27;s seventh studio album was still an open question. In May, Rammstein started touring once again. Also in May, it was revealed that Sky van Hoff would be working with the band on their next album. On 18 June 2018, it was announced via StubHub&#x27;s ticketing website that Rammstein would play songs at their Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, show from their forthcoming album, then set for release late in 2018. On 17 September 2018, the band announced through Facebook that they were &quot;almost done&quot; recording the album, as they were recording orchestra and choirs in Minsk. On 2 January 2019, guitarist Richard Kruspe announced that the recording of the album wrapped in November 2018 and that the record would be released in April 2019, along with five music videos.

Rammstein released the first single from their seventh album, &quot;Deutschland&quot;, on 28 March 2019 and announced the release date of their untitled seventh studio album, 17 May 2019. Rammstein also revealed the album cover which consisted of a single, unlit match which fans say represents their love of fire and simplicity. On 26 April 2019, Rammstein released the second single from the new album, &quot;Radio&quot;. Shortly after its release, the album reached No. 1 in fourteen different countries. On 28 May 2019, Rammstein released their third single and music video from the album, this time for &quot;Ausländer&quot;. The band embarked on their Stadium Tour to support the album, beginning in May 2019. They were due to play shows in Europe and North America in 2020, but were forced to postpone them due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the two continents. The dates first were rescheduled for 2021 and, in March 2021, again rescheduled to 2022.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the band to remain sheltered during a lockdown in Germany, the band returned to writing music, which Christoph Schneider confirmed in a German podcast. It was reported in September 2020 that they had returned to La Fabrique Studios in France, where they recorded their untitled seventh album, to record new music, potentially for a new album. On 25 September, the 25th anniversary of their debut album &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, they announced a remastered anniversary edition for the album, for release on 4 December. The release was made available both digitally and physically, as a CD housed in a digipak as well as a double heavyweight, colored vinyl.

In February 2021, Flake Lorenz confirmed to Motor Music that the band had finished recording an eighth studio album. Lorenz stated that the recording sessions were unplanned and that the quarantine caused by the pandemic allowed for &quot;less distraction&quot; and &quot;more time to think of new things&quot;. In October 2021, a song from the album was premiered on the International Space Station to French astronaut Thomas Pesquet. According to composer Sven Helbig, who worked on the album, the album&#x27;s release had been delayed due to the 2021–2023 global supply chain crisis, which impacted the album&#x27;s physical releases. Richard Kruspe affirmed in an interview that Rammstein&#x27;s eighth studio album would be released in the first half of 2022, prior to the slated resumption of their Stadium Tour that had been postponed to 2022.

Rammstein began teasing the first single from their eighth studio album on 8 March 2022, posting clips to their social media accounts with the hashtag &quot;#ZEITkommt&quot;. On 10 March, they formally announced the album, titled &quot;Zeit&quot;, revealing its release date of 29 April 2022. The release of the title track as the album&#x27;s lead single, along with its music video, coincided with the announcement. The second single from &quot;Zeit&quot;, &quot;Zick Zack&quot;, was released on 7 April with its accompanying music video. The third single from &quot;Zeit&quot;, &quot;Angst&quot;, was released on 29 April with its accompanying music video. On 25 November 2022 Rammstein released the music video for the song &quot;Adieu&quot; on their official YouTube channel.

==Musical style and lyrics==

&quot;The Denver Post&quot; wrote that &quot;[Rammstein] proved that they not only synthesized the genre, but that they successfully made it an art.&quot; Pioneers of the genre, Rammstein&#x27;s style blended &quot;alt-metal, groove and electronica&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;Ostensibly the world&#x27;s biggest industrial metal band, Rammstein sound like a mixture of Laibach&#x27;s situationist anthems, Front 242&#x27;s &#x27;electronic body music&#x27;, German drinking songs, opera [and] T Rex-like riffs&quot;. &quot;Loudwire&quot; wrote that the band&#x27;s &quot;jawdropping, pyro-filled live shows have become as much a part of their identity as their gothy, distortion-saturated melodic electro-metal&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; said that &quot;The band alternates repetitive metal power chords and atmospheric tones for a mind-numbing blend of metal and electronic music.&quot; Rammstein were also described as a gothic metal band who are &quot;Marilyn Manson meets &#x27;Sprockets&#x27;&quot;. &quot;The Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;Rammstein crank out the kind of symphonic metal you&#x27;d expect from a country that boasts Wagner among its favourite sons.&quot; &quot;AllMusic&quot; described the band&#x27;s music as blending &quot;industrial noise, grinding metal guitars, and operatic vocals&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that Rammstein was &quot;mistakenly lumped in with the nu-metal fad that was going on at the same time&quot; as the band&#x27;s debut.

Rammstein was traditionally inspired by bands such as the Slovenian group &quot;Laibach&quot;, known for its provocative songs, often citing political symbols of the far-right and whose music style also combines different genres, or the German rock band Oomph! However, the band members do not see a real connection to &quot;Laibach&quot; – apart from the similarity in vocal style which Flake Lorenz admitted in a &quot;Viva&quot; interview from 1997. In the same interview Richard Kruspe said: &quot;For me, &quot;Laibach&quot; is a very, very intellectual story. Rammstein is much more emotional for me – in the beginning. And I can&#x27;t do anything with that intellect that &quot;Laibach&quot; uses.&quot;

Unlike many bands from Berlin in the early 1990s, Rammstein did not want to imitate American or English bands. Flake Lorenz said in an interview: &quot;We found the style by knowing exactly what we didn&#x27;t want. And we just didn&#x27;t want to do American funky music or punk or anything we can&#x27;t do. We realized that we can only do this music that we also play. And it&#x27;s just very simple, dull, monotone.&quot;

Rammstein&#x27;s style has received positive feedback from critics. New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;Southland Times&quot; (17 December 1999) suggested that Till Lindemann&#x27;s &quot;booming, sub-sonic voice&quot; would send &quot;the peasants fleeing into their barns and bolting their doors&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot; (9 January 2005) commented that on the stage, &quot;Mr. Lindemann gave off an air of such brute masculinity and barely contained violence that it seemed that he could have reached into the crowd, snatched up a fan, and bitten off his head&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented that &quot;their blend of industrial noise, grinding metal guitars, and operatic vocals is staggeringly powerful&quot;. &quot;We just push boundaries&quot;, said Till Lindemann in an interview with rock magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, &quot;We cannot help it if people don&#x27;t like those boundaries being pushed&quot;.

Nearly all of Rammstein&#x27;s songs are in German. Educated in East German schools, the members were all taught Russian as a second language rather than English. In 2019, Flake commented: &quot;I saw a lot of East German bands that sung in very bad English to people who didn&#x27;t understand English – it was absolutely stupid. But if you really want to tell your emotions, you have to speak in your mother tongue.&quot; Songs they have recorded entirely or partly in English include: a cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Stripped&quot; and English renditions of &quot;Engel&quot;, &quot;Du hast&quot;, and &quot;Amerika&quot;. The original version of &quot;Amerika&quot; as well as &quot;Stirb nicht vor mir (Don&#x27;t Die Before I Do)&quot; and &quot;Pussy&quot; also contain some lyrics in English. The song &quot;Moskau&quot; (&quot;Moscow&quot;) contains a chorus in Russian, and Till Lindemann has an unofficial song called &quot;Schtiel&quot; (cover of song &quot;Штиль&quot; / &quot;Shtil&quot; by Russian popular heavy metal band Aria) entirely in Russian. &quot;Te quiero puta!&quot; is entirely in Spanish, &quot;Frühling in Paris&quot; has a chorus in French, &quot;Zeig dich&quot; contains lyrics in Latin performed by a choir and &quot;Ausländer&quot; has lyrics in English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Russian. Oliver Riedel commented that &quot;[the] German language suits heavy metal music. French might be the language of love, but German is the language of anger&quot;. In an interview with Ultimate Guitar, when asked whether Rammstein would ever create an original song entirely in English, Till Lindemann stated that &#x27;Rammstein will never write a song in English, it&#x27;s like asking Buddha to kill a pig&#x27;.

The band&#x27;s lyrics, as sung by Till Lindemann, are an essential element of their music, and shape the perception by fans and a wider public. Among other things that are seen as controversial, Rammstein also refers to classical German literature, e.g. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s famous poems &quot;Der Erlkönig&quot; (1778) and &quot;Das Heidenröslein&quot; (1771) for the songs &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; and &quot;Rosenrot&quot;, respectively. Several of their songs are related to controversial and taboo subjects such as sadomasochism, homosexuality, intersexuality, incest, pedophilia, necrophilia, cannibalism, pyromania, religion and sexual violence. Also several of their songs are allegedly inspired by real-life events. These songs include &quot;Rammstein&quot; (Ramstein air show disaster), &quot;Mein Teil&quot; (The Meiwes Case), &quot;Wiener Blut&quot; (Fritzl case) and &quot;Donaukinder&quot; (2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill). Their fourth album, &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;, is loosely inspired by the crash of Japan Air Lines Flight 123. The band have also occasionally delved into politics with their lyrics. &quot;Amerika&quot; is a critique of the cultural and political imperialism of the United States all over the world. The lyrics of the song &quot;Deutschland&quot; contain the lines &quot;Deutschland! / Meine Liebe / kann ich dir nicht geben&quot; (Germany! / My love / [is what] I cannot give you), which conveys the band&#x27;s inability to have unquestioned patriotic feelings.

==Live performances==
Since their early years, Rammstein are particularly known for their over-the-top live performances, making such extensive use of pyrotechnics that fans eventually coined the motto, &quot;Other bands play, Rammstein burns!&quot; (a play on Manowar&#x27;s song &quot;Kings of Metal&quot;, which states that &quot;other bands play, Manowar kill&quot;). Following an accident in Berlin on 27 September 1996, in which some burning decorative parts of the stage collapsed, the band started using professionals to handle the pyrotechnics. Lindemann subsequently qualified as a licensed pyrotechnician, and often spends entire songs engulfed in flames. He has suffered multiple burns on his ears, head, and arms.

The band&#x27;s stage costumes are also known for being outlandish. During the Reise, Reise Tour, they wore lederhosen, corsets, and military-inspired uniforms with German steel helmets; during the Mutter Tour, the group kept to the themes of the album artwork and descended onto the stage from a giant uterus while wearing diapers. During the &quot;Völkerball&quot; concert, among others, Lindemann changed costumes between songs and dressed accordingly for each. For example, for the song &quot;Mein Teil&quot;, he was dressed as a blood-soaked chef; in &quot;Reise, Reise&quot;, he dressed as a sailor. The rest of the band each wore their own preferred costume, but none quite as bizarre as Till&#x27;s. The band&#x27;s flair for costumes is evident in their music videos as well as their live shows. In the &quot;Keine Lust&quot; video, all members except Lorenz are dressed in fat suits. In the &quot;Amerika&quot; video, all members of the band wear astronaut costumes.

Since the Mutter Tour in 2001, Rammstein have worked with stage designer Roy Bennett, who helped the band in developing the look of the stages. With the Ahoi Tour in 2004/2005, the band began using a two-level stage, with half the band playing the lower level and the other half on the upper level. At this tour, the upper level rose over 2 meters above the stage floor and had an oval entrance just beneath the drums. At both sides of the upper level, a special lift made it possible for the band members to access both stage levels.

On the Liebe ist für alle da Tour in 2009, the new stage still had a two-level design. This time, however, the upper level only had about half the height as on the previous tour. Stage entrance was possible by a hydraulic ramp in the middle of the stage floor. At each end of the upper level, stairs were placed in order to gain access to both levels. This tour included not only the extensive use of pyrotechnics, but also a massive lighting show, such as the band&#x27;s logo lit up as big lamps on four enormous collapsible towers, forming the industrial backdrop of the set and being capable of different lighting effects.

During the arena shows of the Made in Germany 1995-2011 Tour, the stage was slightly altered with new set pieces such as a large industrial fan as well as new backdrops. The most noticeable addition was a long catwalk, connecting the main stage to a smaller stage in the middle of the audience. During the 2013 festival leg of the tour, the bridge and smaller stage were omitted. For the 2016 Festival Tour, the band kept the stage itself mostly unchanged, though had the entire lighting rig changed completely. According to Kruspe, the onstage antics are meant to get people&#x27;s attention and have fun at the same time; Rammstein&#x27;s motto, according to Schneider, is &quot;do your own thing and overdo it&quot;.

Kruspe said of the stage show in July 1999, &quot;You have to understand that 99 per cent of the people don&#x27;t understand the lyrics, so you have to come up with something to keep the drama in the show. We have to do something. We like to have a show; we like to play with fire. We do have a sense of humour. We do laugh about it; we have fun [...] but we&#x27;re not Spinal Tap. We take the music and the lyrics seriously. It&#x27;s a combination of humour, theatre, and our East German culture, you know?&quot;

Their antics have also garnered controversy. During the American Family Values Tour 1998, alongside acts such as rapper Ice Cube, Korn, and Limp Bizkit, the band was arrested for public indecency. In one of their more infamous moments, Lindemann engaged in simulated sodomy with Lorenz during their performance of &quot;Bück dich&quot; in Worcester, Massachusetts. They were subsequently arrested, fined $25 and spent one night in jail.

==Controversies==
===Imagery===
&quot;The New York Times&quot; described Rammstein&#x27;s music as a &quot;powerful strain of brutally intense rock... bringing gale-force music and spectacular theatrics together&quot;. The members have not been shy about courting controversy and have periodically attracted condemnation from morality campaigners. Till and Flake&#x27;s stage act earned them a night in jail in June 1999 after a liquid-ejecting dildo was used in a concert in Worcester, Massachusetts. Back home in Germany, the band faced repeated accusations of fascist sympathies because of the dark and sometimes militaristic imagery of their videos and concerts, including the use of excerpts from the film &quot;Olympia&quot; by Leni Riefenstahl in the video for their cover of Depeche Mode&#x27;s song &quot;Stripped&quot;. MTV Germany studied the lyrics, talked to the band and came away satisfied that Rammstein are apolitical; Peter Ruppert, then head of Music Programming at MTV Germany, stated that the band &quot;aren&#x27;t in any way connected with any right-wing activities&quot;.

Their cover of their debut album &quot;Herzeleid&quot;, released in Germany in 1995, showed the band members bare-chested in a style that resembled Strength Through Joy in the eyes of some critics, who accused the band of trying to sell themselves as &quot;poster boys for the Master Race&quot;. Rammstein have vehemently denied this and said they want nothing to do with politics or supremacy of any kind. Lorenz, annoyed by the claim, has remarked it is just a photo, and should be understood as such. &quot;Herzeleid&quot; has since been given a different cover in North America, depicting the band members&#x27; faces.

The video of &quot;Deutschland&quot;, released in 2019, sparked further controversy, as it portrays black German actress Ruby Commey appearing as Germania, which has been described as &quot;a calculated affront to German nationalists&quot;. The video also portrays the band members both as Nazi concentration camp executioners and as Jewish prisoners, sparking the complaints of Holocaust survivor groups; however, others defended the video and the song lyrics, which have been interpreted as &quot;express[ing] a love/hate relationship with Germany&quot;.

===Relation to violent events===
Rammstein were cited in relation to the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, when a photo of Eric Harris wearing a Rammstein T-shirt in the 11th grade was revealed. There was no evidence to correlate the band and the massacre. In response to the shooting, the band issued a statement:

Coincidentally, on 10 September 2001 the single and video clip of &quot;Ich will&quot; (&quot;I Want&quot;) was released, which portrays the band as bank robbers who want to get a message across and receiving a Goldene Kamera (Golden Camera) award, a German version of the Emmy award, for their &quot;actions&quot;. In the United States, the video clip was broadcast only late at night after the attacks of 11 September 2001, although many media officials and politicians requested the video to be pulled from broadcast completely.

Following the conclusion of the Beslan school hostage crisis in Russia in September 2004, the Russian authorities claimed that the terrorists had &quot;listened to German hard rock group Rammstein on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves edgy and fired up&quot;. The claim has not been independently confirmed.

Band members said this about the issue:

Pekka-Eric Auvinen, the perpetrator of the Jokela school shooting in November 2007, also included Rammstein in one of his favorite bands. However, he noted that the music among other things was not to blame for his decisions.

Elliot Rodger, the perpetrator of the Isla Vista killings in May 2014, was also a fan of Rammstein according to his YouTube records. On a lyric video of Mein Herz brennt, Rodger wrote: &quot;[G]reat song to listen to while daydreaming about being a powerful ruler&quot;. Even though Rodger wrote in his manifesto that he wished to become a dictator and punish all the people who rejected him, there was no direct link found between the band&#x27;s music and the killing spree. Santa Barbara police later confirmed that Rodger&#x27;s main motivations were sexual and social rejection.

The Trollhättan school attack perpetrator, Anton Lundin Pettersson, used a manipulated version of the band&#x27;s logo that added Nazi Germany&#x27;s eagle on his Facebook page.

===Videos===
In October 2004, the video for &quot;Mein Teil&quot; (&quot;My part&quot;) caused considerable controversy in Germany when it was released. It takes a darkly comic view of the Armin Meiwes cannibalism case, showing a cross-dressed Schneider holding the other five band members on a leash and rolling around in mud. The controversy did nothing to stop the single rising to No. 2 in the German charts. Meiwes (who was convicted of manslaughter in 2004, then retried in 2006 and found guilty of murder) brought a lawsuit in January 2006 against the band for infringement of rights to the story.

The band&#x27;s own views of its image are sanguine; Landers has said: &quot;We like being on the fringes of bad taste&quot;. Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz comments: &quot;The controversy is fun, like stealing forbidden fruit. But it serves a purpose. We like audiences to grapple with our music, and people have become more receptive&quot;.

The video for &quot;Pussy&quot; was released September 2009. It features hardcore pornographic scenes of nudity along with women engaging in sexual activity with body doubles of the band members. It is the third Rammstein video to include nudity.

===Placement on the &quot;Index&quot;===
On 5 November 2009, their sixth studio album &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; was placed on the &quot;Index&quot; of the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons (&quot;Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien&quot;, or &quot;BPjM&quot;), making it illegal in Germany to make the album accessible to minors or display it where it can be seen by people underage, effectively banning it from stores. According to the official statement of the BPjM, the depiction of lead guitarist Richard Kruspe holding a woman wearing only a mask over his knee and lifting his hand to strike her behind has given cause for offense, as well as the lyrics to &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot; (meaning &quot;I hurt you&quot;) which supposedly promoted dangerous BDSM techniques. Furthermore, the advisory board took into consideration the alleged promotion of unprotected sexual intercourse in the lyrics to &quot;Pussy&quot;.

The band, as well as several members of the German press, reacted with astonishment to the decision. Keyboardist Christian Lorenz expressed surprise at the advisory board&#x27;s &quot;parochial sense of art&quot; and regretted their apparent inability to detect irony. On 16 November 2009, a stripped-down version of &quot;Liebe ist für alle da&quot; was released. As of 31 May 2010, the administrative court in Cologne had decided to suspend the inclusion into the &quot;Index&quot; (case 22 L 1899/09). The German department deleted the record from the &quot;Index&quot; on 1 June (Decision No. A 117/10). On 9 June, the band announced that the original version of the album was available in their shop and that the single &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot; would soon be released in Germany. In October 2011, the album was judged not harmful to minors and deleted from the &quot;Index&quot;.

In 2016, Rammstein filed a lawsuit against the German state claiming €66,000 in compensation for damages that had allegedly resulted from the indexing, chiefly the destruction or withholding of 85,000 copies of the album that the band says would have otherwise sold.

===Concert misconduct allegations===
In May 2023, a woman claimed that her drink was spiked (drugged) during a Rammstein concert in Lithuania and was selected for an aftershow party, during which she was ushered into a small room underneath the stage for lead singer Till Lindemann. After making herself unavailable for sex, she claimed Lindemann reacted angrily and left. While emphasising that she was never assaulted, she believed there to be an &quot;organised system of funnelling girls.&quot; Although Vilnius prosecutors found no evidence of drugging, her story amplified the band&#x27;s &quot;Row Zero&quot; practice, where young women would be pre-selected on social media by casting director Alena Makeeva to stand in an exclusive area closest to the stage dubbed Row Zero and attend pre-show and after-show parties, during which Lindemann would request to have sex with fans in attendance. Further claims against Lindemann prompted an investigation by German police for sexual offences and the distribution of narcotics. In response, the band denied all claims of illegal behavior, fired Makeeva and halted the &quot;Row Zero&quot; afterparties.

In view of the allegations, Rammstein&#x27;s label Universal announced that it would be suspending all promotional activities for Rammstein&#x27;s albums. Universal also confirmed a press report that it had confidentially requested the German Music Industry Association BVMI not to include the 25th anniversary re-release of &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; in the official album charts, regardless of its actual sales figures, and that the request had been authorized by the band itself. Various other companies including Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch and Rossmann also halted joint ventures with the band.

On 29 August, the German prosecutors announced that they dropped the case, saying that the investigations did not unearth any evidence of a crime. The investigations were originally taken up because of complaints filed by unaffected third persons who were unable to identify any victim. While alleged victims sent sworn statements to journalists, none of those women filed a criminal complaint, and therefore the police were unable to contact and interview them. Also, the journalists had promised the alleged victims anonymity, and made use of their legal right to keep their sources secret.

==Political views==
Early on, Rammstein were accused by media outlets in Germany of being neo-Nazis due to their imagery. The band released the song &quot;Links 2-3-4&quot; (&quot;Links&quot; being German for &quot;left&quot;) in 2001 to affirm to the public that they reside on the left of the political spectrum. In a 2011 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone Germany&quot;, when asked about Nazi accusations, Lindemann stated &quot;We come from the East and we have grown up as socialists. We used to be either punks or Goths – we hate Nazis! And then suddenly there is such a far-fetched accusation. We are doing exactly the same thing today, but no one in America or in Mexico would even get the idea to come up with something like that. This only happens in Germany. Our reply to this animosity was &#x27;Links 2-3-4&#x27;, and with that we had made it clear where we stand politically.&quot; Regarding the song, Kruspe said: My heart beats on the left, two, three, four&#x27;. It&#x27;s simple. If you want to put us in a political category, we&#x27;re on the left side, and that&#x27;s the reason we made the song&quot;. The song&#x27;s title refers to the refrain of the German Communist Party song &quot;Einheitsfrontlied&quot;, written by Bertholt Brecht: &quot;Drum links, zwei, drei! Drum links, zwei, drei! / Wo dein Platz, Genosse ist! / Reih dich ein, in die Arbeitereinheitsfront / Weil du auch ein Arbeiter bist&quot;. (Then left, two, three! Then left, two, three! / Here&#x27;s the place, Comrade, for you! / So fall in with the Workers&#x27; united front / For you are a worker too.) Another key lyric expressing the band&#x27;s allegiance to the left paraphrases the titles of newspaper columns published side by side for several years in the German newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;: &quot;Mein Herz schlägt links&quot; (&quot;My heart beats on the left&quot;) by The Left Party co-chair and former Social Democratic Party of Germany chair Oskar Lafontaine, and &quot;Mein Herz schlägt auf dem rechten Fleck&quot; (&quot;My heart beats in the right place&quot;) by Peter Gauweiler of the conservative Christian Social Union. Lorenz stated that the song was created to show the band could write a harsh, evil, military-sounding song without being Nazis.

The band also wrote the song &quot;Amerika&quot; as a critique of the worldwide cultural and political imperialism of the United States. In their book &quot;Envisioning Social Justice in Contemporary German Culture&quot;, Jill E. Twark and Axel Hildebrandt found that the song&#x27;s text and most of its video&#x27;s images point toward a critique of America&#x27;s cultural imperialism, political propaganda, and self-assumed role as global police force. The song responds critically to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003. They also found that another song of theirs that is critical of the United States is &quot;Mein Land&quot;, believing that it critiques American racism and nationalism.

During the Eastern European leg of their Europe Stadium Tour, the band showed support for the LGBT community on several occasions. At a concert in Chorzów, Poland on 24 July 2019, drummer Christoph Schneider surfed the crowd in a rubber boat, holding a rainbow flag. At their concert in Moscow five days later, guitarists Kruspe and Landers kissed onstage, while they embraced each other during a concert in Saint Petersburg on 2 August. The band&#x27;s support for gay rights was met with criticism from some Russian politicians. Vitaly Milonov, a member of the State Duma, called the band &quot;idiots&quot; and said: &quot;If they think it possible to behave in such a way, they should also consider it possible to keep this garbage away from us.&quot;

==Band members==
Since forming in 1994, Rammstein have retained a constant line-up. Richard Kruspe had said in a &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot; interview that it is because of the band respecting each other&#x27;s wishes to take a break, either for personal reasons or to focus on a side project. Members of the band have had side projects that they take part in during Rammstein&#x27;s inactivity. Kruspe currently fronts the group Emigrate while Till Lindemann began his project Lindemann in 2015.

<doc id="25662" wikidata="Q102527" url="?curid=25662" title="Robert Falcon Scott">
<text>Captain Robert Falcon Scott (6 June 1868 – ) was a British Royal Navy officer and explorer who led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions: the &quot;Discovery&quot; expedition of 1901–04 and the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition of 1910–13.

On the first expedition, he set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82°S and discovered the Antarctic Plateau, on which the South Pole is located. On the second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, less than five weeks after Amundsen&#x27;s South Pole expedition. On the return journey from the Pole, a planned meeting with supporting dog teams from the base camp failed, despite Scott&#x27;s written instructions, and at a distance of from their base camp at Hut Point and approximately from the next depot, Scott and his companions died. When Scott and his party&#x27;s bodies were discovered, they had in their possession the first Antarctic fossils discovered. The fossils were determined to be from the &quot;Glossopteris&quot; tree and proved that Antarctica was once forested and joined to other continents.

Before his appointment to lead the &quot;Discovery&quot; expedition, Scott had a career as a Royal Navy officer. In 1899, he had a chance encounter with Sir Clements Markham, the president of the Royal Geographical Society, and learned of a planned Antarctic expedition, which he soon volunteered to lead. His name became inseparably associated with the Antarctic, the field of work to which he remained committed during the final years of his life.

Following the news of his death, Scott became a celebrated hero, a status reflected by memorials erected across the UK. However, in the last decades of the 20th century, questions were raised about his competence and character. Commentators in the 21st century have regarded Scott more positively after assessing the temperature drop below in March 1912, and after re-discovering Scott&#x27;s written orders of October 1911, in which he had instructed the dog teams to meet and assist him on the return trip.

== Early life ==
=== Family ===

Scott was born on 6 June 1868, the third of six children and elder son of John Edward, a brewer and magistrate, and Hannah ( Cuming) Scott of Stoke Damerel, near Devonport. There were also naval and military traditions in the family, Scott&#x27;s grandfather and four uncles all having served in the army or navy. John Scott&#x27;s prosperity came from the ownership of a small Plymouth brewery which he had inherited from his father and subsequently sold. Scott&#x27;s early childhood years were spent in comfort, but some years later, when he was establishing his naval career, the family suffered serious financial misfortune. 

In accordance with the family&#x27;s tradition, Scott and his younger brother Archie were predestined for careers in the armed services. Scott spent four years at a local day school before being sent to Stubbington House School in Hampshire, a cramming establishment that prepared candidates for the entrance examinations to the naval training ship at Dartmouth. Having passed these exams Scott began his naval career in 1881, as a 13-year-old cadet. One of his older sisters was Ettie Ellison-Macartney.

In &quot;The Worst Journey in the World&quot;, author Apsley Cherry-Garrard claims that &quot;physically Scott had been a delicate boy but developed into a strong man, 5 feet 9 inches in height, 11 stone 6 lbs. in weight, with a chest measurement of 39¼ inches.&quot; 

=== Early naval career ===
In July 1883, Scott passed out of &quot;Britannia&quot; as a midshipman, seventh overall in a class of 26. By October, he was en route to South Africa to join , the flagship of the Cape squadron, the first of several ships on which he served during his midshipman years. While stationed in St Kitts, West Indies, on , he had his first encounter with Clements Markham, then Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, who would loom large in Scott&#x27;s later career. On this occasion, 1 March 1887, Markham observed Midshipman Scott&#x27;s cutter winning that morning&#x27;s race across the bay. Markham&#x27;s habit was to &quot;collect&quot; likely young naval officers with a view to their undertaking polar exploration work in the future. He was impressed by Scott&#x27;s intelligence, enthusiasm and charm, and the 18-year-old midshipman was duly noted.

In March 1888 Scott passed his examinations for sub-lieutenant, with four first class certificates out of five. His career progressed smoothly, with service on various ships and promotion to lieutenant in 1889. In 1891, after a long spell in foreign waters, he applied for the two-year torpedo training course on , an important career step. He graduated with first class certificates in both the theory and practical examinations. A small blot occurred in the summer of 1893 when, while commanding a torpedo boat, Scott ran it aground, a mishap which earned him a mild rebuke.

During the research for his dual biography of Scott and Roald Amundsen, polar historian Roland Huntford investigated a possible scandal in Scott&#x27;s early naval career, related to the period 1889–1890 when Scott was a lieutenant on . According to Huntford, Scott &quot;disappears from naval records&quot; for eight months, from mid-August 1889 until 26 March 1890. Huntford hints at involvement with a married American woman, a cover-up, and protection by senior officers. Biographer David Crane reduces the missing period to eleven weeks, but is unable to clarify further. He rejects the notion of protection by senior officers on the grounds that Scott was not important or well-connected enough to warrant this. Documents that may have offered explanations are missing from Admiralty records.

In 1894, while serving as torpedo officer on the depot ship , Scott learned of the financial calamity that had overtaken his family. John Scott, having sold the brewery and invested the proceeds unwisely, had lost all his capital and was now virtually bankrupt. At the age of 63, and in poor health, he was forced to take a job as a brewery manager and move his family to Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Three years later, while Robert was serving with the Channel Squadron flagship , John Scott died of heart disease, creating a fresh family crisis. Hannah Scott and her two unmarried daughters now relied entirely on the service pay of Scott and the salary of younger brother Archie, who had left the army for a higher-paid post in the colonial service. Archie&#x27;s own death in the autumn of 1898, after contracting typhoid fever, meant that the whole financial responsibility for the family rested on Scott.

Promotion, and the extra income this would bring, now became a matter of considerable concern to Scott. In the Royal Navy however, opportunities for career advancement were both limited and keenly sought after by ambitious officers. Early in June 1899, while home on leave, he had a chance encounter in a London street with Clements Markham, who was now knighted and President of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and learned for the first time of an impending Antarctic expedition with , under the auspices of the RGS. It was the opportunity for early command and a chance to distinguish himself, rather than any predilection for polar exploration which motivated Scott, according to Crane. What passed between them on this occasion is not recorded, but a few days later, on 11 June, Scott appeared at the Markham residence and volunteered to lead the expedition.

== &quot;Discovery&quot; expedition, 1901–1904 ==
The British National Antarctic Expedition, later known as the &quot;Discovery&quot; Expedition, was a joint enterprise of the RGS and the Royal Society. A long-cherished dream of Markham&#x27;s, it required all of his skills and cunning to bring the expedition to fruition, under naval command and largely staffed by naval personnel. Scott may not have been Markham&#x27;s first choice as leader but, having decided on him, the older man remained a constant supporter. There were committee battles over the scope of Scott&#x27;s responsibilities, with the Royal Society pressing to put a scientist in charge of the expedition&#x27;s programme while Scott merely commanded the ship. Eventually, however, Markham&#x27;s view prevailed; Scott was given overall command, and was promoted to the rank of commander before sailed for the Antarctic on 6 August 1901. King Edward VII, who showed a keen interest in the expedition, visited the &quot;Discovery&quot; the day before the ship left British shores in August 1901, and during the visit appointed Scott a Member Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order, his personal gift.

Experience of Antarctic or Arctic waters was almost entirely lacking within the 50-strong party and there was very little special training in equipment or techniques before the ship set sail. Dogs were taken, as were skis, but the dogs succumbed to disease in the first season. Nevertheless, the dogs&#x27; performance impressed Scott, and, despite moral qualms, he implemented the principle of slaughtering dogs for dog food to increase the others&#x27; range. During an early attempt at ice travel, a blizzard trapped expedition members in their tent and their decision to leave it resulted in the death of George Vince, who slipped over a precipice on 11 March 1902. The expedition also experienced problems with scurvy, which affected Scott&#x27;s domestic reputation.

The expedition had both scientific and exploration objectives; the latter included a long journey south, in the direction of the South Pole. This march, undertaken by Scott, Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson, took them to a latitude of 82°17′S, about from the pole. A harrowing return journey brought about Shackleton&#x27;s physical collapse and his early departure from the expedition. The second year showed improvements in technique and achievement, culminating in Scott&#x27;s western journey which led to the discovery of the Polar Plateau. This has been described by one writer as &quot;one of the great polar journeys&quot;. The scientific results of the expedition included important biological, zoological and geological findings. Some of the meteorological and magnetic readings, however, were later criticised as amateurish and inaccurate.

At the end of the expedition it took the combined efforts of two relief ships and the use of explosives to free &quot;Discovery&quot; from the ice. Scott&#x27;s insistence during the expedition on Royal Navy formalities had made for uneasy relations with the merchant navy contingent, many of whom departed for home with the first relief ship in March 1903. Second-in-command Albert Armitage, a merchant officer, was offered the chance to go home on compassionate grounds, but interpreted the offer as a personal slight, and refused. Armitage also promoted the idea that the decision to send Shackleton home on the relief ship arose from Scott&#x27;s animosity rather than Shackleton&#x27;s physical breakdown. Although there was later tension between Scott and Shackleton, when their polar ambitions directly clashed, mutual civilities were preserved in public; Scott joined in the official receptions that greeted Shackleton on his return in 1909 after the &quot;Nimrod&quot; Expedition, and the two exchanged polite letters about their respective ambitions in 1909–1910.

== Between expeditions ==

=== Popular hero ===

&quot;Discovery&quot; returned to Britain in September 1904. The expedition had caught the public imagination, and Scott became a popular hero. He was awarded a cluster of honours and medals, including many from overseas, and was promoted to the rank of captain. He was invited to Balmoral Castle, and King Edward VII promoted him to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

Scott&#x27;s next few years were crowded. For more than a year he was occupied with public receptions, lectures and the writing of the expedition record, &quot;The Voyage of the Discovery&quot;. In January 1906, he resumed his full-time naval career, first as an assistant director of Naval Intelligence at the Admiralty and, in August, as flag-captain to Rear-Admiral Sir George Egerton on . He was now moving in ever more exalted social circles—a telegram to Markham in February 1907 refers to meetings with Queen Amélie of Orléans and Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal, and a later letter home reports lunching with the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet and Prince Heinrich of Prussia. The telegram related to a collision involving Scott&#x27;s ship, . Scott was cleared of blame. , a battleship commanded by Scott, collided with the battleship on 11 February 1907, suffering minor bow damage.

=== Dispute with Shackleton ===
By early 1906, Scott queried the RGS about the possible funding of a future Antarctic expedition. It was therefore unwelcome news to him that Ernest Shackleton had announced his own plans to travel to &quot;Discovery&quot;″s old McMurdo Sound base and launch a bid for the South Pole from there. Scott claimed, in the first of a series of letters to Shackleton, that the area around McMurdo was his own &quot;field of work&quot; to which he had prior rights until he chose to give them up, and that Shackleton should therefore work from an entirely different area. In this, he was strongly supported by &quot;Discovery&quot;″s former zoologist, Edward Wilson, who asserted that Scott&#x27;s rights extended to the entire Ross Sea sector. Shackleton refused to concede.

According to a letter written to Stanfords bookshop owner Edward Stanford, Scott seemed to take offence with a map that was published that had shown how far south Scott and Shackleton had travelled during the Discovery Expedition. Scott implied in this letter, dated in 1907 and discovered in the shop archives in 2018, that having the two men&#x27;s names together on this map indicated that there was &quot;dual leadership&quot; between Scott and Shackleton which was &quot;not in accordance with fact.&quot; After the owner replied with an apology over the issue, Scott expressed his regret at the nature of the previous letter and stated, &quot;I tried to be impartial in giving credit to my companions who one and all laboured honestly and well as I have endeavoured to record...I understand now of course that you had no personal knowledge of the wording and I must express regret that I failed to realise your identity when I first wrote.&quot;

Finally, to end the impasse, Shackleton agreed, in a letter to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W meridian and therefore to avoid all the familiar &quot;Discovery&quot; ground. In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old &quot;Discovery&quot; base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.

Among modern polar writers, Ranulph Fiennes regards Shackleton&#x27;s actions as a technical breach of honour, but adds: &quot;My personal belief is that Shackleton was basically honest but circumstances forced his McMurdo landing, much to his distress.&quot; The polar historian Beau Riffenburgh states that the promise to Scott &quot;should never ethically have been demanded,&quot; and compares Scott&#x27;s intransigence on this matter unfavourably with the generous attitudes of the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen, who gave freely of his advice and expertise to all, whether they were potential rivals or not.

=== Marriage ===
Scott, who because of his &quot;Discovery&quot; fame had entered Edwardian society, first met Kathleen Bruce early in 1907 at a private luncheon party. She was a sculptor, socialite and cosmopolitan who had studied under Auguste Rodin and whose circle included Isadora Duncan, Pablo Picasso and Aleister Crowley. Her initial meeting with Scott was brief, but when they met again later that year, the mutual attraction was obvious. A stormy courtship followed; Scott was not her only suitor—his main rival was would-be novelist Gilbert Cannan—and his absences at sea did not assist his cause. However, Scott&#x27;s persistence was rewarded and, on 2 September 1908, at the Chapel Royal, Hampton Court Palace, the wedding took place. Their only child, Peter Markham Scott, born 14 September 1909, was to found the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

== &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition, 1910–1913 ==
=== Preparation ===

Shackleton returned from the Antarctic having narrowly failed to reach the Pole and this gave Scott the impetus to proceed with plans for his second Antarctic expedition. On 24 March 1909, he took the Admiralty-based appointment of naval assistant to the Second Sea Lord, which placed him conveniently in London. In December, he was released on half-pay to take up the full-time command of the British Antarctic Expedition 1910, to be known as the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; expedition from its ship, .

It was the expressed hope of the RGS that this expedition would be &quot;scientific primarily, with exploration and the Pole as secondary objects&quot; but, unlike the &quot;Discovery&quot; expedition, neither they nor the Royal Society were in charge this time. In his expedition prospectus, Scott stated that its main objective was &quot;to reach the South Pole, and to secure for the British Empire the honour of this achievement&quot;. Scott had, as Markham observed, been &quot;bitten by the Pole mania&quot;.

In a memorandum of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles did not yet exist however and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed the idea of a caterpillar track for snow surfaces. In the middle of 1909, Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get him all the way to the Pole and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton&#x27;s near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), dogs and skis, after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.

Dog expert Cecil Meares was going to Siberia to select the dogs and Scott ordered that, while he was there, he should deal with the purchase of Manchurian ponies. Meares was not an experienced horse-dealer and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality and ill-suited to prolonged Antarctic work. Meanwhile, Scott also recruited Bernard Day, from Shackleton&#x27;s expedition, as his motor expert.

=== First season ===

On 15 June 1910, Scott&#x27;s ship, &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, an old converted whaler, set sail from Cardiff, South Wales. Scott meanwhile was fundraising in Britain and joined the ship later in South Africa. Arriving in Melbourne, Australia in October 1910, Scott received a telegram from Amundsen stating: &quot;Beg leave to inform you &quot;Fram&quot; proceeding Antarctic Amundsen,&quot; possibly indicating that Scott faced a race to the pole.

The expedition suffered a series of early misfortunes which hampered the first season&#x27;s work and impaired preparations for the main polar march. On its journey from New Zealand to the Antarctic, &quot;Terra Nova&quot; nearly sank in a storm and was then trapped in pack ice for 20 days, far longer than other ships had experienced, which meant a late-season arrival and less time for preparatory work before the Antarctic winter. At Cape Evans, Antarctica, one of the motor sledges was lost during its unloading from the ship, breaking through the sea ice and sinking.

Deteriorating weather conditions and weak, unacclimatised, ponies affected the initial depot-laying journey, so that the expedition&#x27;s main supply point, One Ton Depot, was laid north of its planned location at 80°S. Lawrence Oates, in charge of the ponies, advised Scott to kill ponies for food and advance the depot to 80°S, which Scott refused to do. Oates is reported as saying to Scott, &quot;Sir, I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ll come to regret not taking my advice.&quot; Four ponies died during this journey, either from the cold or because they slowed the team down and were shot.

On its return to base, the expedition learned of the presence of Amundsen, camped with his crew and a large contingent of dogs in the Bay of Whales, to their east. Scott conceded that his ponies would not be able to start early enough in the season to compete with Amundsen&#x27;s cold-tolerant dog teams for the pole and also acknowledged that the Norwegian&#x27;s base was closer to the pole by .
Wilson was more hopeful, whereas Gran shared Scott&#x27;s concern. Shortly afterwards, the death toll among the ponies increased to six, three drowning when sea-ice unexpectedly disintegrated, casting in doubt the possibility of reaching the pole at all. However, during the 1911 winter, Scott&#x27;s confidence increased: on 2 August, after the return of a three-man party from their winter journey to Cape Crozier, Scott wrote, &quot;I feel sure we are as near perfection as experience can direct&quot;.

=== Journey to the Pole ===
Scott outlined his plans for the southern journey to the entire shore party, leaving open who would form the final polar team, according to their performance during the polar travel. Eleven days before Scott&#x27;s teams set off towards the pole, Scott gave the dog driver Meares the following written orders at Cape Evans, dated 20 October 1911, to secure Scott&#x27;s speedy return from the pole using dogs:

The march south began on 1 November 1911, a caravan of mixed transport groups (motors, dogs, horses), with loaded sledges, travelling at different rates, all designed to support a final group of four men who would make a dash for the Pole. The southbound party steadily reduced in size as successive support teams turned back. Scott reminded the returning Surgeon-Lieutenant Atkinson of the order &quot;to take the two dog-teams south in the event of Meares having to return home, as seemed likely&quot;. By 4 January 1912, the last two four-man groups had reached 87°34′S. Scott announced his decision: five men — himself, Wilson, Bowers, Oates and E. Evans — would go forward; the other three - (Teddy Evans, William Lashly and Tom Crean) - would return. The chosen group marched on, reaching the Pole on 17 January, only to find a tent left in place by Amundsen, in it containing a letter dated 18 December. Scott&#x27;s anguish is indicated in his diary: &quot;The worst has happened [...] All the day dreams must go [...] Great God! This is an awful place&quot;.

=== Last march ===

The deflated party began the return journey on 19 January. &quot;I&#x27;m afraid the return journey is going to be dreadfully tiring and monotonous&quot;, wrote Scott on that day. The party made good progress despite poor weather, and had completed the Polar Plateau stage of their journey, approximately , by 7 February. In the following days, as the party made the descent of the Beardmore Glacier, the physical condition of Edgar Evans, which Scott had noted with concern as early as 23 January, declined sharply. A fall on 4 February had left Evans &quot;dull and incapable,&quot; and on 17 February, after another fall, he died near the glacier foot. Still needing to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, the prospects of Scott&#x27;s party steadily worsened as they struggled northward with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger, and exhaustion.

Meanwhile, back at Cape Evans, the &quot;Terra Nova&quot; arrived at the beginning of February, and Atkinson decided to unload the supplies from the ship with his own men rather than set out south with the dogs to meet Scott as ordered. When Atkinson finally did leave south for the planned rendezvous with Scott, he encountered the scurvy-ridden Edward (&quot;Teddy&quot;) Evans who needed urgent medical attention. Atkinson therefore tried to send the experienced navigator Wright south to meet Scott, but chief meteorologist Simpson declared he needed Wright for scientific work. Atkinson then decided to send the short-sighted Cherry-Garrard on 25 February, who was not able to navigate, only as far as One Ton depot (which is within sight of Mount Erebus), effectively cancelling Scott&#x27;s orders for meeting him at latitude 82 or 82.30 on 1 March.

On the return journey from the Pole, Scott reached the 82°S meeting point for the dog teams, from Hut Point, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912, &quot;We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt.&quot; On 2 March, Oates began to suffer from the effects of frostbite and the party&#x27;s progress slowed as he was increasingly unable to assist in the workload, eventually only able to drag himself alongside the men pulling the sledge. By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below .
In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: &quot;We very nearly came through, and it&#x27;s a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support.&quot; On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates&#x27; last words were &quot;I am just going outside and may be some time&quot;.

After walking farther despite Scott&#x27;s toes now becoming frostbitten, the three remaining men made their final camp on 19 March, approximately short of One Ton Depot. The next day a fierce blizzard prevented their making any progress. During the next nine days, as their supplies ran out, and with storms still raging outside the tent, Scott and his companions wrote their farewell letters. Scott gave up his diary after 23 March, save for a final entry on 29 March, with its concluding words: &quot;Last entry. For God&#x27;s sake look after our people&quot;. He left letters to Wilson&#x27;s mother, Bowers&#x27; mother, a string of notables including his former commander, Sir George Egerton, his own mother and his wife.

He also wrote his &quot;Message to the Public&quot;, primarily a vindication of the expedition&#x27;s organisation and conduct in which the party&#x27;s failure is attributed to weather and other misfortunes, but ending on an inspirational note, with these words:
Scott is presumed to have died on 29 March 1912, or possibly one day later. The positions of the bodies in the tent when it was discovered eight months later suggested that Scott was the last of the three to die.

In his final journal entry he wrote:
The bodies of Scott and his companions were discovered by a search party on 12 November 1912. Tryggve Gran, who was part of the search party, described the scene as, &quot;snowcovered til up above the door, with Scott in the middle, half out of his  ... the frost had made the skin yellow &amp; transparent &amp; I’ve never seen anything worse in my life.&quot; Their final camp became their tomb; their records and personal belongings were retrieved before the tent roof was lowered over the bodies and a high cairn of snow was erected over it, topped by a roughly fashioned cross, erected using Gran&#x27;s skis. Next to their bodies lay of &quot;Glossopteris&quot; tree fossils which they had dragged on hand sledges. These were the first ever discovered Antarctic fossils and proved that Antarctica had once been warm and connected to other continents.

In January 1913, before &quot;Terra Nova&quot; left for home, a large wooden cross was made by the ship&#x27;s carpenters, inscribed with the names of the lost party and Tennyson&#x27;s line from his poem &quot;Ulysses&quot;: &quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot;, and was erected as a permanent memorial on Observation Hill, overlooking Hut Point.

== Reputation ==

=== Recognition ===

The world was informed of the tragedy when &quot;Terra Nova&quot; reached Oamaru, New Zealand, on 10 February 1913. Within days, Scott became a national icon. A nationalistic spirit was aroused; the &quot;London Evening News&quot; called for the story to be read to schoolchildren throughout the land, to coincide with the memorial service at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on 14 February. Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts Association, asked: &quot;Are Britons going downhill? No! ... There is plenty of pluck and spirit left in the British after all. Captain Scott and Captain Oates have shown us that&quot;.

The expedition&#x27;s survivors were suitably honoured on their return, with polar medals and promotions for the naval personnel. In place of the knighthood that might have been her husband&#x27;s had he survived, Kathleen Scott was granted the rank and precedence of a widow of a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. In 1922, she married Edward Hilton Young, later Lord Kennet, and remained a doughty defender of Scott&#x27;s reputation until her death, aged 69, in 1947.

An article in &quot;The Times&quot;, reporting on the glowing tributes paid to Scott in the New York press, claimed that both Amundsen and Shackleton were &quot;[amazed] to hear that such a disaster could overtake a well-organized expedition&quot;. On learning the details of Scott&#x27;s death, Amundsen is reported to have said, &quot;I would gladly forgo any honour or money if thereby I could have saved Scott his terrible death&quot;. Scott was the better wordsmith of the two, and the story that spread throughout the world was largely that told by him, with Amundsen&#x27;s victory reduced in the eyes of many to an unsporting stratagem.

The response to Scott&#x27;s final plea on behalf of the dependents of the dead was enormous by the standards of the day. The Mansion House Scott Memorial Fund closed at . This was not equally distributed; Scott&#x27;s widow, son, mother and sisters received a total of . Wilson&#x27;s widow received and Bowers&#x27;s mother received . Edgar Evans&#x27;s widow, children, and mother received between them.

In the dozen years following the tragedy, more than 30 monuments and memorials were set up in Britain alone, including the foundation of the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge. Many more were established in other parts of the world, including a statue sculpted by Scott&#x27;s widow for his New Zealand base in Christchurch. A number of institutions have relics and personal belongings from the expedition. Scott&#x27;s snow shoes, sledging goggles and the book bag for his diary are held in the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich. The Museum of Oxford contains among other items a marmalade tin gifted to Scott by an Oxford businessman which was recovered from the site of his death. The Museum of Timekeeping at Upton Hall, Nottinghamshire, England, has the pocket watch which was found with his body. Scott&#x27;s sledging flag is held in Exeter Cathedral.

=== Modern reactions ===

Scott&#x27;s reputation survived the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death. In 1948, the film &quot;Scott of the Antarctic&quot; was released in cinemas and was the third most popular film in Britain the following year. It portrays the team spirit of the expedition and the harsh Antarctic environment, but also includes critical scenes such as Scott regarding his broken down motors and ruefully remembering Nansen&#x27;s advice to take only dogs. Evans and Cherry-Garrard were the only surviving expedition members to refuse participation in the film, but both re-published their respective books in its wake.

In 1966, Reginald Pound, the first biographer given access to Scott&#x27;s original sledging journal, revealed personal failings which cast a new light on Scott, although Pound continued to endorse his heroism, writing of &quot;a splendid sanity that would not be subdued&quot;. Another book critical of Scott, David Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Scott&#x27;s Men&quot;, was released in 1977. In Thomson&#x27;s view, Scott was not a great man, &quot;at least, not until near the end&quot;; his planning is described as &quot;haphazard&quot; and &quot;flawed&quot;, his leadership characterised by lack of foresight. Thus by the late 1970s, biographer Max Jones stated, &quot;Scott&#x27;s complex personality had been revealed and his methods questioned&quot;.

In 1979 came the first extreme attack on Scott, from Roland Huntford&#x27;s dual biography &quot;Scott and Amundsen&quot; in which Scott is depicted as a &quot;heroic bungler&quot;. Huntford&#x27;s thesis had an immediate impact, becoming the contemporary orthodoxy. After Huntford&#x27;s book, several other mostly negative books about Captain Scott were published; Francis Spufford, in a 1996 history not wholly antagonistic to Scott, refers to &quot;devastating evidence of bungling&quot;, concluding that &quot;Scott doomed his companions, then covered his tracks with rhetoric&quot;. Travel writer Paul Theroux summarised Scott as &quot;confused and demoralised ... an enigma to his men, unprepared and a bungler&quot;. This decline in Scott&#x27;s reputation was accompanied by a corresponding rise in that of his erstwhile rival Shackleton, at first in the United States but eventually in Britain as well. A 2002 nationwide poll in the United Kingdom to discover the &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot; showed Shackleton in eleventh place, Scott well down the list at 54th.

The 21st century has seen a shift of opinion in Scott&#x27;s favour, in what cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski calls &quot;a revision of the revisionist view&quot;. Meteorologist Susan Solomon&#x27;s 2001 account &quot;The Coldest March&quot; ties the fate of Scott&#x27;s party to the extraordinarily adverse Barrier weather conditions of February and March 1912 rather than to personal or organisational failings and, while not entirely questioning any criticism of Scott, Solomon principally characterises the criticism as the &quot;Myth of Scott as a bungler&quot;.

In 2005 David Crane published a new Scott biography in which he comes to the conclusion that Scott is possibly the only figure in polar history except Lawrence Oates &quot;so wholly obscured by legend&quot;. According to Barczewski, he goes some way towards an assessment of Scott &quot;free from the baggage of earlier interpretations&quot;. What has happened to Scott&#x27;s reputation, Crane argues, derives from the way the world has changed since the &quot;hopeless heroism and obscene waste&quot; of the First World War. At the time of Scott&#x27;s death, people clutched at the proof he gave that the qualities that made Britain, indeed the British Empire, great were not extinct. Future generations mindful of the carnage that started years later, the ideals of unquestionable duty, self-sacrifice, discipline, patriotism and hierarchy associated with his tragedy take on a different and more sinister colouring.

Crane&#x27;s main achievement, according to Barczewski, is the restoration of Scott&#x27;s humanity, &quot;far more effectively than either Fiennes&#x27;s stridency or Solomon&#x27;s scientific data.&quot; &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; columnist Jasper Rees, likening the changes in explorers&#x27; reputations to climatic variations, suggests that &quot;in the current Antarctic weather report, Scott is enjoying his first spell in the sun for twenty-five years&quot;. The &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; was more critical, pointing out Crane&#x27;s support for Scott&#x27;s account regarding the circumstances of the freeing of the &quot;Discovery&quot; from the pack ice, and concluded that &quot;For all the many attractions of his book, David Crane offers no answers that convincingly exonerate Scott from a significant share of responsibility for his own demise.&quot;

In 2012, Karen May published her discovery that Scott had issued written orders, before his march to the Pole, for Meares to meet the returning party with dog-teams, in contrast to Huntford&#x27;s assertion in 1979 that Scott issued those vital instructions only as a casual oral order to Evans during the march to the Pole. According to May, &quot;Huntford&#x27;s scenario was pure invention based on an error; it has led a number of polar historians down a regrettable false trail&quot;.

The expedition was the subject of &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, a 1977 play by Ted Tally (who later wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;). Beryl Bainbridge&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;The Birthday Boys&quot; also gives a fictionalised account of the expedition, with monologues from the five men who died on the return from the pole.

<text>Raymond Thornton Chandler (July 23, 1888 – March 26, 1959) was an American-British novelist and screenwriter. In 1932, at the age of forty-four, Chandler became a detective fiction writer after losing his job as an oil company executive during the Great Depression. His first short story, &quot;Blackmailers Don&#x27;t Shoot&quot;, was published in 1933 in &quot;Black Mask,&quot; a popular pulp magazine. His first novel, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, was published in 1939. In addition to his short stories, Chandler published seven novels during his lifetime (an eighth, in progress at the time of his death, was completed by Robert B. Parker). All but &quot;Playback&quot; have been made into motion pictures, some more than once. In the year before his death, he was elected president of the Mystery Writers of America.

Chandler had an immense stylistic influence on American popular literature. He is a founder of the hardboiled school of detective fiction, along with Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain and other &quot;Black Mask&quot; writers. The protagonist of his novels, Philip Marlowe, like Hammett&#x27;s Sam Spade, is considered by some to be synonymous with &quot;private detective&quot;. Both were played in films by Humphrey Bogart, whom many consider to be the quintessential Marlowe.

&quot;The Big Sleep&quot; placed second on the Crime Writers Association poll of the 100 best crime novels; &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (1940), &quot;The Lady in the Lake&quot; (1943) and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1953) also made the list. The latter novel was praised in an anthology of American crime stories as &quot;arguably the first book since Hammett&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Key&quot;, published more than twenty years earlier, to qualify as a serious and significant mainstream novel that just happened to possess elements of mystery&quot;. Chandler was also a perceptive critic of detective fiction; his &quot;The Simple Art of Murder&quot; is the canonical essay in the field. In it he wrote: &quot;Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid. The detective must be a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor—by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it. He must be the best man in his world and a good enough man for any world.&quot;

Parker wrote that, with Marlowe, &quot;Chandler seems to have created the culminating American hero: wised up, hopeful, thoughtful, adventurous, sentimental, cynical and rebellious—an innocent who knows better, a Romantic who is tough enough to sustain Romanticism in a world that has seen the eternal footman hold its coat and snicker. Living at the end of the Far West, where the American dream ran out of room, no hero has ever been more congruent with his landscape. Chandler had the right hero in the right place, and engaged him in the consideration of good and evil at precisely the time when our central certainty of good no longer held.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Chandler was born in 1888 in Chicago, the son of Florence Dart (Thornton) and Maurice Benjamin Chandler. He spent his early years in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, living with his mother and father near his cousins and his aunt (his mother&#x27;s sister) and uncle. Chandler&#x27;s father, an alcoholic civil engineer who worked for the railway, abandoned the family in the early 1890s. To obtain the best possible education for Raymond, his mother, who was originally from Ireland, went to live in England with Raymond in 1900 (in Upper Norwood, now in the London Borough of Croydon). Raymond lived there with his mother, unmarried aunt, and maternal grandmother between 1901 and 1907. Another uncle, a successful lawyer in Waterford, Ireland, reluctantly supported them while they lived in London. Raymond was a first cousin to the actor Max Adrian, a founding member of the Royal Shakespeare Company; Max&#x27;s mother Mabel was a sister of Florence Thornton. Chandler was classically educated at Dulwich College, London (a public school whose alumni include the authors P. G. Wodehouse and C. S. Forester). He spent some of his childhood summers in Waterford in Ireland with his mother&#x27;s family. He did not go to university, instead spending time in Paris and Munich improving his foreign language skills. In 1907, he was naturalized as a British subject in order to take the civil service examination, which he passed. He then took an Admiralty job, lasting just over a year. His first poem was published during that time.

Chandler disliked the servility of the civil service and resigned, to the consternation of his family, became a reporter for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and also wrote for &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;. He was unsuccessful as a journalist, but he published reviews and continued writing romantic poetry. An encounter with the slightly older Richard Barham Middleton is said to have influenced him into postponing his career as writer. &quot;I met ... also a young, bearded, and sad-eyed man called Richard Middleton. ... Shortly afterwards he committed suicide in Antwerp, a suicide of despair, I should say. The incident made a great impression on me, because Middleton struck me as having far more talent than I was ever likely to possess; and if he couldn&#x27;t make a go of it, it wasn&#x27;t very likely that I could.&quot; Accounting for that time he said, &quot;Of course in those days as now there were ... clever young men who made a decent living as freelances for the numerous literary weeklies&quot;, but &quot;I was distinctly not a clever young man. Nor was I at all a happy young man.&quot;

In 1912, at the age of 24, he borrowed money from his Waterford uncle, who expected it to be repaid with interest, and returned to America, visiting his aunt and uncle before settling in San Francisco for a time, where he took a correspondence course in bookkeeping, finishing ahead of schedule. His mother joined him there in late 1912. Encouraged by Chandler&#x27;s attorney/oilman friend Warren Lloyd, they moved to Los Angeles in 1913, where he strung tennis rackets, picked fruit and endured a time of scrimping and saving. He found steady employment with the Los Angeles Creamery. In 1917, he traveled to Victoria, where in August he enlisted in the 50th Reinforcement Battalion Canadian Expeditionary Force. He saw combat in the trenches in France with the 7th Battalion C.E.F. (British Columbia Regiment). He was twice hospitalized with Spanish flu during the pandemic and was undergoing flight training in the fledgling Royal Air Force (RAF) when the war ended.

After the armistice, he returned to Los Angeles by way of Vancouver, and soon began a love affair with Pearl Eugenie (&quot;Cissy&quot;) Pascal, a married woman 18 years his senior and the stepmother of Gordon Pascal, with whom Chandler had enlisted. Cissy amicably divorced her husband, Julian, in 1920, but Chandler&#x27;s mother disapproved of the relationship and refused to sanction the marriage. For the next four years Chandler supported both his mother and Cissy. After the death of Florence Chandler on September 26, 1923, he was free to marry Cissy. They were married on February 6, 1924. Having begun in 1922 as a bookkeeper and auditor, Chandler was by 1931 a highly paid vice president of the Dabney Oil Syndicate, but his alcoholism, absenteeism, promiscuity with female employees, and threatened suicides contributed to his dismissal a year later, after ten years with the company.

===As a writer===
In straitened financial circumstances during the Great Depression, Chandler turned to his latent writing talent to earn a living, teaching himself to write pulp fiction by analyzing and imitating a novelette by Erle Stanley Gardner. Chandler&#x27;s first professional work, &quot;Blackmailers Don&#x27;t Shoot&quot;, was published in &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine in 1933. According to genre historian Herbert Ruhm, &quot;Chandler, who worked slowly and painstakingly, revising again and again, had taken five months to write the story. Erle Stanley Gardner could turn out a pulp story in three or four days—and turned out an estimated one thousand.&quot;

His first novel, &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, was published in 1939, featuring the detective Philip Marlowe, speaking in the first person. In 1950, Chandler described in a letter to his English publisher, Hamish Hamilton, why he began reading pulp magazines and later wrote for them:

Wandering up and down the Pacific Coast in an automobile I began to read pulp magazines, because they were cheap enough to throw away and because I never had at any time any taste for the kind of thing which is known as women&#x27;s magazines. This was in the great days of the &quot;Black Mask&quot; (if I may call them great days) and it struck me that some of the writing was pretty forceful and honest, even though it had its crude aspect. I decided that this might be a good way to try to learn to write fiction and get paid a small amount of money at the same time. I spent five months over an 18,000 word novelette and sold it for $180. After that I never looked back, although I had a good many uneasy periods looking forward.

His second Marlowe novel, &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (1940), became the basis for three movie versions adapted by other screenwriters, including the 1944 film &quot;Murder My Sweet&quot;, which marked the screen debut of the Marlowe character, played by Dick Powell (whose depiction of Marlowe was applauded by Chandler). Literary success and film adaptations led to a demand for Chandler himself as a screenwriter. He and Billy Wilder co-wrote &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), based on James M. Cain&#x27;s novel of the same title. The noir screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. Said Wilder, &quot;I would just guide the structure and I would also do a lot of the dialogue, and he (Chandler) would then comprehend and start constructing too.&quot; Wilder acknowledged that the dialogue which makes the film so memorable was largely Chandler&#x27;s.

Chandler&#x27;s only produced original screenplay was &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; (1946). He had not written a denouement for the script and, according to producer John Houseman, Chandler concluded he could finish the script only if drunk, with the assistance of round-the-clock secretaries and drivers, which Houseman agreed to. The script gained Chandler&#x27;s second Academy Award nomination for screenplay.

Chandler collaborated on the screenplay of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), an ironic murder story based on Patricia Highsmith&#x27;s novel, which he thought implausible. Chandler clashed with Hitchcock and they stopped talking after Hitchcock heard Chandler had referred to him as &quot;that fat bastard&quot;. Hitchcock made a show of throwing Chandler&#x27;s two draft screenplays into the studio trash can while holding his nose, but Chandler retained the lead screenwriting credit along with Czenzi Ormonde.

In 1946, the Chandlers moved to La Jolla, an affluent coastal neighborhood of San Diego, California, where Chandler wrote two more Philip Marlowe novels, &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; and his last completed work, &quot;Playback&quot;. The latter was derived from an unproduced courtroom drama screenplay he had written for Universal Studios.

Four chapters of a novel, unfinished at his death, were transformed into a final Philip Marlowe novel, &quot;Poodle Springs&quot;, by the mystery writer and Chandler admirer Robert B. Parker, in 1989. Parker shares the authorship with Chandler. Parker subsequently wrote a sequel to &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; entitled &quot;Perchance to Dream&quot;, which was salted with quotes from the original novel. Chandler&#x27;s final Marlowe short story, circa 1957, was entitled &quot;The Pencil&quot;. It later provided the basis of an episode of the HBO miniseries (1983–86), &quot;Philip Marlowe, Private Eye&quot;, starring Powers Boothe as Marlowe.

In 2014, &quot;The Princess and the Pedlar&quot; (1917), a previously unknown comic operetta, with libretto by Chandler and music by Julian Pascal, was discovered among the uncatalogued holdings of the Library of Congress. The work was never published or produced. It has been dismissed by the Raymond Chandler estate as &quot;no more than… a curiosity.&quot; A small team under the direction of the actor and director Paul Sand is seeking permission to produce the operetta in Los Angeles.

===Later life and death===
Cissy Chandler died in 1954, after a long illness. Heartbroken and drunk, Chandler neglected to inter her cremated remains, and they sat for 57 years in a storage locker in the basement of Cypress View Mausoleum. When he died he was remembered as, &quot;the author of “&quot;The Big Sleep&quot;,” and other mystery novels.&quot;

After Cissy&#x27;s death, Chandler&#x27;s loneliness worsened his propensity for clinical depression; he returned to drinking alcohol, never quitting it for long, and the quality and quantity of his writing suffered. In 1955, he attempted suicide. In &quot;The Long Embrace: Raymond Chandler and the Woman He Loved&quot;, Judith Freeman says it was &quot;a cry for help,&quot; given that he called the police beforehand, saying he planned to kill himself. Chandler&#x27;s personal and professional life were both helped and complicated by the women to whom he was attracted, notably Helga Greene (his literary agent), Jean Fracasse (his secretary), Sonia Orwell (George Orwell&#x27;s widow), and Natasha Spender (Stephen Spender&#x27;s wife). Chandler regained his U.S. citizenship in 1956, while retaining his British rights.

After a respite in England, he returned to La Jolla. He died at Scripps Memorial Hospital of pneumonial peripheral vascular shock and prerenal uremia (according to the death certificate) in 1959. Helga Greene inherited Chandler&#x27;s $60,000 estate, after prevailing in a 1960 lawsuit filed by Fracasse contesting Chandler&#x27;s holographic codicil to his will.

Chandler is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery, in San Diego, California. As Frank MacShane noted in his biography, &quot;The Life of Raymond Chandler&quot;, Chandler wished to be cremated and placed next to Cissy in Cypress View Mausoleum. Instead, he was buried in Mount Hope, because he had left no funeral or burial instructions.

In 2010, Chandler historian Loren Latker, with the assistance of attorney Aissa Wayne (daughter of John Wayne), brought a petition to disinter Cissy&#x27;s remains and reinter them with Chandler in Mount Hope. After a hearing in September 2010 in San Diego Superior Court, Judge Richard S. Whitney entered an order granting Latker&#x27;s request.

On February 14, 2011, Cissy&#x27;s ashes were conveyed from Cypress View to Mount Hope and interred under a new grave marker above Chandler&#x27;s, as they had wished. About 100 people attended the ceremony, which included readings by the Rev. Randal Gardner, Powers Boothe, Judith Freeman and Aissa Wayne. The shared gravestone reads, &quot;Dead men are heavier than broken hearts&quot;, a quotation from &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;. Chandler&#x27;s original gravestone, placed by Jean Fracasse and her children, is still at the head of his grave; the new one is at the foot.

==Views on pulp fiction==
In his introduction to &quot;Trouble Is My Business&quot; (1950), a collection of many of his short stories, Chandler provided insight on the formula for the detective story and how the pulp magazines differed from previous detective stories:

Chandler also described the struggle that writers of pulp fiction had in following the formula demanded by the editors of the pulp magazines:

==Critical reception==
Critics and writers, including W. H. Auden, Evelyn Waugh and Ian Fleming, greatly admired Chandler&#x27;s prose. In a radio discussion with Chandler, Fleming said that Chandler offered &quot;some of the finest dialogue written in any prose today&quot;. Contemporary mystery writer Paul Levine has described Chandler&#x27;s style as the &quot;literary equivalent of a quick punch to the gut&quot;. Chandler&#x27;s swift-moving, hardboiled style was inspired mostly by Dashiell Hammett, but his sharp and lyrical similes are original: &quot;The muzzle of the Luger looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel&quot;; &quot;He had a heart as big as one of Mae West&#x27;s hips&quot;; &quot;Dead men are heavier than broken hearts&quot;; &quot;I went back to the seasteps and moved down them as cautiously as a cat on a wet floor&quot;; &quot;He was crazy as a pair of waltzing mice, but I liked him&quot;; &quot;I felt like an amputated leg&quot;; &quot;He was about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.&quot; Chandler&#x27;s writing redefined the private eye fiction genre, led to the coining of the adjective &quot;Chandleresque&quot;, and inevitably became the subject of parody and pastiche. Yet the detective Philip Marlowe is not a stereotypical tough guy, but a complex, sometimes sentimental man with few friends, who attended university, who speaks some Spanish and sometimes admires Mexicans and Blacks, and who is a student of chess and classical music. He is a man who refuses a prospective client&#x27;s fee for a job he considers unethical.

The high regard in which Chandler is generally held today is in contrast to the critical sniping that stung the author during his lifetime. In a March 1942 letter to Blanche Knopf, published in &quot;Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler&quot;, he wrote, &quot;The thing that rather gets me down is that when I write something that is tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, I get panned for being tough and fast and full of mayhem and murder, and then when I try to tone down a bit and develop the mental and emotional side of a situation, I get panned for leaving out what I was panned for putting in the first time.&quot;

Although his work enjoys general acclaim today, Chandler has been criticized for certain aspects of his writing. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reviewer Patrick Anderson described his plots as &quot;rambling at best and incoherent at worst&quot; (notoriously, even Chandler did not know who murdered the chauffeur in &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;) and Anderson criticized Chandler&#x27;s treatment of black, female, and homosexual characters, calling him a &quot;rather nasty man at times&quot;. Anderson nevertheless praised Chandler as &quot;probably the most lyrical of the major crime writers&quot;.

Chandler&#x27;s short stories and novels are evocatively written, conveying the time, place and ambiance of Los Angeles and environs in the 1930s and 1940s. The places are real, if pseudonymous: Bay City is Santa Monica, Gray Lake is Silver Lake, and Idle Valley a synthesis of wealthy San Fernando Valley communities.

&quot;Playback&quot; is the only one of his novels not to have been made into a movie. Arguably the most notable adaptation is Howard Hawks &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1946), with Humphrey Bogart as Marlowe. William Faulkner and Leigh Brackett were co-writers of the screenplay. Chandler&#x27;s few screenwriting efforts and the cinematic adaptation of his novels proved stylistically and thematically influential on the American film noir genre. Notable for its revised take on Marlowe is Robert Altman&#x27;s 1973 neo-noir adaptation of &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2014, the Hollywood Walk of Fame selection committee announced that Raymond Chandler would be included the following year, but as of 2024, he has not been.

The intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Cahuenga Avenue in Hollywood, California is named Raymond Chandler Square, a tribute both to the author and to the belief that Phillip Marlowe&#x27;s office was located in Security Trust and Savings at the northeast corner of this intersection. In 1994, the Square was designated Los Angeles Historic Cultural Monument #597.

Noirfest&#x27;s lifetime achievement award is named the Raymond Chandler Award. In 1991, Fulbright Program gave out a &quot;Raymond Chandler Mystery Writing Award&quot; and in 1994, they gave out a &quot;Raymond Chandler Award&quot;.

<doc id="25665" wikidata="Q46299" url="?curid=25665" title="Rosaceae">
<text>Rosaceae (), the rose family, is a family of flowering plants that includes 4,828 known species in 91 genera.

The name is derived from the type genus &quot;Rosa&quot;. The family includes herbs, shrubs, and trees. Most species are deciduous, but some are evergreen. They have a worldwide range but are most diverse in the Northern Hemisphere.

Many economically important products come from the Rosaceae, including various edible fruits, such as apples, pears, quinces, apricots, plums, cherries, peaches, raspberries, blackberries, loquats, strawberries, rose hips, hawthorns, and almonds. The family also includes popular ornamental trees and shrubs, such as roses, meadowsweets, rowans, firethorns, and photinias.

Among the most species-rich genera in the family are &quot;Alchemilla&quot; (270), &quot;Sorbus&quot; (260), &quot;Crataegus&quot; (260), &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; (260), &quot;Rubus&quot; (250), and &quot;Prunus&quot; (200), which contains the plums, cherries, peaches, apricots, and almonds. However, all of these numbers should be seen as estimates—much taxonomic work remains.

== Description ==
Rosaceae can be woody trees, shrubs, climbers or herbaceous plants. The herbs are mostly perennials, but some annuals also exist, such as &quot;Aphanes arvensis&quot;.

===Leaves===
The leaves are generally arranged spirally, but have an opposite arrangement in some species. They can be simple or pinnately compound (either odd- or even-pinnate). Compound leaves appear in around 30 genera. The leaf margin is most often serrate. Paired stipules are generally present and are considered a primitive feature within the family, though they have been independently lost in many groups of Amygdaloideae (previously called Spiraeoideae). The stipules are sometimes adnate (attached surface to surface) to the petiole. Glands or extrafloral nectaries may be present on leaf margins or petioles. Spines may be present on the midrib of leaflets and the rachis of compound leaves.

===Flowers===
Flowers of plants in the rose family are generally described as &quot;showy&quot;. They are radially symmetrical, and almost always hermaphroditic. Rosaceae generally have five sepals, five petals, and many spirally arranged stamens. The bases of the sepals, petals, and stamens are fused together to form a characteristic cup-like structure called a hypanthium. They can be arranged in spikes, or heads. Solitary flowers are rare. Rosaceae have a variety of color petals, but blue is almost completely absent.

===Fruits and seeds===
The fruits occur in many varieties and were once considered the main characters for the definition of subfamilies amongst Rosaceae, giving rise to a fundamentally artificial subdivision. They can be follicles, capsules, nuts, achenes, drupes (&quot;Prunus&quot;), and accessory fruits, like the pome of an apple, the hip of a rose, or the receptacle-derived aggregate accessory fruit of a strawberry. Many fruits of the family are edible, but their seeds often contain amygdalin, which can release cyanide during digestion if the seed is damaged.

==Taxonomy==

=== Taxonomic history ===
The family was traditionally divided into six subfamilies: Rosoideae, Spiraeoideae, Maloideae (Pomoideae), Amygdaloideae (Prunoideae), Neuradoideae, and Chrysobalanoideae, and most of these were treated as families by various authors. More recently (1971), Chrysobalanoideae was placed in Malpighiales in molecular analyses and Neuradoideae has been assigned to Malvales. Schulze-Menz, in Engler&#x27;s Syllabus edited by Melchior (1964) recognized Rosoideae, Dryadoideae, Lyonothamnoideae, Spireoideae, Amygdaloideae, and Maloideae. They were primarily diagnosed by the structure of the fruits. More recent work has identified that not all of these groups were monophyletic. Hutchinson (1964) and Kalkman (2004) recognized only tribes (17 and 21, respectively). Takhtajan (1997) delimited 21 tribes in 10 subfamilies: Filipenduloideae, Rosoideae, Ruboideae, Potentilloideae, Coleogynoideae, Kerroideae, Amygdaloideae (Prunoideae), Spireoideae, Maloideae (Pyroideae), Dichotomanthoideae. A more modern model comprises three subfamilies, one of which (Rosoideae) has largely remained the same.

While the boundaries of the Rosaceae are not disputed, there is no general agreement as to how many genera it contains. Areas of divergent opinion include the treatment of &quot;Potentilla s.l.&quot; and &quot;Sorbus s.l.&quot;. Compounding the problem is that apomixis is common in several genera. This results in an uncertainty in the number of species contained in each of these genera, due to the difficulty of dividing apomictic complexes into species. For example, &quot;Cotoneaster&quot; contains between 70 and 300 species, &quot;Rosa&quot; around 100 (including the taxonomically complex dog roses), &quot;Sorbus&quot; 100 to 200 species, &quot;Crataegus&quot; between 200 and 1,000, &quot;Alchemilla&quot; around 300 species, &quot;Potentilla&quot; roughly 500, and &quot;Rubus&quot; hundreds, or possibly even thousands of species.

=== Genera ===
Identified clades include:
* Subfamily Rosoideae: Traditionally composed of those genera bearing aggregate fruits that are made up of small achenes or drupelets, and often the fleshy part of the fruit (e.g. strawberry) is the receptacle or the stalk bearing the carpels. The circumscription is now narrowed (excluding, for example, the Dryadoideae), but it still remains a diverse group containing five or six tribes and 20 or more genera, including rose, &quot;Rubus&quot; (blackberry, raspberry), &quot;Fragaria&quot; (strawberry), &quot;Potentilla&quot;, and &quot;Geum&quot;.
* Subfamily Amygdaloideae: Within this group remains an identified clade with a pome fruit, traditionally known as subfamily Maloideae (or Pyroideae) which included genera such as apple, &quot;Cotoneaster&quot;, and &quot;Crataegus&quot; (hawthorn). To separate it at the subfamily level would leave the remaining genera as a paraphyletic group, so it has been expanded to include the former Spiraeoideae and Amygdaloideae. The subfamily has sometimes been referred to by the name &quot;Spiraeoideae&quot;, but this is not permitted by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants.
* Subfamily Dryadoideae: Fruits are achenes with hairy styles, and includes five genera (&quot;Dryas&quot;, &quot;Cercocarpus&quot;, &quot;Chamaebatia&quot;, &quot;Cowania&quot;, and &quot;Purshia&quot;), most species of which form root nodules which host nitrogen-fixing bacteria from the genus &quot;Frankia&quot;.

=== Phylogeny ===
The phylogenetic relationships between the three subfamilies within Rosaceae are unresolved. There are three competing hypotheses:

==== Amygdaloideae basal ====
Amygdaloideae has been identified as the earliest branching subfamily by Chin et al. (2014), Li et al. (2015), Li et al. (2016), and Sun et al. (2016). Most recently Zhang et al. (2017) recovered these relationships using whole plastid genomes:

The sister relationship between Dryadoideae and Rosoideae is supported by the following shared morphological characters not found in Amygdaloideae: presence of stipules, separation of the hypanthium from the ovary, and the fruits are usually achenes.

==== Dryadoideae basal ====
Dryadoideae has been identified as the earliest branching subfamily by Evans et al. (2002) and Potter (2003). Most recently Xiang et al. (2017) recovered these relationships using nuclear transcriptomes:

==== Rosoideae basal ====
Rosoideae has been identified as the earliest branching subfamily by Morgan et al. (1994), Evans (1999), Potter et al. (2002), Potter et al. (2007), Töpel et al. (2012), and Chen et al. (2016). The following is taken from Potter et al. (2007):

The sister relationship between Amygdaloideae and Dryadoideae is supported by the following shared biochemical characters not found in Rosoideae: production of cyanogenic glycosides and production of sorbitol.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Rosaceae have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found nearly everywhere except for Antarctica. They are primarily concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere in regions that are not desert or tropical rainforest.

== Uses ==
The rose family is considered one of the six most economically important crop plant families, and includes apples, pears, quinces, medlars, loquats, almonds, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, sloes, and roses.

Many genera are also highly valued ornamental plants. These include trees and shrubs (&quot;Cotoneaster&quot;, &quot;Chaenomeles&quot;, &quot;Crataegus&quot;, &quot;Dasiphora&quot;, &quot;Exochorda&quot;, &quot;Kerria&quot;, &quot;Photinia&quot;, &quot;Physocarpus&quot;, &quot;Prunus&quot;, &quot;Pyracantha&quot;, &quot;Rhodotypos&quot;, &quot;Rosa&quot;, &quot;Sorbus&quot;, &quot;Spiraea&quot;), herbaceous perennials (&quot;Alchemilla&quot;, &quot;Aruncus&quot;, &quot;Filipendula&quot;, &quot;Geum&quot;, &quot;Potentilla&quot;, &quot;Sanguisorba&quot;), alpine plants (&quot;Dryas&quot;, &quot;Geum&quot;, &quot;Potentilla&quot;) and climbers (&quot;Rosa&quot;).

However, several genera are also introduced noxious weeds in some parts of the world, costing money to be controlled. These invasive plants can have negative impacts on the diversity of local ecosystems once established. Such naturalised pests include &quot;Acaena&quot;, &quot;Cotoneaster&quot;, &quot;Crataegus&quot;, and &quot;Pyracantha&quot;.

In Bulgaria and parts of western Asia, the production of rose oil from fresh flowers such as &quot;Rosa damascena&quot;, &quot;Rosa gallica&quot;, and other species is an important economic industry.

<doc id="25671" wikidata="Q193156" url="?curid=25671" title="Ralph Nader">
<text>Ralph Nader (; born February 27, 1934) is an American political activist involved in consumer protection, environmentalism, and government reform causes. He is a perennial presidential candidate. His 1965 book &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;, which criticized the automotive industry for its safety record, helped lead to the passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act in 1966.

The son of Lebanese immigrants to the United States, Nader attended Princeton University and Harvard Law School. He quickly developed an interest in vehicle designs that were hazardous and contributed to elevated levels of car accidents and fatalities. Published in 1965, &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot; became a highly influential critique of the safety record of American automobile manufacturers, focusing on General Motors&#x27; (GM&#x27;s) Corvair automobile in particular.

Following the publication of &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;, Nader led a group of volunteer law students—dubbed &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot;—in an investigation of the Federal Trade Commission, leading directly to that agency&#x27;s overhaul and reform. In the 1970s, Nader leveraged his growing popularity to establish a number of advocacy and watchdog groups including the Public Interest Research Group, the Center for Auto Safety, and Public Citizen. Two of Nader&#x27;s most notable targets were the Chevy Corvair and the Ford Pinto.

Nader made four bids to become President of the United States, running with the Green Party in 1996 and 2000, the Reform Party in 2004, and as an independent in 2008. In each campaign, Nader said he sought to highlight under-reported issues and a perceived need for electoral reform. He received nearly three million votes during his 2000 candidacy, but also stirred controversy over allegations that his campaign helped Republican candidate George W. Bush win a close election against Democratic candidate Al Gore. In 2006 &quot;The Atlantic Monthly,&quot; calling Nader one of the hundred most influential Americans in history, said, &quot;He made the cars we drive safer; thirty years later, he made George W. Bush the president.&quot;

A two-time Nieman Fellow, Nader is the author or co-author of more than two dozen books and was the subject of a documentary film on his life and work, &quot;An Unreasonable Man&quot;, which debuted at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. He has been repeatedly named to lists of the &quot;100 Most Influential Americans&quot;, including those published by &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as a &quot;dissident&quot;.

== Early life and education==
Ralph Nader was born on February 27, 1934, in Winsted, Connecticut, to Rose (née Bouziane) and Nathra Nader, both of whom were Antiochian Greek Christian immigrants from Mount Lebanon and the Beqaa Valley in Southeastern Lebanon. After settling in Connecticut, Nathra Nader worked in a textile mill before opening a bakery and restaurant. Ralph Nader occasionally helped at his father&#x27;s restaurant, as well as worked as a newspaper delivery boy for the local paper, the Winsted &quot;Register Citizen&quot;. Nader graduated from The Gilbert School in 1951, going on to attend Princeton University. Though he was offered a scholarship to Princeton, his father forced him to decline it on the grounds that the family was able to pay Nader&#x27;s tuition and the funds should go to a student who could not afford it. Nader graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa with a Bachelor of Arts from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1955 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;Lebanese Agriculture&quot;.

After graduating from Princeton, Nader enrolled at Harvard Law School, though he quickly became bored by his courses. While at Harvard, Nader would frequently skip classes to hitchhike across the U.S. where he would engage in field research on Native American issues and migrant worker rights. He earned a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) from Harvard in 1958. Nader identified with libertarian philosophy in his youth, but gradually shifted away in his early 20s. Although Nader acknowledged that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like public housing because it disadvantaged landlords unfairly&quot;, his viewpoint changed when he &quot;saw the slums and what landlords did&quot;. After graduating from Harvard, Nader served in the U.S. Army as a cook and was posted to Fort Dix.

== Career ==
===Early history===
In 1959, Nader was admitted to the bar and began practice as a lawyer in Hartford, Connecticut, while also lecturing at the University of Hartford and traveling to the Soviet Union, Chile, and Cuba, where he filed dispatches for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;. In 1964, he moved to Washington, D.C., taking a position as a consultant to Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

===&quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;===
Nader gained national attention with the 1965 publication of his journalistic exposé &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;. The book, critical of the automotive industry, argued that many American automobiles were generally unsafe to operate. For the book, Nader researched case files from more than a hundred lawsuits then pending against General Motors&#x27; Chevrolet Corvair to support his assertions.

The book became an immediate bestseller, but also prompted a backlash from General Motors (GM), which attempted to discredit Nader. GM tapped Nader&#x27;s phone in an attempt to obtain salacious information and, when that failed, GM hired prostitutes in an attempt to catch him in a compromising situation. Nader, by then working as an unpaid consultant to United States Senator Abe Ribicoff, reported to the senator that he suspected he was being followed. Ribicoff convened an inquiry that called GM CEO James Roche who admitted, when placed under oath, that the company had hired a private detective agency to investigate Nader. Nader sued GM for invasion of privacy, settling the case for $425,000 and using the proceeds to found the activist organization known as the Center for the Study of Responsive Law.

A year following the publication of &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed&quot;, Congress unanimously enacted the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Speaker of the United States House of Representatives John William McCormack said the passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act was brought about by the &quot;crusading spirit of one individual who believed he could do something: Ralph Nader&quot;.

===&quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot;, Public Citizen and Center for Auto Safety===
In 1968, Nader recruited seven volunteer law students, dubbed &quot;Nader&#x27;s Raiders&quot; by the Washington press corps, to evaluate the efficacy and operation of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The group&#x27;s ensuing report, which criticized the body as &quot;ineffective&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; led to an American Bar Association investigation of the FTC. Based on the results of that second study, Richard Nixon revitalized the agency and sent it on a path of vigorous consumer protection and antitrust enforcement for the rest of the 1970s.

Nader&#x27;s Raiders became involved in such issues as nuclear safety, international trade, regulation of insecticides, meat processing, pension reform, land use, and banking.

Following the publication of the report, Nader founded the watchdog group Public Citizen in 1971 to engage in public interest lobbying and activism on issues of consumer rights. He also served on its board of directors until 1980.

===1970s–1990s===

By the early 1970s Nader had established himself as a household name. In a critical memo written by Lewis Powell to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Powell warned business representatives that Nader &quot;has become a legend in his own time and an idol of millions of Americans&quot;.

Ralph Nader&#x27;s name appeared in the press as a potential candidate for president for the first time in 1971, when he was offered the opportunity to run as the presidential candidate for the New Party, a progressive split-off from the Democratic Party. Chief among his advocates was author Gore Vidal, who touted a 1972 Nader presidential campaign in a front-page article in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Best Man/&#x27;72&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Nader declined the advances.

In 1973, Ralph Nader was plaintiff in the case against acting attorney general Robert Bork, who under orders of President Richard Nixon had fired special prosecutor Archibald Cox in the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, an action that was ultimately ruled illegal by federal judge Gerhard Gesell.

In 1974, he received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen.

In the 1970s, Nader turned his attention to environmental activism, becoming a key leader in the antinuclear power movement, described by one observer as the &quot;titular head of opposition to nuclear energy&quot;. The Critical Mass Energy Project was formed by Nader in 1974 as a national anti-nuclear umbrella group, growing to become the largest national anti-nuclear group in the United States, with several hundred local affiliates and an estimated 200,000 supporters. The organization&#x27;s main efforts were directed at lobbying activities and providing local groups with scientific and other resources to campaign against nuclear power.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, through his ongoing work with Public Citizen, Nader continued to be involved in issues of consumer rights and public accountability. His work testifying before Congress, drafting model legislation, and organizing citizen letter-writing and protest efforts, earned him direct credit for the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Clean Water Act, Consumer Product Safety Act, and Whistleblower Protection Act.

In the late 1990s, Nader accused Microsoft of being a monopoly and organized a conference featuring Microsoft&#x27;s critics from the tech world.

In 1999, Nader was unsuccessfully approached by Nike to appear in an advertisement. The firm offered Nader $25,000 to say &quot;another shameless attempt by Nike to sell shoes&quot; while holding Air 120 sneakers. After Nader turned down the offer, the corporation hired filmmaker Spike Lee.

=== Presidential campaigns ===

==== 1972 ====

Ralph Nader&#x27;s name appeared in the press as a potential candidate for president for the first time in 1971, when he was offered the opportunity to run as the presidential candidate for the New Party, a progressive split-off from the Democratic Party in 1972. Chief among his advocates was author Gore Vidal, who touted a 1972 Nader presidential campaign in a front-page article in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine in 1971. Psychologist Alan Rockway organized a &quot;draft Ralph Nader for President&quot; campaign in Florida on the New Party&#x27;s behalf. Nader declined their offer to run that year; the New Party ultimately joined with the People&#x27;s Party in running Benjamin Spock in the 1972 presidential election. Spock had hoped Nader in particular would run, getting &quot;some of the loudest applause of the evening&quot; when mentioning him at the University of Alabama. Spock went on to try to recruit Nader for the party among over 100 others, and indicated he would be &quot;delighted&quot; to be replaced by any of them even after he accepted the nomination himself. Nader received one vote for the vice-presidential nomination at the 1972 Democratic National Convention.

==== 1980 ====
In the 1980 Presidential Election, the progressive-oriented Citizens Party approached Nader with the prospect of running as their Presidential Nominee. Nader declined their offer stating &quot;I will never run for president&quot;. The party ended up nominating biologist Barry Commoner instead.

==== 1992 ====

Nader stood in as a write-in for &quot;none of the above&quot; in both the 1992 New Hampshire Democratic and Republican Primaries and received 3,054 of the 170,333 Democratic votes and 3,258 of the 177,970 Republican votes cast. He was also a candidate in the 1992 Massachusetts Democratic Primary.

==== 1996 ====
Nader was drafted as a candidate for President of the United States on the Green Party ticket during the 1996 presidential election. He was not formally nominated by the Green Party USA, which was, at the time, the largest national Green group; instead he was nominated independently by various state Green parties (in some states, he appeared on the ballot as an independent). However, many activists in the Green Party USA worked actively to campaign for Nader that year. Nader qualified for ballot status in 22 states, garnering 685,297 votes or 0.71% of the popular vote (fourth place overall), although the effort did make significant organizational gains for the party. He refused to raise or spend more than $5,000 on his campaign, presumably to avoid meeting the threshold for Federal Election Commission reporting requirements. The unofficial Draft Nader committee could (and did) spend more than that, but the committee was legally prevented from coordinating in any way with Nader himself.

Nader received some criticism from gay rights supporters for calling gay rights &quot;gonadal politics&quot; and stating that he was not interested in dealing with such matters. In July 2004, however, he publicly stated that he supported same-sex marriage.

His 1996 running mates included: Anne Goeke (nine states), Deborah Howes (Oregon), Muriel Tillinghast (New York), Krista Paradise (Colorado), Madelyn Hoffman (New Jersey), Bill Boteler (Washington, D.C.), and Winona LaDuke (California and Texas).

==== 2000 ====
In the 2006 documentary &quot;An Unreasonable Man&quot;, Nader described how he was unable to get the views of his public-interest groups heard in Washington, even by the Clinton Administration. Nader cited this as one of the primary reasons why he decided to actively run in the 2000 election as candidate of the Green Party, which had been formed in the wake of his 1996 campaign.
In June 2000, The Association of State Green Parties (ASGP) organized the national nominating convention that took place in Denver, Colorado, at which Green Party delegates nominated Ralph Nader and Winona LaDuke to be their party&#x27;s candidates for president and vice president.

On July 9, the Vermont Progressive Party nominated Nader, giving him ballot access in the state. On August 12, the United Citizens Party of South Carolina chose Ralph Nader as its presidential nominee, giving him a ballot line in the state.

In October 2000, at the largest Super Rally of his campaign, held in New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, 15,000 people paid $20 each to hear Nader speak. Nader&#x27;s campaign rejected both parties as institutions dominated by corporate interests, stating that Al Gore and George W. Bush were &quot;Tweedledee and Tweedledum&quot;. A long list of notable celebrities spoke and performed at the event including Susan Sarandon, Ani DiFranco, Ben Harper, Tim Robbins, Michael Moore, Eddie Vedder and Patti Smith. The campaign also had some prominent union help: The California Nurses Association and the United Electrical Workers endorsed his candidacy and campaigned for him.

Nader and LaDuke received 2,883,105 votes, for 2.74 percent of the popular vote (third place overall), missing the 5 percent needed to qualify the Green Party for federally distributed public funding in the next election, yet qualifying the party for ballot status in many states.

Nader often openly expressed his hope for Bush&#x27;s victory over Gore, saying it &quot;would mobilize us&quot;, and that environmental and consumer regulatory agencies would fare better under Bush than Gore. When asked which of the two he&#x27;d vote for if forced, Nader answered &quot;Bush ... If you want the parties to diverge from one another, have Bush win.&quot; As to whether he would feel regret if he caused Gore&#x27;s defeat, Nader replied &quot;I would not—not at all. I&#x27;d rather have a provocateur than an anesthetizer in the White House.&quot; On another occasion, Nader answered this question with: &quot;No, not at all ... There may be a cold shower for four years that would help the Democratic Party ... It doesn&#x27;t matter who is in the White House.&quot;

===== Spoiler controversy =====
In the 2000 presidential election in Florida, George W. Bush defeated Al Gore by 537 votes. Nader received votes, which led to claims that he was responsible for Gore&#x27;s defeat. Nader disputes that he helped Bush win. A 2003 study found that Nader&#x27;s candidacy was a critical factor in Bush&#x27;s victory. A 2004 study found that Nader voters had the profile of likely voters with a preference for Democratic candidates. They were therefore likely to vote for Gore over Bush in the absence of Nader&#x27;s candidacy.

A study by Harvard Professor B.C. Burden in 2005 showed Nader did &quot;play a pivotal role in determining who would become president following the 2000 election&quot;, but that:

However, Jonathan Chait of &quot;The American Prospect&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot; notes that Nader did indeed focus on swing states disproportionately during the waning days of the campaign, and by doing so jeopardized his own chances of achieving the 5% of the vote he was aiming for.

When Nader, in a letter to environmentalists, attacked Gore for &quot;his role as broker of environmental voters for corporate cash,&quot; and &quot;the prototype for the bankable, Green corporate politician,&quot; and what he called a string of broken promises to the environmental movement, Sierra Club president Carl Pope sent an open letter to Nader, dated October 27, 2000, defending Al Gore&#x27;s environmental record and calling Nader&#x27;s strategy &quot;irresponsible.&quot; He wrote:

==== 2004 ====
Nader announced on December 23, 2003, that he would not seek the Green Party&#x27;s nomination for president in 2004, but did not rule out running as an independent candidate.

Ralph Nader and Democratic candidate John Kerry held a widely publicized meeting early in the 2004 presidential campaign. Nader said that John Kerry wanted to work to win Nader&#x27;s support and the support of Nader&#x27;s voters, prompting Nader to provide Kerry more than 20 pages of issues that he felt were important. According to Nader, he asked John Kerry to choose any three of the issues and highlight them in his campaign; should Kerry meet these conditions Nader would not contest the election. On February 22, 2004, having not heard back from Kerry, Nader announced that he would run for president as an independent.

Due to concerns about a possible spoiler effect, many Democrats urged Nader to abandon his 2004 candidacy. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, stated that Nader had a &quot;distinguished career, fighting for working families&quot;, and that McAuliffe &quot;would hate to see part of his legacy being that he got us eight years of George Bush&quot;. Theresa Amato, Nader&#x27;s national campaign manager in 2000 and 2004, later alleged that McAuliffe offered to pay off Nader if he would not campaign in certain states, an allegation confirmed by Nader and undisputed by McAuliffe.

Nader received 463,655 votes, for 0.38 percent of the popular vote, placing him in third place overall.

==== 2008 ====


In February 2007, Nader criticized Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as &quot;a panderer and a flatterer,&quot; later describing her as someone who had &quot;no political fortitude.&quot; During a February 2008 appearance on &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, Nader announced his intention to run for president as an independent, later naming Matt Gonzalez as his running-mate. Nader was endorsed by Howard Zinn, Jesse Ventura, Justin Jeffre, Tom Morello, Val Kilmer, Rocky Anderson, James Abourezk, Patti Smith, and Jello Biafra. The Nader campaign raised $4.3 million in campaign funds, primarily from small, individual donations. Nader/Gonzalez earned 738,475 votes and a third-place finish in the 2008 United States presidential election.


===Congressional Accountability Project===
Nader founded the Congressional Accountability Project to &quot;oppose corruption in the U. S. Congress.&quot;

===Later activities===
Nader condemned the 2011 military intervention in Libya. He branded President Barack Obama as a &quot;war criminal&quot; and called for his impeachment.

In June 2019, Nader, who lost his 24-year-old grandniece in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, claimed that the Boeing 737 Max &quot;must never fly again... it&#x27;s not a matter of software. It&#x27;s a matter of structural design defect: the plane&#x27;s engines are too much for the traditional fuselage&quot;. Nader also called for Boeing top leaders to resign and said that the Federal Aviation Administration &quot;has been in the pockets of the Boeing company for years&quot;.

====D.C. Library Renaissance Project====
In 2002, Nader founded the D.C. Library Renaissance Project, which has sought to halt the development of the West End Library in Washington, D.C., alleging that it &quot;violated affordable housing guidelines, undervalued the land, and didn&#x27;t conform to the city&#x27;s Comprehensive Plan.&quot; The legal obstacles presented by the Library Renaissance Project have cost the D.C. government over one million dollars in legal fees. Nader has opposed the privatized development of D.C. libraries despite community support, citing a lack of oversight and competitive bidding process.

====&quot;Only the Super Rich Can Save Us&quot;====
In 2009 Nader published his first work of fiction, &quot;Only the Super-Rich Can Save Us!&quot;. Many of the characters were fictionalized versions of real-life persons including Ted Turner and Warren Buffett. The book&#x27;s principal villain, a &quot;conservative evil genius&quot; named Brovar Dortwist, represents Grover Norquist. According to Norquist, Nader had called him prior to the book&#x27;s publication and said he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t be too unhappy, because the character was principled&quot;.

The novel met with mixed reviews with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noting that the book &quot;reads less like a novel ... than a dream journal&quot; with a plot that victoriously concludes with &quot;American society thoroughly Naderized&quot;, though &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; called it &quot;a powerful idea by the perfect person at a fortuitous time&quot;.

Nader also branched out into fiction with the fable collection &quot;Animal Envy&quot; in 2016.

====2012 debate moderator====
During the 2012 United States presidential election, Nader moderated a debate for third-party candidates at Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Busboys and Poets. The debate was attended by Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, Libertarian Gary Johnson, Rocky Anderson of the Justice Party and Constitution Party candidate Virgil Goode. He later moderated a similar debate in a studio appearance broadcast by Russia Today.

====Ralph Nader Radio Hour====
Since March 2014, Nader has co-hosted the weekly Ralph Nader Radio Hour, produced at KPFK-FM in Los Angeles and distributed via the Pacifica Radio Network. The program features &quot;interviews with some of the nation&#x27;s most influential movers and shakers&quot; and discussion of current events. Nader&#x27;s co-hosts are Steve Skrovan and David Feldman.

====American Museum of Tort Law====
In 2015, after a decade planning, Nader founded the American Museum of Tort Law in Winsted, Connecticut. The opening ceremonies were emceed by Phil Donahue. Nader personally donated $150,000 to the establishment of the museum, which was sited on two parcels of land rezoned by the town of Winsted to host it. At the time of its opening, some expressed skepticism that a museum dedicated to tort would have much interest to the general public, though Nader responded that he was &quot;astounded how a country can go over 200 years and not have a law museum&quot;.

====Campaign for Harvard admissions reform====
Nader unsuccessfully sought a seat on the Harvard University Board of Overseers in 2016 as part of an insurgent candidate slate operating under the name &quot;Free Harvard, Fair Harvard&quot; which called for increased transparency by the university as to how it made athletic and legacy admissions decisions. In February of that year, while noting that he would not vote for him personally, he expressed support for Donald Trump making a third-party run for president, saying that such a move might help break-up the two party system.

====Newspapers====
Following the closure of &quot;The Winsted Journal&quot; in 2017, Nader provided the first funds for &quot;The Winsted Phoenix&quot; in 2018 and then pulled backing. The newspaper folded in 2021. A year later, Nader announced he was financially backing the creation of another newspaper in his hometown called the &quot;Winsted Citizen&quot; and provided $15,000 for the first monthly issue printed February 2023.

A month later it was reported Nader failed to provide funding as initially promised for the paper&#x27;s second edition. He had agreed to cover 75% of the cost, with the newspaper covering the rest. However, the money had not been delivered by the time of the second edition&#x27;s printing. Instead, at that time Nader offered to give a $8,000 loan, which the newspaper declined to accept.

In April 2022, Nader founded the print newspaper &quot;Capitol Hill Citizen&quot;. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, the publication&#x27;s coverage centers on issues important to Nader, such as the growth of corporate influence on the federal government, corruption among lawmakers and the follies and failures of the mainstream political media.

== Personal life ==
Nader, whose family was Antiochian Greek Orthodox Christian, recalled that during his childhood his family had been &quot;embraced&quot; by a Methodist church where he attended Sunday school. In addition to English, Nader also speaks Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, Chinese, and conversational Arabic.

Nader defines his ideology not as left-wing or right-wing but as a &quot;moral empiricist&quot;. He has lived in Washington D.C. since the 1960s, but is domiciled in Connecticut, where he is registered to vote. Nader has expressed admiration for Robert La Follette, Eugene Debs, and Edmund Burke.

His siblings are Laura (a professor of social and cultural anthropology at U.C. Berkeley), Claire, and late brother Shafeek. After his older brother Shafeek died of prostate cancer in 1986, Nader developed Bell&#x27;s palsy, which paralyzed the left side of his mouth for several months. He commented on his partial facial paralysis to audiences during this time with the quip that &quot;at least my opponents can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m talking out of both sides of my mouth.&quot; Nader&#x27;s grandniece Samya Stumo was among the 157 people killed in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in March 2019.

Nader is a lifelong fan of the New York Yankees.

===Personality and character traits===
Rupert Cornwell of &quot;The Independent&quot; described Nader as an &quot;ascetic ... bordering on self-righteous&quot;. Despite access to respectable financial assets, he lives in a modest apartment and spends $25,000 annually on personal bills, conducting most of his writing on a typewriter. According to popular accounts of his personal life, he does not own a television, relies primarily on public transportation, and over a 25-year period, until 1983, exclusively wore one of a dozen pairs of shoes he had purchased at a clearance sale in 1959. His suits, which he reports he purchases at sales and outlet stores, have been the repeated subject of public scrutiny, being variously described as &quot;wrinkled&quot;, &quot;rumpled&quot;, and &quot;styleless&quot;. A newspaper story once described Nader as a &quot;conscientious objector to fashion&quot;.

Nader has never married. Karen Croft, a writer who worked for Nader in the late 1970s at the Center for Study of Responsive Law, once asked him if he had ever considered marriage, to which he responded that he had made a choice to dedicate his life to career rather than family.

=== Finances ===
According to the mandatory fiscal disclosure report that he filed with the Federal Election Commission in 2000, Nader owned more than $3 million worth of stocks and mutual fund shares; his single largest holding was more than $1 million worth of stock in Cisco Systems, Inc. He also held between $100,000 and $250,000 worth of shares in the Magellan Fund.
Nader said he owned no car and owned no real estate directly in 2000, and said that he lived on $25,000 a year, giving most of his stock earnings to many of the over four dozen non-profit organizations he had founded.

Nader owns shares in Amazon and believes the corporation should be paying shareholders a dividend. He also believes that there should be an &quot;antitrust investigation&quot; looking into the company&#x27;s business practices.

Nader is also an Apple Inc. shareholder. In 2018, he wrote an open letter to Tim Cook criticizing Apple&#x27;s $100 billion share buyback.

== Media appearances ==
===Film===
In the 2005 Jim Carrey film &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, Nader makes a cameo appearance as himself.

The Steve Skrovan documentary film &quot;An Unreasonable Man&quot; is about the life of Ralph Nader and uses both archival footage and original interviews. It debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2006.

===Periodicals===
Nader was featured on the cover of the January 22, 1968, issue of &quot;Newsweek&quot;; the December 12, 1969, issue of &quot;Time&quot;; the June 1971 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;; and the August 2016 issue of &quot;Pacific Standard&quot;.

===Television===
Nader has been a guest on multiple episodes of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, and &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. In 2003 he appeared on &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; and, in 2008, was interviewed by Triumph the Insult Comic Dog on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

In 1988, Nader appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as &quot;a person in your neighborhood&quot;, the episode also featuring Barbara Walters and Martina Navratilova. Nader&#x27;s appearance on the show was memorable because it was the only time that the grammar of the last line of the song &quot;a person that you meet each day&quot; was questioned and changed. Nader refused to sing a line which he deemed grammatically improper, so a compromise was reached by which Nader sang the last line solo, with the modified words: &quot;a person &quot;whom&quot; you meet each day.&quot;

<doc id="25674" wikidata="Q245407" url="?curid=25674" title="Richard Bach">
<text>Richard David Bach (born June 23, 1936) is an American writer. He has written numerous flight-related works of fiction and non-fiction. His works include &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; (1970) and &quot;Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah&quot; (1977), both of which were among the 1970s&#x27; biggest sellers.

Most of Bach&#x27;s books have been semi-autobiographical, using actual or fictionalized events from his life to illustrate his philosophy. His books espouse his philosophy that our apparent physical limits and mortality are merely appearance. Bach is noted for his love of aviation and his books related to flying in a metaphorical context. He has flown as a hobby since the age of 17. In late August 2012, Bach was severely injured when on approach to landing at Friday Harbor, Washington, his aircraft clipped some power lines and crashed upside down in a field.

==Early life==
Bach was born in Oak Park, Illinois, to Roland R. and Ruth Shaw Bach. His father was an American Red Cross chapter manager. Bach attended Long Beach State College in 1955.

Bach&#x27;s first airplane flight occurred at age 14, when his mother was campaigning for a seat on the council of Long Beach, California. Her campaign manager, Paul Marcus, mentioned that he flew airplanes and invited Richard on a flight in his Globe Swift.

==Aviation career==
Bach served in the United States Navy Reserve, then in the New Jersey Air National Guard&#x27;s 108th Fighter Wing, 141st Fighter Squadron (USAF), as a Republic F-84F Thunderstreak fighter pilot. He then worked at a variety of jobs, including as a technical writer for Douglas Aircraft and as a contributing editor for &quot;Flying&quot; magazine. He served in the USAF reserve and was deployed in France in 1960. He later became a barnstormer.

During the summer of 1970, Bach and his friend Chris Cagle traveled to Ireland, where they participated in flying sequences for Roger Corman&#x27;s film &quot;Von Richthofen and Brown&quot;. They flew a variety of World War I aircraft of the Blue Max collection owned by ex-RCAF pilot Lynn Garrison. Bach and Garrison first met when Bach wrote articles for &quot;Avian&quot;, Garrison&#x27;s aviation publication.

Most of Bach&#x27;s books involve flight in some way, from the early stories which are purely about flying aircraft, to &quot;Stranger to the Ground&quot;, his first book, to his later works, in which he used flight as a philosophical metaphor.

==Literary career==
Bach&#x27;s first book, the autobiographical &quot;Stranger to the Ground&quot; (1963) described his Air National Guard unit&#x27;s deployment to France. It was received favorably by Edmund Fuller in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

1970&#x27;s &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;, a story about a seagull who flew for the love and passion of flying rather than merely to catch food, was released by Macmillan Publishers after the manuscript was turned down by several others. It had first been published in &quot;Soaring&quot;, the magazine of the Soaring Society of America. The book, which included photos of seagulls in flight by photographer Russell Munson, became a number-one bestseller. Containing fewer than 10,000 words, the book sold more than one million copies in 1972 alone. The surprising success of the book was widely reported in the media in the early 1970s.

In 1973, &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name, produced by Paramount Pictures Corporation, with a soundtrack by Neil Diamond. Bach then filed a lawsuit against producer/director Hall Bartlett, alleging that Bartlett had destroyed Bach&#x27;s screenplay for the film and that Bartlett had violated a clause in Bach&#x27;s contract which stated that the film could not be released in theaters without Bach&#x27;s approval. Associate producer Leslie Parrish was appointed to be a mediator between Bach and Bartlett, but the mediation failed. The lawsuit ended with the film being released in theaters with some changes made to the final cut, while Bach had his name removed from the film&#x27;s screenwriting credits.

In 1975, Bach was the driving force behind &quot;Nothing by Chance&quot;, a documentary film based on his book of the same name. The film centers on modern barnstorming around the United States in the 1970s. Bach recruited a group of his friends who were pilots to recreate the era of the barnstormer.

The second novel, &quot;Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah&quot;, published in 1977, tells of an encounter with a modern-day messiah who has decided to quit.

On August 31, 2012, Bach was injured in an aircraft landing accident on San Juan Island in Washington. He was landing a 2008 Easton Gilbert G Searey (N346PE) that he had nicknamed &quot;Puff&quot; at a private airport when the landing gear clipped some power lines. He crashed upside down in a field about two miles from Friday Harbor, taking down two poles and sparking a small grass fire.

The day after the accident, Bach was reported to be in serious but stable condition with a head injury and broken shoulder. Bach was hospitalized for four months. He reported that his near-death experience inspired him to finish the fourth part of &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;, which had been originally published in three parts.

In December 2012, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reported that &quot;Travels with Puff&quot; had been sent to his publisher the day before his accident. &quot;Travels with Puff&quot; was released on March 19, 2013.

In 2014, Bach published his sequel to &quot;Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah&quot;, which he called &quot;Illusions II: The Adventures of a Reluctant Student&quot;. The book incorporates the story of Bach&#x27;s real-life aircraft crash, with the author imagining he is being visited by the &quot;messiah&quot;, Don Shimoda, who helps him through his difficult medical recovery.

==Personal life==
Bach had six children with his first wife, Bette Jeanne Franks. Also a pilot, she is the author of &quot;Patterns: Tales of Flying and of Life&quot;, a book about her life as a pilot and single mother. She typed and edited most of Richard&#x27;s aviation writing. They divorced in 1970, and Bach spent years without seeing his children.

His and Bette&#x27;s son Jonathan, named after the titular character in Bach&#x27;s bestseller, &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull,&quot; is a software engineer and journalist. He wrote the 1993 book &quot;Above the Clouds,&quot; about growing up without knowing his father and then later meeting him as a college student. Richard gave his approval, although he noted that it included some personal history he would &quot;rather not see in print.&quot;

Their other children are Robert, Kristel, James Marcus Bach, Erika, and their youngest daughter, Bethany, who died in an accident at the age of 15 in 1985.

In 1981, Bach married the actress Leslie Parrish, whom he met during the making of the film &quot;Jonathan Livingston Seagull&quot;. She featured significantly in two of his subsequent books: &quot;The Bridge Across Forever&quot; and &quot;One&quot;, which primarily focused on their relationship and Bach&#x27;s concept of soulmates. They divorced in 1999.

Bach married his third wife, Sabryna Nelson-Alexopoulos, in April 1999. They divorced on April 1, 2011.

Bach has been married to his fourth wife, Melinda Kellogg, since November, 2020.

<text>Radar is a system that uses radio waves to determine the distance (&quot;ranging&quot;), direction (azimuth and elevation angles), and radial velocity of objects relative to the site. It is a radiodetermination method used to detect and track aircraft, ships, spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, map weather formations, and terrain.

A radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to determine properties of the objects. Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the transmitter reflect off the objects and return to the receiver, giving information about the objects&#x27; locations and speeds.

Radar was developed secretly for military use by several countries in the period before and during World War II. A key development was the cavity magnetron in the United Kingdom, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. The term &quot;RADAR&quot; was coined in 1940 by the United States Navy as an acronym for &quot;radio detection and ranging&quot;. The term &quot;radar&quot; has since entered English and other languages as an , a common noun, losing all capitalization.

The modern uses of radar are highly diverse, including air and terrestrial traffic control, radar astronomy, air-defense systems, anti-missile systems, marine radars to locate landmarks and other ships, aircraft anti-collision systems, ocean surveillance systems, outer space surveillance and rendezvous systems, meteorological precipitation monitoring, radar remote sensing, altimetry and flight control systems, guided missile target locating systems, self-driving cars, and ground-penetrating radar for geological observations. Modern high tech radar systems use digital signal processing and machine learning and are capable of extracting useful information from very high noise levels.

Other systems which are similar to radar make use of other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. One example is lidar, which uses predominantly infrared light from lasers rather than radio waves. With the emergence of driverless vehicles, radar is expected to assist the automated platform to monitor its environment, thus preventing unwanted incidents.

== History ==
=== First experiments ===
As early as 1886, German physicist Heinrich Hertz showed that radio waves could be reflected from solid objects. In 1895, Alexander Popov, a physics instructor at the Imperial Russian Navy school in Kronstadt, developed an apparatus using a coherer tube for detecting distant lightning strikes. The next year, he added a spark-gap transmitter. In 1897, while testing this equipment for communicating between two ships in the Baltic Sea, he took note of an interference beat caused by the passage of a third vessel. In his report, Popov wrote that this phenomenon might be used for detecting objects, but he did nothing more with this observation.

The German inventor Christian Hülsmeyer was the first to use radio waves to detect &quot;the presence of distant metallic objects&quot;. In 1904, he demonstrated the feasibility of detecting a ship in dense fog, but not its distance from the transmitter. He obtained a patent for his detection device in April 1904 and later a patent for a related amendment for estimating the distance to the ship. He also obtained a British patent on 23 September 1904 for a full radar system, that he called a &quot;telemobiloscope&quot;. It operated on a 50 cm wavelength and the pulsed radar signal was created via a spark-gap. His system already used the classic antenna setup of horn antenna with parabolic reflector and was presented to German military officials in practical tests in Cologne and Rotterdam harbour but was rejected.

In 1915, Robert Watson-Watt used radio technology to provide advance warning of thunderstorms to airmen and during the 1920s went on to lead the U.K. research establishment to make many advances using radio techniques, including the probing of the ionosphere and the detection of lightning at long distances. Through his lightning experiments, Watson-Watt became an expert on the use of radio direction finding before turning his inquiry to shortwave transmission. Requiring a suitable receiver for such studies, he told the &quot;new boy&quot; Arnold Frederic Wilkins to conduct an extensive review of available shortwave units. Wilkins would select a General Post Office model after noting its manual&#x27;s description of a &quot;fading&quot; effect (the common term for interference at the time) when aircraft flew overhead.

By placing a transmitter and receiver on opposite sides of the Potomac River in 1922, U.S. Navy researchers A. Hoyt Taylor and Leo C. Young discovered that ships passing through the beam path caused the received signal to fade in and out. Taylor submitted a report, suggesting that this phenomenon might be used to detect the presence of ships in low visibility, but the Navy did not immediately continue the work. Eight years later, Lawrence A. Hyland at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) observed similar fading effects from passing aircraft; this revelation led to a patent application as well as a proposal for further intensive research on radio-echo signals from moving targets to take place at NRL, where Taylor and Young were based at the time.

Similarly, in the UK, L. S. Alder took out a secret provisional patent for Naval radar in 1928. W.A.S. Butement and P. E. Pollard developed a breadboard test unit, operating at 50 cm (600 MHz) and using pulsed modulation which gave successful laboratory results. In January 1931, a writeup on the apparatus was entered in the &quot;Inventions Book&quot; maintained by the Royal Engineers. This is the first official record in Great Britain of the technology that was used in coastal defence and was incorporated into Chain Home as Chain Home (low).

===Before World War II===

Before the Second World War, researchers in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, and the United States, independently and in great secrecy, developed technologies that led to the modern version of radar. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa followed prewar Great Britain&#x27;s radar development, Hungary and Sweden generated its radar technology during the war.

In France in 1934, following systematic studies on the split-anode magnetron, the research branch of the Compagnie générale de la télégraphie sans fil (CSF) headed by Maurice Ponte with Henri Gutton, Sylvain Berline and M. Hugon, began developing an obstacle-locating radio apparatus, aspects of which were installed on the ocean liner &quot;Normandie&quot; in 1935.

During the same period, Soviet military engineer P.K. Oshchepkov, in collaboration with the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute, produced an experimental apparatus, RAPID, capable of detecting an aircraft within 3 km of a receiver. The Soviets produced their first mass production radars RUS-1 and RUS-2 Redut in 1939 but further development was slowed following the arrest of Oshchepkov and his subsequent gulag sentence. In total, only 607 Redut stations were produced during the war. The first Russian airborne radar, Gneiss-2, entered into service in June 1943 on Pe-2 dive bombers. More than 230 Gneiss-2 stations were produced by the end of 1944. The French and Soviet systems, however, featured continuous-wave operation that did not provide the full performance ultimately synonymous with modern radar systems.

Full radar evolved as a pulsed system, and the first such elementary apparatus was demonstrated in December 1934 by the American Robert M. Page, working at the Naval Research Laboratory. The following year, the United States Army successfully tested a primitive surface-to-surface radar to aim coastal battery searchlights at night. This design was followed by a pulsed system demonstrated in May 1935 by Rudolf Kühnhold and the firm in Germany and then another in June 1935 by an Air Ministry team led by Robert Watson-Watt in Great Britain.
In 1935, Watson-Watt was asked to judge recent reports of a German radio-based death ray and turned the request over to Wilkins. Wilkins returned a set of calculations demonstrating the system was basically impossible. When Watson-Watt then asked what such a system might do, Wilkins recalled the earlier report about aircraft causing radio interference. This revelation led to the Daventry Experiment of 26 February 1935, using a powerful BBC shortwave transmitter as the source and their GPO receiver setup in a field while a bomber flew around the site. When the plane was clearly detected, Hugh Dowding, the Air Member for Supply and Research, was very impressed with their system&#x27;s potential and funds were immediately provided for further operational development. Watson-Watt&#x27;s team patented the device in patent GB593017.

Development of radar greatly expanded on 1 September 1936, when Watson-Watt became superintendent of a new establishment under the British Air Ministry, Bawdsey Research Station located in Bawdsey Manor, near Felixstowe, Suffolk. Work there resulted in the design and installation of aircraft detection and tracking stations called &quot;Chain Home&quot; along the East and South coasts of England in time for the outbreak of World War II in 1939. This system provided the vital advance information that helped the Royal Air Force win the Battle of Britain; without it, significant numbers of fighter aircraft, which Great Britain did not have available, would always have needed to be in the air to respond quickly. The radar formed part of the &quot;Dowding system&quot; for collecting reports of enemy aircraft and coordinating the response.

Given all required funding and development support, the team produced working radar systems in 1935 and began deployment. By 1936, the first five Chain Home (CH) systems were operational and by 1940 stretched across the entire UK including Northern Ireland. Even by standards of the era, CH was crude; instead of broadcasting and receiving from an aimed antenna, CH broadcast a signal floodlighting the entire area in front of it, and then used one of Watson-Watt&#x27;s own radio direction finders to determine the direction of the returned echoes. This fact meant CH transmitters had to be much more powerful and have better antennas than competing systems but allowed its rapid introduction using existing technologies.

===During World War II===
A key development was the cavity magnetron in the UK, which allowed the creation of relatively small systems with sub-meter resolution. Britain shared the technology with the U.S. during the 1940 Tizard Mission.

In April 1940, &quot;Popular Science&quot; showed an example of a radar unit using the Watson-Watt patent in an article on air defence. Also, in late 1941 &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; had an article in which a U.S. scientist speculated about the British early warning system on the English east coast and came close to what it was and how it worked. Watson-Watt was sent to the U.S. in 1941 to advise on air defense after Japan&#x27;s attack on Pearl Harbor. Alfred Lee Loomis organized the secret MIT Radiation Laboratory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts which developed microwave radar technology in the years 1941–45. Later, in 1943, Page greatly improved radar with the monopulse technique that was used for many years in most radar applications.

The war precipitated research to find better resolution, more portability, and more features for radar, including small, lightweight sets to equip night fighters (aircraft interception radar) and maritime patrol aircraft (air-to-surface-vessel radar), and complementary navigation systems like Oboe used by the RAF&#x27;s Pathfinder.

==Applications==
The information provided by radar includes the bearing and range (and therefore position) of the object from the radar scanner. It is thus used in many different fields where the need for such positioning is crucial. The first use of radar was for military purposes: to locate air, ground and sea targets. This evolved in the civilian field into applications for aircraft, ships, and automobiles.

In aviation, aircraft can be equipped with radar devices that warn of aircraft or other obstacles in or approaching their path, display weather information, and give accurate altitude readings. The first commercial device fitted to aircraft was a 1938 Bell Lab unit on some United Air Lines aircraft. Aircraft can land in fog at airports equipped with radar-assisted ground-controlled approach systems in which the plane&#x27;s position is observed on precision approach radar screens by operators who thereby give radio landing instructions to the pilot, maintaining the aircraft on a defined approach path to the runway. Military fighter aircraft are usually fitted with air-to-air targeting radars, to detect and target enemy aircraft. In addition, larger specialized military aircraft carry powerful airborne radars to observe air traffic over a wide region and direct fighter aircraft towards targets.

Marine radars are used to measure the bearing and distance of ships to prevent collision with other ships, to navigate, and to fix their position at sea when within range of shore or other fixed references such as islands, buoys, and lightships. In port or in harbour, vessel traffic service radar systems are used to monitor and regulate ship movements in busy waters.

Meteorologists use radar to monitor precipitation and wind. It has become the primary tool for short-term weather forecasting and watching for severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, winter storms, precipitation types, etc. Geologists use specialized ground-penetrating radars to map the composition of Earth&#x27;s crust. Police forces use radar guns to monitor vehicle speeds on the roads. Automotive radars are used for adaptive cruise control and emergency braking on vehicles by ignoring stationary roadside objects that could cause incorrect brake application and instead measuring moving objects to prevent collision with other vehicles. As part of Intelligent Transport Systems, fixed-position stopped vehicle detection (SVD) radars are mounted on the roadside to detect stranded vehicles, obstructions and debris by inverting the automotive radar approach and ignoring moving objects. Smaller radar systems are used to detect human movement. Examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring and hand and finger gesture detection for computer interaction. Automatic door opening, light activation and intruder sensing are also common.

==Principles==
===Radar signal===
A radar system has a transmitter that emits radio waves known as &quot;radar signals&quot; in predetermined directions. When these signals contact an object they are usually reflected or scattered in many directions, although some of them will be absorbed and penetrate into the target. Radar signals are reflected especially well by materials of considerable electrical conductivity—such as most metals, seawater, and wet ground. This makes the use of radar altimeters possible in certain cases. The radar signals that are reflected back towards the radar receiver are the desirable ones that make radar detection work. If the object is &quot;moving&quot; either toward or away from the transmitter, there will be a slight change in the frequency of the radio waves due to the Doppler effect.

Radar receivers are usually, but not always, in the same location as the transmitter. The reflected radar signals captured by the receiving antenna are usually very weak. They can be strengthened by electronic amplifiers. More sophisticated methods of signal processing are also used in order to recover useful radar signals.

The weak absorption of radio waves by the medium through which they pass is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges—ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet light, are too strongly attenuated. Weather phenomena, such as fog, clouds, rain, falling snow, and sleet, that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves. Certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapour, raindrops, or atmospheric gases (especially oxygen) are avoided when designing radars, except when their detection is intended.

=== Illumination ===

Radar relies on its own transmissions rather than light from the Sun or the Moon, or from electromagnetic waves emitted by the target objects themselves, such as infrared radiation (heat). This process of directing artificial radio waves towards objects is called &quot;illumination&quot;, although radio waves are invisible to the human eye as well as optical cameras.

===Reflection===

If electromagnetic waves travelling through one material meet another material, having a different dielectric constant or diamagnetic constant from the first,
the waves will reflect or scatter from the boundary between the materials. This means that a solid object in air or in a vacuum, or a significant change in atomic density between the object and what is surrounding it, will usually scatter radar (radio) waves from its surface. This is particularly true for electrically conductive materials such as metal and carbon fibre, making radar well-suited to the detection of aircraft and ships. Radar absorbing material, containing resistive and sometimes magnetic substances, is used on military vehicles to reduce radar reflection. This is the radio equivalent of painting something a dark colour so that it cannot be seen by the eye at night.

Radar waves scatter in a variety of ways depending on the size (wavelength) of the radio wave and the shape of the target. If the wavelength is much shorter than the target&#x27;s size, the wave will bounce off in a way similar to the way light is reflected by a mirror. If the wavelength is much longer than the size of the target, the target may not be visible because of poor reflection. Low-frequency radar technology is dependent on resonances for detection, but not identification, of targets. This is described by Rayleigh scattering, an effect that creates Earth&#x27;s blue sky and red sunsets. When the two length scales are comparable, there may be resonances. Early radars used very long wavelengths that were larger than the targets and thus received a vague signal, whereas many modern systems use shorter wavelengths (a few centimetres or less) that can image objects as small as a loaf of bread.

Short radio waves reflect from curves and corners in a way similar to glint from a rounded piece of glass. The most reflective targets for short wavelengths have 90° angles between the reflective surfaces. A corner reflector consists of three flat surfaces meeting like the inside corner of a cube. The structure will reflect waves entering its opening directly back to the source. They are commonly used as radar reflectors to make otherwise difficult-to-detect objects easier to detect. Corner reflectors on boats, for example, make them more detectable to avoid collision or during a rescue. For similar reasons, objects intended to avoid detection will not have inside corners or surfaces and edges perpendicular to likely detection directions, which leads to &quot;odd&quot; looking stealth aircraft. These precautions do not totally eliminate reflection because of diffraction, especially at longer wavelengths. Half wavelength long wires or strips of conducting material, such as chaff, are very reflective but do not direct the scattered energy back toward the source. The extent to which an object reflects or scatters radio waves is called its radar cross-section.

===Radar range equation===
The power &quot;Pr&quot; returning to the receiving antenna is given by the equation:

:formula_1

where
* &quot;P&quot;t = transmitter power
* &quot;G&quot;t = gain of the transmitting antenna
* &quot;A&quot;r = effective aperture (area) of the receiving antenna; this can also be expressed as formula_2, where
:* formula_3 = transmitted wavelength
:* &quot;G&quot;r = gain of receiving antenna
* &quot;σ&quot; = radar cross section, or scattering coefficient, of the target
* &quot;F&quot; = pattern propagation factor
* &quot;R&quot;t = distance from the transmitter to the target
* &quot;R&quot;r = distance from the target to the receiver.

In the common case where the transmitter and the receiver are at the same location, &quot;R&quot;t = &quot;R&quot;r and the term &quot;R&quot;t² &quot;R&quot;r² can be replaced by &quot;R&quot;4, where &quot;R&quot; is the range.
This yields:
:formula_4

As an example, a Doppler weather radar with a pulse rate of 2 kHz and transmit frequency of 1 GHz can reliably measure weather speed up to at most , thus cannot reliably determine radial velocity of aircraft moving .

===Polarization===

In all electromagnetic radiation, the electric field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation, and the electric field direction is the polarization of the wave. For a transmitted radar signal, the polarization can be controlled to yield different effects. Radars use horizontal, vertical, linear, and circular polarization to detect different types of reflections. For example, circular polarization is used to minimize the interference caused by rain. Linear polarization returns usually indicate metal surfaces. Random polarization returns usually indicate a fractal surface, such as rocks or soil, and are used by navigation radars.

===Limiting factors===

====Beam path and range====
A radar beam follows a linear path in vacuum but follows a somewhat curved path in atmosphere due to variation in the refractive index of air, which is called the radar horizon. Even when the beam is emitted parallel to the ground, the beam rises above the ground as the curvature of the Earth sinks below the horizon. Furthermore, the signal is attenuated by the medium the beam crosses, and the beam disperses.

The maximum range of conventional radar can be limited by a number of factors:
* Line of sight, which depends on the height above the ground. Without a direct line of sight, the path of the beam is blocked.
* The maximum non-ambiguous range, which is determined by the pulse repetition frequency. The maximum non-ambiguous range is the distance the pulse can travel to and return from before the next pulse is emitted.
* Radar sensitivity and the power of the return signal as computed in the radar equation. This component includes factors such as the environmental conditions and the size (or radar cross section) of the target.

====Noise====

Signal noise is an internal source of random variations in the signal, which is generated by all electronic components.

Reflected signals decline rapidly as distance increases, so noise introduces a radar range limitation. The noise floor and signal-to-noise ratio are two different measures of performance that affect range performance. Reflectors that are too far away produce too little signal to exceed the noise floor and cannot be detected. Detection requires a signal that exceeds the noise floor by at least the signal-to-noise ratio.

Noise typically appears as random variations superimposed on the desired echo signal received in the radar receiver. The lower the power of the desired signal, the more difficult it is to discern it from the noise. The noise figure is a measure of the noise produced by a receiver compared to an ideal receiver, and this needs to be minimized.

Shot noise is produced by electrons in transit across a discontinuity, which occurs in all detectors. Shot noise is the dominant source in most receivers. There will also be flicker noise caused by electron transit through amplification devices, which is reduced using heterodyne amplification. Another reason for heterodyne processing is that for fixed fractional bandwidth, the instantaneous bandwidth increases linearly in frequency. This allows improved range resolution. The one notable exception to heterodyne (downconversion) radar systems is ultra-wideband radar. Here a single cycle, or transient wave, is used similar to UWB communications, see List of UWB channels.

Noise is also generated by external sources, most importantly the natural thermal radiation of the background surrounding the target of interest. In modern radar systems, the internal noise is typically about equal to or lower than the external noise. An exception is if the radar is aimed upwards at clear sky, where the scene is so &quot;cold&quot; that it generates very little thermal noise. The thermal noise is given by &quot;k&quot;B &quot;T&quot; &quot;B&quot;, where &quot;T&quot; is temperature, &quot;B&quot; is bandwidth (post matched filter) and &quot;k&quot;B is the Boltzmann constant. There is an appealing intuitive interpretation of this relationship in a radar. Matched filtering allows the entire energy received from a target to be compressed into a single bin (be it a range, Doppler, elevation, or azimuth bin). On the surface it appears that then within a fixed interval of time, perfect, error free, detection could be obtained. This is done by compressing all energy into an infinitesimal time slice. What limits this approach in the real world is that, while time is arbitrarily divisible, current is not. The quantum of electrical energy is an electron, and so the best that can be done is to match filter all energy into a single electron. Since the electron is moving at a certain temperature (Planck spectrum) this noise source cannot be further eroded. Ultimately, radar, like all macro-scale entities, is profoundly impacted by quantum theory.

Noise is random and target signals are not. Signal processing can take advantage of this phenomenon to reduce the noise floor using two strategies. The kind of signal integration used with moving target indication can improve noise up to formula_5 for each stage. The signal can also be split among multiple filters for pulse-Doppler signal processing, which reduces the noise floor by the number of filters. These improvements depend upon coherence.

====Interference====

Radar systems must overcome unwanted signals in order to focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system&#x27;s SNR the better it is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.

====Clutter====
Clutter refers to radio frequency (RF) echoes returned from targets which are uninteresting to radar operators. Such targets include man-made objects such as buildings and — intentionally — by radar countermeasures such as chaff. Such targets also include natural objects such as ground, sea, and — when not being tasked for meteorological purposes — precipitation, hail spike, dust storms, animals (especially birds), turbulence in the atmospheric circulation, and meteor trails. Radar clutter can also be caused by other atmospheric phenomena, such as disturbances in the ionosphere caused by geomagnetic storms or other space weather events. This phenomenon is especially apparent near the geomagnetic poles, where the action of the solar wind on the earth&#x27;s magnetosphere produces convection patterns in the ionospheric plasma. Radar clutter can degrade the ability of over-the-horizon radar to detect targets.

Some clutter may also be caused by a long radar waveguide between the radar transceiver and the antenna. In a typical plan position indicator (PPI) radar with a rotating antenna, this will usually be seen as a &quot;sun&quot; or &quot;sunburst&quot; in the center of the display as the receiver responds to echoes from dust particles and misguided RF in the waveguide. Adjusting the timing between when the transmitter sends a pulse and when the receiver stage is enabled will generally reduce the sunburst without affecting the accuracy of the range since most sunburst is caused by a diffused transmit pulse reflected before it leaves the antenna. Clutter is considered a passive interference source since it only appears in response to radar signals sent by the radar.

Clutter is detected and neutralized in several ways. Clutter tends to appear static between radar scans; on subsequent scan echoes, desirable targets will appear to move, and all stationary echoes can be eliminated. Sea clutter can be reduced by using horizontal polarization, while rain is reduced with circular polarization (meteorological radars wish for the opposite effect, and therefore use linear polarization to detect precipitation). Other methods attempt to increase the signal-to-clutter ratio.

Clutter moves with the wind or is stationary. Two common strategies to improve measures of performance in a clutter environment are:
:* Moving target indication, which integrates successive pulses
:* Doppler processing, which uses filters to separate clutter from desirable signals

The most effective clutter reduction technique is pulse-Doppler radar. Doppler separates clutter from aircraft and spacecraft using a frequency spectrum, so individual signals can be separated from multiple reflectors located in the same volume using velocity differences. This requires a coherent transmitter. Another technique uses a moving target indicator that subtracts the received signal from two successive pulses using phase to reduce signals from slow-moving objects. This can be adapted for systems that lack a coherent transmitter, such as time-domain pulse-amplitude radar.

Constant false alarm rate, a form of automatic gain control (AGC), is a method that relies on clutter returns far outnumbering echoes from targets of interest. The receiver&#x27;s gain is automatically adjusted to maintain a constant level of overall visible clutter. While this does not help detect targets masked by stronger surrounding clutter, it does help to distinguish strong target sources. In the past, radar AGC was electronically controlled and affected the gain of the entire radar receiver. As radars evolved, AGC became computer-software-controlled and affected the gain with greater granularity in specific detection cells.

Clutter may also originate from multipath echoes from valid targets caused by ground reflection, atmospheric ducting or ionospheric reflection/refraction (e.g., anomalous propagation). This clutter type is especially bothersome since it appears to move and behave like other normal (point) targets of interest. In a typical scenario, an aircraft echo is reflected from the ground below, appearing to the receiver as an identical target below the correct one. The radar may try to unify the targets, reporting the target at an incorrect height, or eliminating it on the basis of jitter or a physical impossibility. Terrain bounce jamming exploits this response by amplifying the radar signal and directing it downward. These problems can be overcome by incorporating a ground map of the radar&#x27;s surroundings and eliminating all echoes which appear to originate below ground or above a certain height. Monopulse can be improved by altering the elevation algorithm used at low elevation. In newer air traffic control radar equipment, algorithms are used to identify the false targets by comparing the current pulse returns to those adjacent, as well as calculating return improbabilities.

====Jamming====

Radar jamming refers to radio frequency signals originating from sources outside the radar, transmitting in the radar&#x27;s frequency and thereby masking targets of interest. Jamming may be intentional, as with an electronic warfare tactic, or unintentional, as with friendly forces operating equipment that transmits using the same frequency range. Jamming is considered an active interference source, since it is initiated by elements outside the radar and in general unrelated to the radar signals.

Jamming is problematic to radar since the jamming signal only needs to travel one way (from the jammer to the radar receiver) whereas the radar echoes travel two ways (radar-target-radar) and are therefore significantly reduced in power by the time they return to the radar receiver in accordance with inverse-square law. Jammers therefore can be much less powerful than their jammed radars and still effectively mask targets along the line of sight from the jammer to the radar (&quot;mainlobe jamming&quot;). Jammers have an added effect of affecting radars along other lines of sight through the radar receiver&#x27;s sidelobes (&quot;sidelobe jamming&quot;).

Mainlobe jamming can generally only be reduced by narrowing the mainlobe solid angle and cannot fully be eliminated when directly facing a jammer which uses the same frequency and polarization as the radar. Sidelobe jamming can be overcome by reducing receiving sidelobes in the radar antenna design and by using an omnidirectional antenna to detect and disregard non-mainlobe signals. Other anti-jamming techniques are frequency hopping and polarization.

==Signal processing==

===Distance measurement===

====Transit time====

One way to obtain a distance measurement (ranging) is based on the time-of-flight: transmit a short pulse of radio signal (electromagnetic radiation) and measure the time it takes for the reflection to return. The distance is one-half the round trip time multiplied by the speed of the signal. The factor of one-half comes from the fact that the signal has to travel to the object and back again. Since radio waves travel at the speed of light, accurate distance measurement requires high-speed electronics.
In most cases, the receiver does not detect the return while the signal is being transmitted. Through the use of a duplexer, the radar switches between transmitting and receiving at a predetermined rate.
A similar effect imposes a maximum range as well. In order to maximize range, longer times between pulses should be used, referred to as a pulse repetition time, or its reciprocal, pulse repetition frequency.

These two effects tend to be at odds with each other, and it is not easy to combine both good short range and good long range in a single radar. This is because the short pulses needed for a good minimum range broadcast have less total energy, making the returns much smaller and the target harder to detect. This could be offset by using more pulses, but this would shorten the maximum range. So each radar uses a particular type of signal. Long-range radars tend to use long pulses with long delays between them, and short range radars use smaller pulses with less time between them. As electronics have improved many radars now can change their pulse repetition frequency, thereby changing their range. The newest radars fire two pulses during one cell, one for short range (about ) and a separate signal for longer ranges (about ).

Distance may also be measured as a function of time. The radar mile is the time it takes for a radar pulse to travel one nautical mile, reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852 m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458 m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36 μs in duration.

====Frequency modulation====

Another form of distance measuring radar is based on frequency modulation. In these systems, the frequency of the transmitted signal is changed over time. Since the signal takes a finite time to travel to and from the target, the received signal is a different frequency than what the transmitter is broadcasting at the time the reflected signal arrives back at the radar. By comparing the frequency of the two signals the difference can be easily measured. This is easily accomplished with very high accuracy even in 1940s electronics. A further advantage is that the radar can operate effectively at relatively low frequencies. This was important in the early development of this type when high-frequency signal generation was difficult or expensive.

This technique can be used in continuous wave radar and is often found in aircraft radar altimeters. In these systems a &quot;carrier&quot; radar signal is frequency modulated in a predictable way, typically varying up and down with a sine wave or sawtooth pattern at audio frequencies. The signal is then sent out from one antenna and received on another, typically located on the bottom of the aircraft, and the signal can be continuously compared using a simple &quot;beat frequency&quot; modulator that produces an audio frequency tone from the returned signal and a portion of the transmitted signal.

The modulation index riding on the receive signal is proportional to the time delay between the radar and the reflector. The frequency shift becomes greater with greater time delay. The frequency shift is directly proportional to the distance travelled. That distance can be displayed on an instrument, and it may also be available via the transponder. This signal processing is similar to that used in speed detecting Doppler radar. Example systems using this approach are AZUSA, MISTRAM, and UDOP.

Terrestrial radar uses low-power FM signals that cover a larger frequency range. The multiple reflections are analyzed mathematically for pattern changes with multiple passes creating a computerized synthetic image. Doppler effects are used which allows slow moving objects to be detected as well as largely eliminating &quot;noise&quot; from the surfaces of bodies of water.

====Pulse compression====
The two techniques outlined above both have their disadvantages. The pulse timing technique has an inherent tradeoff in that the accuracy of the distance measurement is inversely related to the length of the pulse, while the energy, and thus direction range, is directly related. Increasing power for longer range while maintaining accuracy demands extremely high peak power, with 1960s early warning radars often operating in the tens of megawatts. The continuous wave methods spread this energy out in time and thus require much lower peak power compared to pulse techniques, but requires some method of allowing the sent and received signals to operate at the same time, often demanding two separate antennas.

The introduction of new electronics in the 1960s allowed the two techniques to be combined. It starts with a longer pulse that is also frequency modulated. Spreading the broadcast energy out in time means lower peak energies can be used, with modern examples typically on the order of tens of kilowatts. On reception, the signal is sent into a system that delays different frequencies by different times. The resulting output is a much shorter pulse that is suitable for accurate distance measurement, while also compressing the received energy into a much higher energy peak and thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The technique is largely universal on modern large radars.

===Speed measurement===
Speed is the change in distance to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity to see where the target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making grease pencil marks on the radar screen and then calculating the speed using a slide rule. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.

If the transmitter&#x27;s output is coherent (phase synchronized), there is another effect that can be used to make almost instant speed measurements (no memory is required), known as the Doppler effect. Most modern radar systems use this principle into Doppler radar and pulse-Doppler radar systems (weather radar, military radar). The Doppler effect is only able to determine the relative speed of the target along the line of sight from the radar to the target. Any component of target velocity perpendicular to the line of sight cannot be determined by using the Doppler effect alone, but it can be determined by tracking the target&#x27;s azimuth over time.

It is possible to make a Doppler radar without any pulsing, known as a continuous-wave radar (CW radar), by sending out a very pure signal of a known frequency. CW radar is ideal for determining the radial component of a target&#x27;s velocity. CW radar is typically used by traffic enforcement to measure vehicle speed quickly and accurately where the range is not important.

When using a pulsed radar, the variation between the phase of successive returns gives the distance the target has moved between pulses, and thus its speed can be calculated.
Other mathematical developments in radar signal processing include time-frequency analysis (Weyl Heisenberg or wavelet), as well as the chirplet transform which makes use of the change of frequency of returns from moving targets (&quot;chirp&quot;).

===Pulse-Doppler signal processing===

Pulse-Doppler signal processing includes frequency filtering in the detection process. The space between each transmit pulse is divided into range cells or range gates. Each cell is filtered independently much like the process used by a spectrum analyzer to produce the display showing different frequencies. Each different distance produces a different spectrum. These spectra are used to perform the detection process. This is required to achieve acceptable performance in hostile environments involving weather, terrain, and electronic countermeasures.

The primary purpose is to measure both the amplitude and frequency of the aggregate reflected signal from multiple distances. This is used with weather radar to measure radial wind velocity and precipitation rate in each different volume of air. This is linked with computing systems to produce a real-time electronic weather map. Aircraft safety depends upon continuous access to accurate weather radar information that is used to prevent injuries and accidents. Weather radar uses a low PRF. Coherency requirements are not as strict as those for military systems because individual signals ordinarily do not need to be separated. Less sophisticated filtering is required, and range ambiguity processing is not normally needed with weather radar in comparison with military radar intended to track air vehicles.

The alternate purpose is &quot;look-down/shoot-down&quot; capability required to improve military air combat survivability. Pulse-Doppler is also used for ground based surveillance radar required to defend personnel and vehicles. Pulse-doppler signal processing increases the maximum detection distance using less radiation close to aircraft pilots, shipboard personnel, infantry, and artillery. Reflections from terrain, water, and weather produce signals much larger than aircraft and missiles, which allows fast moving vehicles to hide using nap-of-the-earth flying techniques and stealth technology to avoid detection until an attack vehicle is too close to destroy. Pulse-Doppler signal processing incorporates more sophisticated electronic filtering that safely eliminates this kind of weakness. This requires the use of medium pulse-repetition frequency with phase coherent hardware that has a large dynamic range. Military applications require medium PRF which prevents range from being determined directly, and range ambiguity resolution processing is required to identify the true range of all reflected signals. Radial movement is usually linked with Doppler frequency to produce a lock signal that cannot be produced by radar jamming signals. Pulse-Doppler signal processing also produces audible signals that can be used for threat identification.

===Reduction of interference effects===
Signal processing is employed in radar systems to reduce the radar interference effects. Signal processing techniques include moving target indication, Pulse-Doppler signal processing, moving target detection processors, correlation with secondary surveillance radar targets, space-time adaptive processing, and track-before-detect. Constant false alarm rate and digital terrain model processing are also used in clutter environments.

===Plot and track extraction===
A track algorithm is a radar performance enhancement strategy. Tracking algorithms provide the ability to predict the future position of multiple moving objects based on the history of the individual positions being reported by sensor systems.

Historical information is accumulated and used to predict future position for use with air traffic control, threat estimation, combat system doctrine, gun aiming, and missile guidance. Position data is accumulated by radar sensors over the span of a few minutes.

There are four common track algorithms:
* Nearest neighbour algorithm
* Probabilistic Data Association
* Multiple Hypothesis Tracking
* Interactive Multiple Model (IMM)

Radar video returns from aircraft can be subjected to a plot extraction process whereby spurious and interfering signals are discarded. A sequence of target returns can be monitored through a device known as a plot extractor.

The non-relevant real time returns can be removed from the displayed information and a single plot displayed. In some radar systems, or alternatively in the command and control system to which the radar is connected, a radar tracker is used to associate the sequence of plots belonging to individual targets and estimate the targets&#x27; headings and speeds.

==Engineering==
A radar&#x27;s components are:
* A transmitter that generates the radio signal with an oscillator such as a klystron or a magnetron and controls its duration by a modulator.
* A waveguide that links the transmitter and the antenna.
* A duplexer that serves as a switch between the antenna and the transmitter or the receiver for the signal when the antenna is used in both situations.
* A receiver. Knowing the shape of the desired received signal (a pulse), an optimal receiver can be designed using a matched filter.
* A display processor to produce signals for human readable output devices.
* An electronic section that controls all those devices and the antenna to perform the radar scan ordered by software.
* A link to end user devices and displays.

===Antenna design===
Radio signals broadcast from a single antenna will spread out in all directions, and likewise a single antenna will receive signals equally from all directions. This leaves the radar with the problem of deciding where the target object is located.

Early systems tended to use omnidirectional broadcast antennas, with directional receiver antennas which were pointed in various directions. For instance, the first system to be deployed, Chain Home, used two straight antennas at right angles for reception, each on a different display. The maximum return would be detected with an antenna at right angles to the target, and a minimum with the antenna pointed directly at it (end on). The operator could determine the direction to a target by rotating the antenna so one display showed a maximum while the other showed a minimum.
One serious limitation with this type of solution is that the broadcast is sent out in all directions, so the amount of energy in the direction being examined is a small part of that transmitted. To get a reasonable amount of power on the &quot;target&quot;, the transmitting aerial should also be directional.

====Parabolic reflector====
More modern systems use a steerable parabolic &quot;dish&quot; to create a tight broadcast beam, typically using the same dish as the receiver. Such systems often combine two radar frequencies in the same antenna in order to allow automatic steering, or &quot;radar lock&quot;.

Parabolic reflectors can be either symmetric parabolas or spoiled parabolas:
Symmetric parabolic antennas produce a narrow &quot;pencil&quot; beam in both the X and Y dimensions and consequently have a higher gain. The NEXRAD Pulse-Doppler weather radar uses a symmetric antenna to perform detailed volumetric scans of the atmosphere. Spoiled parabolic antennas produce a narrow beam in one dimension and a relatively wide beam in the other. This feature is useful if target detection over a wide range of angles is more important than target location in three dimensions. Most 2D surveillance radars use a spoiled parabolic antenna with a narrow azimuthal beamwidth and wide vertical beamwidth. This beam configuration allows the radar operator to detect an aircraft at a specific azimuth but at an indeterminate height. Conversely, so-called &quot;nodder&quot; height finding radars use a dish with a narrow vertical beamwidth and wide azimuthal beamwidth to detect an aircraft at a specific height but with low azimuthal precision.

====Types of scan====
* Primary Scan: A scanning technique where the main antenna aerial is moved to produce a scanning beam, examples include circular scan, sector scan, etc.
* Secondary Scan: A scanning technique where the antenna feed is moved to produce a scanning beam, examples include conical scan, unidirectional sector scan, lobe switching, etc.
* Palmer Scan: A scanning technique that produces a scanning beam by moving the main antenna and its feed. A Palmer Scan is a combination of a Primary Scan and a Secondary Scan.
* Conical scanning: The radar beam is rotated in a small circle around the &quot;boresight&quot; axis, which is pointed at the target.

====Slotted waveguide====

Applied similarly to the parabolic reflector, the slotted waveguide is moved mechanically to scan and is particularly suitable for non-tracking surface scan systems, where the vertical pattern may remain constant. Owing to its lower cost and less wind exposure, shipboard, airport surface, and harbour surveillance radars now use this approach in preference to a parabolic antenna.

====Phased array====
Another method of steering is used in a phased array radar.

Phased array antennas are composed of evenly spaced similar antenna elements, such as aerials or rows of slotted waveguide. Each antenna element or group of antenna elements incorporates a discrete phase shift that produces a phase gradient across the array. For example, array elements producing a 5 degree phase shift for each wavelength across the array face will produce a beam pointed 5 degrees away from the centerline perpendicular to the array face. Signals travelling along that beam will be reinforced. Signals offset from that beam will be cancelled. The amount of reinforcement is antenna gain. The amount of cancellation is side-lobe suppression.

Phased array radars have been in use since the earliest years of radar in World War II (Mammut radar), but electronic device limitations led to poor performance. Phased array radars were originally used for missile defence (see for example Safeguard Program). They are the heart of the ship-borne Aegis Combat System and the Patriot Missile System. The massive redundancy associated with having a large number of array elements increases reliability at the expense of gradual performance degradation that occurs as individual phase elements fail. To a lesser extent, phased array radars have been used in weather surveillance. As of 2017, NOAA plans to implement a national network of multi-function phased array radars throughout the United States within 10 years, for meteorological studies and flight monitoring.

Phased array antennas can be built to conform to specific shapes, like missiles, infantry support vehicles, ships, and aircraft.

As the price of electronics has fallen, phased array radars have become more common. Almost all modern military radar systems are based on phased arrays, where the small additional cost is offset by the improved reliability of a system with no moving parts. Traditional moving-antenna designs are still widely used in roles where cost is a significant factor such as air traffic surveillance and similar systems.

Phased array radars are valued for use in aircraft since they can track multiple targets. The first aircraft to use a phased array radar was the B-1B Lancer. The first fighter aircraft to use phased array radar was the Mikoyan MiG-31. The MiG-31M&#x27;s SBI-16 Zaslon passive electronically scanned array radar was considered to be the world&#x27;s most powerful fighter radar, until the AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array was introduced on the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor.

Phased-array interferometry or aperture synthesis techniques, using an array of separate dishes that are phased into a single effective aperture, are not typical for radar applications, although they are widely used in radio astronomy. Because of the thinned array curse, such multiple aperture arrays, when used in transmitters, result in narrow beams at the expense of reducing the total power transmitted to the target. In principle, such techniques could increase spatial resolution, but the lower power means that this is generally not effective.

Aperture synthesis by post-processing motion data from a single moving source, on the other hand, is widely used in space and airborne radar systems.

===Frequency bands===
Antennas generally have to be sized similar to the wavelength of the operational frequency, normally within an order of magnitude. This provides a strong incentive to use shorter wavelengths as this will result in smaller antennas. Shorter wavelengths also result in higher resolution due to diffraction, meaning the shaped reflector seen on most radars can also be made smaller for any desired beamwidth.

Opposing the move to smaller wavelengths are a number of practical issues. For one, the electronics needed to produce high power very short wavelengths were generally more complex and expensive than the electronics needed for longer wavelengths or did not exist at all. Another issue is that the radar equation&#x27;s effective aperture figure means that for any given antenna (or reflector) size will be more efficient at longer wavelengths. Additionally, shorter wavelengths may interact with molecules or raindrops in the air, scattering the signal. Very long wavelengths also have additional diffraction effects that make them suitable for over the horizon radars. For this reason, a wide variety of wavelengths are used in different roles.

The traditional band names originated as code-names during World War II and are still in military and aviation use throughout the world. They have been adopted in the United States by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and internationally by the International Telecommunication Union. Most countries have additional regulations to control which parts of each band are available for civilian or military use.

Other users of the radio spectrum, such as the broadcasting and electronic countermeasures industries, have replaced the traditional military designations with their own systems.

===Modulators===
Modulators act to provide the waveform of the RF-pulse. There are two different radar modulator designs:
* High voltage switch for non-coherent keyed power-oscillators. These modulators consist of a high voltage pulse generator formed from a high voltage supply, a pulse forming network, and a high voltage switch such as a thyratron. They generate short pulses of power to feed, e.g., the magnetron, a special type of vacuum tube that converts DC (usually pulsed) into microwaves. This technology is known as pulsed power. In this way, the transmitted pulse of RF radiation is kept to a defined and usually very short duration.
* Hybrid mixers, fed by a waveform generator and an exciter for a complex but coherent waveform. This waveform can be generated by low power/low-voltage input signals. In this case the radar transmitter must be a power-amplifier, e.g., a klystron or a solid state transmitter. In this way, the transmitted pulse is intrapulse-modulated and the radar receiver must use pulse compression techniques.

===Coolant===

Coherent microwave amplifiers operating above 1,000 watts microwave output, like travelling wave tubes and klystrons, require liquid coolant. The electron beam must contain 5 to 10 times more power than the microwave output, which can produce enough heat to generate plasma. This plasma flows from the collector toward the cathode. The same magnetic focusing that guides the electron beam forces the plasma into the path of the electron beam but flowing in the opposite direction. This introduces FM modulation which degrades Doppler performance. To prevent this, liquid coolant with minimum pressure and flow rate is required, and deionized water is normally used in most high power surface radar systems that use Doppler processing.

Coolanol (silicate ester) was used in several military radars in the 1970s. However, it is hygroscopic, leading to hydrolysis and formation of highly flammable alcohol. The loss of a U.S. Navy aircraft in 1978 was attributed to a silicate ester fire. Coolanol is also expensive and toxic. The U.S. Navy has instituted a program named Pollution Prevention (P2) to eliminate or reduce the volume and toxicity of waste, air emissions, and effluent discharges. Because of this, Coolanol is used less often today.

<text>The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the air and space force of the United Kingdom, British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies. It was formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, on the merger of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). Following the Allied victory over the Central Powers in 1918, the RAF emerged as the largest air force in the world at the time. Since its formation, the RAF has played a significant role in British military history. In particular, during the Second World War, the RAF established air superiority over Nazi Germany&#x27;s Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain, and led the Allied strategic bombing effort.

The RAF&#x27;s mission is to support the objectives of the British Ministry of Defence (MOD), which are to &quot;provide the capabilities needed to ensure the security and defence of the United Kingdom and overseas territories, including against terrorism; to support the Government&#x27;s foreign policy objectives particularly in promoting international peace and security&quot;. The RAF describes its mission statement as &quot;... [to provide] an &quot;agile, adaptable and capable&quot; Air Force that, person for person, is second to none, and that makes a decisive air power contribution in support of the UK Defence Mission&quot;. The mission statement is supported by the RAF&#x27;s definition of air power, which guides its strategy. Air power is defined as &quot;the ability to project power from the air and space to influence the behaviour of people or the course of events&quot;.

Today, the Royal Air Force maintains an operational fleet of various types of aircraft, described by the RAF as being &quot;leading-edge&quot; in terms of technology. This largely consists of fixed-wing aircraft, including those in the following roles: fighter and strike, airborne early warning and control, intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR), signals intelligence (SIGINT), maritime patrol, air-to-air refueling (AAR) and strategic &amp; tactical transport. The majority of the RAF&#x27;s rotary-wing aircraft form part of the tri-service Joint Aviation Command in support of ground forces. Most of the RAF&#x27;s aircraft and personnel are based in the UK, with many others serving on global operations (principally over Iraq and Syria) or at long-established overseas bases (Ascension Island, Cyprus, Gibraltar, and the Falkland Islands). Although the RAF is the principal British air power arm, the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm and the British Army&#x27;s Army Air Corps also operate armed aircraft.

==History==

===Origins===
The Royal Air Force was formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, becoming the third independent air force in the world after the Mexican Air Force (established 5 February 1915) and the Finnish Air Force (established 6 March 1918), by merging the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). This was done as recommended in a report prepared by the South African statesman and general Jan Smuts. At that time it was the largest air force in the world. Its headquarters was located in the former Hotel Cecil.

After the war, the RAF was drastically cut and its inter-war years were relatively quiet. The RAF was put in charge of British military activity in Iraq, and carried out minor activities in other parts of the British Empire, including establishing bases to protect Singapore and Malaya. The RAF&#x27;s naval aviation branch, the Fleet Air Arm, was founded in 1924 but handed over to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939.

The RAF adopted the doctrine of strategic bombing, which led to the construction of long-range bombers and became its main bombing strategy in the Second World War.

===Second World War===
The Royal Air Force underwent rapid expansion prior to and during the Second World War. Under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan of December 1939, the air forces of British Commonwealth countries trained and formed &quot;Article XV squadrons&quot; for service with RAF formations. Many individual personnel from these countries, and exiles from occupied Europe, also served with RAF squadrons. By the end of the war the Royal Canadian Air Force had contributed more than 30 squadrons to serve in RAF formations, similarly, approximately a quarter of Bomber Command&#x27;s personnel were Canadian. Additionally, the Royal Australian Air Force represented around nine per cent of all RAF personnel who served in the European and Mediterranean theatres.

During the Battle of Britain in 1940, the RAF defended the skies over Britain against the numerically superior German . In what is perhaps the most prolonged and complicated air campaign in history, the Battle of Britain contributed significantly to the delay and subsequent indefinite postponement of Operation Sea Lion, Hitler&#x27;s plans for an invasion of the UK. In the House of Commons on 20 August, prompted by the ongoing efforts of the RAF, Prime Minister Winston Churchill made a speech to the nation, where he said &quot;Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few&quot;.
The largest RAF effort during the war was the strategic bombing campaign against Germany by Bomber Command. While RAF bombing of Germany began almost immediately upon the outbreak of war at first it was ineffectual; it was only later, particularly under the leadership of Air Chief Marshal Harris, that these attacks became increasingly devastating, from early 1943 onward, as new technology and greater numbers of superior aircraft became available. The RAF adopted night-time area bombing on German cities such as Hamburg and Dresden. Night time area bombing constituted the great bulk of the RAF&#x27;s bombing campaign, mainly due to Harris, but it also developed precision bombing techniques for specific operations, such as the infamous &quot;Dambusters&quot; raid by No. 617 Squadron, or the Amiens prison raid known as Operation Jericho.

===Cold War era===
Following victory in the Second World War, the RAF underwent significant re-organisation, as technological advances in air warfare saw the arrival of jet fighters and bombers. During the early stages of the Cold War, one of the first major operations undertaken by the RAF was the Berlin Airlift, codenamed Operation Plainfire. Between 26 June 1948 and the lifting of the Soviet blockade of the city on 12 May 1949, the RAF provided 17% of the total supplies delivered, using Avro Yorks, Douglas Dakotas flying to Gatow Airport and Short Sunderlands flying to Lake Havel. The RAF saw its first post-war engagements in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War: during the withdrawal of the former Mandatory Palestine in May 1948 where British Supermarine Spitfire FR.18s shot down four Royal Egyptian Air Force Spitfire LF.9s after the REAF mistakenly attacked RAF Ramat David airbase; and during encounters with the Israeli Air Force which saw the loss of a single de Havilland Mosquito PR.34 in November 1948 and four Spitfire FR.18s and a single Hawker Tempest F.6 in January 1949.

Before Britain developed its own nuclear weapons, the RAF was provided with American nuclear weapons under Project E. However, following the development of its own arsenal, the British Government elected on 16 February 1960 to share the country&#x27;s nuclear deterrent between the RAF and submarines of the Royal Navy, first deciding to concentrate solely on the air force&#x27;s V bomber fleet. These were initially armed with nuclear gravity bombs, later being equipped with the Blue Steel missile. Following the development of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Polaris submarines, the strategic nuclear deterrent passed to the navy&#x27;s submarines on 30 June 1969. With the introduction of Polaris, the RAF&#x27;s strategic nuclear role was reduced to a tactical one, using WE.177 gravity bombs. This tactical role was continued by the V bombers into the 1980s and until 1998 by the Panavia Tornado GR1.
For much of the Cold War the primary role of the RAF was the defence of Western Europe against potential attack by the Soviet Union, with many squadrons based in West Germany. The main RAF bases in RAF(G) were RAF Brüggen, RAF Gutersloh, RAF Laarbruch and RAF Wildenrath – the only air defence base in RAF(G). With the decline of the British Empire, global operations were scaled back, and RAF Far East Air Force was disbanded on 31 October 1971. Despite this, the RAF fought in many battles in the Cold War period. In June 1948, the RAF commenced Operation Firedog against Malayan pro-independence fighters during the Malayan Emergency. Operations continued for the next 12 years until 1960 with aircraft flying out of RAF Tengah and RAF Butterworth. The RAF played a minor role in the Korean War, with flying boats taking part. From 1953 to 1956 the RAF Avro Lincoln squadrons carried out anti-Mau Mau operations in Kenya using its base at RAF Eastleigh. The Suez Crisis in 1956 saw a large RAF role, with aircraft operating from RAF Akrotiri and RAF Nicosia on Cyprus and RAF Luqa and RAF Hal Far on Malta as part of Operation Musketeer. The RAF suffered its most recent loss to an enemy aircraft during the Suez Crisis, when an English Electric Canberra PR7 was shot down over Syria.

In 1957, the RAF participated heavily during the Jebel Akhdar War in Oman, operating both de Havilland Venom and Avro Shackleton aircraft. The RAF made 1,635 raids, dropping 1,094 tons and firing 900 rockets at the interior of Oman between July and December 1958, targeting insurgents, mountain top villages and water channels in a war that remained under low profile. The Konfrontasi against Indonesia in the early 1960s did see use of RAF aircraft, but due to a combination of deft diplomacy and selective ignoring of certain events by both sides, it never developed into a full-scale war. The RAF played a large role in the Aden Emergency between 1963 and 1967. Hawker Hunter FGA.9s based at RAF Khormaksar, Aden, were regularly called in by the British Army as close air support to carry out strikes on rebel positions. The Radfan Campaign (Operation Nutcracker) in early 1964 was successful in suppressing the revolt in Radfa, however it did nothing to end the insurgency with the British withdrawing from Aden in November 1967.

One of the largest actions undertaken by the RAF during the Cold War was the air campaign during the 1982 Falklands War, in which the RAF operated alongside the Fleet Air Arm. During the war, RAF aircraft were deployed in the mid-Atlantic at RAF Ascension Island and a detachment from No. 1 Squadron was deployed with the Royal Navy, operating from the aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Hermes&quot;. RAF pilots also flew missions using the Royal Navy&#x27;s Sea Harriers in the air-to-air combat role, in particular Flight Lieutenant Dave Morgan the highest scoring pilot of the war. Following a British victory, the RAF remained in the South Atlantic to provide air defence to the Falkland Islands, with the McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 based at RAF Mount Pleasant which was built in 1984.

===Post-Cold War===

With the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the RAF&#x27;s focus returned to expeditionary air power. Since 1990, the RAF has been involved in several large-scale operations, including the 1991 Gulf War, the 1999 Kosovo War, the 2001 War in Afghanistan, the 2003 invasion and war in Iraq, the 2011 intervention in Libya and from 2014 onwards has been involved in the war against the Islamic State.

The RAF began conducting Remotely-piloted Air System (RPAS) operations in 2004, with No. 1115 Flight carrying out missions in Afghanistan and Iraq with the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator. Initially embedded with the United States Air Force, the RAF formed its own RPAS squadron in 2007 when No. 39 Squadron was stood up as a General Atomics MQ-9A Reaper unit at Creech AFB, Nevada.

The RAF&#x27;s 90th anniversary was commemorated on 1 April 2008 by a flypast of the RAF&#x27;s Aerobatic Display Team the Red Arrows and four Eurofighter Typhoons along the River Thames, in a straight line from just south of London City Airport Tower Bridge, the London Eye, the RAF Memorial and (at 13.00) the Ministry of Defence building.

Four major defence reviews have been conducted since the end of the Cold War: the 1990 Options for Change, the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the 2003 Delivering Security in a Changing World and the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR). All four defence reviews have resulted in steady reductions in manpower and numbers of aircraft, especially combat aircraft such as fast-jets. As part of the latest 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review, the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 maritime patrol aircraft was cancelled due to over spending and missing deadlines. Other reductions saw total manpower reduced by 5,000 personnel to a trained strength of 33,000 and the early retirement of the Joint Force Harrier aircraft, the BAE Harrier GR7/GR9.
In recent years, fighter aircraft on Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) have been increasingly required to scramble in response to Russian Air Force aircraft approaching British airspace. On 24 January 2014, in the Houses of Parliament, Conservative MP and Minister of State for the Armed Forces, Andrew Robathan, announced that the RAF&#x27;s QRA force had been scrambled almost thirty times in the last three years: eleven times during 2010, ten times during 2011 and eight times during 2012. RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and RAF Lossiemouth in Moray both provide QRA aircraft, and scramble their Typhoons within minutes to meet or intercept aircraft which give cause for concern. Lossiemouth generally covers the northern sector of UK airspace, while Coningsby covers the southern sector. Typhoon pilot Flight Lieutenant Noel Rees describes how QRA duty works. &quot;At the start of the scaled QRA response, civilian air traffic controllers might see on their screens an aircraft behaving erratically, not responding to their radio calls, or note that it&#x27;s transmitting a distress signal through its transponder. Rather than scramble Typhoons at the first hint of something abnormal, a controller has the option to put them on a higher level of alert, &#x27;a call to cockpit&#x27;. In this scenario the pilot races to the hardened aircraft shelter and does everything short of starting his engines&quot;.
On 4 October 2015, a final stand-down saw the end of more than 70 years of RAF Search and Rescue provision in the UK. The RAF and Royal Navy&#x27;s Westland Sea King fleets, after over 30 years of service, were retired. A civilian contractor, Bristow Helicopters, took over responsibility for UK Search and Rescue, under a Private Finance Initiative with newly purchased Sikorsky S-92 and AgustaWestland AW189 aircraft. The new contract means that all UK SAR coverage is now provided by Bristow aircraft.

In 2018, the RAF&#x27;s vision of a future constellation of imagery satellites was initiated through the launch of the Carbonite-2 technology demonstrator. The 100 kg Carbonite-2 uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components to deliver high-quality imagery and 3D video footage from space. The Royal Air Force celebrated its 100th anniversary on 1 April 2018. It marked the occasion on 10 July 2018 with a flypast over London consisting of 103 aircraft.

Between March 2020 and 2022, the RAF assisted with the response efforts to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom as part of Operation Rescript. This saw the service provide repatriation flights and aeromedical evacuations of COVID-19 patients, drivers and call-handlers to support ambulance services and medics to assist with the staffing of hospitals, testing units and vaccination centres. Under Operation Broadshare, the RAF has also been involved with COVID-19 relief operations overseas, repatriating stranded nationals and delivering medical supplies and vaccines to British Overseas Territories and military installations.

The UK&#x27;s 20-year long operations in Afghanistan came to an end in August 2021, seeing the largest airlift since the Berlin Blockade take place. As part of Operation Pitting, the RAF helped evacuate over 15,000 people in two weeks. Between April and May 2023, the RAF helped evacuate over 2,300 people from Sudan due to the 2023 Sudan conflict as part of Operation Polarbear.

In April 2024, Typhoon FGR4s operating from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus, engaged and destroyed Iranian drones over Iraqi and Syrian airspace during Iran&#x27;s strikes against Israel.

==Structure==
=== Senior leadership ===

The professional head and highest-ranking officer of the Royal Air Force is the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS). He reports to the Chief of the Defence Staff, who is the professional head of the British Armed Forces. The incumbent Chief of the Air Staff is Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton who was appointed in 2023.

The management of the RAF is the responsibility of the Air Force Board, a sub-committee of the Defence Council which is part of the Ministry of Defence and body legally responsible for the defence of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. The Chief of the Air Staff chairs the Air Force Board Standing Committee (AFBSC) which decides on the policy and actions required for the RAF to meet the requirements of the Defence Council and His Majesty&#x27;s Government.

The Chief of the Air Staff is supported by several other senior commanders:

=== Air Command ===
Administrative and operational command of the RAF is delegated by the Air Force Board to Headquarters Air Command, based at RAF High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. Air Command was formed on 1 April 2007 by combining RAF Strike Command and RAF Personnel and Training Command, resulting in a single command covering the whole RAF, led by the Chief of the Air Staff. Through its subordinate groups, Air Command oversees the whole spectrum of RAF aircraft and operations.

United Kingdom Space Command (UKSC), established 1 April 2021 under the command of Air Vice-Marshal Paul Godfrey is a joint command, but sits &quot;under the Royal Air Force.&quot; Godfrey is of equal rank to the commanders of 1, 2, 11, and 22 Groups. The new command has &quot;responsibility for not just operations, but also generating, training and growing the force, and also owning the money and putting all the programmatic rigour into delivering new ..capabilities.&quot; UKSC headquarters is at RAF High Wycombe co-located with Air Command.

===Groups===
Groups are the subdivisions of operational commands and are responsible for certain types of capabilities or for operations in limited geographical areas. There are five groups subordinate to Air Command, of which four are functional and one is geographically focused:

==== No. 1 Group (Air Combat) ====
No. 1 Group is responsible for combat aircraft (comprising the Lightning Force and Typhoon Force) and the RAF&#x27;s intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) capabilities. It oversees stations at RAF Coningsby and RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, RAF Lossiemouth in Moray and RAF Marham in Norfolk. The group&#x27;s Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 aircraft protect UK and NATO airspace by providing a continuous Quick Reaction Alert capability.

==== No. 2 Group (Air Combat Support) ====
No. 2 Group controls the Air Mobility Force which provides strategic and tactical airlift, air-to-air refuelling and command support air transport (CSAT). The group is also responsible for the RAF Medical Services, RAF Support Force, consisting of the RAF&#x27;s engineering, logistics, intelligence, signals, musical and mountain rescue assets, RAF&#x27;s Combat and Readiness Force, comprising the RAF Regiment, and the Air Security Force, comprising RAF Police. It oversees stations at RAF Benson and RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, RAF Henlow in Bedfordshire, RAF Honington in Suffolk, RAF Odiham in Hampshire and RAF Northolt in West London.

====No. 11 Group (Multi-domain operations)====
No. 11 Group is responsible for integrating operations across the air, cyber and space domains whilst responding to new and evolving threats. It includes the RAF&#x27;s Battlespace Management Force which controls the UK Air Surveillance and Control System (ASACS). The group oversees stations at RAF Boulmer in Northumberland, RAF Fylingdales in North Yorkshire and RAF Spadeadam in Cumbria.

====No. 22 Group (Training)====
No. 22 Group is responsible for the supply of qualified and skilled personnel to the RAF and provides flying and non-flying training to all three British armed services. It is the end-user of the UK Military Flying Training System which is provided by civilian contractor Ascent Flight Training. The group oversees stations at RAF College Cranwell in Lincolnshire, RAF Cosford and RAF Shawbury in Shropshire, RAF Halton in Buckinghamshire, MOD St Athan in the Vale of Glamorgan, RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall and RAF Valley on Anglesey. The No. 22 Group also manages the Royal Air Force Air Cadets.

===Stations===
An RAF station is ordinarily subordinate to a group and is commanded by a group captain. Each station typically hosts several flying and non-flying squadrons or units which are supported by administrative and support wings.

==== United Kingdom ====
Front-line flying operations are focused at eight stations:

* RAF Coningsby, RAF Marham and RAF Lossiemouth (Air Combat)
* RAF Waddington (ISTAR)
* RAF Brize Norton and RAF Northolt (Air Transport)
* RAF Benson and RAF Odiham (Support Helicopter Force operating under Joint Aviation Command)

Flying training takes places at RAF Barkston Heath, RAF College Cranwell, RAF Shawbury and RAF Valley, each forming part of the UK Military Flying Training System which is dedicated to training aircrew for all three UK armed services. Specialist ground crew training is focused at RAF Cosford, RAF St Mawgan and MOD St. Athan.

Operations are supported by numerous other flying and non-flying stations, with activity focussed at RAF Honington which coordinates Force Protection and RAF Leeming &amp; RAF Wittering which have a support enabler role.

A Control and Reporting Centre (CRC) at RAF Boulmer is tasked with compiling a Recognised Air Picture of UK air space and providing tactical control of the Quick Reaction Alert Force. In order to achieve this Boulmer is supported by a network of eight Remote Radar Heads (RRHs) spread the length of the UK.

==== Overseas ====
The UK operates permanent military airfields (known as Permanent Joint Operating Bases) in four British Overseas Territories. These bases contribute to the physical defence and maintenance of sovereignty of the British Overseas Territories and enable the UK to conduct expeditionary military operations. Although command and oversight of the bases is provided by Strategic Command, the airfield elements are known as RAF stations.

* RAF Akrotiri (Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Cyprus)
* RAF Ascension Island (Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cuhna)
* RAF Mount Pleasant (Falkland Islands)
* RAF Gibraltar (Gibraltar)

Four RAF squadrons are based overseas. No. 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron is based at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in the United States and works in close cooperation with the U.S. Air Force in the development of the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning. No. 80 Squadron is part of the Australia, Canada and United Kingdom Reprogramming Laboratory (ACURL) at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and is tasked with compiling and testing the Mission Data File Sets (MDFS) for the F-35. No. 84 Squadron is located at RAF Akrotiri, operating the Westland Puma HC2 for search and rescue. No. 230 Squadron, based at Medicina Lines, Brunei, also operate the Puma HC2.

===Squadrons===
A flying squadron is an aircraft unit which carries out the primary tasks of the RAF. RAF squadrons are somewhat analogous to the regiments of the British Army in that they have histories and traditions going back to their formation, regardless of where they are based or which aircraft they are operating. They can be awarded standards and battle honours for meritorious service. Most flying squadrons are commanded by a wing commander and, for a fast-jet squadron, have an complement of around twelve aircraft.

=== Flights ===
Independent flights are so designated because they are explicitly smaller in size than a squadron. Many independent flights are, or have been, front-line flying units. For example, No. 1435 Flight carries out air defence duties for the Falkland Islands, with four Eurofighter Typhoon fighters based at RAF Mount Pleasant.

=== Support wings and units ===

Support capabilities are provided by several specialist wings and other units.
* Air Warfare Centre (RAF Waddington)
* Airborne Delivery Wing (RAF Brize Norton)
* Mobile Meteorological Unit (RAF Waddington)
* Tactical Communications Wing (RAF Leeming)
* Tactical Medical Wing (RAF Brize Norton)
* Tactical Supply Wing (MOD Stafford)

* No. 1 Air Control Centre (RAF Boulmer)
* No. 1 Air Mobility Wing (RAF Brize Norton)
* No. 1 Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Wing (RAF Waddington)
* No. 42 (Expeditionary Support) Wing (RAF Wittering)
* No. 85 (Expeditionary Logistics) Wing (RAF Wittering)
* No. 90 Signals Unit (RAF Leeming)
=== Expeditionary Air Wings ===

Command, control, and support for overseas operations is typically provided through Expeditionary Air Wings (EAWs). Each wing is brought together as and when required and comprises the deployable elements of its home station as well as other support elements from throughout the RAF.

* No. 34 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Waddington) – ISTAR operations
* No. 38 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Brize Norton) – air transport operations
* No. 121 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Coningsby) – multi-role operations
* No. 135 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Leeming) – fighter operations
* No. 138 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Marham) – fighter operations
* No. 140 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Lossiemouth) – fighter operations

Several Expeditionary Air Wings are based overseas:

* No. 901 Expeditionary Air Wing (Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar) – Communication and information systems support
* No. 902 Expeditionary Air Wing (Middle East) – Helicopter support
*No. 903 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus) – Supports Operation Shader
*No. 905 Expeditionary Air Wing (RAF Mount Pleasant, Falklands Islands) – Protection of British Overseas Territories in the South Atlantic
* No. 906 Expeditionary Air Wing (Middle East) – Air transport support

===Training schools===
==== Flying training ====
The RAF Schools consist of the squadrons and support apparatus that train new aircrew to join front-line squadrons. The schools separate individual streams, but group together units with similar responsibility or that operate the same aircraft type. Some schools operate with only one squadron, and have an overall training throughput which is relatively small; some, like No. 3 Flying Training School, have responsibility for all Elementary Flying Training (EFT) in the RAF, and all RAF aircrew will pass through its squadrons when they start their flying careers. No. 2 Flying Training School and No. 6 Flying Training School do not have a front-line training responsibility – their job is to group the University Air Squadrons and the Volunteer Gliding Squadrons together. The commanding officer of No. 2 FTS holds the only full-time flying appointment for a Group Captain in the RAF, and is a reservist.

*Central Flying School (RAF Cranwell) – standardises flying training across the air force and ensures standards and safety are maintained.
*No. 1 Flying Training School (RAF Shawbury) – basic and advanced helicopter training.
*No. 2 Flying Training School (RAF Syerston) – gliding training provided by Volunteer Gliding Squadrons based at airfields throughout the UK.
*No. 3 Flying Training School (RAF Cranwell) – Elementary Flying Training (EFT) for RAF, Fleet Air Arm and Army Air Corps crews, also operates from RAF Wittering and RAF Barkston Heath.
*No. 4 Flying Training School (RAF Valley) – Basic Fast Jet Training (BFJT) and Advanced Fast Jet Training (AFJT).
*No. 6 Flying Training School (RAF Cranwell) – Initial training provided by University Air Squadrons and Air Experience Flights based at airfields throughout the UK.

==== Non-flying training ====

The British military operate a number of joint training organisations, with Air Command leading the provision of technical training through the Defence College of Technical Training (DCTT). It provides training in aeronautical engineering, electro and mechanical engineering, and communication and information systems.

* No. 1 School of Technical Training is based at RAF Cosford and provides RAF personnel with mechanical, avionics, weapons and survival equipment training. Also based at Cosford is the Aerosystems Engineer and Management Training School. Both are part of the Defence School of Aeronautical Engineering. 
* No. 4 School of Technical Training is part of the Defence School of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering (DSEME) and is based at MOD St Athan. It provides training to non-aircraft ground engineering technicians.
* No. 1 Radio School and the Aerial Erectors School are based at Cosford and RAF Digby respectively and are part of the Defence School of Communications and Information Systems.

====Specialist training and education====
The Royal Air Force operates several units and centres for the provision of non-generic training and education. These include the Royal Air Force Leadership Centre and the RAF Centre for Air Power Studies, both based at RAF Cranwell, and the Air Warfare Centre, based at RAF Waddington and RAF Cranwell. Non-commissioned officer training and developmental courses occur at RAF Halton and officer courses occur at the Joint Services Command and Staff College at Shrivenham.

==Personnel==
At its height in 1944 during the Second World War, more than 1,100,000 personnel were serving in the RAF. The longest-lived founding member of the RAF was Henry Allingham, who died on 18 July 2009 aged 113.

As of 1 January 2015, the RAF numbered some 34,200 Regular and 1,940 Royal Auxiliary Air Force personnel, giving a combined component strength of 36,140 personnel. In addition to the active elements of the RAF, (Regular and Royal Auxiliary Air Force), all ex-Regular personnel remain liable to be recalled for duty in a time of need, this is known as the Regular Reserve. In 2007, there were 33,980 RAF Regular Reserves, of which 7,950 served under a fixed-term reserve contract. Publications since April 2013 no-longer report the entire strength of the Regular Reserve, instead they only give a figure for Regular Reserves who serve under a fixed-term reserve contract. They had a strength of 7,120 personnel in 2014.

Figures provided by the International Institute for Strategic Studies from 2012 showed that RAF pilots achieve a relatively high number of flying hours per year when compared with other major NATO allies such as France and Germany. RAF pilots achieve 210 to 290 flying hours per year. French and German Air Force pilots achieved 180 and 150 flying hours across their fleets respectively.

===Officers===

Officers hold a commission from the Sovereign, which provides the legal authority for them to issue orders to subordinates. The commission of a regular officer is granted after successfully completing the 24-week-long Initial Officer Training course at the RAF College, Cranwell, Lincolnshire.

To emphasise the merger of both military and naval aviation when the RAF was formed, many of the titles of officers were deliberately chosen to be of a naval character, such as flight lieutenant, wing commander, group captain, and air commodore.

===Other ranks===
Other ranks attend the Recruit Training Squadron at RAF Halton for basic training. The titles and insignia of other ranks in the RAF were based on that of the Army, with some alterations in terminology. Over the years, this structure has seen significant changes: for example, there was once a separate system for those in technical trades, and the ranks of chief technician and junior technician continue to be held only by personnel in technical trades. RAF other ranks fall into four categories: Warrant Officers, Senior Non-Commissioned Officers, Junior Non-Commissioned Officers and Airmen. All Warrant Officers in the RAF are equal in terms of rank, but the most senior Non-Commissioned appointment is known as the Warrant Officer of the Royal Air Force.

The Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 is the RAF&#x27;s primary multi-role air defence and ground attack fighter aircraft, following the retirement of the Panavia Tornado F3 in late March 2011. With the completion of &#x27;Project Centurion&#x27; upgrades, the Typhoon FGR4 took over ground attack duties from the Panavia Tornado GR4, which was retired on 1 April 2019. The Typhoon is tasked to defend UK airspace, while also frequently deploying in support of NATO air defence missions in the Baltic (Operation Azotize), Black Sea (Operation Biloxi), and Iceland (Icelandic Air Policing).

The RAF has seven front-line Typhoon squadrons, plus an Operational Conversion Unit (OCU), and Operational Evaluation Unit (OEU); No. 3 (Fighter) Squadron, No. XI (F) Squadron, No. 12 Squadron (joint RAF / Qatar Air Force), No. 29 Squadron (OCU), and No. 41 Test and Evaluation Squadron (OEU) based at RAF Coningsby; with No. 1 (F) Squadron, No. II (Army Cooperation) Squadron, No. 6 Squadron, and No. IX (Bomber) Squadron based at RAF Lossiemouth. Additionally, four Typhoons (&quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, &quot;Charity&quot;, and &quot;Desperation&quot;) are based at RAF Mount Pleasant on the Falkland Islands, forming No. 1435 Flight, where they provide air defence. It was originally suggested that an eighth front-line Typhoon squadron could be formed, however, the 2021 Defence Command Paper announced the retirement of 24 Tranche 1 Typhoons by 2025, and a commitment to seven front-line squadrons.

The Typhoon made its combat debut in support of Operation Ellamy in 2011, and has been supporting Operation Shader since December 2015. Typhoons have also been supporting Operation Poseidon Archer since January 2024. The Typhoon made its first air-to-air kill in December 2021, shooting down a small hostile drone near Al-Tanf base, Syria, with an ASRAAM.

====Lightning====
The Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine, all-weather stealth multirole combat aircraft. It is intended to perform both air superiority and strike missions while also providing electronic warfare and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. It will be jointly operated by the RAF and the Royal Navy and with its ability to perform short take-offs and vertical-landings (STOVL), can operate from the Royal Navy&#x27;s &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carriers. Originally a total of 138 Lightnings were planned, however the 2021 Defence Command Paper amended this to a commitment to increase the fleet beyond the current order of 48. By March 2024, 35 F-35Bs had been delivered to the RAF (though one crashed in November 2021). The F-35B has an out of service date (OSD) of 2069.

The first RAF squadron to operate the F-35B was No. 17 Test and Evaluation Squadron at Edwards AFB, California, accepting its first aircraft in 2014. No. 617 (The Dambusters) Squadron officially reformed on 18 April 2018 as the first operational RAF Lightning squadron. The first four aircraft arrived at RAF Marham from the United States in June 2018, with a further five arriving in August 2018. The Lightning was declared combat ready in January 2019. The second UK based F-35B squadron to be formed was No. 207 Squadron on 1 August 2019 as the OCU for both RAF and Royal Navy pilots.

=== Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) ===
Six Hawker Beechcraft Shadow R1s (with two more to be converted) are operated by No. 14 Squadron from RAF Waddington, these aircraft are King Air 350CERs that have been specially converted for the ISTAR role. Four Shadow R1s were originally ordered in 2007 due to an Urgent Operational Requirement, and began the conversion process to the ISTAR role in 2009. &quot;ZZ416&quot; was the first Shadow R1 to be delivered in May 2009 to No. V (AC) Squadron. A further Shadow was procured and delivered in December 2011. The Shadow fleet was transferred over to the newly reformed No. 14 Squadron in October 2011. Following the 2015 SDSR, three more Shadows were ordered and the fleet was given an OSD of 2030.

Ten General Atomics MQ-9A Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles are operated by No. XIII Squadron at RAF Waddington.

Three Boeing RC-135W Rivet Joints (also known in RAF service as Airseeker) replaced the Hawker Siddeley Nimrod R1 fleet in the signals intelligence role under the Airseeker Programme and are flown by No. 51 Squadron. The Nimrod fleet was retired in 2011, the RAF co-manned aircraft of the US Air Force until the three RC-135s entered service between 2014 and 2017. The aircraft were Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker tankers converted to RC-135W standard in the most complex combined Foreign Military Sales case and co-operative support arrangement that the UK had undertaken with the United States Air Force since the Second World War. The Rivet Joint received its first operational deployment in August 2014, when it was deployed to the Middle East to fly missions over Iraq and Syria as part of Operation Shader. The RC-135W&#x27;s OSD is 2035.

The General Atomics Protector RG1 is currently being introduced into RAF service, with operational flying scheduled to begin in 2025. On 5 October 2015, it was announced that the Scavenger programme had been replaced by &quot;Protector&quot;, a new requirement for at least 20 unmanned aerial vehicles. On 7 October 2015, it was revealed that Protector would be a certifiable derivative of the MQ-9B SkyGuardian with enhanced range and endurance. In 2016, it was indicated that at least sixteen aircraft would be purchased with a maximum of up to twenty-six. In July 2018, a General Atomics US civil-registered SkyGuardian was flown from North Dakota to RAF Fairford for the Royal International Air Tattoo where it was given RAF markings. In July 2020, the Ministry of Defence signed a contract for three Protectors with an option on an additional thirteen aircraft. The 2021 Defence Command Paper confirmed the order for 16 Protectors, despite the fact that the 2015 SDSR originally laid out plans for more than 20. The first Protector RG1 (&quot;PR009&quot;) was delivered to RAF Waddington in September 2023. No. 31 Squadron was reformed as the first Protector squadron on 11 October 2023, having been earmarked for the role in 2018.

Based at RAF Waddington, No. 54 Squadron and No. 56 Squadron act as the OCU and OEU for the ISTAR fleet respectively.

===Maritime patrol===

Nine Boeing Poseidon MRA1 were ordered by the British government in November 2015 in its Strategic Defence and Security Review for surveillance, anti-submarine and anti-surface ship warfare, filling a capability gap in maritime patrol that had been left since the cancellation of the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 programme in the 2010 SDSR. On 13 July 2017, it was announced that No. 120 Squadron and No. 201 Squadron, both former Nimrod MR2 squadrons, would operate the Poseidon and be based at RAF Lossiemouth. No. 120 Squadron was stood up on 1 April 2018, with No. 201 Squadron reforming on 7 August 2021. No. 54 Squadron was the OCU for the Poseidon fleet between 2020 and 2023. No. 42 (Torpedo Bomber) Squadron has been the OCU for the Poseidon since September 2023.

The first production Poseidon MRA1 &quot;ZP801&quot; made its initial flight on 13 July 2019. &quot;ZP801&quot; arrived at Kinloss Barracks, the former home of the Nimrod, on 4 February 2020, filling a decade long gap in maritime capability. The Poseidon was declared combat ready in April 2020. The Poseidon carried out its first operational mission on 3 August 2020, when the Russian warship &quot;Vasily Bykov&quot; was tracked. A Poseidon MRA1 arrived at RAF Lossiemouth for the first time in October 2020. The ninth, and final Poseidon arrived at RAF Lossiemouth on 11 January 2022.

===Air mobility===
No. 99 Squadron operate eight Boeing C-17A Globemaster III in the heavy strategic airlift role from RAF Brize Norton, Oxfordshire. Four C-17A were originally leased from Boeing in 2000, These four were subsequently purchased outright, followed by a fifth delivered on 7 April 2008 and a sixth delivered on 11 June 2008. The MOD said there was &quot;a stated departmental requirement for eight&quot; C-17s and a seventh was subsequently ordered, to be delivered in December 2010. In February 2012 the purchase of an eighth C-17 was confirmed; the aircraft arrived at RAF Brize Norton in May 2012.

The Airbus Atlas C1 (A400M) replaced the RAF&#x27;s fleet of C-130 Hercules, initially replacing the C1/C3 (C-130K) which were withdrawn from use on 28 October 2013, having originally entered service in 1967. Based at RAF Brize Norton, the Atlas fleet is operated by No. 30 Squadron and No. LXX Squadron. The first Atlas C1 (&quot;ZM400&quot;) was delivered to the RAF in November 2014. Originally, twenty-five A400Ms were ordered in the initial batch; the total initial purchase then dropped to twenty-two. The final aircraft in the initial order of 22 aircraft was delivered in May 2023. In February 2023, the Chief of the Air Staff indicated that up to six additional aircraft were planned for delivery by 2030. The C-130J Hercules was retired from RAF service on 30 June 2023.

No. XXIV Squadron acts as the Air Mobility OCU (AMOCU) for the Globemaster and Atlas, while No. 206 Squadron is the OEU.

Air transport tasks are also carried out by the Airbus Voyager KC2/3, flown by No. 10 Squadron and No. 101 Squadron. The first Voyager (&quot;ZZ330&quot;) arrived in the UK for testing at MOD Boscombe Down in April 2011, and entered service in April 2012. The Voyager received approval from the MOD on 16 May 2013 to begin air-to-air refuelling flights and made its first operational tanker flight on 20 May 2013 as part of a training sortie with Tornado GR4s. By 21 May 2013, the Voyager fleet had carried over 50,000 passengers and carried over 3,000 tons of cargo. A total of fourteen Voyagers form the fleet, with nine allocated to sole RAF use (three KC2s and six KC3s). As the Voyagers lack a refuelling boom, the RAF has requested a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the USAF allowing the UK access to tankers equipped with refuelling booms for its RC-135W Rivet Joint .

Two Dassault Falcon 900XLs were procured in early 2022 to replace the RAF&#x27;s fleet of four BAe 146s (two CC2s and two C3s) in the Command Support Air Transport role. Known as the Envoy IV CC1 in British service, the aircraft are based at RAF Northolt and are operated by a mixed civilian and No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron crew. This arrangement will remain until 2026 when the fleet will be placed on the military register.

===Helicopters===
RAF helicopters support the British Army by moving troops and equipment to and around the battlefield. Helicopters are also used in a variety of other roles, including in support of RAF ground units and heavy-lift support for the Royal Marines. The support helicopters are organised into the tri-service Joint Aviation Command (JAC), along with helicopters from the British Army and Royal Navy. No. 22 Squadron, based at RAF Benson, is the OEU for JAC.

The large twin-rotor Boeing Chinook is the RAF&#x27;s heavy-lift support helicopter. Originally ordered in 1978, with subsequent orders in 1995, 2011, and 2018 (yet to be finalised), the Chinook is operated by No. 7 Squadron, No. 18 (B) Squadron and No. 27 Squadron at RAF Odiham and No. 28 (AC) Squadron (Support Helicopter OCU) at RAF Benson. Since being first delivered in 1980, the Chinook has been involved in numerous operations: the Falklands War (1982); Operation Granby (1991); Operation Engadine (1999); Operation Barras (2000); Operation Herrick (2002–2014); Operation Telic (2003–2011); Operation Ruman (2017); and Operation Newcombe (2018–2022). The 60-strong fleet of Chinooks currently has an OSD in the 2040s.

The Westland Puma HC2 is the RAF&#x27;s medium-lift support helicopter. It is operated by No. 33 Squadron and No. 28 (AC) Squadron (Support Helicopter OCU) at RAF Benson. No. 230 Squadron, the RAF&#x27;s &quot;tiger squadron&quot;, operate the Puma from Medicina Lines, Brunei, having relocated from RAF Benson in May 2023. No. 84 Squadron based at RAF Akrotiri in the Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas operate three Pumas as an emergency response platform after the Bell Griffin HAR2 was retired in April 2023. The first two Puma HC1s (&quot;XW198&quot; and &quot;XW199&quot;), of an eventual forty-eight, were delivered in January 1971, which were supplemented by a captured Argentine Army SA 330J in 2001 and six ex-South African Air Force SA 330Ls in 2002. Twenty-four Puma HC1s underwent upgrades to HC2 standard between 2012 and 2014. The Puma HC2 OSD is currently March 2028, having been extended from March 2025.

===Training aircraft===

The UK&#x27;s military flying training has been privatised through a public-private partnership, known as the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS). Training is provided by Ascent Flight Training, a consortium of Lockheed Martin and Babcock International. New aircraft were procured to reduce the training gap between the older generation Grob Tutor T1, Short Tucano T1 and Beechcraft King Air T1 aircraft, and the RAF&#x27;s modern front-line aircraft, including advanced systems and glass cockpits. UKMFTS also relies far more on synthetic training to prepare aircrew for the front line, where advanced synthetic training is commonplace.

====Initial training====
The Grob Tutor T1 equips fifteen University Air Squadrons, which provide university students an opportunity to undertake an RAF training syllabus, which includes first solo, as well as air navigation, aerobatics and formation flying. These units are co-located with Air Experience Flights, which share the same aircraft and facilities and provide air experience flying to the Air Training Corps and Combined Cadet Force. The Tutor is also flown by No. 16 Squadron and No. 115 Squadron based at RAF Wittering.

Volunteer Gliding Squadrons also provide air experience flying to cadets using the Grob Viking T1 conventional glider. Due to an airworthiness issue in April 2014, the Viking fleet and the Grob Vigilant T1 fleet were grounded for a two-year period, although Viking operations have subsequently resumed. The Vigilant was unexpectedly withdrawn from service in May 2018, a year earlier than planned. A contract tender was initiated in February 2018 to replace this capability from 2022 onwards.

==== Elementary training ====
The Grob Prefect T1 was introduced to RAF service in 2016 as its elementary trainer. The 23-strong fleet is based at RAF Cranwell and RAF Barkston Heath in Lincolnshire where they are operated by No. 57 Squadron. On completion of elementary training, aircrew are then streamed to either fast jet, multi-engine, or rotary training.

==== Basic fast jet training ====
Basic fast jet training is provided on the Beechcraft Texan T1, which replaced the Short Tucano T1 in November 2019. The Texan is a tandem-seat turboprop aircraft, featuring a digital glass cockpit. It is operated by No. 72 (F) Squadron based at RAF Valley in Anglesey which provides lead-in training for RAF and Royal Navy fighter pilots prior to advanced training on the BAE Hawk T2. The first two Texans were delivered in February 2018 and by December 2018 ten aircraft had arrived at RAF Valley. Four additional Texans were delivered on 3 November 2020.

===Advanced fast jet training===

The BAE Hawk T2 is flown by No. IV Squadron and No. XXV (F) Squadron based at RAF Valley. The latter provides initial Advanced Fast Jet Training (AFJT), while pilots who graduate on to the former squadron learn tactical and weapons training. After advanced training aircrew go on to an Operational Conversion Unit (OCU) where they are trained to fly either the Typhoon FGR4 (No. 29 Squadron at RAF Coningsby) or F-35B Lightning (No. 207 Squadron at RAF Marham) in preparation for service with a front-line squadron. The OCUs use operational aircraft alongside simulators and ground training, although in the case of the Typhoon a two-seater training variant exists which is designated the Typhoon T3.

On 15 October 2020, it was announced a joint RAF-Qatari Air Force Hawk squadron (similar to No. 12 Squadron) would be formed in the future. On 1 April 2021, it was further elaborated that this squadron would be stood up in September 2021 at RAF Leeming, North Yorkshire. The Joint Hawk Training Squadron received its first two Hawk Mk.167s at RAF Leeming on 1 September 2021. On 24 November 2021, the Joint Hawk Training Squadron became 11 Squadron QEAF when it reformed at RAF Leeming.

===Multi-engine training===

Multi-Engine aircrew, weapon systems officer (WSO) and weapon systems operator (WSOp) students are trained on the Embraer Phenom T1. It is operated by No. 45 Squadron based at RAF Cranwell. Multi-engine aircrew then go to their Operational Conversion Unit or front-line squadron.

====Rotary====
No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) (formerly the Defence Helicopter Flying School) is based at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire and provides basic helicopter pilot training for all UK armed forces. It flies twenty-nine Airbus Juno HT1. No. 1 FTS comprises two main elements, 2 Maritime Air Wing (2 MAW) and No. 9 Regiment. 2 MAW includes No. 660 Squadron of the Army Air Corps (AAC) and 705 Naval Air Squadron and provide basic helicopter flying training. No. 9 Regiment comprises No. 60 Squadron of the RAF and No. 670 Squadron of the AAC in the advanced helicopter flying training. No. 202 Squadron is also part of No. 1 FTS and operates the Airbus Jupiter HT1 at RAF Valley.

===Future aircraft===
In July 2014, the House of Commons Defence Select Committee released a report on the RAF future force structure that envisaged a mixture of unmanned and manned platforms, including further F-35, Protector RG1, a service life extension for the Typhoon (which would otherwise end its service in 2030) or a possible new manned aircraft. In July 2018, at the Farnborough Airshow, the Defence Secretary announced a £2bn investment for BAE Systems, MBDA and Leonardo to develop a new British 6th Generation Fighter to replace Typhoon in 2035 under Project Tempest.

On 22 March 2019, the Defence Secretary announced the UK had signed a $1.98 billion deal to procure five Boeing E-7 Wedgetails to replace the ageing Boeing E-3D Sentry AEW1 fleet in the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) role. As of May 2020, the first E-7 is expected to enter RAF service in 2023 with the final aircraft arriving in late 2025 or early 2026. In December 2020, it was announced that the Wedgetail AEW1 will be based at RAF Lossiemouth. The 2021 Defence Command Paper cut the Wedgetail order down to three aircraft. The Sentry AEW1s were officially withdrawn on 28 September 2021.

In March 2021, the Defence and Security Industrial Strategy paper was published which announced the aim to procure a New Medium Helicopter (NMH) in order to replace the Puma HC2, Griffin HAR2 (in RAF service) and the AAC&#x27;s Bell 212 AH1 and Eurocopter Dauphin AH1. In May 2022, the MoD announced the beginning of the NMH competition, with the aim to acquire up to 44 helicopters. By November 2022, four companies qualified for the MoD&#x27;s requirements: Airbus (H175M); Boeing (MH-139 Grey Wolf); Leonardo (AW149); and Sikorsky / Lockheed Martin (S-70 Black Hawk). The Minister of State for Defence Procurement opened bidding for the competition, between Airbus Helicopters UK, Leonardo Helicopters UK and Lockheed Martin UK, in February 2024.

==Symbols, flags, emblems and uniform==

Following the tradition of the other British armed services, the RAF has adopted symbols to represent it, use as rallying devices for members and promote esprit de corps. British aircraft in the early stages of the First World War carried the Union Flag as an identifying feature; however, this was easily confused with Germany&#x27;s Iron Cross motif. In October 1914, therefore, the French system of three concentric rings was adopted, with the colours reversed to a red disc surrounded by a white ring and an outer blue ring. The relative sizes of the rings have changed over the years and during the Second World War an outer yellow ring was added to the fuselage roundel. Aircraft serving in the Far East during the Second World War had the red disc removed to prevent confusion with Japanese aircraft. Since the 1970s, camouflaged aircraft carry low-visibility roundels, either red and blue on dark camouflage, or washed-out pink and light blue on light colours. Most non-camouflaged training and transport aircraft retain the traditional red-white-blue roundel.

The RAF&#x27;s motto is and is usually translated from Latin as &quot;Through Adversity to the Stars&quot;, but the RAF&#x27;s official translation is &quot;Through Struggle to the Stars&quot;. The choice of motto is attributed to a junior officer named J S Yule, in response to a request for suggestions from a commander of the Royal Flying Corps, Colonel Sykes.

The badge of the Royal Air Force was first used in August 1918. In heraldic terms, it is: &quot;In front of a circle inscribed with the motto and ensigned by the Imperial Crown an eagle volant and affronté head lowered and to the sinister&quot;. Although there have been debates among airmen over the years about whether the bird was originally meant to be an albatross or an eagle, the consensus is that it was always an eagle.

==Ceremonial functions and display==
===Red Arrows===
The Red Arrows, officially known as the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, is the aerobatics display team of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Waddington. The team was formed in late 1964 as an all-RAF team, replacing a number of unofficial teams that had been sponsored by RAF commands. The Red Arrows badge shows the aircraft in their trademark &quot;Diamond Nine&quot; formation, with the motto , a French word meaning &quot;brilliance&quot; or &quot;excellence&quot;.

Initially, they were equipped with seven Folland Gnat trainers inherited from the RAF Yellowjacks display team. This aircraft was chosen because it was less expensive to operate than front-line fighters. In their first season, they flew at sixty-five shows across Europe. In 1966, the team was increased to nine members, enabling them to develop their &quot;Diamond Nine&quot; formation. In late 1979, they switched to the BAE Hawk trainer. The Red Arrows have performed over 4,700 displays in fifty-six countries worldwide.

===Royal Air Force Music===

Headquarters Royal Air Force Music Services, located at RAF Northolt, supports professional musicians who perform at events around the globe in support of the RAF. The Central Band of the Royal Air Force was established in 1920. Other bands include the Band of the Royal Air Force College, the Band of the Royal Air Force Regiment and the Band of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.

===Trooping the Colour===

The Royal Air Force, and its predecessor, the Royal Flying Corps, has provided the flypast for Trooping the Colour since 1913. The RFC performed its first flypast for King George V&#x27;s Official Birthday over Laffin&#x27;s Plain, Aldershot.

<text>The Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Red Army, often shortened to the Red Army, was the army and air force of the Russian Soviet Republic and, from 1922, the Soviet Union. The army was established in January 1918 by a decree of the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars to oppose the military forces of the new nation&#x27;s adversaries during the Russian Civil War, especially the various groups collectively known as the White Army. In February 1946, the Red Army (which embodied the main component of the Soviet Armed Forces alongside the Soviet Navy) was renamed the &quot;Soviet Army&quot;. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union it was split between the post-Soviet states, with its bulk becoming the Russian Army, commonly considered to be the successor of the Soviet Army.

The Red Army provided the largest land force in the Allied victory in the European theatre of World War II, and its invasion of Manchuria assisted the unconditional surrender of Imperial Japan. During its operations on the Eastern Front, it accounted for 75–80% of the casualties that the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; suffered during the war, and ultimately captured the German capital, Berlin.

Up to 34 million soldiers served in the Red Army during World War II, 8 million of which were non-Slavic minorities. Officially, the Red Army lost 6,329,600 killed in action (KIA), 555,400 deaths by disease and 4,559,000 missing in action (MIA) (mostly captured). The majority of the losses, excluding POWs, were ethnic Russians (5,756,000), followed by ethnic Ukrainians (1,377,400). Of the 4.5 million missing, 939,700 rejoined the ranks in liberated Soviet territory, and a further 1,836,000 returned from German captivity. The official grand total of losses amounted to 8,668,400. This is the official total dead, but other estimates give the number of total dead up to almost 11 million. Officials at the Russian Central Defense Ministry Archive (CDMA) maintain that their database lists the names of roughly 14 million dead and missing service personnel.
==Origins==
In September 1917, Vladimir Lenin wrote: &quot;There is only one way to prevent the restoration of the police, and that is to create a people&#x27;s militia and to fuse it with the army (the standing army to be replaced by the arming of the entire people).&quot; At the time, the Imperial Russian Army had started to collapse. Approximately 23% (about 19 million) of the male population of the Russian Empire were mobilized; however, most of them were not equipped with any weapons and had support roles such as maintaining the lines of communication and the base areas. The Tsarist general Nikolay Dukhonin estimated that there had been 2 million deserters, 1.8 million dead, 5 million wounded and 2 million prisoners. He estimated the remaining troops as numbering 10 million.

While the Imperial Russian Army was being taken apart, &quot;it became apparent that the rag-tag Red Guard units and elements of the imperial army who had gone over the side of the Bolsheviks were quite inadequate to the task of defending the new government against external foes.&quot; Therefore, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars decided to form the Red Army on 28 January 1918. They envisioned a body &quot;formed from the class-conscious and best elements of the working classes.&quot; All citizens of the Russian republic aged 18 or older were eligible. Its role being the defense &quot;of the Soviet authority, the creation of a basis for the transformation of the standing army into a force deriving its strength from a nation in arms, and, furthermore, the creation of a basis for the support of the coming Socialist Revolution in Europe.&quot; Enlistment was conditional upon &quot;guarantees being given by a military or civil committee functioning within the territory of the Soviet Power, or by party or trade union committees or, in extreme cases, by two persons belonging to one of the above organizations.&quot; In the event of an entire unit wanting to join the Red Army, a &quot;collective guarantee and the affirmative vote of all its members would be necessary.&quot; Because the Red Army was composed mainly of peasants, the families of those who served were guaranteed rations and assistance with farm work. Some peasants who remained at home yearned to join the Army; men, along with some women, flooded the recruitment centres. If they were turned away, they would collect scrap metal and prepare care-packages. In some cases, the money they earned would go towards tanks for the Army.

The Council of People&#x27;s Commissars appointed itself the supreme head of the Red Army, delegating command and administration of the army to the Commissariat for Military Affairs and the Special All-Russian College within this commissariat. Nikolai Krylenko was the supreme commander-in-chief, with Aleksandr Myasnikyan as deputy. Nikolai Podvoisky became the commissar for war, Pavel Dybenko, commissar for the fleet. Proshyan, Samoisky, Steinberg were also specified as people&#x27;s commissars as well as Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich from the Bureau of Commissars. At a joint meeting of Bolsheviks and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, held on 22 February 1918, Krylenko remarked: &quot;We have no army. The demoralized soldiers are fleeing, panic-stricken, as soon as they see a German helmet appear on the horizon, abandoning their artillery, convoys and all war material to the triumphantly advancing enemy. The Red Guard units are brushed aside like flies. We have no power to stay the enemy; only an immediate signing of the peace treaty will save us from destruction.&quot;

==History==

===Russian Civil War===

The Russian Civil War (1917–1923) can be divided into three periods:

# October 1917 – November 1918, from the October Revolution to the World War I armistice. The Bolshevik government&#x27;s nationalization of traditional Cossack lands in November 1917 provoked the insurrection of General Alexey Maximovich Kaledin&#x27;s Volunteer Army in the River Don region. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk of March 1918 aggravated Russian internal politics. The overall situation encouraged direct Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, in which twelve foreign countries supported anti-Bolshevik militias. A series of engagements resulted, involving, amongst others, the Czechoslovak Legion, the Polish 5th Rifle Division, and the pro-Bolshevik Red Latvian Riflemen.
# January 1919 – November 1919, the advance and retreat of the White armies. Initially the White armies advanced successfully: from the south, under General Anton Denikin; from the east, under Admiral Aleksandr Vasilevich Kolchak; and from the northwest, under General Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich. The Whites beat back the Red Army on each front. Leon Trotsky reformed and counterattacked – the Red Army repelled Admiral Kolchak&#x27;s army in June, and the armies of General Denikin and General Yudenich in October. By mid-November the White armies were all almost completely exhausted. In January 1920 Budenny&#x27;s First Cavalry Army entered Rostov-on-Don.
# 1919 to 1923, residual conflicts. Some peripheral theatres continued to see conflict for two more years, and remnants of the White forces remained in the Russian Far East into 1923.

At the start of the civil war, the Red Army consisted of 299 infantry regiments. The civil war intensified after Lenin dissolved the Russian Constituent Assembly (5–6 January 1918) and the Soviet government signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (3 March 1918), removing Russia from the First World War. Freed from international obligations, the Red Army confronted an internecine war against a variety of opposing anti-Bolshevik forces, including the Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, the anti-White and anti-Red Green armies, efforts to restore the defeated Provisional Government, monarchists, but mainly the White Movement of several different anti-socialist military confederations. &quot;Red Army Day&quot;, 23 February 1918, has a two-fold historical significance: it was the first day of conscription (in Petrograd and Moscow), and the first day of combat against the occupying Imperial German Army.

The Red Army controlled by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic also against independence movements, invading and annexing newly independent states of the former Russian Empire. This included three military campaigns against the army of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, in January–February 1918, January–February 1919, and May–October 1920. Conquered nations were subsequently incorporated into the Soviet Union.

In June 1918, Leon Trotsky abolished workers&#x27; control over the Red Army, replacing the election of officers with traditional army hierarchies and criminalizing dissent with the death penalty. Simultaneously, Trotsky carried out a mass recruitment of officers from the old Imperial Russian Army, who were employed as military advisors (&quot;voenspetsy&quot;). The Bolsheviks occasionally enforced the loyalty of such recruits by holding their families as hostages. As a result of this initiative, in 1918, 75% of the officers were former tsarists. By mid-August 1920 the Red Army&#x27;s former tsarist personnel included 48,000 officers, 10,300 administrators, and 214,000 non-commissioned officers. When the civil war ended in 1922, ex-tsarists constituted 83% of the Red Army&#x27;s divisional and corps commanders.

In September 1918, the Bolshevik militias consolidated under the supreme command of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic (). The first chairman was Trotsky, and the first commander-in-chief was Jukums Vācietis of the Latvian Riflemen; in July 1919 he was replaced by Sergey Kamenev. Soon afterwards Trotsky established the GRU (military intelligence) to provide political and military intelligence to Red Army commanders. Trotsky founded the Red Army with an initial Red Guard organization and a core soldiery of Red Guard militiamen and the Cheka secret police. Conscription began in June 1918, and opposition to it was violently suppressed. To control the multi-ethnic and multi-cultural Red Army soldiery, the Cheka operated special punitive brigades which suppressed anti-communists, deserters, and &quot;enemies of the state&quot;.

In 1919, 612 &quot;hardcore&quot; deserters of the total 837,000 draft dodgers and deserters were executed following Trotsky&#x27;s draconian measures. According to Figes, &quot;a majority of deserters (most registered as &quot;weak-willed&quot;) were handed back to the military authorities, and formed into units for transfer to one of the rear armies or directly to the front&quot;. Even those registered as &quot;malicious&quot; deserters were returned to the ranks when the demand for reinforcements became desperate&quot;. Forges also noted that the Red Army instituted amnesty weeks to prohibit punitive measures against desertion which encouraged the voluntary return of 98,000–132,000 deserters to the army.

The Red Army used special regiments for ethnic minorities, such as the Dungan Cavalry Regiment commanded by the Dungan Magaza Masanchi. It also co-operated with armed Bolshevik Party-oriented volunteer units, the Forces of Special Purpose from 1919 to 1925.

The slogan &quot;exhortation, organization, and reprisals&quot; expressed the discipline and motivation which helped ensure the Red Army&#x27;s tactical and strategic success. On campaign, the attached Cheka special punitive brigades conducted summary field court-martial and executions of deserters and slackers. Under Commissar Yan Karlovich Berzin, the brigades took hostages from the villages of deserters to compel their surrender; one in ten of those returning was executed. The same tactic also suppressed peasant rebellions in areas controlled by the Red Army, the biggest of these being the Tambov Rebellion. The Soviets enforced the loyalty of the various political, ethnic, and national groups in the Red Army through political commissars attached at the brigade and regimental levels. The commissars also had the task of spying on commanders for political incorrectness. In August 1918, Trotsky authorized General Mikhail Tukhachevsky to place blocking units behind politically unreliable Red Army units, to shoot anyone who retreated without permission. In 1942, during the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945) Joseph Stalin reintroduced the blocking policy and penal battalions with Order 227.

In the spring of 1919, Anna Novikova was enrolled in the school of infantry commanders in Moscow. After completing military training, she became the first woman to command a combat unit of the Red Army. In 1920, she fought on an armored train.

===Polish–Soviet War and prelude===

The Soviet westward offensive of 1918–1919 occurred at the same time as the general Soviet move into the areas abandoned by the Ober Ost garrisons that were being withdrawn to Germany in the aftermath of World War I. This merged into the 1919–1921 Polish–Soviet War, in which the Red Army invaded Poland, reaching the central part of the country in 1920, but then suffered a resounding defeat in Warsaw, which put an end to the war. During the Polish Campaign the Red Army numbered some 6.5 million men, many of whom the Army had difficulty supporting, around 581,000 in the two operational fronts, western and southwestern. Around 2.5 million men and women were mobilized in the interior as part of reserve armies.

===Reorganization===
The XI Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) (RCP (b)) adopted a resolution on the strengthening of the Red Army. It decided to establish strictly organized military, educational and economic conditions in the army. However, it was recognized that an army of 1,600,000 would be burdensome. By the end of 1922, after the Congress, the Party Central Committee decided to reduce the Red Army to 800,000. This reduction necessitated the reorganization of the Red Army&#x27;s structure. The supreme military unit became corps of two or three divisions. Divisions consisted of three regiments. Brigades as independent units were abolished. The formation of departments&#x27; rifle corps began.

===Doctrinal development in the 1920s and 1930s===

After four years of warfare, the Red Army&#x27;s defeat of Pyotr Wrangel in the south in 1920 allowed the foundation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in December 1922. Historian John Erickson sees 1 February 1924, when Mikhail Frunze became head of the Red Army staff, as marking the ascent of the general staff, which came to dominate Soviet military planning and operations. By 1 October 1924 the Red Army&#x27;s strength had diminished to 530,000. The list of Soviet divisions 1917–1945 details the formations of the Red Army in that time.

In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s, Soviet military theoreticians – led by Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky – developed the deep operation doctrine, a direct consequence of their experiences in the Polish–Soviet War and in the Russian Civil War. To achieve victory, deep operations envisage simultaneous corps- and army-size unit maneuvers of simultaneous parallel attacks throughout the depth of the enemy&#x27;s ground forces, inducing catastrophic defensive failure. The deep-battle doctrine relies upon aviation and armor advances with the expectation that maneuver warfare offers quick, efficient, and decisive victory. Marshal Tukhachevsky said that aerial warfare must be &quot;employed against targets beyond the range of infantry, artillery, and other arms. For maximum tactical effect aircraft should be employed , concentrated in time and space, against targets of the highest tactical importance.&quot;

Red Army deep operations found their first formal expression in the 1929 Field Regulations and became codified in the 1936 Provisional Field Regulations (PU-36). The Great Purge of 1937–1939 and the 1941 Red Army Purge removed many leading officers from the Red Army, including Tukhachevsky himself and many of his followers, and the doctrine was abandoned. Thus, at the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938 and in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1939 (major border conflicts with the Imperial Japanese Army), the doctrine was not used. Only in the Second World War did deep operations come into play.

===Chinese–Soviet conflicts===
The Red Army was involved in armed conflicts in the Republic of China during the Sino-Soviet conflict (1929), the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang (1934), when it was assisted by White Russian forces, and the Islamic rebellion in Xinjiang (1937) in Northwestern China. The Red Army achieved its objectives; it maintained effective control over the Manchurian Chinese Eastern Railway, and successfully installed a pro-Soviet regime in Xinjiang.

===Soviet–Japanese border conflicts===

The Soviet–Japanese border conflicts, also known as the &quot;Soviet–Japanese Border War&quot; or the first &quot;Soviet–Japanese War&quot;, was a series of minor and major conflicts fought between the Soviet Union and the Empire of Japan from 1932 to 1939. Japan&#x27;s expansion into Northeast China created a common border between Japanese controlled areas and the Soviet Far East and Mongolia. The Soviets and Japanese, including their respective client states of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic and Manchukuo, disputed the boundaries and accused the other side of border violations. This resulted in a series of escalating border skirmishes and punitive expeditions, including the 1938 Battle of Lake Khasan, and culminated in the Red Army finally achieving a Soviet-Mongolian victory over Japan and Manchukuo at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in September 1939. The Soviet Union and Japan agreed to a ceasefire. Later the two sides signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact on 13 April 1941, which resolved the dispute and returned the borders to &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;.

===Winter War with Finland===

The Winter War (, , ) was a war between the Soviet Union and Finland. It began with a Soviet offensive on 30 November 1939three months after the start of World War II and the Soviet invasion of Poland. The League of Nations deemed the attack illegal and expelled the Soviet Union on 14 December 1939.

The Soviet forces led by Semyon Timoshenko had three times as many soldiers as the Finns, thirty times as many aircraft, and a hundred times as many tanks. The Red Army, however, had been hindered by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of 1937, reducing the army&#x27;s morale and efficiency shortly before the outbreak of the fighting. With over 30,000 of its army officers executed or imprisoned, most of whom were from the highest ranks, the Red Army in 1939 had many inexperienced senior officers. Because of these factors, and high commitment and morale in the Finnish forces, Finland was able to resist the Soviet invasion for much longer than the Soviets expected. Finnish forces inflicted stunning losses on the Red Army for the first three months of the war while suffering very few losses themselves.

Hostilities ceased in March 1940 with the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty. Finland ceded 9% of its pre-war territory and 30% of its economic assets to the Soviet Union. Soviet losses on the front were heavy, and the country&#x27;s international reputation suffered. The Soviet forces did not accomplish their objective of the total conquest of Finland but did receive territory in Karelia, Petsamo, and Salla. The Finns retained their sovereignty and improved their international reputation, which bolstered their morale in the Continuation War (also known as the &quot;Second Soviet-Finnish War&quot;) which was a conflict fought by Finland and Germany against the Soviet Union from 1941 to 1944.

===Second World War (&quot;The Great Patriotic War&quot;)===


In accordance with the Soviet-Nazi Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 23 August 1939, the Red Army invaded Poland on 17 September 1939, after the Nazi invasion on 1 September 1939. On 30 November, the Red Army also attacked Finland, in the Winter War of 1939–1940. By autumn 1940, after conquering its portion of Poland, Nazi Germany shared an extensive border with the USSR, with whom it remained neutrally bound by their non-aggression pact and trade agreements. Another consequence of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, carried out by the Southern Front in June–July 1940 and Soviet occupation of the Baltic states. These conquests also added to the border the Soviet Union shared with Nazi-controlled areas. For Adolf Hitler, the circumstance was no dilemma, because the &quot;Drang nach Osten&quot; (&quot;Drive towards the East&quot;) policy secretly remained in force, culminating on 18 December 1940 with &quot;Directive No. 21, Operation Barbarossa&quot;, approved on 3 February 1941, and scheduled for mid-May 1941.
When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, in Operation Barbarossa, the Red Army&#x27;s ground forces had 303 divisions and 22 separate brigades (5.5 million soldiers) including 166 divisions and brigades (2.6 million) garrisoned in the western military districts. The Axis forces deployed on the Eastern Front consisted of 181 divisions and 18 brigades (3 million soldiers). Three Fronts, the Northwestern, Western, and Southwestern conducted the defense of the western borders of the USSR. In the first weeks of the Great Patriotic War (as it is known in Russia), the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; defeated many Red Army units. The Red Army lost millions of men as prisoners and lost much of its pre-war matériel. Stalin increased mobilization, and by 1 August 1941, despite 46 divisions lost in combat, the Red Army&#x27;s strength was 401 divisions.

The Soviet forces were apparently unprepared despite numerous warnings from a variety of sources. They suffered much damage in the field because of mediocre officers, partial mobilization, and an incomplete reorganization. The hasty pre-war forces expansion and the over-promotion of inexperienced officers (owing to the purging of experienced officers) favored the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in combat. The Axis&#x27;s numeric superiority rendered the combatants&#x27; divisional strength approximately equal. A generation of Soviet commanders (notably Georgy Zhukov) learned from the defeats, and Soviet victories in the Battle of Moscow, at Stalingrad, Kursk and later in Operation Bagration proved decisive.

In 1941, the Soviet government raised the bloodied Red Army&#x27;s &quot;esprit de corps&quot; with propaganda stressing the defense of Motherland and nation, employing historic exemplars of Russian courage and bravery against foreign aggressors. The anti-Nazi Great Patriotic War was conflated with the Patriotic War of 1812 against Napoleon, and historical Russian military heroes, such as Alexander Nevsky and Mikhail Kutuzov, appeared. Repression of the Russian Orthodox Church temporarily ceased, and priests revived the tradition of blessing arms before battle.

To encourage the initiative of Red Army commanders, the CPSU temporarily abolished political commissars, reintroduced formal military ranks and decorations, and introduced the Guards unit concept. Exceptionally heroic or high-performing units earned the Guards title (for example 1st Guards Special Rifle Corps, 6th Guards Tank Army), an elite designation denoting superior training, materiel, and pay. Punishment also was used; slackers, malingerers, those avoiding combat with self-inflicted wounds cowards, thieves, and deserters were disciplined with beatings, demotions, undesirable/dangerous duties, and summary execution by NKVD punitive detachments.

At the same time, the &quot;osobist&quot; (NKVD military counter-intelligence officers) became a key Red Army figure with the power to condemn to death and to spare the life of any soldier and (almost any) officer of the unit to which he was attached. In 1942, Stalin established the penal battalions composed of &quot;gulag&quot; inmates, Soviet PoWs, disgraced soldiers, and deserters, for hazardous front-line duty as &quot;tramplers&quot; clearing Nazi minefields, et cetera. Given the dangers, the maximum sentence was three months. Likewise, the Soviet treatment of Red Army personnel captured by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; was especially harsh. Per a 1941 Stalin directive, Red Army officers and soldiers were to &quot;fight to the last&quot; rather than surrender; Stalin stated: &quot;There are no Soviet prisoners of war, only traitors&quot;. During and after World War II freed POWs went to special &quot;filtration camps&quot;. Of these, by 1944, more than 90% were cleared, and about 8% were arrested or condemned to serve in penal battalions. In 1944, they were sent directly to reserve military formations to be cleared by the NKVD. Further, in 1945, about 100 filtration camps were set for repatriated POWs, and other displaced persons, which processed more than 4,000,000 people. By 1946, 80% civilians and 20% of POWs were freed, 5% of civilians, and 43% of POWs were re-drafted, 10% of civilians and 22% of POWs were sent to labor battalions, and 2% of civilians and 15% of the POWs (226,127 out of 1,539,475 total) were transferred to the Gulag.


During the Great Patriotic War, the Red Army conscripted 29,574,900 men in addition to the 4,826,907 in service at the beginning of the war. Of this total of 34,401,807 it lost 6,329,600 killed in action (KIA), 555,400 deaths by disease and 4,559,000 missing in action (MIA) (most captured). Of the 4.5 million missing, 939,700 rejoined the ranks in the subsequently liberated Soviet territory, and a further 1,836,000 returned from German captivity. Thus the grand total of losses amounted to 8,668,400. This is the official total dead, but other estimates give the number of total dead up to almost 11 million men, including 7.7 million killed or missing in action and 2.6 million prisoners of war (POW) dead (out of 5.2 million total POWs), plus 400,000 paramilitary and Soviet partisan losses. Officials at the Russian Central Defense Ministry Archive (CDMA) maintain that their database lists the names of roughly 14 million dead and missing service personnel. The majority of the losses, excluding POWs, were ethnic Russians (5,756,000), followed by ethnic Ukrainians (1,377,400). As many as 8 million of the 34 million mobilized were non-Slavic minority soldiers, and around 45 divisions formed from national minorities served from 1941 to 1943.

The German losses on the Eastern Front consisted of an estimated 3,604,800 KIA/MIA within the 1937 borders plus 900,000 ethnic Germans and Austrians outside the 1937 border (included in these numbers are men listed as missing in action or unaccounted for after the war) and 3,576,300 men reported captured (total 8,081,100); the losses of the German satellites on the Eastern Front approximated 668,163 KIA/MIA and 799,982 captured (total 1,468,145). Of these 9,549,245, the Soviets released 3,572,600 from captivity after the war, thus the grand total of the Axis losses came to an estimated 5,976,645. Regarding POWs, both sides captured large numbers and had many die in captivity – one recent British figure says 3.6 of 6 million Soviet POWs died in German camps, while 300,000 of 3 million German POWs died in Soviet hands.

====Shortcomings====
In 1941, the rapid progress of the initial German air and land attacks into the Soviet Union made Red Army logistical support difficult because many depots (and most of the USSR&#x27;s industrial manufacturing base) lay in the country&#x27;s invaded western areas, obliging their re-establishment east of the Ural Mountains. Lend-Lease trucks and jeeps from the United States began appearing in large numbers in 1942. Until then, the Red Army was often required to improvise or go without weapons, vehicles, and other equipment. The 1941 decision to physically move their manufacturing capacity east of the Ural Mountains kept the main Soviet support system out of German reach. In the later stages of the war, the Red Army fielded some excellent weaponry, especially artillery and tanks. The Red Army&#x27;s heavy KV-1 and medium T-34 tanks outclassed most &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; armor, but in 1941 most Soviet tank units used older and inferior models.

====Lend-Lease====

The Red Army was financially and materially assisted in its wartime effort by the United States. In total, the U.S. deliveries to the USSR through Lend-Lease amounted to $11 billion in materials ($180 billion in the 2020 money value): over 400,000 jeeps and trucks; 12,000 armored vehicles (including 7,000 tanks, about 1,386 of which were M3 Lees and 4,102 M4 Shermans); 14,015 aircraft (of which 4,719 were Bell P-39 Airacobras, 2,908 were Douglas A-20 Havocs and 2,400 were Bell P-63 Kingcobras) and 1.75 million tons of food.

====Wartime rape====
Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially in Germany. The wartime rapes were followed by decades of silence. According to historian Antony Beevor, whose books were banned in 2015 from some Russian schools and colleges, NKVD (Soviet secret police) files have revealed that the leadership knew what was happening, but did little to stop it. It was often units who committed the rapes. According to professor Oleg Rzheshevsky, &quot;4,148 Red Army officers and many privates were punished for committing atrocities&quot;. The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million.

===Soviet–Japanese War (1945)===
While the Soviets considered the surrender of Germany to be the end of the &quot;Great Patriotic War&quot;, at the earlier Yalta Conference the Soviet Union agreed to enter the Pacific Theater portion of World War II within three months of the end of the war in Europe. This promise was reaffirmed at the Potsdam Conference held in July 1945.

The Red Army began the Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 9 August 1945 (three days after the first atomic bombing of Hiroshima and the same day the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, while also being exact three months after the surrender of Germany). It was the largest campaign of the Soviet–Japanese War, which resumed hostilities between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Empire of Japan after almost six years of peace following the 1932–1939 Soviet–Japanese border conflicts. The Red Army, with support from Mongolian forces, overwhelmed the Japanese Kwantung Army and local Chinese forces supporting them. The Soviets advanced on the continent into the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo, Mengjiang (the northeast section of present-day Inner Mongolia which was part of another puppet state) and via an amphibious operation the northern portion of Korea. Other Red Army operations included the Soviet invasion of South Sakhalin, which was the Japanese portion of Sakhalin Island (and Russia had lost to Japan in 1905 in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War), and the invasion of the Kuril Islands. Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan on 15 August. The commanding general of the Kwantung Army ordered a surrender the following day although some Japanese units continued to fight for several more days. A proposed Soviet invasion of Hokkaido, the second largest Japanese island, was originally planned to be part of the territory to be taken but it was cancelled.

==Administration==
Military administration after the October Revolution was taken over by the People&#x27;s Commissariat of War and Marine affairs headed by a collective committee of Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko, Pavel Dybenko, and Nikolai Krylenko. At the same time, Nikolay Dukhonin was acting as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief after Alexander Kerensky fled from Russia. On 12 November 1917 the Soviet government appointed Krylenko as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and because of an &quot;accident&quot; during the forceful displacement of the commander-in-chief, Dukhonin was killed on 20 November 1917. Nikolai Podvoisky was appointed as the Narkom of War Affairs, leaving Dybenko in charge of the Narkom of Marine Affairs and Ovseyenko – the expeditionary forces to the Southern Russia on 28 November 1917. The Bolsheviks also sent out their own representatives to replace front commanders of the Russian Imperial Army.

After the signing of Treaty of Brest-Litovsk on 3 March 1918, a major reshuffling took place in the Soviet military administration. On 13 March 1918, the Soviet government accepted the official resignation of Krylenko and the post of Supreme Commander-in-Chief was liquidated. On 14 March 1918, Leon Trotsky replaced Podvoisky as the Narkom of War Affairs. On 16 March 1918, Pavel Dybenko was relieved from the office of Narkom of Marine Affairs. On 8 May 1918, the All-Russian Chief Headquarters was created, headed by Nikolai Stogov and later Alexander Svechin.

On 2 September 1918, the Revolutionary Military Council (RMC) was established as the main military administration under Leon Trotsky, the Narkom of War Affairs. On 6 September 1918 alongside the chief headquarters, the Field Headquarters of RMC was created, initially headed by Nikolai Rattel. On the same day the office of the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces was created, and initially assigned to Jukums Vācietis (and from July 1919 to Sergey Kamenev). The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces existed until April 1924, the end of Russian Civil War.

In November 1923, after the establishment of the Soviet Union, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars on War and Navy Affairs was transformed into the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Military and Naval Affairs.

==Organization==


At the beginning of its existence, the Red Army functioned as a voluntary formation, without ranks or insignia. Democratic elections selected the officers. However, a decree on 29 May 1918 imposed obligatory military service for men of ages 18 to 40. To service the massive draft, the Bolsheviks formed regional military commissariats (&quot;voyennyy komissariat&quot;, abbr. &quot;voyenkomat&quot;), which as of 2023 still exist in Russia in this function and under this name. Military commissariats, however, should not be confused with the institution of military political commissars.

In the mid-1920s, the territorial principle of manning the Red Army was introduced. In each region, able-bodied men were called up for a limited period of active duty in territorial units, which constituted about half the army&#x27;s strength, each year, for five years. The first call-up period was for three months, with one month a year thereafter. A regular cadre provided a stable nucleus. By 1925, this system provided 46 of the 77 infantry divisions and one of the eleven cavalry divisions. The remainder consisted of regular officers and enlisted personnel serving two-year terms. The territorial system was finally abolished, with all remaining formations converted to the other cadre divisions, in 1937–1938.

===Mechanization===
The Soviet military received ample funding and was innovative in its technology. An American journalist wrote in 1941:

Under Stalin&#x27;s campaign for mechanization, the army formed its first mechanized unit in 1930. The 1st Mechanized Brigade consisted of a tank regiment, a motorized infantry regiment, as well as reconnaissance and artillery battalions. From this humble beginning, the Soviets would go on to create the first operational-level armored formations in history, the 11th and 45th Mechanized Corps, in 1932. These were tank-heavy formations with combat support forces included so they could survive while operating in enemy rear areas without support from a parent front.

Impressed by the German campaign of 1940 against France, the Soviet People&#x27;s Commissariat of Defence (Defence Ministry, Russian abbreviation NKO) ordered the creation of nine mechanized corps on 6 July 1940. Between February and March 1941, the NKO ordered another twenty to be created. All of these formations were larger than those theorized by Tukhachevsky. Even though the Red Army&#x27;s 29 mechanized corps had an authorized strength of no less than 29,899 tanks by 1941, they proved to be a paper tiger. There were actually only 17,000 tanks available at the time, meaning several of the new mechanized corps were badly under strength. The pressure placed on factories and military planners to show production numbers also led to a situation where the majority of armored vehicles were obsolescent models, critically lacking in spare parts and support equipment, and nearly three-quarters were overdue for major maintenance. By 22 June 1941, there were only 1,475 of the modern T-34s and KV series tanks available to the Red Army, and these were too dispersed along the front to provide enough mass for even local success. To illustrate this, the 3rd Mechanized Corps in Lithuania was formed up of a total of 460 tanks; 109 of these were newer KV-1s and T-34s. This corps would prove to be one of the lucky few with a substantial number of newer tanks. However, the 4th Army was composed of 518 tanks, all of which were the obsolete T-26, as opposed to the authorized strength of 1,031 newer medium tanks. This problem was universal throughout the Red Army and would play a crucial role in the initial defeats of the Red Army in 1941 at the hands of the German armed forces.

===Wartime===
War experience prompted changes to the way frontline forces were organized. Following six months of combat against the Germans, the Stavka abolished the rifle corps which was intermediate between the army and division level because, while useful in theory, in the state of the Red Army in 1941, they proved ineffective in practice. Following the decisive victory in the Battle of Moscow in January 1942, the high command began to reintroduce rifle corps into its more experienced formations. The total number of rifle corps started at 62 on 22 June 1941, dropped to six by 1 January 1942, but then increased to 34 by February 1943, and 161 by New Year&#x27;s Day 1944. Actual strengths of front-line rifle divisions, authorized to contain 11,000 men in July 1941, were mostly no more than 50% of establishment strengths during 1941, and divisions were often worn down, because of continuous operations, to hundreds of men or even less.

On the outbreak of war, the Red Army deployed mechanized corps and tank divisions whose development has been described above. The initial German attack destroyed many and, in the course of 1941, virtually all of them, (barring two in the Transbaikal Military District). The remnants were disbanded. It was much easier to coordinate smaller forces, and separate tank brigades and battalions were substituted. It was late 1942 and early 1943 before larger tank formations of corps size were fielded to employ armor in mass again. By mid-1943, these corps were being grouped together into tank armies whose strength by the end of the war could be up to 700 tanks and 50,000 men.

==Personnel==

The Bolshevik authorities assigned to every unit of the Red Army a political commissar, or &quot;politruk&quot;, who had the authority to override unit commanders&#x27; decisions if they ran counter to the principles of the Communist Party. The Party leadership considered political control over the military absolutely necessary, as the army relied more and more on officers from the pre-revolutionary Imperial period and understandably feared a military coup. This system was abolished in 1925, as there were by that time enough trained Communist officers to render the counter-signing unnecessary.

===Ranks and titles===
The early Red Army abandoned the institution of a professional officer corps as a &quot;heritage of tsarism&quot; in the course of the Revolution. In particular, the Bolsheviks condemned the use of the word &quot;officer&quot; and used the word &quot;commander&quot; instead. The Red Army abandoned epaulettes and ranks, using purely functional titles such as &quot;Division Commander&quot;, &quot;Corps Commander&quot; and similar titles. Insignia for these functional titles existed, consisting of triangles, squares and rhombuses (so-called &quot;diamonds&quot;).

In 1924 (2 October) &quot;personal&quot; or &quot;service&quot; categories were introduced, from K1 (section leader, assistant squad leader, senior rifleman, etc.) to K14 (field commander, army commander, military district commander, army commissar and equivalent). Service category insignia again consisted of triangles, squares and rhombuses, but also rectangles (1 – 3, for categories from K7 to K9).

On 22 September 1935 the Red Army abandoned service categories and introduced personal ranks. These ranks, however, used a unique mix of functional titles and traditional ranks. For example, the ranks included &quot;Lieutenant&quot; and &quot;Comdiv&quot; (Комдив, Division Commander). Further complications ensued from the functional and categorical ranks for political officers (e.g., &quot;brigade commissar&quot;, &quot;army commissar 2nd rank&quot;), for technical corps (e.g., &quot;engineer 3rd rank&quot;, &quot;division engineer&quot;), and for administrative, medical and other non-combatant branches.

The Marshal of the Soviet Union (Маршал Советского Союза) rank was introduced on 22 September 1935. On 7 May 1940 further modifications to rationalise the system of ranks were made on the proposal by Marshal Voroshilov: the ranks of &quot;General&quot; and &quot;Admiral&quot; replaced the senior functional ranks of Combrig, Comdiv, Comcor, Comandarm in the Red Army and Flagman 1st rank etc. in the Red Navy; the other senior functional ranks (&quot;division commissar&quot;, &quot;division engineer&quot;, etc.) remained unaffected. The arm or service distinctions remained (e.g., general of the cavalry, marshal of armoured troops). For the most part the new system restored that used by the Imperial Russian Army at the conclusion of its participation in World War I.

In early 1943 a unification of the system saw the abolition of all the remaining functional ranks. The word &quot;officer&quot; became officially endorsed, together with the use of epaulettes, which superseded the previous rank insignia. The ranks and insignia of 1943 did not change much until the last days of the USSR; the contemporary Russian Army uses largely the same system.

===Military education===

During the Civil War the commander cadres were trained at the Nicholas General Staff Academy of the Russian Empire, which became the Frunze Military Academy in the 1920s. Senior and supreme commanders were trained at the Higher Military Academic Courses, renamed the Advanced Courses for Supreme Command in 1925. The 1931 establishment of an Operations Faculty at the Frunze Military Academy supplemented these courses. The General staff Academy was reinstated on 2 April 1936, and became the principal military school for the senior and supreme commanders of the Red Army.

===Purges===
According to the new data that emerged on the break of the 21st century, The Vesna Case (also known as &quot;Operation Vesna&quot;) of 1930–1931 was massive Soviet repressions targeting former officers and generals of the Russian Imperial Army who had served in the Red Army and Soviet Navy, a major purge of the Red Army preceding the Great Purge. According to over 3,000 group cases in Moscow, Leningrad and Ukraine, over 10,000 persons were convicted. In particular, in May 1931, in Leningrad alone over 1,000 persons were executed according to the so-called &quot;Guards Case&quot; ().

The late 1930s saw purges of the Red Army leadership which occurred concurrently with Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge of Soviet society. In 1936 and 1937, at the orders of Stalin, thousands of Red Army senior officers were dismissed from their commands. The purges had the objective of cleansing the Red Army of the &quot;politically unreliable elements,&quot; mainly among higher-ranking officers. This inevitably provided a convenient pretext for the settling of personal vendettas or to eliminate competition by officers seeking the same command. Many army, corps, and divisional commanders were sacked: most were imprisoned or sent to labor camps; others were executed. Among the victims was the Red Army&#x27;s primary military theorist, Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, who was perceived by Stalin as a potential political rival. Officers who remained soon found all of their decisions being closely examined by political officers, even in mundane matters such as record-keeping and field training exercises. An atmosphere of fear and unwillingness to take the initiative soon pervaded the Red Army; suicide rates among junior officers rose to record levels. The purges significantly impaired the combat capabilities of the Red Army. Hoyt concludes &quot;the Soviet defense system was damaged to the point of incompetence&quot; and stresses &quot;the fear in which high officers lived.&quot; Clark says, &quot;Stalin not only cut the heart out of the army, he also gave it brain damage.&quot; Lewin identifies three serious results: the loss of experienced and well-trained senior officers; the distrust it caused among potential allies especially France; and the encouragement it gave Germany.

Recently declassified data indicated that in 1937, at the height of the Purges, the Red Army had 114,300 officers, of whom 11,034 were dismissed. In 1938, the Red Army had 179,000 officers, 56% more than in 1937, of whom a further 6,742 were dismissed. In the highest echelons of the Red Army the Purges removed 3 of 5 marshals, 13 of 15 army generals, 8 of 9 admirals, 50 of 57 army corps generals, 154 out of 186 division generals, all 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.

The result was that the Red Army officer corps in 1941 had many inexperienced senior officers. While 60% of regimental commanders had two years or more of command experience in June 1941, and almost 80% of rifle division commanders, only 20% of corps commanders, and 5% or fewer army and military district commanders, had the same level of experience.

The significant growth of the Red Army during the high point of the purges may have worsened matters. In 1937, the Red Army numbered around 1.3 million, increasing to almost three times that number by June 1941. The rapid growth of the army necessitated in turn the rapid promotion of officers regardless of experience or training. Junior officers were appointed to fill the ranks of the senior leadership, many of whom lacked broad experience. This action in turn resulted in many openings at the lower level of the officer corps, which were filled by new graduates from the service academies. In 1937, the entire junior class of one academy was graduated a year early to fill vacancies in the Red Army. Hamstrung by inexperience and fear of reprisals, many of these new officers failed to impress the large numbers of incoming draftees to the ranks; complaints of insubordination rose to the top of offenses punished in 1941, and may have exacerbated instances of Red Army soldiers deserting their units during the initial phases of the German offensive of that year.

By 1940, Stalin began to relent, restoring approximately one-third of previously dismissed officers to duty. However, the effect of the purges would soon manifest itself in the Winter War of 1940, where Red Army forces generally performed poorly against the much smaller Finnish Army, and later during the German invasion of 1941, in which the Germans were able to rout the Soviet defenders partially due to inexperience amongst the Soviet officers.

===Weapons and equipment===
The Soviet Union expanded its indigenous arms industry as part of Stalin&#x27;s industrialisation program in the 1920s and 1930s.

<text>A random variable (also called random quantity, aleatory variable, or stochastic variable) is a mathematical formalization of a quantity or object which depends on random events. The term &#x27;random variable&#x27; in its mathematical definition refers to neither randomness nor variability but instead is a mathematical function in which 

* the domain is the set of possible outcomes in a sample space (e.g. the set formula_1 which are the possible upper sides of a flipped coin heads formula_2 or tails formula_3 as the result from tossing a coin); and
* the range is a measurable space (e.g. corresponding to the domain above, the range might be the set formula_4 if say heads formula_2 mapped to -1 and formula_3 mapped to 1). Typically, the range of a random variable is a subset of the real numbers.

Informally, randomness typically represents some fundamental element of chance, such as in the roll of a die; it may also represent uncertainty, such as measurement error. However, the interpretation of probability is philosophically complicated, and even in specific cases is not always straightforward. The purely mathematical analysis of random variables is independent of such interpretational difficulties, and can be based upon a rigorous axiomatic setup.

In the formal mathematical language of measure theory, a random variable is defined as a measurable function from a probability measure space (called the &quot;sample space&quot;) to a measurable space. This allows consideration of the pushforward measure, which is called the &quot;distribution&quot; of the random variable; the distribution is thus a probability measure on the set of all possible values of the random variable. It is possible for two random variables to have identical distributions but to differ in significant ways; for instance, they may be independent.

It is common to consider the special cases of discrete random variables and absolutely continuous random variables, corresponding to whether a random variable is valued in a countable subset or in an interval of real numbers. There are other important possibilities, especially in the theory of stochastic processes, wherein it is natural to consider random sequences or random functions. Sometimes a &quot;random variable&quot; is taken to be automatically valued in the real numbers, with more general random quantities instead being called &quot;random elements&quot;.

According to George Mackey, Pafnuty Chebyshev was the first person &quot;to think systematically in terms of random variables&quot;.

==Definition==

A random variable formula_7 is a measurable function formula_8 from a sample space formula_9 as a set of possible outcomes to a measurable space formula_10. The technical axiomatic definition requires the sample space formula_11 to belong to a probability triple formula_12 (see the measure-theoretic definition). A random variable is often denoted by capital Roman letters such as formula_13.

The probability that formula_7 takes on a value in a measurable set formula_15 is written as

: formula_16.

===Standard case===

In many cases, formula_7 is real-valued, i.e. formula_18. In some contexts, the term random element (see extensions) is used to denote a random variable not of this form.

When the image (or range) of formula_7 is finitely or infinitely countable, the random variable is called a discrete random variable and its distribution is a discrete probability distribution, i.e. can be described by a probability mass function that assigns a probability to each value in the image of formula_7. If the image is uncountably infinite (usually an interval) then formula_7 is called a continuous random variable. In the special case that it is absolutely continuous, its distribution can be described by a probability density function, which assigns probabilities to intervals; in particular, each individual point must necessarily have probability zero for an absolutely continuous random variable. Not all continuous random variables are absolutely continuous.

Any random variable can be described by its cumulative distribution function, which describes the probability that the random variable will be less than or equal to a certain value.

===Extensions===

The term &quot;random variable&quot; in statistics is traditionally limited to the real-valued case (formula_22). In this case, the structure of the real numbers makes it possible to define quantities such as the expected value and variance of a random variable, its cumulative distribution function, and the moments of its distribution.

However, the definition above is valid for any measurable space formula_23 of values. Thus one can consider random elements of other sets formula_23, such as random Boolean values, categorical values, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, sequences, trees, sets, shapes, manifolds, and functions. One may then specifically refer to a &quot;random variable of type formula_23&quot;, or an &quot;formula_23-valued random variable&quot;.

This more general concept of a random element is particularly useful in disciplines such as graph theory, machine learning, natural language processing, and other fields in discrete mathematics and computer science, where one is often interested in modeling the random variation of non-numerical data structures. In some cases, it is nonetheless convenient to represent each element of formula_23, using one or more real numbers. In this case, a random element may optionally be represented as a vector of real-valued random variables (all defined on the same underlying probability space formula_11, which allows the different random variables to covary). For example:
*A random word may be represented as a random integer that serves as an index into the vocabulary of possible words. Alternatively, it can be represented as a random indicator vector, whose length equals the size of the vocabulary, where the only values of positive probability are formula_29, formula_30, formula_31 and the position of the 1 indicates the word.
*A random sentence of given length formula_32 may be represented as a vector of formula_32 random words.
*A random graph on formula_32 given vertices may be represented as a formula_35 matrix of random variables, whose values specify the adjacency matrix of the random graph.
*A random function formula_36 may be represented as a collection of random variables formula_37, giving the function&#x27;s values at the various points formula_38 in the function&#x27;s domain. The formula_37 are ordinary real-valued random variables provided that the function is real-valued. For example, a stochastic process is a random function of time, a random vector is a random function of some index set such as formula_40, and random field is a random function on any set (typically time, space, or a discrete set).

==Distribution functions==

If a random variable formula_41 defined on the probability space formula_12 is given, we can ask questions like &quot;How likely is it that the value of formula_7 is equal to 2?&quot;. This is the same as the probability of the event formula_44 which is often written as formula_45 or formula_46 for short.

Recording all these probabilities of outputs of a random variable formula_7 yields the probability distribution of formula_7. The probability distribution &quot;forgets&quot; about the particular probability space used to define formula_7 and only records the probabilities of various output values of formula_7. Such a probability distribution, if formula_7 is real-valued, can always be captured by its cumulative distribution function

:formula_52

and sometimes also using a probability density function, formula_53. In measure-theoretic terms, we use the random variable formula_7 to &quot;push-forward&quot; the measure formula_55 on formula_11 to a measure formula_57 on formula_58. The measure formula_57 is called the &quot;(probability) distribution of formula_7&quot; or the &quot;law of formula_7&quot;.
 The density formula_62, the Radon–Nikodym derivative of formula_57 with respect to some reference measure formula_64 on formula_58 (often, this reference measure is the Lebesgue measure in the case of continuous random variables, or the counting measure in the case of discrete random variables).
The underlying probability space formula_11 is a technical device used to guarantee the existence of random variables, sometimes to construct them, and to define notions such as correlation and dependence or independence based on a joint distribution of two or more random variables on the same probability space. In practice, one often disposes of the space formula_11 altogether and just puts a measure on formula_58 that assigns measure 1 to the whole real line, i.e., one works with probability distributions instead of random variables. See the article on quantile functions for fuller development.

==Examples==

===Discrete random variable===

Consider an experiment where a person is chosen at random. An example of a random variable may be the person&#x27;s height. Mathematically, the random variable is interpreted as a function which maps the person to their height. Associated with the random variable is a probability distribution that allows the computation of the probability that the height is in any subset of possible values, such as the probability that the height is between 180 and 190 cm, or the probability that the height is either less than 150 or more than 200 cm.

Another random variable may be the person&#x27;s number of children; this is a discrete random variable with non-negative integer values. It allows the computation of probabilities for individual integer values – the probability mass function (PMF) – or for sets of values, including infinite sets. For example, the event of interest may be &quot;an even number of children&quot;. For both finite and infinite event sets, their probabilities can be found by adding up the PMFs of the elements; that is, the probability of an even number of children is the infinite sum formula_69.

In examples such as these, the sample space is often suppressed, since it is mathematically hard to describe, and the possible values of the random variables are then treated as a sample space. But when two random variables are measured on the same sample space of outcomes, such as the height and number of children being computed on the same random persons, it is easier to track their relationship if it is acknowledged that both height and number of children come from the same random person, for example so that questions of whether such random variables are correlated or not can be posed.

If formula_70 are countable sets of real numbers, formula_71 and formula_72, then formula_73 is a discrete distribution function. Here formula_74 for formula_75, formula_76 for formula_77. Taking for instance an enumeration of all rational numbers as formula_78 , one gets a discrete function that is not necessarily a step function (piecewise constant).
====Coin toss====

The possible outcomes for one coin toss can be described by the sample space formula_79. We can introduce a real-valued random variable formula_80 that models a $1 payoff for a successful bet on heads as follows:
formula_81

If the coin is a fair coin, &quot;Y&quot; has a probability mass function formula_82 given by:
formula_83

====Dice roll====

A random variable can also be used to describe the process of rolling dice and the possible outcomes. The most obvious representation for the two-dice case is to take the set of pairs of numbers &quot;n&quot;1 and &quot;n&quot;2 from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (representing the numbers on the two dice) as the sample space. The total number rolled (the sum of the numbers in each pair) is then a random variable &quot;X&quot; given by the function that maps the pair to the sum:
formula_84
and (if the dice are fair) has a probability mass function &quot;f&quot;&quot;X&quot; given by:
formula_85

===Continuous random variable===

Formally, a continuous random variable is a random variable whose cumulative distribution function is continuous everywhere. There are no &quot;gaps&quot;, which would correspond to numbers which have a finite probability of occurring. Instead, continuous random variables almost never take an exact prescribed value &quot;c&quot; (formally, formula_86) but there is a positive probability that its value will lie in particular intervals which can be arbitrarily small. Continuous random variables usually admit probability density functions (PDF), which characterize their CDF and probability measures; 
such distributions are also called absolutely continuous; but some continuous distributions are singular, or mixes of an absolutely continuous part and a singular part.

An example of a continuous random variable would be one based on a spinner that can choose a horizontal direction. Then the values taken by the random variable are directions. We could represent these directions by North, West, East, South, Southeast, etc. However, it is commonly more convenient to map the sample space to a random variable which takes values which are real numbers. This can be done, for example, by mapping a direction to a bearing in degrees clockwise from North. The random variable then takes values which are real numbers from the interval [0, 360), with all parts of the range being &quot;equally likely&quot;. In this case, X = the angle spun. Any real number has probability zero of being selected, but a positive probability can be assigned to any &quot;range&quot; of values. For example, the probability of choosing a number in [0, 180] is . Instead of speaking of a probability mass function, we say that the probability &quot;density&quot; of X is 1/360. The probability of a subset of [0, 360) can be calculated by multiplying the measure of the set by 1/360. In general, the probability of a set for a given continuous random variable can be calculated by integrating the density over the given set.

More formally, given any interval formula_87, a random variable formula_88 is called a &quot;continuous uniform random variable&quot; (CURV) if the probability that it takes a value in a subinterval depends only on the length of the subinterval. This implies that the probability of formula_89 falling in any subinterval formula_90 is proportional to the length of the subinterval, that is, if , one has

formula_91

where the last equality results from the unitarity axiom of probability. The probability density function of a CURV formula_92 is given by the indicator function of its interval of support normalized by the interval&#x27;s length: formula_93Of particular interest is the uniform distribution on the unit interval formula_94. Samples of any desired probability distribution formula_95 can be generated by calculating the quantile function of formula_95 on a randomly-generated number distributed uniformly on the unit interval. This exploits properties of cumulative distribution functions, which are a unifying framework for all random variables.

===Mixed type===

A mixed random variable is a random variable whose cumulative distribution function is neither discrete nor everywhere-continuous. It can be realized as a mixture of a discrete random variable and a continuous random variable; in which case the will be the weighted average of the CDFs of the component variables.

An example of a random variable of mixed type would be based on an experiment where a coin is flipped and the spinner is spun only if the result of the coin toss is heads. If the result is tails, X = −1; otherwise X = the value of the spinner as in the preceding example. There is a probability of that this random variable will have the value −1. Other ranges of values would have half the probabilities of the last example.

Most generally, every probability distribution on the real line is a mixture of discrete part, singular part, and an absolutely continuous part; see . The discrete part is concentrated on a countable set, but this set may be dense (like the set of all rational numbers).

==Measure-theoretic definition==

The most formal, axiomatic definition of a random variable involves measure theory. Continuous random variables are defined in terms of sets of numbers, along with functions that map such sets to probabilities. Because of various difficulties (e.g. the Banach–Tarski paradox) that arise if such sets are insufficiently constrained, it is necessary to introduce what is termed a sigma-algebra to constrain the possible sets over which probabilities can be defined. Normally, a particular such sigma-algebra is used, the Borel σ-algebra, which allows for probabilities to be defined over any sets that can be derived either directly from continuous intervals of numbers or by a finite or countably infinite number of unions and/or intersections of such intervals.

The measure-theoretic definition is as follows.

Let formula_97 be a probability space and formula_98 a measurable space. Then an formula_98-valued random variable is a measurable function formula_100, which means that, for every subset formula_101, its preimage is formula_102-measurable; formula_103, where formula_104. This definition enables us to measure any subset formula_105 in the target space by looking at its preimage, which by assumption is measurable.

In more intuitive terms, a member of formula_11 is a possible outcome, a member of formula_102 is a measurable subset of possible outcomes, the function formula_55 gives the probability of each such measurable subset, formula_23 represents the set of values that the random variable can take (such as the set of real numbers), and a member of formula_110 is a &quot;well-behaved&quot; (measurable) subset of formula_23 (those for which the probability may be determined). The random variable is then a function from any outcome to a quantity, such that the outcomes leading to any useful subset of quantities for the random variable have a well-defined probability.

When formula_23 is a topological space, then the most common choice for the σ-algebra formula_110 is the Borel σ-algebra formula_114, which is the σ-algebra generated by the collection of all open sets in formula_23. In such case the formula_98-valued random variable is called an formula_23-valued random variable. Moreover, when the space formula_23 is the real line formula_58, then such a real-valued random variable is called simply a random variable.

===Real-valued random variables===

In this case the observation space is the set of real numbers. Recall, formula_97 is the probability space. For a real observation space, the function formula_121 is a real-valued random variable if
:formula_122

This definition is a special case of the above because the set formula_123 generates the Borel σ-algebra on the set of real numbers, and it suffices to check measurability on any generating set. Here we can prove measurability on this generating set by using the fact that formula_124.

==Moments==

The probability distribution of a random variable is often characterised by a small number of parameters, which also have a practical interpretation. For example, it is often enough to know what its &quot;average value&quot; is. This is captured by the mathematical concept of expected value of a random variable, denoted formula_125, and also called the first moment. In general, formula_126 is not equal to formula_127. Once the &quot;average value&quot; is known, one could then ask how far from this average value the values of formula_7 typically are, a question that is answered by the variance and standard deviation of a random variable. formula_125 can be viewed intuitively as an average obtained from an infinite population, the members of which are particular evaluations of formula_7.

Mathematically, this is known as the (generalised) problem of moments: for a given class of random variables formula_7, find a collection formula_132 of functions such that the expectation values formula_133 fully characterise the distribution of the random variable formula_7.

Moments can only be defined for real-valued functions of random variables (or complex-valued, etc.). If the random variable is itself real-valued, then moments of the variable itself can be taken, which are equivalent to moments of the identity function formula_135 of the random variable. However, even for non-real-valued random variables, moments can be taken of real-valued functions of those variables. For example, for a categorical random variable &quot;X&quot; that can take on the nominal values &quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;green&quot;, the real-valued function formula_136 can be constructed; this uses the Iverson bracket, and has the value 1 if formula_7 has the value &quot;green&quot;, 0 otherwise. Then, the expected value and other moments of this function can be determined.

==Functions of random variables==

A new random variable &quot;Y&quot; can be defined by applying a real Borel measurable function formula_138 to the outcomes of a real-valued random variable formula_7. That is, formula_140. The cumulative distribution function of formula_80 is then

:formula_142

If function formula_143 is invertible (i.e., formula_144 exists, where formula_145 is formula_143&#x27;s inverse function) and is either increasing or decreasing, then the previous relation can be extended to obtain

:formula_147

With the same hypotheses of invertibility of formula_143, assuming also differentiability, the relation between the probability density functions can be found by differentiating both sides of the above expression with respect to formula_149, in order to obtain

:formula_150

If there is no invertibility of formula_143 but each formula_149 admits at most a countable number of roots (i.e., a finite, or countably infinite, number of formula_153 such that formula_154) then the previous relation between the probability density functions can be generalized with

:formula_155

where formula_156, according to the inverse function theorem. The formulas for densities do not demand formula_143 to be increasing.

In the measure-theoretic, axiomatic approach to probability, if a random variable formula_7 on formula_11 and a Borel measurable function formula_138, then formula_161 is also a random variable on formula_11, since the composition of measurable functions is also measurable. (However, this is not necessarily true if formula_143 is Lebesgue measurable.) The same procedure that allowed one to go from a probability space formula_164 to formula_165 can be used to obtain the distribution of formula_80.

===Example 1===

Let formula_7 be a real-valued, continuous random variable and let formula_168.

:formula_169

If formula_170, then formula_171, so

:formula_172

If formula_173, then

:formula_174

so

:formula_175

===Example 2===

Suppose formula_7 is a random variable with a cumulative distribution

:formula_177

where formula_178 is a fixed parameter. Consider the random variable formula_179 Then,

:formula_180

The last expression can be calculated in terms of the cumulative distribution of formula_181 so

:formula_182

which is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of an exponential distribution.

===Example 3===

Suppose formula_7 is a random variable with a standard normal distribution, whose density is

:formula_184

Consider the random variable formula_185 We can find the density using the above formula for a change of variables:

:formula_186

In this case the change is not monotonic, because every value of formula_80 has two corresponding values of formula_7 (one positive and negative). However, because of symmetry, both halves will transform identically, i.e.,

:formula_189

The inverse transformation is
:formula_190
and its derivative is
:formula_191

Then,

:formula_192

This is a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom.

===Example 4===

Suppose formula_7 is a random variable with a normal distribution, whose density is

:formula_194

Consider the random variable formula_185 We can find the density using the above formula for a change of variables:

:formula_186

In this case the change is not monotonic, because every value of formula_80 has two corresponding values of formula_7 (one positive and negative). Differently from the previous example, in this case however, there is no symmetry and we have to compute the two distinct terms:

:formula_199

The inverse transformation is
:formula_200
and its derivative is
:formula_201

Then,

:formula_202

This is a noncentral chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom.

==Some properties==
* The probability distribution of the sum of two independent random variables is the convolution of each of their distributions.
* Probability distributions are not a vector space—they are not closed under linear combinations, as these do not preserve non-negativity or total integral 1—but they are closed under convex combination, thus forming a convex subset of the space of functions (or measures).

==Equivalence of random variables==

There are several different senses in which random variables can be considered to be equivalent. Two random variables can be equal, equal almost surely, or equal in distribution.

In increasing order of strength, the precise definition of these notions of equivalence is given below.

===Equality in distribution===

If the sample space is a subset of the real line, random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are &quot;equal in distribution&quot; (denoted formula_203) if they have the same distribution functions:
:formula_204

To be equal in distribution, random variables need not be defined on the same probability space. Two random variables having equal moment generating functions have the same distribution. This provides, for example, a useful method of checking equality of certain functions of independent, identically distributed (IID) random variables. However, the moment generating function exists only for distributions that have a defined Laplace transform.

===Almost sure equality===

Two random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are &quot;equal almost surely&quot; (denoted formula_205) if, and only if, the probability that they are different is zero:

:formula_206

For all practical purposes in probability theory, this notion of equivalence is as strong as actual equality. It is associated to the following distance:

:formula_207

where &quot;ess sup&quot; represents the essential supremum in the sense of measure theory.

===Equality===

Finally, the two random variables &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are &quot;equal&quot; if they are equal as functions on their measurable space:

:formula_208

This notion is typically the least useful in probability theory because in practice and in theory, the underlying measure space of the experiment is rarely explicitly characterized or even characterizable.

==Convergence==

A significant theme in mathematical statistics consists of obtaining convergence results for certain sequences of random variables; for instance the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.

There are various senses in which a sequence formula_209 of random variables can converge to a random variable formula_7. These are explained in the article on convergence of random variables.

<doc id="25686" wikidata="Q1059358" url="?curid=25686" title="Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam">
<text>Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his 1859 translation from Persian to English of a selection of quatrains (&quot;&quot;) attributed to Omar Khayyam (1048–1131), dubbed &quot;the Astronomer-Poet of Persia&quot;.

Although commercially unsuccessful at first, FitzGerald&#x27;s work was popularised from 1861 onward by Whitley Stokes, and the work came to be greatly admired by the Pre-Raphaelites in England. FitzGerald had a third edition printed in 1872, which increased interest in the work in the United States. By the 1880s, the book was extremely popular throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent that numerous &quot;Omar Khayyam clubs&quot; were formed and there was a &quot; cult of the Rubaiyat&quot;.

FitzGerald&#x27;s work has been published in several hundred editions and has inspired similar translation efforts in English, Hindi and in many other languages.

==Sources==

The authenticity of the poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam is highly uncertain. Khayyam was famous during his lifetime not as a poet but as an astronomer and mathematician. The earliest reference to his having written poetry is found in his biography by al-Isfahani, written 43 years after his death. This view is reinforced by other medieval historians such as Shahrazuri (1201) and Al-Qifti (1255). Parts of the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; appear as incidental quotations from Omar in early works of biography and in anthologies. These include works of Razi (ca. 1160–1210), Daya (1230), Juvayni (ca. 1226–1283), and Jajarmi (1340). Also, five quatrains assigned to Khayyam in somewhat later sources appear in Zahiri Samarqandi&#x27;s &quot;Sindbad-Nameh&quot; (before 1160) without attribution.

The number of quatrains attributed to him in more recent collections varies from about 1,200 (according to Saeed Nafisi) to more than 2,000. Sceptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be pseudepigraphic.
The extant manuscripts containing collections attributed to Omar are dated much too late to enable a reconstruction of a body of authentic verses.

In the 1930s, Iranian scholars, notably Mohammad-Ali Foroughi, attempted to reconstruct a core of authentic verses from scattered quotes by authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, ignoring the younger manuscript tradition. After World War II, reconstruction efforts were significantly delayed by two clever forgeries. De Blois (2004) is pessimistic, suggesting that contemporary scholarship has not advanced beyond the situation of the 1930s, when Hans Heinrich Schaeder commented that the name of Omar Khayyam &quot;is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature&quot;.

A feature of the more recent collections is the lack of linguistic homogeneity and continuity of ideas. Sadegh Hedayat commented that &quot;if a man had lived for a hundred years and had changed his religion, philosophy, and beliefs twice a day, he could scarcely have given expression to such a range of ideas&quot;. Hedayat&#x27;s final verdict was that 14 quatrains could be attributed to Khayyam with certainty. Various tests have been employed to reduce the quatrains attributable to Omar to about 100. Arthur Christensen states that &quot;of more than 1,200 ruba&#x27;is known to be ascribed to Omar, only 121 could be regarded as reasonably authentic&quot;. Foroughi accepts 178 quatrains as authentic, while Ali Dashti accepts 36 of them.

FitzGerald&#x27;s source was transcripts sent to him in 1856–57, by his friend and teacher Edward B. Cowell, of two manuscripts, a Bodleian manuscript with 158 quatrains
and a &quot;Calcutta manuscript&quot;.

FitzGerald completed his first draft in 1857 and sent it to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in January 1858.
He made a revised draft in January 1859, of which he privately printed 250 copies. This first edition became extremely sought after by the 1890s, when &quot;more than two million copies ha[d] been sold in two hundred editions&quot;.

==Scepticism vs. Sufism debate==
The extreme popularity of FitzGerald&#x27;s work led to a prolonged debate on the correct interpretation of the philosophy behind the poems. FitzGerald emphasized the religious scepticism he found in Omar Khayyam. In his preface to the &quot;Rubáiyát&quot;, he describes Omar&#x27;s philosophy as Epicurean and claims that Omar was &quot;hated and dreaded by the Sufis, whose practice he ridiculed and whose faith amounts to little more than his own when stripped of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide&quot;. Richard Nelson Frye also emphasizes that Khayyam was despised by a number of prominent contemporary Sufis. These include figures such as Shams Tabrizi, Najm al-Din Daya, Al-Ghazali, and Attar, who &quot;viewed Khayyam not as a fellow-mystic, but a free-thinking scientist&quot;. The sceptic interpretation is supported by the medieval historian Al-Qifti (ca. 1172–1248), who in his &quot;The History of Learned Men&quot; reports that Omar&#x27;s poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style but were written with an anti-religious agenda. He also mentions that Khayyam was indicted for impiety and went on a pilgrimage to avoid punishment.

Critics of FitzGerald, on the other hand, have accused the translator of misrepresenting the mysticism of Sufi poetry by an overly literal interpretation. Thus, the view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard (1915). Dougan (1991) likewise says that attributing hedonism to Omar is due to the failings of FitzGerald&#x27;s translation, arguing that the poetry is to be understood as &quot;deeply esoteric&quot;. Idries Shah (1999) similarly says that FitzGerald misunderstood Omar&#x27;s poetry.

The Sufi interpretation is the view of a minority of scholars. Henry Beveridge states that &quot;the Sufis have unaccountably pressed this writer [Khayyam] into their service; they explain away some of his blasphemies by forced interpretations, and others they represent as innocent freedoms and reproaches&quot;. Aminrazavi (2007) states that &quot;Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his Rubaiyat extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine&quot;.

FitzGerald&#x27;s &quot;scepticist&quot; reading of the poetry is still defended by modern scholars. Sadegh Hedayat (&quot;The Blind Owl&quot;, 1936) was the most notable modern proponent of Khayyam&#x27;s philosophy as agnostic scepticism. In his introductory essay to his second edition of the &quot;Quatrains of the Philosopher Omar Khayyam&quot; (1922), Hedayat states that &quot;while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine&quot;. He concludes that &quot;religion has proved incapable of surmounting his inherent fears; thus Khayyam finds himself alone and insecure in a universe about which his knowledge is nil&quot;. In his later work (&quot;Khayyam&#x27;s Quatrains&quot;, 1935), Hedayat further maintains that Khayyam&#x27;s usage of Sufic terminology such as &quot;wine&quot; is literal, and that &quot;Khayyam took refuge in wine to ward off bitterness and to blunt the cutting edge of his thoughts.&quot;

==Editions==

FitzGerald&#x27;s text was published in five editions, with substantial revisions:
* 1st edition – 1859 [75 quatrains]
* 2nd edition – 1868 [110 quatrains]
* 3rd edition – 1872 [101 quatrains]
**1878, &quot;first American edition&quot;, reprint of the 3rd ed.
* 4th edition – 1879 [101 quatrains]
* 5th edition – 1889 [101 quatrains]

Of the five editions published, four were published under the authorial control of FitzGerald. The fifth edition, which contained only minor changes from the fourth, was edited posthumously on the basis of manuscript revisions FitzGerald had left.

Numerous later editions were published after 1889, notably an edition with illustrations by Willy Pogany first published in 1909 (George G. Harrap, London). It was issued in numerous revised editions. This edition combined FitzGerald&#x27;s texts of the 1st and 4th editions and was subtitled &quot;The First and Fourth Renderings in English Verse&quot;.

A bibliography of editions compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions. Many more have been published since.

Notable editions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include:

==Character of translation==
FitzGerald&#x27;s translation is rhyming and metrical, and rather free. Many of the verses are paraphrased, and some of them cannot be confidently traced to his source material at all. Michael Kearney claimed that FitzGerald described his work as &quot;transmogrification&quot;. To a large extent, the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; can be considered original poetry by FitzGerald loosely based on Omar&#x27;s quatrains rather than a &quot;translation&quot; in the narrow sense.

FitzGerald was open about the liberties he had taken with his source material:
My translation will interest you from its form, and also in many respects in its detail: very un-literal as it is. Many quatrains are mashed together: and something lost, I doubt, of Omar&#x27;s simplicity, which is so much a virtue in him. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 9/3/58)

I suppose very few people have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: though certainly not to be literal. But at all Costs, a Thing must live: with a transfusion of one&#x27;s own worse Life if one can&#x27;t retain the Originals better. Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 4/27/59)

For comparison, here are two versions of the same quatrain by FitzGerald, from the 1859 and 1889 editions:

This quatrain has a close correspondence in two of the quatrains in the Bodleian Library ms., numbers 149 and 155. In the literal prose translation of 
Edward Heron-Allen (1898):

==Other translations==
===English===
Multilingual edition, published in 1955 by Tahrir Iran Co./Kashani Bros.

Two English editions by Edward Henry Whinfield (1836–1922) consisted of 253 quatrains in 1882 and 500 in 1883. This translation was fully revised and some cases fully translated anew by Ali Salami and published by Mehrandish Books.

Whinfield&#x27;s translation is, if possible, even more free than FitzGerald&#x27;s; Quatrain 84 (equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above) reads:
&lt;poem&gt;
In the sweet spring a grassy bank I sought
And thither wine and a fair Houri brought;
And, though the people called me graceless dog,
Gave not to Paradise another thought!
&lt;/poem&gt;

John Leslie Garner published an English translation of 152 quatrains in 1888. His was also a free, rhyming translation.
Quatrain I. 20 (equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
Yes, Loved One, when the Laughing Spring is blowing,
With Thee beside me and the Cup o’erflowing,
I pass the day upon this Waving Meadow,
And dream the while, no thought on Heaven bestowing.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Justin Huntly McCarthy (1859–1936) (Member of Parliament for Newry) published prose translations of 466 quatrains in 1889.
Quatrain 177 (equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
In Spring time I love to sit in the meadow with a paramour
perfect as a Houri and goodly jar of wine, and though
I may be blamed for this, yet hold me lower
than a dog if ever I dream of Paradise.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Richard Le Gallienne (1866–1947) produced a paraphrase in 1897. Le Gallienne knew no Persian and based his paraphrase on earlier translations, exaggerating earlier translators&#x27; choices to make Khayyam appear more irreligious. For instance, he invents a verse in which Khayyam is made to say &quot;the unbeliever knows his Koran best,&quot; and rewrites another to describe pious hypocrites as &quot;a maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew,&quot; rather than the original Persian which emphasizes their ignorance of religion. Rather than a symbol for gnostic wisdom, wine becomes a straightforward image of libertinism for La Gallienne. Some example quatrains follow:
&lt;poem&gt;
Look not above, there is no answer there;
Pray not, for no one listens to your prayer;
Near is as near to God as any Far,
And Here is just the same deceit as There.
&quot;(#78, on p. 44)&quot;

&quot;Did God set grapes a-growing, do you think,
And at the same time make it sin to drink?
Give thanks to Him who foreordained it thus—
Surely He loves to hear the glasses clink!&quot;
&quot;(#91, p. 48)&quot;

&lt;/poem&gt;

Edward Heron-Allen (1861–1943) published a prose translation in 1898. He also wrote an introduction to an edition of the translation by Frederick Rolfe (Baron Corvo) into English from Nicolas&#x27;s French translation. Below is Quatrain 17 translated by E. H. into English:

&lt;poem&gt;
This worn caravanserai which is called the world
Is the resting-place of the piebald horse of night and day;
It is a pavilion which has been abandoned by a hundred Jamshyds;
It is a palace that is the resting-place of a hundred Bahrams.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The English novelist and orientalist Jessie Cadell (1844–1884) consulted various manuscripts of the Rubaiyat with the intention of producing an authoritative edition. Her translation of 150 quatrains was published posthumously in 1899.

A. J. Arberry in 1949 and 1952 produced translations of two putative thirteenth-century manuscripts acquired shortly before by the Chester Beatty Library and Cambridge University Library. However, it was soon established that, unbeknown to Arberry or the libraries, the manuscripts were recent forgeries. While Arberry&#x27;s work had been misguided, it was published in good faith.

The 1967 translation of the Rubáiyat by Robert Graves and Omar Ali-Shah created a scandal. The authors claimed it was based on a twelfth-century manuscript located in Afghanistan, where it was allegedly utilized as a Sufi teaching document. But the manuscript was never produced, and British experts in Persian literature were easily able to prove that the translation was in fact based on Edward Heron Allen&#x27;s analysis of possible sources for FitzGerald&#x27;s work.

Quatrains 11 and 12 (the equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
Should our day&#x27;s portion be one mancel loaf,
A haunch of mutton and a gourd of wine
Set for us two alone on the wide plain,
No Sultan&#x27;s bounty could evoke such joy.

A gourd of red wine and a sheaf of poems —
A bare subsistence, half a loaf, not more —
Supplied us two alone in the free desert:
What Sultan could we envy on his throne?
&lt;/poem&gt;

John Charles Edward Bowen (1909–1989) was a British poet and translator of Persian poetry. He is best known for his translation of the Rubaiyat, titled &quot;A New Selection from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.&quot; Bowen is also credited as being one of the first scholars to question Robert Graves&#x27; and Omar Ali-Shah&#x27;s translation of the Rubaiyat.

A modern version of 235 quatrains, claiming to be &quot;as literal an English version of the Persian originals as readability and intelligibility permit&quot;, was published in 1979 by Peter Avery and John Heath-Stubbs. 
Their edition provides two versions of the thematic quatrain, the first (98) considered by the Persian writer Sadeq Hedayat to be a spurious attribution.
&lt;poem&gt;
98.
I need a jug of wine and a book of poetry,
Half a loaf for a bite to eat,
Then you and I, seated in a deserted spot,
Will have more wealth than a Sultan&#x27;s realm.
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
234.
If chance supplied a loaf of white bread,
Two casks of wine and a leg of mutton,
In the corner of a garden with a tulip-cheeked girl,
There&#x27;d be enjoyment no Sultan could outdo.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1988, the Rubaiyat was translated by an Iranian for the first time. Karim Emami&#x27;s translation of the Rubaiyat was published under the title &quot;The Wine of Nishapour&quot; in Paris. &quot;The Wine of Nishapour&quot; is the collection of Khayyam&#x27;s poetry by Shahrokh Golestan, including Golestan&#x27;s pictures in front of each poem.
Example quatrain 160 (equivalent to FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his first edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
In spring if a houri-like sweetheart
Gives me a cup of wine on the edge of a green cornfield,
Though to the vulgar this would be blasphemy,
If I mentioned any other Paradise, I&#x27;d be worse than a dog.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In 1991, Ahmad Saidi (1904–1994) produced an English translation of 165 quatrains grouped into 10 themes. Born and raised in Iran, Saidi went to the United States in 1931 and attended college there. He served as the head of the Persian Publication Desk at the U.S. Office of War Information during World War II, inaugurated the Voice of America in Iran, and prepared an English-Persian military dictionary for the Department of Defense. His quatrains include the original Persian verses for reference alongside his English translations. His focus was to faithfully convey, with less poetic license, Khayyam&#x27;s original religious, mystical, and historic Persian themes, through the verses as well as his extensive annotations. Two example quatrains follow:

Quatrain 16 (equivalent to FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XII in his 5th edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
Ah, would there were a loaf of bread as fare,
A joint of lamb, a jug of vintage rare,
And you and I in wilderness encamped—
No Sultan&#x27;s pleasure could with ours compare.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Quatrain 75:
&lt;poem&gt;
The sphere upon which mortals come and go,
Has no end nor beginning that we know;
And none there is to tell us in plain truth:
Whence do we come and whither do we go.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Paramahansa Yogananda (1893–1952) published an English translation and other translations of 75 quatrains in 1996, with a glossary, spiritual interpretation and practical applications.

===German===
Adolf Friedrich von Schack (1815–1894) published a German translation in 1878.

Quatrain 151 (equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
Gönnt mir, mit dem Liebchen im Gartenrund
Zu weilen bei süßem Rebengetränke,
Und nennt mich schlimmer als einen Hund,
Wenn ferner an&#x27;s Paradies ich denke!
&lt;/poem&gt;

Friedrich Martinus von Bodenstedt (1819–1892) published a German translation in 1881. The translation eventually consisted of 395 quatrains.

Quatrain IX, 59 (equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
Im Frühling mag ich gern im Grüne weilen
Und Einsamkeit mit einer Freundin teilen
Und einem Kruge Wein. Mag man mich schelten:
Ich lasse keinen andern Himmel gelten.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===French===
The first French translation, of 464 quatrains in prose, was made by J. B. Nicolas, chief interpreter at the French embassy in Persia in 1867.

Prose stanza (equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Au printemps j’aime à m’asseoir au bord d’une prairie, avec une idole semblable à une houri et une cruche de vin, s’il y en a, et bien que tout cela soit généralement blâmé, je veux être pire qu’un chien si jamais je songe au paradis.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

The best-known version in French is the free verse edition by Franz Toussaint (1879–1955) published in 1924. This translation consisting of 170 quatrains was done from the original Persian text, while most of the other French translations were themselves translations of FitzGerald&#x27;s work. The &quot;Éditions d&#x27;art Henri Piazza&quot; published the book almost unchanged between 1924 and 1979. Toussaint&#x27;s translation has served as the basis of subsequent translations into other languages, but Toussaint did not live to witness the influence his translation has had.

Quatrain XXV (equivalent of FitzGerald&#x27;s quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Au printemps, je vais quelquefois m’asseoir à la lisière d’un champ fleuri. Lorsqu’une belle jeune fille m’apporte une coupe de vin, je ne pense guère à mon salut. Si j’avais cette préoccupation, je vaudrais moins qu’un chien.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Russian===
Many Russian-language translations have been undertaken, reflecting the popularity of the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; in Russia since the late 19th century and the increasingly popular tradition of using it for the purposes of bibliomancy. The earliest verse translation (by Vasily Velichko) was published in 1891. The version by Osip Rumer published in 1914 is a translation of FitzGerald&#x27;s version. Rumer later published a version of 304 rubaiyat translated directly from Persian. A lot of poetic translations (some based on verbatim translations into prose by others) were also written by German Plisetsky, Konstantin Bal&#x27;mont, Cecilia Banu, I. I. Tkhorzhevsky (ru), L. Pen&#x27;kovsky, and others.

==Influence==

FitzGerald rendered Omar&#x27;s name as &quot;Omar the Tentmaker&quot;, and this name resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, Nathan Haskell Dole published a novel called &quot;Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia&quot; in 1898. &quot;Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur&quot; is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. 
&quot;Omar the Tentmaker&quot; is a 1914 play in an oriental setting by Richard Walton Tully, adapted as a silent film in 1922.
US General Omar Bradley was given the nickname &quot;Omar the Tent-Maker&quot; in World War II, and the name has been recorded as a slang expression for &quot;penis&quot;.
FitzGerald&#x27;s translations also reintroduced Khayyam to Iranians, &quot;who had long ignored the Neishapouri poet&quot;.

===Literature===
* The title of Rex Stout&#x27;s Nero Wolfe novel &quot;Some Buried Caesar&quot; comes from one of the Tentmaker&#x27;s quatrains (FitzGerald&#x27;s XIX), for example.
* W.E.B. Du Bois references Omar Khayyam, the Persian poet, astronomer, and mathematician, in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; as part of his exploration of the relationship between the African American community and mainstream American society.  In the chapter &quot;Of the Passing of the First-Born,&quot; Du Bois reflects on the death of his infant son and uses the imagery of Khayyam&#x27;s &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; to express his sense of grief and alienation.
* Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s drama &quot;Ah, Wilderness!&quot; derives its title from the first quoted quatrain above.
* Agatha Christie used &quot;The Moving Finger&quot; as a story title, as did Stephen King. See also &quot;And Having Writ...&quot;.
* Lan Wright used &quot;Dawn&#x27;s Left Hand&quot; as the title of a science fiction story serialized in &quot;New Worlds Science Fiction&quot; (January–March 1963).
* The title of Allen Drury&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;The Throne of Saturn&quot; comes from a quatrain which appears as the book&#x27;s epigraph.
* The title of Nevil Shute Norway&#x27;s novel &quot;The Chequer Board&quot; is taken from Stanza LXIX, and that stanza appears as the book&#x27;s epigraph.
* The titles of Mike Shupp&#x27;s science fiction novels &quot;With Fate Conspire&quot; and &quot;Morning Of Creation&quot;, the first two books of the series &quot;The Destiny Makers&quot;, are taken from Stanzas LXXIII and LIII. These stanzas are quoted during the novels by the main character. The first quote in particular ties in with his mission as a time traveler trying to change past history to alter the outcome of a future war:
:::Ah Love! could thou and I with Fate conspire
:::To grasp this sorry Scheme of Things entire,
:::Would not we shatter it to bits - and then
:::Re-mould it nearer to the Heart&#x27;s Desire!

Equally noteworthy are these works likewise influenced:
* The satirist and short story writer Hector Hugh Munro took his pen name of &#x27;Saki&#x27; from Edward FitzGerald&#x27;s translation of the Rubaiyat.
* The American author O. Henry humorously referred to a book by &quot;Homer KM&quot; with the character &quot;Ruby Ott&quot; in his short story &quot;The Handbook of Hymen. &quot; O. Henry also quoted a quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam in &quot;The Rubaiyat of a Scotch Highball&quot;.
* Oliver Herford released a parody of the Rubaiyat called &quot;The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten&quot; in 1904, which is notable for its charming illustrations of the kitten in question on his philosophical adventures.

* The play &quot;The Shadow of a Gunman&quot; (1923) by Seán O&#x27;Casey contains a reference to the &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; as the character Donal Davoren quotes &quot;grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, and mould life nearer to the heart&#x27;s desire&quot;.
* The Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges discusses &quot;The Rubaiyat&quot; and its history in an essay, &quot;The Enigma of Edward FitzGerald&quot; (&quot;El enigma de Edward FitzGerald&quot;) in his book &quot;Other Inquisitions&quot; (&quot;Otras Inquisiciones&quot;, 1952). He also references it in some of his poems, including &quot;Rubaiyat&quot; in &quot;The Praise of the Shadow&quot; (&quot;Elogio de la Sombra&quot;, 1969), and &quot;Chess&quot; (&quot;Ajedrez&quot;) in &quot;The Maker&quot; (&quot;El Hacedor&quot;, 1960). Borges&#x27; father Jorge Guillermo Borges was the author of a Spanish translation of the FitzGerald version of The Rubaiyat.
* Science fiction author Paul Marlowe&#x27;s story &quot;Resurrection and Life&quot; featured a character who could only communicate using lines from the Rubaiyat.

* One of the title pages of &quot;Principia Discordia&quot; (1965), a co-author of which went by the pen-name Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst, features its own spin on the quatrain most quoted above:
::: A jug of wine,
::: A leg of lamb
:::: And thou!
::: Beside me,
:::: Whistling in
::::: the darkness.
* The Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf based his novel &quot;Samarkand&quot; (1988) on the life of Omar Khayyam, and the creation of the Rubaiyat. It details the Assassin sect as well, and includes a fictional telling of how the (non-existent) original manuscript came to be on the &quot;RMS Titanic&quot;.
* In the opening chapter of his book &quot;God is Not Great&quot; (2007), Christopher Hitchens quotes from Richard Le Gallienne&#x27;s translation of Khayyam&#x27;s famous quatrain:
:::And do you think that unto such as you
:::A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew
:::God gave the secret, and denied it me?
:::Well, well—what matters it? Believe that, too!
* The title of Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s memoir &quot;Myself when Young&quot; is a quote from quatrain 27 of FitzGerald&#x27;s translation:
:::Myself when young did eagerly frequent
:::Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument
:::About it and about: but evermore
:::Came out by the same Door as in I went.
* Rudyard Kipling composed the satirical poem &quot;The Rupaiyat of Omar Kal&#x27;vin&quot;, following the form of the original but with the content being primarily a complaint against an increase in income tax.
* Working as a pornographic illustrator, The main character in Osamu Dazai&#x27;s &quot;No Longer Human&quot; appends Rupaiyat verses to his illustrations.

Pirsig&#x27;s &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot; (1974) tries to recall the opening Quatrain of &quot;The Rubáiyat of Omar Khayyám&quot; when the landscape of Oregon &quot;looks like some desert in Persia above [them].&quot; The narrator quotes some more Quatrains that &quot;keep rumbling through [his] head. ... &quot;something, something along some Strip of Herbage strown / That just divides the desert from the sown, / Where name of Slave and Sultan scarce is known, / And pity Sultan Mahmud on his Throne&quot; ...&quot; He tries to remember other parts saying to himself, &quot;How did that go? I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t even &quot;like&quot; the poem.&quot;

===Cinema===
* Filmmaker D.W. Griffith planned a film based on the poems as a follow-up to &quot;Intolerance&quot; in 1916. It was to star Miriam Cooper, but when she left the Griffith company the plans were dropped; he would ultimately film &quot;Broken Blossoms&quot; instead.

* The Rubaiyat was quoted in the 1946 King Vidor Western film &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot;, which starred Gregory Peck and Jennifer Jones: &quot;Oh threats of hell and hopes of paradise! One thing at least is certain: This life flies. One thing is certain and the rest is Lies; The Flower that once is blown for ever dies.&quot;
* The 1951 film &quot;Pandora and the Flying Dutchman&quot;, starring James Mason and Ava Gardner, opens with an illuminated manuscript of the quatrain beginning &quot;The moving finger writes...&quot;.

Summarizing what she calls the &quot;Ruby Hat of Omar Kayayayayay...I am &quot;appalled!!&quot;&quot;, the mayor&#x27;s wife paraphrases FitzGerald&#x27;s Quatrain XII from his 5th edition: &quot;People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches, and drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls.&quot;
* The film &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot;, also known as &quot;The Loves of Omar Khayyam&quot;, was released in 1957 by Paramount Pictures and includes excerpts from the Rubaiyat.

He later rewrote these pieces as an orchestral suite, &quot;Four Character Pieces after the Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám&quot;.
* Using FitzGerald&#x27;s translation, the Armenian-American composer Alan Hovhaness set a dozen of the quatrains to music. This work, &quot;The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;, Op. 308, calls for narrator, orchestra, and solo accordion.

<doc id="25695" wikidata="Q129817" url="?curid=25695" title="Russell Crowe">
<text>Russell Ira Crowe (born April 7, 1964) is an actor. He was born in New Zealand, spending ten years of his childhood in Australia and residing there permanently by the age of 21. His work on screen has earned him various accolades, including an Academy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and a British Academy Film Award.

Crowe began acting in Australia and had his break-out role in &quot;Romper Stomper&quot; (1992). He gained international recognition in the late 1990s for his starring roles in &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999). Crowe gained wider stardom for playing the title role of &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), which earned him the Academy Award for Best Actor. Further acclaim came for portraying real-life mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. in &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; (2001). Crowe then starred in a number of films in the 2000s, including &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot; (2003), &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; (2005), &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; (2007), &quot;American Gangster&quot; (2007), &quot;State of Play&quot; (2009), and &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2010).

Crowe has since appeared in the films &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (2012), &quot;Man of Steel&quot; (2013), &quot;Noah&quot; (2014), and &quot;&quot; (2022). In 2014, he made his directorial debut with the drama &quot;The Water Diviner&quot;, in which he also starred. Aside from acting, Crowe has been the co-owner of the National Rugby League (NRL) team South Sydney Rabbitohs since 2006.

==Early life==
Crowe was born in Strathmore Park, a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, on 7 April 1964, the son of film set caterers Jocelyn Yvonne (née Wemyss) and John Alexander Crowe. His father also managed a hotel. His maternal grandfather, Stan Wemyss, was a cinematographer who was appointed an MBE for filming footage of World War II as a member of the New Zealand Film Unit. Crowe is Māori, and identifies with Ngāti Porou through one of his maternal great-great-grandmothers. His paternal grandfather, John Doubleday Crowe, was a Welsh man from Wrexham, while another of his grandparents was Scottish. His other ancestry includes English, German, Irish, Italian, Norwegian, and Swedish. He is a cousin of former New Zealand national cricket captains Martin and Jeff Crowe, and the nephew of cricketer Dave Crowe.
Through his paternal grandmother, he is a direct descendant of Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat, the last man to be beheaded in Britain. 

When Crowe was four years old, his family moved to Australia and settled in Sydney, where his parents pursued their career in film set catering. His mother&#x27;s godfather was the producer of the Australian TV series &quot;Spyforce&quot;, and Crowe was hired for a line of dialogue in one episode of the series at age five or six, opposite series star Jack Thompson. Later, in 1994, Thompson would play the supportive father of Crowe&#x27;s gay character in &quot;The Sum of Us&quot;. Crowe also appeared briefly in the serial &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;. In Australia, he was educated at Vaucluse Public School and Sydney Boys High School, before his family moved back to New Zealand in 1978 when he was 14. He continued his secondary education at Auckland Grammar School, with his cousins and brother Terry, and Mount Roskill Grammar School before leaving school at the age of 16 to pursue his acting ambitions.

==Acting career==
===New Zealand===
Under guidance from his good friend Tom Sharplin, Crowe began his performing career as a musician in the early 1980s performing under the stage name &quot;Russ Le Roq&quot;. He released several New Zealand singles, including &quot;I Just Wanna Be Like Marlon Brando&quot;, &quot;Pier 13&quot;, and &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, none of which charted. He managed an Auckland music venue called &quot;The Venue&quot; in 1984. When he was 18, he was featured in &quot;A Very Special Person...&quot;, a promotional video for the theology/ministry course at Avondale University, a Seventh-day Adventist tertiary education provider in New South Wales, Australia.

===Australia===
Crowe left New Zealand and returned to Australia at the age of 21, intending to apply to the National Institute of Dramatic Art. He said, &quot;I was working in a theatre show, and talked to a guy who was then the head of technical support at NIDA. I asked him what he thought about me spending three years at NIDA. He told me it&#x27;d be a waste of time. He said, &#x27;You already do the things you go there to learn, and you&#x27;ve been doing it for most of your life, so there&#x27;s nothing to teach you but bad habits.&#x27;&quot; From 1986 to 1988, he was given his first professional role by director Daniel Abineri, in a New Zealand production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. He played the role of Eddie/Dr Scott. He repeated this performance in a further Australian production of the show, which also toured New Zealand. In 1987, Crowe spent six months busking when he could not find other work. In the 1988 Australian production of &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;, Crowe played the role of Mickey. He was also cast again by Daniel Abineri in the role of Johnny, in the stage musical &quot;Bad Boy Johnny and the Prophets of Doom&quot; in 1989.

After appearing in the TV series &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Living with the Law,&quot; Crowe was cast by Faith Martin in his first film, &quot;The Crossing&quot; (1990), a small-town love triangle directed by George Ogilvie. Before production started, a film-student protégé of Ogilvie, Steve Wallace, hired Crowe for the 1990 film &quot;Blood Oath&quot; (aka &quot;Prisoners of the Sun&quot;), which was released a month earlier than &quot;The Crossing&quot;, although actually filmed later. In 1992, Crowe starred in the first episode of the second series of &quot;Police Rescue.&quot; Also in 1992, Crowe starred in &quot;Romper Stomper&quot;, an Australian film which followed the exploits and downfall of a racist skinhead group in blue-collar suburban Melbourne, directed by Geoffrey Wright and co-starring Jacqueline McKenzie. For the role, Crowe won an Australian Film Institute (AFI) award for Best Actor, following up from his Best Supporting Actor award for &quot;Proof&quot; in 1991. In 2015, it was reported that Crowe had applied for Australian citizenship in 2006 and again in 2013 but was rejected because he failed to fulfill the residency requirements. However, Australia&#x27;s Immigration Department said it had no record of any such application by Crowe.

=== North America ===

After initial success in Australia, Crowe first starred in a Canadian production in 1993, &quot;For the Moment&quot;, before concentrating on American films. In 1993 he was favoured for the role of Joshua Chamberlain in the epic film Gettysburg, but was passed over for Jeff Daniels. He co-starred with Denzel Washington in &quot;Virtuosity&quot; (the duo later appearing together in &quot;American Gangster&quot;) and with Sharon Stone in &quot;The Quick and the Dead&quot; in 1995. He went on to become a three-time Oscar nominee, winning the Academy Award as Best Actor in 2000 for &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Crowe was awarded the (Australian) Centenary Medal in 2001 for &quot;service to Australian society and Australian film production.&quot;

Crowe received three consecutive best actor Oscar nominations, for &quot;The Insider&quot;, &quot;Gladiator&quot;, and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;. Crowe won the best actor award for &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; at the 2002 BAFTA award ceremony, as well as the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild awards for the same performance. Although nominated for an Academy Award, he lost to Denzel Washington. All three films were also nominated for Best Picture, and both &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; won the award. Crowe became the first actor to star as the lead in back-to-back Best Picture winners since Walter Pidgeon (who starred in &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; [1941] and &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; [1942]).

Within the six-year stretch from 1997 to 2003, Crowe also starred in two other best picture nominees, &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; and &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;. In 2005, he re-teamed with &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; director Ron Howard for the biographical boxing drama &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;. In 2006, he re-teamed with &quot;Gladiator&quot; director Ridley Scott for &quot;A Good Year&quot;, the first of two consecutive collaborations (the second being &quot;American Gangster&quot; co-starring again with Denzel Washington, released in late 2007). Although the light romantic comedy of &quot;A Good Year&quot; was not greatly received, Crowe seemed pleased with the film, telling STV in an interview that he thought it would be enjoyed by fans of his other films. In 2007, he starred in the Western film &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot;, a remake of the 1957 film of the same name. 

In recent years, Crowe&#x27;s box office standing has declined. He starred in the 2009 political thriller &quot;State of Play&quot;, based on the BBC drama television series of the same name. Crowe appeared in &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, a film based on the Robin Hood legend, directed by Ridley Scott and released on 14 May 2010. During the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; shoot, Crowe fractured both of his legs doing a scene in which he &quot;jumped off a castle portcullis onto rock-hard uneven ground&quot; and said he &quot;never discussed the injury with production, never took a day off because of it, I just kept going to work&quot;. Crowe starred in the 2010 Paul Haggis film &quot;The Next Three Days&quot;, an adaptation of the 2008 French film &quot;Pour elle&quot; (&quot;Anything for Her&quot;).

After a year off from acting, Crowe played Jackknife in &quot;The Man with the Iron Fists&quot; (2012), opposite RZA. He took on the role of Javert in the musical film of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (2012), and portrayed Superman&#x27;s biological father, Jor-El, in the Christopher Nolan-produced film &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, released in the summer of 2013. In 2014, he played a gangster in the film adaptation of Mark Helprin&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, and the title role in the Darren Aronofsky film &quot;Noah&quot;. Crowe had a major role in &quot;The Mummy&quot; (2017), starred as an angry driver in the action thriller &quot;Unhinged&quot; (2020), played the mythical Greek god Zeus in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;&quot; (released 8 July 2022), and portrayed the famous exorcist Fr. Gabriele Amorth in &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Exorcist&quot; (2023).

In June 2013, Crowe signed to make his directorial debut with an historical drama film &quot;The Water Diviner&quot;, in which he also starred alongside Jacqueline McKenzie, Olga Kurylenko, Jai Courtney. Set in the year 1919, the film was produced by Troy Lum, Andrew Mason and Keith Rodger.

== Music ==
In the 1980s, Crowe, under the name of &quot;Russ le Roq&quot;, recorded a song titled &quot;I Just Wanna Be Like Marlon Brando&quot;.

In the 1980s, Crowe and friend Billy Dean Cochran formed a band, Roman Antix, which later evolved into the Australian rock band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts (abbreviated to TOFOG). Crowe performed lead vocals and guitar for the band, which formed in 1992. The band released &quot;The Photograph Kills EP&quot; in 1995, as well as three full-length records, &quot;Gaslight&quot; (1998), &quot;Bastard Life or Clarity&quot; (2001) and &quot;Other Ways of Speaking&quot; (2003). In 2000, TOFOG performed shows in London, Los Angeles and in Austin, Texas. In 2001, the band toured in the U.S. with dates in Austin, Boulder, Chicago, Portland, San Francisco, Hollywood, Philadelphia, New York City and the last show at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey.

In early 2005, 30 Odd Foot of Grunts as a group had &quot;dissolved/evolved&quot; with Crowe feeling his future music would take a new direction. He began a collaboration with Alan Doyle of the Canadian band Great Big Sea, and with it a new band emerged, the Ordinary Fear of God, which also involved some members of the previous TOFOG line-up. A new single, &quot;Raewyn&quot;, was released in April 2005 and an album entitled &quot;My Hand, My Heart&quot; was released. The album includes a tribute song to actor Richard Harris, who became Crowe&#x27;s friend during the making of &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

Crowe and his new band the Ordinary Fear of God (keeping the TOFOG acronym) toured Australia in 2005, and then the U.S. In 2006 they returned to the US to promote their new release &quot;My Hand, My Heart&quot;. In March 2010, the group&#x27;s version of the John Williamson song &quot;Winter Green&quot; was included on a new compilation album &quot;The Absolute Best of John Williamson: 40 Years True Blue&quot;, commemorating the singer-songwriter&#x27;s milestone of 40 years in the Australian music industry.

On 2 August 2011, the third collaboration between Crowe and Doyle was released on iTunes as &quot;The Crowe/Doyle Songbook Vol III&quot;, featuring nine original songs followed by their acoustic demo counterparts (for a total of 18 tracks). Danielle Spencer does guest vocals on most tracks. The release coincided with a pair of live performances at the LSPU Hall in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. The digital album was released as download versions only on Amazon.com, iTunes, Spotify. The album has since charted at No. 72 on the Canadian Albums Chart.

On 26 September 2011, Crowe appeared onstage at Rogers Arena in Vancouver in the middle of Keith Urban&#x27;s concert. He sang a cover of &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, before joining the rest of the band in a rendition of &quot;The Joker&quot;. On 18 August 2012, Crowe appeared along with Doyle at the Harpa Concert Hall in Reykjavík, Iceland as part of the city&#x27;s Menningarnótt program.

In 2017, Crowe and Doyle had created a new act (with Samantha Barks, Scott Grimes and Carl Falk) called Indoor Garden Party who appeared on &quot;The One Show&quot; to promote their album called &quot;The Musical&quot;.

On 27 June 2023, Crowe sang in concert with his band Indoor Garden Party in Bologna at the Teatro Comunale Nouveau. The concert was very successful, completely sold out. The total proceeds from the concert were entirely donated to the flood victims of Emilia-Romagna.

== Philanthropy ==

During location filming of &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, Crowe made a donation to a Jewish elementary school whose library had been damaged as a result of arson. A note with an anti-Semitic message had been left at the scene. Crowe called school officials to express his concern and wanted his message relayed to the students. The school&#x27;s building fund received donations from throughout Canada and the amount of Crowe&#x27;s donation was not disclosed.

On another occasion, Crowe donated to a struggling primary school near his home in rural Australia. The money went towards an project to construct a swimming pool at the school. Crowe&#x27;s sympathies were sparked when a pupil drowned at the nearby Coffs Harbour beach in 2001, and he felt the pool would help students become better swimmers and improve their water safety. At the opening ceremony, he dived into the pool fully clothed as soon as it was declared open. Nana Glen principal Laurie Renshall said, &quot;The many things he does up here, people just don&#x27;t know about. We&#x27;ve been trying to get a pool for 10 years.&quot;

In August 2020, Crowe donated to a fundraiser on GoFundMe by filmmaker Amanda Bailly and journalist Richard Hall to help rebuild Le Chef, a restaurant which was destroyed in the 2020 Beirut explosion. The fundraiser aimed to raise , but it had raised approximately as of 16 August. In response to Hall noting the donation, Crowe tweeted: &quot;On behalf of Anthony Bourdain. I thought he probably would have done so if he was still around. I wish you and Le Chef the best and hope things can be put back together soon.&quot;

In June 2023, Crowe agreed with the organisers of a concert of his band Indoor Garden Party in Bologna to donate the full revenue to the victims of the Emilia-Romagna floods.

== Sport ==
=== Rugby league ===
He has been the co-owner of the National Rugby League (NRL) team South Sydney Rabbitohs since 2006; Crowe has been a supporter of the team since childhood. After his rise to fame as an actor, he has continued appearing at home games and supported the financially troubled club. Following the Super League war of the 1990s, he made an attempt to use his Hollywood connections to convince Ted Turner, a rival of Super League&#x27;s Rupert Murdoch, to save the Rabbitohs before they were forced from the NRL competition for two years. In 1999, Crowe paid at auction for the brass bell used to open the inaugural rugby league match in Australia in 1908 at a fundraiser to assist Souths&#x27; legal battle for re-inclusion in the league. In 2005, he made the Rabbitohs the first club team in Australia to be sponsored by a film, when he negotiated a deal to advertise his film &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; on their jerseys.
On 19 March 2006, the voting members of the South Sydney club voted (in a 75.8% majority) to allow Crowe and businessman Peter Holmes à Court to purchase 75% of the organisation, leaving 25% ownership with the members. It cost them , and they received four of eight seats on the board of directors. A six-part television miniseries entitled &quot;South Side Story&quot; depicting the takeover aired in Australia in 2007.
On 5 November 2006, Crowe appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; to announce that Firepower International was sponsoring the South Sydney Rabbitohs for over three years, showing viewers a Rabbitoh playing jersey with Firepower&#x27;s name emblazoned on it.

Crowe helped to organise a rugby league game that took place at the University of North Florida, in Jacksonville, Florida, between the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the 2007 Super League Grand Final winners the Leeds Rhinos on 26 January 2008 (Australia Day). Crowe told ITV Local Yorkshire the game was not a marketing exercise.
Crowe wrote a letter of apology to a Sydney newspaper following the sacking of South Sydney&#x27;s coach Jason Taylor and one of their players David Fa&#x27;alogo after a drunken altercation between the two at the end of the 2009 NRL season.
Also in 2009, Crowe persuaded young England international forward Sam Burgess to sign with the Rabbitohs over other clubs that were competing for his signature, after inviting Burgess and his mother to the set of &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, which he was filming in Britain at the time.

Crowe&#x27;s influence helped to persuade noted player Greg Inglis to renege on his deal to join the Brisbane Broncos and sign for the Rabbitohs for 2011.
In 2010, the NRL was investigating Crowe&#x27;s business relationships with a number of media and entertainment companies including Channel Nine, Channel Seven, ANZ Stadium and V8 Supercars in relation to the South Sydney Rabbitohs&#x27; salary cap.

In 2011, Souths also announced a corporate partnership with the bookmaking conglomerate Luxbet.
Previously, Crowe had been prominent in trying to prevent gambling being associated with the Rabbitohs.
In May 2011, Crowe helped arrange to have Fox broadcast the 2011 State of Origin series live for the first time in the United States, in addition to the NRL Grand Final.
In November 2012 the South Sydney Rabbitohs confirmed that Russell Crowe was selling his 37.5 per cent stake in the club.
At the Rabbitohs Annual General Meeting on 3 March 2013, Chairman Nick Pappas claimed Crowe &quot;would not be selling his shareholding in the short-to-medium term and at this stage has no intention of selling at all&quot;.

Crowe was a guest presenter at the 2013 Dally M Awards and presented the prestigious Dally M Medal to winner Cooper Cronk. Russell was present at the 2014 NRL Grand Final when the Rabbitohs won the NRL premiership for the first time in 43 years.

=== Other sporting interests ===
Two of his cousins, Martin Crowe and Jeff Crowe, captained the New Zealand national cricket team.

Crowe watches and plays cricket, and captained the &#x27;Australian&#x27; Team containing Steve Waugh against an English side in the &#x27;Hollywood Ashes&#x27; Cricket Match. On 17 July 2009, Crowe took to the commentary box for British sports channel Sky Sports as the &#x27;third man&#x27; during the second Test of the 2009 Ashes series, between England and Australia.

Crowe is a fan of the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team.

He is friends with Lloyd Carr, the former coach of the University of Michigan Wolverines American football team, and Carr used Crowe&#x27;s movie &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; to motivate his 2006 team following a 7–5 season the previous year. Upon hearing of this, Crowe called Carr and invited him to Australia to address his rugby league team, the South Sydney Rabbitohs, which Carr did the following summer. In September 2007, after Carr came under fire following the Wolverines&#x27; 0–2 start, Crowe travelled to Ann Arbor, Michigan for the Wolverines&#x27; 15 September game against Notre Dame to show his support for Carr. He addressed the team before the game and watched from the sidelines as the Wolverines defeated the Irish 38–0.
Crowe is also a fan of the National Football League. On 22 October 2007, Crowe appeared in the booth of a Monday night game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars.

He is also a fan of Leeds United and narrated the Amazon Prime documentary &quot;Take Us Home: Leeds United&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1989, Crowe met Australian singer Danielle Spencer while working on the film &quot;The Crossing&quot; and the two began an on-again, off-again relationship. In 2000, he became romantically involved with American actress Meg Ryan while working on their film &quot;Proof of Life&quot;. In 2001, Crowe and Spencer reconciled, and they married two years later in April 2003. The wedding took place at Crowe&#x27;s cattle property in Nana Glen, New South Wales, with the ceremony taking place on Crowe&#x27;s 39th birthday. The couple have two sons: Charles Spencer Crowe (born 21 December 2003) and Tennyson Spencer Crowe (born 7 July 2006). In October 2012, it was reported that Crowe and Spencer had separated. They divorced in April 2018.
A longtime resident of Nana Glen, Crowe is well known in the community and is a frequent patron of the local rugby games. During the Australian bushfires in 2019 and 2020, he raised over for the NSW RFS by selling his South Sydney Rabbitohs hat in an online auction.

On 9 March 2005, Crowe revealed to &quot;GQ&quot; magazine that prior to him attending the 73rd Academy Awards, FBI agents had approached him and told him that the terrorist group al-Qaeda wanted to kidnap him. He recalled, &quot;It was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either Libya or Algiers... it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural destabilisation plan.&quot;

At the beginning of 2009, Crowe appeared in a series of Australian special-edition postage stamps called &quot;Legends of the Screen&quot;, featuring Australian actors. Crowe, Geoffrey Rush, Cate Blanchett, and Nicole Kidman each appear twice in the series, once as themselves and once as their Academy Award-nominated character. Crowe is the only non-Australian to appear in the stamps.

In June 2010, Crowe, who started smoking when he was 10, announced he had quit for the sake of his two sons. In November, he told David Letterman that he had smoked more than 60 cigarettes a day for 36 years, and that he had &quot;fallen off the wagon&quot; the night before the interview and smoked heavily. 

=== Ambassador of Rome in the world ===
On 20 December 2022, Crowe was appointed by the mayor of Rome to be its ambassador of Rome in the world.
On the day of the appointment, Crowe declared that it would be important to host the next FIFA World Cup in Italy.

In July 2023, on holiday in Italy visiting the archaeological site of Ostia Antica, to please fans of &quot;Gladiator&quot;, including those who asked about the sequel, Crowe pretended to have a phone conversation with Cicero, servant of Crowe&#x27;s character Maximus. &#x27;Max&#x27; asks Cicero where the men are, why they have gone away, then says he understands why: &quot;I&#x27;m dead... It&#x27;s perfectly understandable.&quot;
===Political views===
Crowe has supported the Australian Labor Party (ALP). He endorsed former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard in June 2013, and narrated an advertisement for the Labor Party&#x27;s election campaign in May 2022. Crowe has been an outspoken critic of Australia&#x27;s immigration detention facilities, describing them as &quot;a nation&#x27;s shame&quot; and &quot;fucking disgraceful&quot;. In November 2017, Crowe offered to resettle displaced refugees who were held in Australia&#x27;s offshore detention facility on Manus Island.

=== Altercations ===

Between 1999 and 2005, Crowe was involved in four altercations, which gave him a reputation for having a bad temper.

In 1999, Crowe was involved in an altercation with a woman at the Plantation Hotel in Coffs Harbour, in which he was caught on a security camera kissing a man trying to placate him. Two men were acquitted of using the video in an attempt to blackmail him.

In 2002, when part of Crowe&#x27;s appearance at that year&#x27;s BAFTA Awards was cut out to fit into the BBC&#x27;s tape-delayed broadcast, Crowe used strong language during an argument with producer Malcolm Gerrie. The part cut was a Patrick Kavanagh poem in tribute to actor Richard Harris, which was cut for copyright reasons. Crowe later apologised, saying, &quot;What I said to him may have been a little bit more passionate than now, in the cold light of day, I would have liked it to have been.&quot; 

Later in 2002, Crowe was alleged to have been involved in a brawl with businessman Eric Watson inside the London branch of Zuma, a Japanese restaurant chainthe fight was broken up by English actor Ross Kemp.

In June 2005, Crowe was arrested and charged with second-degree assault by the NYPD after he threw a telephone at the concierge of the Mercer Hotel who had refused to help him place a call when the system did not work from Crowe&#x27;s room. He was also charged with fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon (the telephone). The concierge was treated for a facial laceration. After his arrest, Crowe underwent a perp walk, a procedure customary in New York City, exposing the handcuffed suspect to the news media to take pictures. This procedure was under discussion as potentially violating Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Crowe later described the incident as &quot;possibly the most shameful situation that I&#x27;ve ever gotten myself in&quot;. Crowe pleaded guilty and was conditionally discharged. Before the trial, he settled a lawsuit filed by the concierge, Nestor Estrada. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but amounts in the six-figure range have been reported.

The telephone incident had a generally negative impact on Crowe&#x27;s public image, an example of negative public relations in the mass media, although Crowe had made a point of befriending Australian journalists in an effort to influence his image. The &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;The New Terrance and Phillip Movie Trailer&quot; revolves around a lampooning of his aggressive tendencies. Crowe commented on the ongoing media coverage in November 2010, during an interview with American television talk show host and journalist Charlie Rose: &quot;I think it indelibly changed me. It was a very, very minor situation that was made into something outrageous. More violence perpetuated me walking between the car to the courtroom with the waiting media than anything I&#x27;d done ... it very definitely affected me ... psychologically.&quot;

In October 2016, Azealia Banks filed a police report against Crowe, claiming that he choked and spat at her before proceeding to call her the n-word during a party in his hotel suite. However, the Los Angeles District Attorney&#x27;s office dropped the case in December. RZA supported Banks’ claims the following year during an interview with &quot;The Breakfast Club&quot;, but also condemned her alleged &quot;obnoxious and erratic&quot; behaviour. Crowe has claimed that he removed Banks from the premises because she had threatened to physically assault other attendees.

<text>Robert Musil (; 6 November 1880 – 15 April 1942) was an Austrian philosophical writer. His unfinished novel, &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; (), is generally considered to be one of the most important and influential modernist novels.

==Family==
Musil was born in Klagenfurt, Carinthia, the son of engineer Alfred &quot;Edler&quot; Musil (1846, Temeswar/Timișoara – 1924) and his wife Hermine Bergauer (1853, Linz – 1924). The orientalist Alois Musil (&quot;The Czech Lawrence&quot;) was his second cousin.

Soon after his birth, the family moved to Komotau/Chomutov in Bohemia, and in 1891 Musil&#x27;s father was appointed to the chair of Mechanical Engineering at the German Technical University in Brünn/Brno and, later, he was raised to hereditary nobility in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was baptized &quot;Robert Mathias Musil&quot; and his name was officially &quot;Robert Mathias Edler von Musil&quot; from 22 October 1917, when his father was ennobled (made &quot;Edler&quot;), until 3 April 1919, when the use of noble titles was forbidden in Austria.

==Early life==

Musil was short in stature, but strong and skilled at wrestling, and by his early teens, he proved to be more than his parents could handle. They sent him to a military boarding school at Eisenstadt (1892–1894) and then Hranice (1894–1897). The school experiences are reflected in his first novel &quot;Die Verwirrungen des Zöglings Törless&quot; (&quot;The Confusions of Young Törless&quot;).

==Youth and studies==
After graduation Musil studied at a military academy in Vienna during the fall of 1897, but then switched to mechanical engineering, joining his father&#x27;s department at the Technical University in Brno. During his university studies, he studied engineering by day, and at night, read literature and philosophy and went to the theatre and art exhibitions. Friedrich Nietzsche, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Ernst Mach were particular interests of his university years. Musil finished his studies in three years and, in 1902–1903, served as an unpaid assistant to Professor of Mechanical Engineering , in Stuttgart. During that time, he began work on &quot;Young Törless&quot;.

He also invented , the Musil color top, a motorised device for producing mixed colours by additive colour-mixing with two differently colored, sectored, rotating discs. This was an improvement over earlier models, allowing a user to vary the proportions of the two colors during rotation and to read off those proportions precisely.

Musil&#x27;s sexual life around the turn of the century, according to his own records, was mainly with a prostitute, which he treated partly as an experimental self-experience. But he also was infatuated with the pianist and mountaineer Valerie Hilpert, who assumed mystical features. 
In March 1902, Musil underwent treatment for syphilis with mercury ointment. During this time, his several years of relationship began with Hermine Dietz, the &#x27;Tonka&#x27; of his own novel, published in 1923. Hermine&#x27;s syphilitic miscarriage in 1906 and her death in 1907 may have been due to infection from Musil.

Musil grew tired of engineering and what he perceived as the limited world-view of the engineer. He launched himself into a new round of doctoral studies (1903–1908) in psychology and philosophy at the University of Berlin under Professor Carl Stumpf. In 1905, Musil met his future wife, Martha Marcovaldi (née Heimann, 21 January 1874 – 6 November 1949). She had been widowed and remarried, with two children, and was seven years older than Musil. His first novel, &quot;Young Törless&quot;, was published in 1906.

==Author==
In 1909, Musil completed his doctorate, with a thesis on the philosopher Ernst Mach, and Professor Alexius Meinong offered him a position at the University of Graz, which he turned down to concentrate on writing. Over the next two years, he wrote and published two stories, (&quot;The Temptation of Quiet Veronica&quot; and &quot;The Perfecting of a Love&quot;) collected in &quot;Vereinigungen&quot; (&quot;Unions&quot;) published in 1911. During the same year, Martha&#x27;s divorce was completed, and Musil married her. As she was Jewish and Musil Roman Catholic, they both converted to Protestantism as a sign of their union. Until then, Musil had been supported by his family, but he now found employment first as a librarian in the Technical University of Vienna and then in an editorial role with the Berlin literary journal &quot;Die neue Rundschau&quot;. He also worked on a play entitled &quot;Die Schwärmer&quot; (&quot;The Enthusiasts&quot;), which was published in 1921.
When World War I began, Musil joined the army and was stationed first in Tirol and then at Austria&#x27;s Supreme Army Command in Bozen (ital. Bolzano). In 1916, Musil visited Prague and met Franz Kafka, whose work he held in high esteem. After the end of the war and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Musil returned to his literary career in Vienna. He published a collection of short stories, &quot;Drei Frauen&quot; (&quot;Three Women&quot;), in 1924. He also admired the Bohemian poet Rainer Maria Rilke, whom Musil called &quot;great and not always understood&quot; at his memorial service in 1927 in Berlin. According to Musil, Rilke &quot;did nothing but perfect the German poem for the first time&quot;, but by the time of his death, Rilke had turned into &quot;a delicate, well-matured liqueur suitable for grown-up ladies&quot;. However, his work is &quot;too demanding&quot; to be &quot;considered relaxing&quot;.

In 1930 and 1933, his masterpiece, &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; (&quot;Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften&quot;) was published in Berlin in two volumes consisting of three parts, running into 1,074 pages: Volume 1 (Part I: A Sort of Introduction, and Part II: The Like of It Now Happens) and 605-page unfinished Volume 2 (Part III: Into the Millennium (The Criminals)). Part III did not include the 20 chapters withdrawn from Volume 2 of 1933 in printer&#x27;s galley proofs. The novel deals with the moral and intellectual decline of the Austro-Hungarian Empire through the eyes of the book&#x27;s protagonist, Ulrich, an ex-mathematician who has failed to engage with the world around him in a manner that would allow him to possess &quot;qualities&quot;. It is set in Vienna on the eve of World War I.

&quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; brought Musil only mediocre commercial success. Although he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, he felt that he did not receive the recognition he deserved. He sometimes expressed annoyance at the success of better known colleagues such as Thomas Mann or Hermann Broch, who admired his work deeply and tried to shield him from economic difficulties and encouraged his writing even though Musil initially was critical of Mann.

In the early 1920s, Musil lived mostly in Berlin. In Vienna, Musil was a frequent visitor to Eugenie Schwarzwald&#x27;s salon (the model for Diotima in &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot;). In 1932, the Robert Musil Society was founded in Berlin on the initiative of Mann. In the same year, Mann was asked to name outstanding contemporary novels, and he cited only one, &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot;. In 1936, Musil suffered his first stroke, while swimming.

== Thought ==
The fundamental problem Musil confronts in his essays and fiction is the crisis of Enlightenment values that engulfed Europe during the early twentieth century. He endorses the Enlightenment project of emancipation, while at the same time examining its shortcomings with a questioning irony. Musil believed that the crisis required a renewal in social and individual values that, accepting science and reason, could liberate humanity in beneficent ways. Musil wrote:After the Enlightenment most of us lost courage. A minor failure was enough to turn us away from reason, and we allowed every barren enthusiast to inveigh against the intentions of a d&#x27;Alembert or a Diderot as mere rationalism. We beat the drums for feeling against intellect and forgot that without intellect ... feeling is as dense as a blockhead (&quot;dick wie ein Mops ist&quot;).

He took aim at the ideological chaos and misleading generalizations about culture and society promoted by nationalist reactionaries. Musil wrote a withering critique of Oswald Spengler entitled &quot;Mind and Experience: a Note for Readers Who Have Escaped the Decline of the West (&quot;Geist und Erfahrung: Anmerkung für Leser, welche dem Untergang des Abendlandes entronnen sind&quot;)&quot;, in which he dismantles the latter&#x27;s misunderstanding of science and misuse of axiomatic thinking, to try to understand human complexity and promote a deterministic philosophy.

He deplored the social conditions under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and foresaw its disappearance. Surveying the upheavals of the 1910s and 1920s, Musil hoped that Europe could find an internationalist solution to the &quot;dead end of imperial nationalism&quot;. In 1927, he signed a declaration of support for the Austrian Social Democratic Party.

Musil was a staunch individualist who opposed the authoritarianism of both right and left. A recurring theme in his speeches and essays through the 1930s is the defense of the autonomy of the individual against the authoritarian and collectivist ideas then prevailing in Germany, Italy, Austria, and Russia. He participated in the anti-fascist International Writers&#x27; Congress for the Defense of Culture in 1935 in which he spoke in favor of artistic independence against the claims of the state, class, nation, and religion.

== Later life ==
The last years of Musil&#x27;s life were dominated by Nazism and World War II: the Nazis banned his books. He saw early Nazism first-hand while he was living in Berlin from 1931 to 1933. In 1938, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany, Musil and his Jewish wife, Martha, left for exile in Switzerland, where he died at the age of 61. Martha wrote to Franz Theodor Csokor that he had suffered a stroke.

Only eight people attended his cremation. Martha cast his ashes into the woods of Mont Salève. From 1933 to his death, Musil had been working on Part III of &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot;. In 1943 in Lausanne, Martha published a 462-page collection of material from his literary remains, including the 20 galley chapters withdrawn from Part III before Volume 2 appeared in 1933, as well as drafts of the final incomplete chapters and notes on the development and direction of the novel. She died in Rome in 1949.

==Legacy==
After his death, Musil&#x27;s work was almost forgotten. His writings began to reappear during the early 1950s. The first translation of &quot;The Man Without Qualities&quot; in English was published by Ernst Kaiser and Eithne Wilkins in 1953, 1954, and 1960. An updated translation by Sophie Wilkins and Burton Pike, containing extensive selections from unpublished drafts, appeared in 1995.
Musil&#x27;s work, including its philosophical aspects, has received more attention since then. Milan Kundera said, &quot;No novelist is dearer to me,&quot; and Thomas Bernhard said he was &quot;addicted&quot; to Musil. One of the most important philosophy journals, &quot;The Monist&quot;, published a special issue on &quot;The Philosophy of Robert Musil&quot; in 2014, edited by Bence Nanay.

<text>Russia () is the largest country in the world, covering over , and encompassing more than one-eighth of Earth&#x27;s inhabited land area. Russia extends across eleven time zones, and has the most borders of any country in the world, with sixteen sovereign nations.

Russia is a transcontinental country, stretching vastly over two continents, Europe and Asia. It spans the northernmost edge of Eurasia, and has the world&#x27;s fourth-longest coastline, at . Russia, alongside Canada and the United States, is one of only three countries with a coast along three oceans (however connection to the Atlantic Ocean is extremely remote), due to which it has links with over thirteen marginal seas. It lies between latitudes 41° and 82° N, and longitudes 19° E and 169° W. Russia is larger than three continents of the world and has about the same surface area as Pluto. Russia encompasses, by far, the largest forest area of any country in the world.

==Global position and boundaries==
Kaliningrad Oblast, westernmost part of Russia along the Baltic Sea, is about apart from its easternmost part, Big Diomede Island in the Bering Strait. From north to south, the country ranges from the northern tip of the Russian Arctic islands at Franz Josef Land to the southern tip of the Republic of Dagestan on the Caspian Sea, spanning about of extremely varied, often inhospitable terrain.

Extending for , the Russian border is the world&#x27;s longest. Along the land frontier, Russia has boundaries with 14 countries: Poland and Lithuania (both via Kaliningrad Oblast), Norway, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, China, Mongolia, and North Korea.

Approximately two-thirds of the frontier is bounded by seawater. Virtually all of the lengthy northern coast is well above the Arctic Circle; except for the port of Murmansk—which receives currents that are somewhat warmer than would be expected at that latitude, due to the effects of the Gulf Stream—that coast is locked in ice much of the year. Thirteen seas and parts of two oceans—the Arctic and Pacific—wash Russian shores. It is separated by close sea, making it a maritime boundary. It also shares one with Japan.

==Administrative and territorial divisions==

With a few changes of status, most of the Soviet Union&#x27;s administrative and territorial divisions of the Russian Republic were retained in constituting the Russian Federation. As of 2014, there were eighty-five administrative territorial divisions (called federal subjects): twenty-two republics, nine krais (territories), forty-six oblasts (provinces), one autonomous oblast, four autonomous okrugs, and three cities with federal status, namely the cities of Moscow, Saint Petersburg, and Sevastopol.

The republics include a wide variety of peoples, including northern Europeans, Tatars, Caucasus peoples, and indigenous Siberians. The largest federal subjects are in Siberia. Located in east-central Siberia, the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) is the largest federal subject in the country (and the largest country subdivision in the world), twice the size of Alaska. Second in size is Krasnoyarsk Krai, located west of Sakha in Siberia. Kaliningrad Oblast, which is a noncontiguous constituent entity of Russia, is the smallest oblast. The is both the smallest republic and the smallest federal subject of Russia except for the three federal cities. The two most populous federal subjects, Moscow Oblast (with Moscow) and Krasnodar Krai, are in European Russia.

==Human geography==
=== Demographics ===

Russia had a population of 142.8 million according to the 2010 census, which rose to 146.2 million as of 2021 following the annexation of Crimea in 2014. It is the most populous country in Europe, and the ninth-most populous country in the world; with a population density of .

=== Urban areas ===
Russia is one of the world&#x27;s most urbanized countries, with roughly 75% of its total population living in urban areas. Moscow, the capital and largest city, has a population estimated at 12.4 million residents within the city limits, while over 17 million residents in the urban area, and over 20 million residents in the metropolitan area. Moscow is among the world&#x27;s largest cities, being the most populous city entirely within Europe, the most populous urban area in Europe, the most populous metropolitan area in Europe, and also the largest city by land area on the European continent. Saint Petersburg, the cultural capital, is the second-largest city, with a population of roughly 5.4 million inhabitants. Other major urban areas are Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Chelyabinsk.
==Physiography and hydrography==
Geographers traditionally divide the vast territory of Russia into five natural zones: the tundra zone; the Taiga, or forest, zone; the steppe, or plains, zone; the arid zone; and the mountain zone. Most of Russia consists of two plains (the East European Plain and the West Siberian Plain), three lowlands (the North Siberian, the Central Yakutian and the East Siberian), two plateaus (the Central Siberian Plateau and the Lena Plateau), and two systems of mountainous areas (the East Siberian Mountains in far northeastern Siberia and the South Siberian Mountains along the southern border).

===Ecoregions===

====East European plain====
The East European Plain encompasses most of European Russia. The West Siberian Plain, which is the world&#x27;s largest, extends east from the Urals to the Yenisei River. Because the terrain and vegetation are relatively uniform in each of the natural zones, Russia presents an illusion of uniformity. Nevertheless, Russian territory contains all the major vegetation zones of the world except a tropical rain forest. 

====Icecaps====

The Russian Arctic stretches for close to west to east, from Karelia and the Kola Peninsula to Nenetsia, the Gulf of Ob, the Taymyr Peninsula and the Chukchi Peninsula (Kolyma, Anadyr River, Cape Dezhnev). Russian islands and archipelagos in the Arctic Sea include Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, and the New Siberian Islands.

About 10 percent of Russia is tundra—a treeless, marshy plain. The tundra is Russia&#x27;s northernmost zone, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Bering Strait in the east, then running south along the Pacific coast to the northern Kamchatka Peninsula. The zone is known for its herds of wild reindeer, for so-called white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and for days of total darkness in winter. The long, harsh winters and lack of sunshine allow only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although several powerful Siberian rivers traverse this zone as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean, partial and intermittent thawing hamper drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps of the tundra. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, gradually shaping a landscape that was severely modified by glaciation in the last ice age. Less than one percent of Russia&#x27;s population lives in this zone. The fishing and port industries of the northwestern Kola Peninsula and the huge oil and gas fields of northwestern Siberia are the largest employers in the tundra. With a population of 180,000, the industrial frontier city of Norilsk is third in population to Murmansk and Arkhangelsk among Russia&#x27;s settlements above the Arctic Circle. From here you can also see the auroras (northern lights).

====Taiga====
Taiga, the most extensive natural area of Russia, stretches from the western borders of Russia to the Pacific. It occupies the territory of the Eastern Europe and West Siberian plains to the north of ° N and most of the territory east of Yenisei River taiga forests reach the southern borders of Russia in Siberia taiga only accounts for over 60% of Russia. In the north–south direction the eastern taiga is divided (east of the Yenisei River), with a continental climate, and west, with a milder climate, in general, the climate zone is moist, moderately warm (cool in the north) in the summer and harsh winter, there is a steady snow cover in the winter. In the latitudinal direction, the taiga is divided into three subzones - northern, middle and southern taiga. In the western taiga dense spruce and fir forests on wetlands alternate with pine forests, shrubs, and meadows on the lighter soils. Such vegetation is typical of the eastern taiga, but it plays an important role not fir and larch. Coniferous forest, however, does not form a continuous array and sparse areas of birch, alder, willow (mainly in river valleys), the wetlands - marshes. Within the taiga are widespread fur-bearing animals - sable, marten, ermine, moose, brown bear, Wolverine, wolf, and muskrat.
In the taiga is dominated by podzolic and cryogenic taiga soils, characterized by clearly defined horizontal structure (only in the southern taiga there is sod-podzolic soil). Formed in a leaching regime and in poor humus. Groundwater is normally found in the forest close to the surface, washing calcium from the upper layers, resulting in the top layer of soil of the taiga being discolored and oxidized. Few areas of the taiga, suitable for farming, are located mainly in the European part of Russia. Large areas are occupied by sphagnum marshes (here is dominated by podzolic-boggy soil). To enrich the soil for agricultural purposes lime and other fertilizers should be used.

Russian Taiga has the world&#x27;s largest reserves of coniferous wood, but from year to year - as a result of intensive logging - they decrease. Development of hunting, farming (mainly in river valleys).

====Mixed and deciduous forests====
The mixed and deciduous forest belt is triangular, widest along the western border and narrower towards the Ural Mountains. The main trees are Oak and Spruce, but many other growths of vegetation such as ash, aspen, birch, hornbeam, maple, and pine reside there. Separating the taiga from the wooded steppe is a narrow belt of birch and aspen woodland located east of the Urals as far as the Altay Mountains. Much of the forested zone has been cleared for agriculture, especially in European Russia. Wildlife is more scarce as a result of this, but the roe deer, wolf, fox, and squirrel are very common.

====Steppe====
The steppe has long been depicted as the typical Russian landscape. It is a broad band of treeless, grassy plains, interrupted by mountain ranges, extending from Hungary across Ukraine, southern Russia, and Kazakhstan before ending in Manchuria. In a country of extremes, the steppe zone provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture because of its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture. Even here, however, agricultural yields are sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts. The soil is very dry.

===Topography===
Russia&#x27;s mountain ranges are located principally along its continental dip (the Ural Mountains), along the southwestern border (the Caucasus), along the border with Mongolia (the eastern and western Sayan Mountains and the western extremity of the Altay Mountains), and in eastern Siberia (a complex system of ranges in the northeastern corner of the country and forming the spine of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and lesser mountains extending along the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan). Russia has nine major mountain ranges. In general, the eastern half of the country is much more mountainous than the western half, the interior of which is dominated by low plains. The traditional dividing line between the east and the west is the Yenisei River valley. In delineating the western edge of the Central Siberian Plateau from the West Siberian Plain, the Yenisey runs from near the Mongolian border northward into the Arctic Ocean west of the Taymyr Peninsula.

====Ural Mountains====


The Ural Mountains form the natural boundary between Europe and Asia; the range extends about from the Arctic Ocean to the northern border of Kazakhstan. Several low passes provide major transportation routes through the Urals eastward from Europe. The highest 
peak, Mount Narodnaya, is . The Urals also contain valuable deposits of minerals.

====West Siberian Plain====


To the east of the Urals is the West Siberian Plain, stretching about from west to east and about from north to south. With more than half its territory below in elevation, the plain contains some of the world&#x27;s largest swamps and floodplains. The plain is largely flat and featureless. The only slightly elevated areas are the Siberian Uvaly across the central part and the Ob Plateau in the south. There are steppe areas in the southern part reaching into Kazakhstan, such as the Ishim Steppe with the Kamyshlov Log trench. Most of the plain&#x27;s population lives in the drier section south of 77 degrees north latitude.

====Central Siberian plateau====
The region directly east of the West Siberian Plain is the Central Siberian Plateau, which extends eastward from the Yenisei River valley to the Lena River valley. The region is divided into several plateaus, with elevations ranging between ; the highest elevation is about , in the northern Putoran Mountains. The plain is bounded on the south by the Primorsky Range and the Baikal Mountains, and on the north by the North Siberian Lowland, an extension of the West Siberian Plain extending into the Taymyr Peninsula on the Arctic Ocean.

====Sayan and Stanovoy Mountains====
In the mountain system west of Lake Baikal in south-central Siberia, the highest elevations are in the Western Sayan, in the Eastern Sayan, and at Belukha Mountain in the Altay Mountains. The Eastern Sayan reach nearly to the southern shore of Lake Baikal; at the lake, there is an elevation difference of more than between the nearest mountain, high, and the deepest part of the lake, which is below sea level. The mountain systems east of Lake Baikal are lower, forming a complex of minor ranges and valleys that reaches from the lake to the Pacific coast. The maximum height of the Stanovoy Range, which runs west to east from northern Lake Baikal to the Sea of Okhotsk, is . To the south of that range is southeastern Siberia, whose mountains reach . Across the Strait of Tartary from that region is Sakhalin Island, Russia&#x27;s largest island, where the highest elevation is about . The small Moneron Island, the site of the shootdown of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, is found to its west.

====Caucasus Mountains====
Truly alpine terrain appears in the southern mountain ranges. Between the Black and Caspian seas, the Caucasus Mountains rise to impressive heights, forming a boundary between Europe and Asia. One of the peaks, Mount Elbrus, is the highest point in Europe, at . The geological structure of the Caucasus extends to the northwest as the Crimean and Carpathian Mountains and southeastward into Central Asia as the Tian Shan and Pamirs. The Caucasus Mountains create an imposing natural barrier between Russia and its neighbors to the southwest, Georgia and Azerbaijan.

====Northeast Siberia and Kamchatka====
Northeastern Siberia, north of the Stanovoy Range, is an extremely mountainous region. The long Kamchatka Peninsula, which juts southward into the Sea of Okhotsk, includes many volcanic peaks, some of which are still active. The highest is the Klyuchevskaya Sopka, the highest point in the Russian Far East. The volcanic chain continues from the southern tip of Kamchatka southward through the Kuril Islands chain and into Japan. Kamchatka also is one of Russia&#x27;s two centers of seismic activity (the other is the Caucasus). In 1995, a major earthquake largely destroyed the oil-processing town of Neftegorsk. Also located in this region is the very large Beyenchime-Salaatin crater.

===Drainage===
Russia, home to over 100,000 rivers, is divided into twenty watershed districts. It has one of the world&#x27;s largest surface water resources, with its lakes containing approximately one-quarter of the world&#x27;s liquid fresh water. Russia is second only to Brazil by total renewable water resources.

Forty of Russia&#x27;s rivers longer than are east of the Ural Mountains, including the three major rivers that drain Siberia as they flow northward to the Arctic Ocean: the Irtysh-Ob system (totaling ), the Yenisey (), and the Lena (), they are among the world&#x27;s longest rivers. The basins of those river systems cover about , discharging nearly 50,000 cubic meters of water per second () into the Arctic Ocean. The northward flow of these rivers means that source areas thaw before the areas downstream, creating vast swamps such as the Vasyugan Swamp in the center of the West Siberian Plain. The same is true of other river systems, including the Pechora and the Northern Dvina in western Russia, and the Kolyma and the Indigirka in Siberia. Approximately 10 percent of Russian territory is classified as swampland.

Russia&#x27;s inland bodies of water are chiefly a legacy of extensive glaciation. Ladoga and Onega in northwestern Russia are two of the largest lakes in Europe. However, Lake Baikal is the largest and most prominent among Russia&#x27;s fresh water bodies, is the world&#x27;s deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water lake, containing over one-fifth of the world&#x27;s fresh surface water. Numerous smaller lakes dot northern Russia and Siberian plains. The largest of these are lakes Belozero, Topozero, Vygozero, and Ilmen in the country&#x27;s northwest and Lake Chany in southwestern Siberia.

A number of other rivers drain Siberia from eastern mountain ranges into the Pacific Ocean. The Amur River and its main tributary, the Ussuri, form a long stretch of the winding boundary between Russia and China. The Amur system drains most of southeastern Siberia. Three basins drain European Russia. The Dnieper, which flows mainly through Belarus and Ukraine, has its headwaters in the hills west of Moscow. The Don, which is the fifth-longest river in Europe, originates in the Central Russian Upland south of Moscow and then flows into the Sea of Azov at Rostov-on-Don. The Volga, widely seen as Russia&#x27;s national river due to its historical and cultural importance, is the longest river in Europe, it rises in the Valdai Hills west of Moscow and meandering southeastward for before emptying into the Caspian Sea. Altogether, the Volga system drains about . Linked by several canals, western Russia&#x27;s rivers long have been a vital transportation system; the Volga remains the country&#x27;s most commercial river, and carries about two-thirds of Russia&#x27;s inland water traffic.

== Agriculture geography ==
One billion acres of land is arable in Russia, but only about 0.1 percent is permanent agriculture. The landscapes of region have extremely varied environments because of the following:

*Tundra landscapes cover most of the region, where conditions are harsh because of the cold climates, and plant life is not very well supported to grow because of the harsh conditions. This has become a problem, as the unfavorable conditions make agriculture more difficult.
*Mountain ranges are spread through the region, such as the Ural Mountains, which have become the dividing line between European Russia and Eurasian Russia. 
*European Russia also has the European plains which extend about .

The workforce involved in agriculture workforce was reported to be about 9.4% of the population in 2016.

The main export of Russia is grain, which is about 6% of the world trade. Other exported products include fish and oil with 3%, meals with 2%, and meat which accounts for less than 1%.

=== Pre-industrial agriculture ===
Agriculture has always been important for Russia. The land was worked by its peasant class.

===Climate===
The sheer size of Russia and the remoteness of many areas from the sea result in the dominance of the humid continental climate, which is prevalent in all parts of the country except for the tundra and the extreme southwest. Mountains in the south and east obstruct the flow of warm air masses from the Indian and Pacific oceans, while the plain of the west and north makes the country open to Arctic and Atlantic influences.
Most of Northwest Russia and Siberia has a subarctic climate, with extremely severe winters in the inner regions of Northeast Siberia (mostly Sakha, where the Northern Pole of Cold is located with the record low temperature of ), and more moderate winters elsewhere. Russia&#x27;s vast stretch of land along the Arctic Ocean and the Russian Arctic islands have a polar climate.

The coastal part of Krasnodar Krai on the Black Sea, most notably Sochi, and some coastal and interior strips of the North Caucasus possess a humid subtropical climate with mild and wet winters. In many regions of East Siberia and the Russian Far East, winter is dry compared to summer; while other parts of the country experience more even precipitation across seasons. Winter precipitation in most parts of the country usually falls as snow. The westernmost parts of Kaliningrad Oblast on the Vistula Spit, and some parts in the south of Krasnodar Krai and the North Caucasus have an oceanic climate. The region along the Lower Volga and Caspian Sea coast, as well as some southernmost silvers of Siberia, possess a semi-arid climate and an arid climate.

Throughout much of the territory, there are only two distinct seasons—winter and summer—as spring and autumn are usually brief periods of change between extremely low and extremely high temperatures. The coldest month is January (February on the coastline); the warmest is usually July. Great ranges of temperature are typical. In winter, temperatures get colder both from south to north and from west to east. Summers can be quite hot, even in Siberia.

==Natural resources and land use==

Russia holds the greatest reserves of mineral resources of any country in the world. Though they are abundant, they are in remote areas with extreme climates, making them expensive to mine. The country is the most abundant in mineral fuels. It may hold as much as half of the world&#x27;s coal reserves and even larger reserves of petroleum. Deposits of coal are scattered throughout the region, but the largest are located in central and eastern Siberia. The most developed fields lie in western Siberia, in the northeastern European region, in the area around Moscow, and in the Urals. The major petroleum deposits are located in western Siberia and in the Volga-Urals. Smaller deposits are found throughout the country. Natural gas, a resource of which Russia holds around forty percent of the world&#x27;s reserves, can be found along Siberia&#x27;s Arctic coast, in the North Caucasus, and in northwestern Russia. Major iron-ore deposits are located south of Moscow, near the Ukrainian border in the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly; this area contains vast deposits of iron ore that have caused a deviation in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. There are smaller deposits in other parts of the country. The Ural mountains hold small deposits of manganese. nickel, tungsten, cobalt, molybdenum and other iron alloying elements occur in adequate quantities.

Russia also contains most of the nonferrous metals. Aluminium ores are scarce and are found primarily in the Ural region, northwestern European Russia, and south-central Siberia. Copper is more abundant and major reserves are located in the Urals, the Norilsk area near the mouth of the Yenisey in eastern Siberia, and the Kola Peninsula. Another vast deposit located east of Lake Baikal only became exploited when the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM) railroad was finished in 1989.

The North Caucasus, far eastern Russia, and the western edge of the Kuznetsk Basin in southern Siberia contain an abundance of lead and zinc ores. These are commonly found along with copper, gold, silver, and a large amount of other rare metals. The country has one of the largest gold reserves in the world; mostly in Siberia and the Urals. Mercury deposits can be found in the central and southern Urals and in south-central Siberia.

Raw materials are abundant as well, including potassium and magnesium salt deposits in the Kama River region of the western Urals. Russia also contains one of the world&#x27;s largest deposits of apatite found in the central Kola Peninsula. Rock salt is located in the southwestern Urals and the southwest of Lake Baikal. Surface deposits of salt are found in salt lakes along the lower Volga Valley. Sulfur can be found in the Urals and the middle Volga Valley.

Eight percent of the land is used for arable farming, four percent—for permanent pastures, forty-six percent of the land is forests and woodland, and forty-two percent is used for other purposes.

A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were of tidal flats in Russia, making it the 33rd ranked country in terms of tidal flat area.

==Natural hazards==
Volcanic activity in the Kuril Islands and volcanoes and earthquakes on the Kamchatka Peninsula are other natural hazards.
