<text>The Romani people ( or ), also known as the Roma (: Rom), are an Indo-Aryan ethnic group who traditionally lived a nomadic, itinerant lifestyle. Linguistic and genetic evidence suggests that the Romani people originated in the Indian subcontinent, in particular the region of Rajasthan. Their first wave of westward migration is believed to have occurred sometime between the 5th and 11th centuries. They are thought to have first arrived in Europe sometime between the 9th and 14th centuries. Although they are widely dispersed, their most concentrated populations are believed to be in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia.

In the English language, Romani people have long been known by the exonym Gypsies or Gipsies, which many Roma consider to be an ethnic slur. The attendees of the first World Romani Congress in 1971 unanimously voted to reject the use of all exonyms for the Roma, including &quot;Gypsy&quot;. However, it is the group&#x27;s common name amongst Romani people in the United Kingdom.

Romani slaves were first shipped to the Americas with Columbus in 1498. Spain sent Romani slaves to their Louisiana colony between 1762 and 1800. An Afro-Romani community exists in St. Martin Parish due to intermarriage between freed African American and Romani slaves. The Romani population in the United States is estimated at more than one million. There are between 800,000 and 1million Roma in Brazil, most of whose ancestors emigrated in the 19th century from Eastern Europe. Brazilian Roma are mostly descended from German/Italian Sinti (in the South/Southeast regions), and Roma and Calon people. Brazil also includes a notable Romani community descended from Sinti and Roma deportees from the Portuguese Empire during the Portuguese Inquisition. Since the late 19th century, Roma have also migrated to other countries in South America and Canada.

The Romani language is an Indo-Aryan language with strong Balkan influence. It is divided into several dialects, which together are estimated to have over 2 million speakers. Because the language has traditionally been oral, many Roma are native speakers of the dominant language in their country of residence, or else of mixed languages that combine the dominant language with a dialect of Romani in varieties sometimes called para-Romani.

== Names ==
=== Romani-language endonyms ===
&quot;Rom&quot; literally means husband in the Romani language, with the plural &quot;Roma&quot;. The feminine of &quot;Rom&quot; in the Romani language is &quot;Romni/Romli/Romnije or Romlije&quot;. However, in most other languages &quot;Rom&quot; is now used for individuals regardless of gender. It has the variants &quot;dom&quot; and &quot;lom&quot;, which may be related to the Sanskrit words &quot;dam-pati&quot; (lord of the house, husband), &quot;dama&quot; (to subdue), &quot;lom&quot; (hair), &quot;lomaka&quot; (hairy), &quot;loman&quot;, &quot;roman&quot; (hairy), &quot;romaça&quot; (man with beard and long hair). Another possible origin is from Sanskrit डोम &quot;doma&quot; (member of a low caste of travelling musicians and dancers). Despite their presence in the country and neighboring nations, the word is not related in any way to the name of Romania.

&quot;Romani&quot; is the feminine adjective, while &quot;Romano&quot; is the masculine adjective. Some Romanies use &quot;Rom&quot; or &quot;Roma&quot; as an ethnic name, while others (such as the Sinti, or the Romanichal) do not use this term as a self-description for the entire ethnic group.

Sometimes, &quot;rom&quot; and &quot;romani&quot; are spelled with a double &quot;r&quot;, i.e., &quot;rrom&quot; and &quot;rromani&quot;. In this case &quot;rr&quot; is used to represent the phoneme  (also written as &quot;ř&quot; and &quot;rh&quot;), which in some Romani dialects has remained different from the one written with a single &quot;r&quot;. The &quot;rr&quot; spelling is common in certain institutions (such as the INALCO Institute in Paris), or used in certain countries, e.g., Romania, to distinguish from the endonym/homonym for Romanians (&quot;sg. român, pl. români&quot;).

In Norway, &quot;Romani&quot; is used exclusively for an older Northern Romani-speaking population (which arrived in the 16th century) while &quot;Rom/Romanes&quot; is used to describe Vlax Romani-speaking groups that migrated since the 19th century.

=== English-language endonyms ===

In the English language (according to the Oxford English Dictionary), &quot;Rom&quot; is both a noun (with the plural &quot;Roma&quot; or &quot;Roms&quot;) and an adjective. Similarly, &quot;Romani&quot; (&quot;Romany&quot;) is both a noun (with the plural &quot;Romani&quot;, &quot;the Romani&quot;, &quot;Romanies&quot;, or &quot;Romanis&quot;) and an adjective. Both &quot;Rom&quot; and &quot;Romani&quot; have been in use in English since the 19th century as an alternative for &quot;Gypsy&quot;. &quot;Romani&quot; was sometimes spelled &quot;Rommany&quot;, but more often &quot;Romany&quot;, while today &quot;Romani&quot; is the most popular spelling. Occasionally, the double &quot;r&quot; spelling (e.g., &quot;Rroma&quot;, &quot;Rromani&quot;) mentioned above is also encountered in English texts.

The term &quot;Roma&quot; is increasingly encountered as a generic term for the Roma.

Because not all Roma use the word &quot;Romani&quot; as an adjective, the term became a noun for the entire ethnic group. Today, the term &quot;Romani&quot; is used by some organizations, including the United Nations and the US Library of Congress. However, the Council of Europe and other organizations consider that &quot;Roma&quot; is the correct term referring to all related groups, regardless of their country of origin, and recommend that &quot;Romani&quot; be restricted to the language and culture: Romani language, Romani culture. The British government uses the term &quot;Roma&quot; as a sub-group of &quot;White&quot; in its ethnic classification system.

The standard assumption is that the demonyms of the Roma, Lom and Dom, share the same origin.

=== Other designations ===

The English exonym &quot;Gypsy&quot; (or &quot;Gipsy&quot;) originates from the Middle English , short for . The Spanish term and French have similar etymologies. They are ultimately derived from the Greek (), meaning &#x27;Egyptian&#x27;, via Latin. This designation owes its existence to the belief, common in the Middle Ages, that the Roma, or some related group (such as the Indian Dom people), were itinerant Egyptians. This belief appears to be derived from verses in the biblical Book of Ezekiel (29: 6 and 12–13) which refer to the Egyptians being scattered among the nations by an angry God. According to one narrative, they were exiled from Egypt as punishment for allegedly harbouring the infant Jesus. In his book &quot;The Zincali: an account of the Gypsies of Spain&quot;, George Borrow notes that when they first appeared in Germany, it was under the character of Egyptians doing penance for their having refused hospitality to Mary and her son. As described in Victor Hugo&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, the medieval French referred to the Romanies as .

These exonyms are sometimes written with capital letter, to show that they designate an ethnic group. However, the word is often considered derogatory because of its negative and stereotypical associations. The Council of Europe consider that &quot;Gypsy&quot; or equivalent terms, as well as administrative terms such as &quot;Gens du Voyage&quot; are not in line with European recommendations. In Britain, many Roma proudly identify as &quot;Gypsies&quot;, and, as part of the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller grouping, this is the name used to describe all para-Romani groups in official contexts. In North America, the word &quot;Gypsy&quot; is most commonly used as a reference to Romani ethnicity, though lifestyle and fashion are at times also referenced by using this word.

Another designation of the Roma is &quot;Cingane&quot; (alternatively Çingene, Tsinganoi, Zigar, Zigeuner, Tschingaren), likely deriving from the Persian word (), derived from the Turkic word , meaning poor person. It is also possible that the origin of this word is &quot;Athinganoi&quot;, the name of a Christian sect with whom the Roma (or some related group) could have become associated in the past.

== Population and subgroups ==

=== Romani populations ===

There is no official or reliable count of the Romani populations worldwide. Many Roma refuse to register their ethnic identity in official censuses for a variety of reasons, such as fear of discrimination. Others are descendants of intermarriage with local populations, some who no longer identify only as Romani and some who do not identify as Romani at all. Then, too, some countries do not collect data by ethnicity.

Despite these challenges to getting an accurate picture of the Romani dispersal, there were an estimated 10 million in Europe (as of 2019), although some Romani organizations have given earlier estimates as high as 14 million. Significant Romani populations are found in the Balkans, in some central European states, in Spain, France, Russia and Ukraine. In the European Union, there are an estimated 6 million Roma.

Outside Europe there may be several million more Roma, in particular in the Middle East and the Americas.

===Romani subgroups===

Romani people may belong to distinct subgroups based in part on territorial, cultural and dialectal differences, and self-designation.

Romani subgroups may have more than one ethnonym. They may use more than one endonym and be commonly known by an exonym or erroneously by the endonym of another subgroup. The only name approaching an all-encompassing self-description is &quot;Rom&quot;. Even when subgroups do not use the name, they all acknowledge a common origin and a dichotomy between themselves and &quot;Gadjo&quot; (non-Roma). For instance, while the main group of Roma in German-speaking countries refer to themselves as Sinti, their name for their original language is &quot;Romanes&quot;.

Subgroups have been described as, in part, a result of the castes and subcastes in India, which the founding population of &quot;Rom&quot; almost certainly experienced in their south Asian &quot;urheimat&quot;.

Many subgroups use names derived from the Romani word &quot;kalo&quot; or &quot;calo&quot;, meaning &quot;black&quot; or &quot;absorbing all light&quot;. This closely resembles words for &quot;black&quot; or &quot;dark&quot; in Indo-Aryan languages (e.g., Sanskrit काल &quot;kāla&quot;: &quot;black&quot;, &quot;of a dark colour&quot;). Likewise, the name of the Dom or Domba people of north India—with whom the Roma have genetic, cultural and linguistic links—has come to imply &quot;dark-skinned&quot; in some Indian languages. Hence, names such as &quot;kale&quot; and &quot;calé&quot; may have originated as an exonym or a euphemism for &quot;Roma&quot;.

Other endonyms for Roma include, for example:
* &quot;Arlije&quot; (also &quot;Erlides&quot;, &quot;Yerli&quot;, meaning &quot;local&quot;, from the Turkish word &quot;Yerli&quot;) in the Balkans and Turkey to describe sedentary Muslim Roma.

(There is a semantic overlap due to the homophony or merging of lemmas with different meanings from at least two languages: the Serbian &quot;rudar&quot; &quot;miner&quot;, and &quot;ruda&quot; &quot;stick&quot;, &quot;staff&quot;, &quot;rod&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;pole&quot; (in Hungarian, &quot;rúd&quot;, and in Romanian, &quot;rudă&quot;.)

=== Diaspora ===


The Romani people have a number of distinct populations, the largest being the Roma, who reached Anatolia and the Balkans about the early 12th century from a migration out of northwestern India beginning about 600 years earlier.

The Roma migrated throughout Europe and Iberian Calé or Caló. The first Roma to come to the United States arrived in Virginia, Georgia, New Jersey and Louisiana during the 1500s. Romani slaves were first shipped to the Americas with Columbus in 1498. Spain sent Romani slaves to their Louisiana colony between 1762 and 1800. An Afro-Romani community exists in St. Martin Parish due to intermarriage of freed African American and Romani slaves. The Romani population in the United States is estimated at more than one million.

In Brazil, the Roma are mainly called &quot;ciganos&quot; by non-Romani Brazilians. Most of them belong to the ethnic subgroup &quot;Calés&quot; (Kale) of the Iberian peninsula. Juscelino Kubitschek, Brazil&#x27;s president from 1956 to 1961, was 50% Czech Romani by his mother&#x27;s bloodline, and Washington Luís, the last president of the First Brazilian Republic (1926–1930), had Portuguese Kale ancestry.

Persecution against the Roma has led to many of the cultural practices being extinguished, hidden or modified to survive in a country that has excluded them ethnically and culturally. The very common carnivals throughout Brazil are one of the few spaces in which the Roma can still express their cultural traditions, including the so-called &quot;carnival wedding&quot; in which a boy is disguised as a bride and the famous &quot;Romaní dance&quot;, picturesquely simulated with the women of the town parading in their traditional attire.

== Indian origin ==

Genetic findings show an Indian origin for Roma. Because Romani groups did not keep chronicles of their history or have oral accounts of it, most hypotheses about early Romani migration are based on linguistic theory.

=== &quot;Shahnameh&quot; legend ===
According to a legend reported in the Persian epic poem, the &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, the Sasanian king Bahrām V Gōr learned towards the end of his reign (421–439) that the poor could not afford to enjoy music, and so he asked the king of India to send him ten thousand &quot;luris&quot;, lute-playing experts. When the &quot;luris&quot; arrived, Bahrām gave each one an ox, a donkey, and a donkey-load of wheat so they could live on agriculture and play music for free for the poor. However, the &quot;luris&quot; ate the oxen and the wheat and came back a year later with their cheeks hollowed by hunger. The king, angered with their having wasted what he had given them, ordered them to pack up their bags and go wandering around the world on their donkeys.

=== Linguistic evidence ===
Linguistic evidence has indisputably shown that the roots of the Romani language lie in India: the language has grammatical characteristics of Indian languages and shares with them a large part of the basic lexicon.

Romani and Domari share some similarities: agglutination of postpositions of the second layer (or case-marking clitics) to the nominal stem, concord markers for the past tense, the neutralisation of gender marking in the plural, and the use of the oblique case as an accusative. This has prompted much discussion about the relationships between these two languages. Domari was once thought to be a &quot;sister language&quot; of Romani, the two languages having split after the departure from the Indian subcontinent—but later research suggests that the differences between them are significant enough to treat them as two separate branches within the central zone (Hindustani) group of languages. The Dom and the Rom, therefore, likely descend from two migration waves from India separated by several centuries.

In phonology, the Romani language shares several isoglosses with the Central branch of Indo-Aryan languages, especially in the realization of some sounds of the Old Indo-Aryan. However, it also preserves several dental clusters. In regards to verb morphology, Romani follows exactly the same pattern of northwestern languages such as Kashmiri and Shina through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers, lending credence to the theory of their Central Indian origin and a subsequent migration to northwestern India. Though the retention of dental clusters suggests a break from central languages during the transition from Old to Middle Indo-Aryan, the overall morphology suggests that the language participated in some of the significant developments leading toward the emergence of New Indo-Aryan languages.
=== Genetic evidence ===

Genetic findings in 2012 suggest the Roma originated in northwestern India and migrated as a group. According to the study, the ancestors of present scheduled caste and scheduled tribe populations of northern India, traditionally referred to collectively as the Ḍoma, are the likely ancestral populations of modern European Roma.

In December 2012, additional findings appeared to confirm that the &quot;Roma came from a single group that left northwestern India about 1,500 years ago&quot;. They reached the Balkans about 900 years ago and then spread throughout Europe. The team also found that the Roma displayed genetic isolation, as well as &quot;differential gene flow in time and space with non-Romani Europeans&quot;.

Genetic research published in the &quot;European Journal of Human Genetics&quot; &quot;has revealed that over 70% of males belong to a single lineage that appears unique to the Roma&quot;.

Genetic evidence supports the medieval migration from India. The Roma have been described as &quot;a conglomerate of genetically isolated founder populations&quot;, while a number of common Mendelian disorders among Roma from all over Europe indicates &quot;a common origin and founder effect&quot;. A 2020 whole-genome study confirmed the northwest Indian origins, and also confirmed substantial Balkan and Middle Eastern ancestry.

A study from 2001 by Gresham et al. suggests &quot;a limited number of related founders, compatible with a small group of migrants splitting from a distinct caste or tribal group&quot;. The same study found that &quot;a single lineage... found across Romani populations, accounts for almost one-third of Romani males&quot;. A 2004 study by Morar et al. concluded that the Romani population &quot;was founded approximately 32–40 generations ago, with secondary and tertiary founder events occurring approximately 16–25 generations ago&quot;.

Haplogroup H-M82 is a major lineage cluster in the Balkan Romani group, accounting for approximately 60% of the total. Haplogroup H is uncommon in Europe but present in the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka.

A study of 444 people representing three ethnic groups in North Macedonia found mtDNA haplogroups M5a1 and H7a1a were dominant in Romanies (13.7% and 10.3%, respectively).

Y-DNA composition of Muslim Roma from Šuto Orizari Municipality in North Macedonia, based on 57 samples:
* Haplogroup H – 59.6%
* Haplogroup E – 29.8%
* Haplogroup I – 5.3%
* Haplogroup R – 3.%, of which the half are R1b and many are R1a
* Haplogroup G – 1.8%
Y-DNA Haplogroup H1a occurs in Roma at frequencies 7–70%. Unlike ethnic Hungarians, among Hungarian and Slovakian Roma subpopulations Haplogroup E-M78 and I1 usually occur above 10% and sometimes over 20%, while among Slovakian and Tiszavasvari Roma, the dominant haplogroup is H1a; among Tokaj Roma it is Haplogroup J2a (23%); and among Taktaharkány Roma, it is Haplogroup I2a (21%).

Five rather consistent founder lineages throughout the subpopulations were found among Roma – J-M67 and J-M92 (J2), H-M52 (H1a1), and I-P259 (I1). Haplogroup I-P259 as H is not found at frequencies of over 3% among host populations, while haplogroups E and I are absent in south Asia. The lineages E-V13, I-P37 (I2a) and R-M17 (R1a) may represent gene flow from the host populations. Bulgarian, Romanian and Greek Roma are dominated by Haplogroup H-M82 (H1a1), while among Spanish Roma J2 is prevalent. In Serbia among Kosovo and Belgrade Roma Haplogroup H prevails, while among Vojvodina Roma, H drops to 7 percent and E-V13 rises to a prevailing level.

Among non-Roma Europeans, Haplogroup H is extremely rare, peaking at 7% among Albanians from Tirana and 11% among Bulgarian Turks. It occurs at 5% among Hungarians, although the carriers might be of Romani origin. Among non-Roma-speaking Europeans, it occurs at 2% among Slovaks, 2% among Croats, 1% among Macedonians from Skopje, 3% among Macedonian Albanians, 1% among Serbs from Belgrade, 3% among Bulgarians from Sofia, 1% among Austrians and Swiss, 3% among Romanians from Ploiești, and 1% among Turks.

The Ottoman occupation of the Balkans also left a significant genetic mark on the Y-DNA of the Roma there, creating a higher frequency of Haplogroups J and E3b in Romani populations from the region.

==== Full genome analysis ====
A full genome autosomal DNA study on 186 Roma samples from Europe in 2019 found that modern Romani people are characterized by a common south Asian origin and a complex admixture from Balkan, Middle East, and Caucasus-derived ancestries. The autosomal genetic data links the proto-Roma to groups in northwest India (specifically Punjabi and Gujarati samples), as well as, Dravidian-speaking groups in southeastern India (specifically Irula). The paternal lineages of Roma are most common in southern and central India among Dravidian-speaking populations. The authors argue that this may point to a founder effect among the early Roma during their ethnogenesis or shortly after they migrated out of the Indian subcontinent. In addition, they theorized of a possible low-caste (Dalit) origin for the Proto-Roma, since they were genetically closer to the Punjabi cluster that lacks a common marker characteristic of high castes, which is West Euroasian admixing.

=== Possible migration route ===

The Roma may have emerged from what is the modern Indian state of Rajasthan, migrating to the northwest (the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent) around 250 BCE. Their subsequent westward migration, possibly in waves, is now believed to have occurred beginning in about 500 CE.
It has also been suggested that emigration from India may have taken place in the context of the raids by Mahmud of Ghazni. As these soldiers were defeated, they were moved west with their families into the Byzantine Empire. The author Ralph Lilley Turner theorised a central Indian origin of Romani followed by a migration to northwest India as it shares a number of ancient isoglosses with central Indo-Aryan languages in relation to realization of some sounds of Old Indo-Aryan. This is lent further credence by its sharing exactly the same pattern of northwestern languages such as Kashmiri and Shina through the adoption of oblique enclitic pronouns as person markers. The overall morphology suggests that Romani participated in some of the significant developments leading toward the emergence of New Indo-Aryan languages, thus indicating that the proto-Roma did not leave the Indian subcontinent until late in the second half of the first millennium.

The first Romani people are believed to have arrived in Europe via the Balkans in the 13th or 14th century. Romani people began migrating to other parts of the continent during the 15th and 16th centuries.

In February 2016, during the International Roma Conference, then Indian Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj stated that the people of the Romani community were children of India. The conference ended with a recommendation to the government of India to recognize the Romani community spread across 30 countries as a part of the Indian diaspora.

== Ethnic identities conflated with the Roma ==
Even though genetic studies confirmed that the Romani people originated in India and their language is an Indo-Aryan language, they have a long history of taking on different identities of various ethnic groups.

===Romaei/Eastern Romans===
With the Roma fleeing the Muslim conquest of Mahmud of Ghazni in Northern India in the early 11th century, they arrived in the Eastern Roman Empire by the 12th century. The name Roma/Romani is similar to Romaei (), or Rhomaioi/Romioi (Ῥωμαῖοι/Ῥωμηοί/Ρωμιοί, &quot;Romans&quot;) (the endonym for the Eastern Romans/Byzantines) from which the name could have originated. Roma is also similar to their original Sanskrit word () meaning &quot;drummer&quot;, with the Doma being dancers and musicians and a sub-group of the Dalit caste.

===Athinganoi===
In the Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire the Roma also took on the identity of the ethnic religious group, the Athinganoi (Greek: Αθίγγανοι). They were a Manichaean sect regarded as Judaizing heretics who lived in Phrygia and Lycaonia but were neither Hebrews nor Gentiles. They kept the Sabbath, but were not circumcised. They were Shomer nagia. The word &quot;Athiganoi&quot; is where the Turkish name as well as the Romanian name come from, as the Ottoman Empire had some linguistic and cultural influence on the neighbouring medieval Romanian principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia. The Turkish Ottomans conquered the Byzantine Empire in the 15th century, hence they ruled over the Roma (Ciganos) as well. Today, Turkey has the highest Romani population.

===Egyptians===
Some terms for the Romani people trace their origin to conflation with Egyptians. The English term &quot;Gypsy&quot; (or &quot;Gipsy&quot;) originates from the Middle English &quot;gypcian&quot;, short for &quot;Egipcien&quot;. The Spanish term and French have similar etymologies. They are ultimately derived from the Greek (), meaning &quot;Egyptian&quot;, via Latin. This designation owes its existence to the belief, common in the Middle Ages, that the Roma, or some related group (such as the Indian Dom people), were itinerant Egyptians.

===Bohemians===
The Roma from Bohemia (today Czech Republic) were called ( in French) because they were believed to have originated ethnically in Bohemia and later came to Western European countries such as France in the 16th century. The term came to mean carefree, artistic people. The Roma were musicians and dancers as well as circus performers that moved place to place, having an adventurous nomadic lifestyle, away from society&#x27;s conventional norms and expectations. This lifestyle inspired the 19th-century European artistic movement, Bohemianism as well as the hippie movement of the late 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s in the United States.

===Irish Travellers===
Because Irish Travellers, a sub-group of the Irish (having the same ancestral genetics from within the general population of Ireland) lived as nomads, the Roma and the Irish travellers came to be conflated with each other and in time some of the Roma mixed with some of the native Irish travellers (beginning in the 1650s) because of proximity and similar nomadic traditions.

===Yenish people===
Similar to the Irish Travellers, the Yenish people were confused with the Roma because they were nomadic and itinerant people. The Yenish people have origins in Western Europe, mostly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Belgium. The Yenish descended from members of the marginalized and vagrant poor classes of society in Germanic-speaking regions in Europe in the Late Middle Ages. Most of the Yenish became sedentary in the course of the mid-19th to 20th centuries. The culture of the Irish Travellers and the Yenish people in Western Europe and the culture of the Roma are different while having the nomadic and itinerant similarity.

===Balkan people and Romanians===
Forced sterilisation carried out in several European countries, such as Norway, Sweden, Czech Republic and Slovakia, in the mid to late 20th century led to a decrease in Romani populations in those countries. Countries in South Eastern Europe that had not carried out forced sterilisation, such as Romania and Bulgaria, experienced steady increases of Roma birth rates during the 20th century that continue to this day, mainly because of the Roma tradition to marry young (in their early teens). Once communism fell in Eastern Europe and travel restrictions were lifted as well as Eastern European countries joining the European Union in the 2000s, it was easier for the Eastern European Roma to mass migrate to Western Europe. Often, Romania is wrongly identified as the place of origin of the Roma because of the similar name Roma/Romani and Romanians. Romanians derive their name from the Latin , meaning &quot;Roman&quot;, referencing the Roman conquest of Dacia. (The Dacians were a sub-group of the Thracians.) Romanian genetics show ancient Balkan ancestry (Thracian ancestry) as well as Slavic ancestry and not Indian ancestry like the Roma.

== History ==

=== Arrival in Europe ===
According to a 2012 genomic study, the Roma reached the Balkans as early as the 12th century. A document of 1068, describing an event in Constantinople, mentions &quot;Atsingani&quot;, probably referring to Roma.

Later historical records of the Roma reaching southeastern Europe are from the 14th century: in 1322, after leaving Ireland on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, Irish Franciscan friar Symon Semeonis encountered a migrant group of Roma outside the town of Candia (modern Heraklion), in Crete, calling them &quot;the descendants of Cain&quot;; his account is the earliest surviving description by a western chronicler of the Roma in Europe.

In 1350, Ludolph of Saxony mentioned a similar people with a unique language whom he called &quot;Mandapolos&quot;, a word possibly derived from the Greek word &quot;mantes&quot; (meaning prophet or fortune teller).

In the 14th century, Roma are recorded in Venetian territories, including Methoni and Nafplio in the Peloponnese, and Corfu. Around 1360, a fiefdom called the &quot;Feudum Acinganorum&quot; was established in Corfu, which mainly used Romani serfs and to which the Roma on the island were subservient.

By the 1440s, they were recorded in Germany; and by the 16th century, Scotland and Sweden. Some Roma migrated from Persia through north Africa, reaching the Iberian Peninsula in the 15th century. The two currents met in France.

=== Early modern history ===

Their early history shows a mixed reception. Although 1385 marks the first recorded transaction for a Romani slave in Wallachia, they were issued safe conduct by Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund in 1417. Roma were ordered expelled from the Meissen region of Germany in 1416, Lucerne in 1471, Milan in 1493, France in 1504, Catalonia in 1512, Sweden in 1525, England in 1530 (see Egyptians Act 1530), and Denmark in 1536. From 1510 onwards, any Rom found in Switzerland was to be executed, while in England (beginning in 1554) and Denmark (beginning of 1589) any Rom who did not leave within a month was to be executed. Portugal began deportations of Roma to its colonies in 1538.

A 1596 English statute gave Roma special privileges that other wanderers lacked. France passed a similar law in 1683. Catherine the Great of Russia declared the Roma &quot;crown slaves&quot; (a status superior to serfs), but also kept them out of certain parts of the capital. In 1595, Ștefan Răzvan overcame his birth into slavery, and became the Voivode (Prince) of Moldavia.

Since a royal edict by Charles II in 1695, Spanish Roma had been restricted to certain towns. An official edict in 1717 restricted them to only 75 towns and districts, so that they would not be concentrated in any one region. In the Great Gypsy Round-up, Roma were arrested and imprisoned by the Spanish Monarchy in 1749.

During the latter part of the 17th century, around the Franco-Dutch War, both France and the Dutch Republic needed thousands of men to fight. Some recruitment took the form of rounding up vagrants and the poor to work the galleys and provide the armies&#x27; labour force. With this background, Roma were targets of both the French and the Dutch.

After the wars, and into the first decade of the 18th century, Roma were slaughtered with impunity throughout the Dutch Republic. Roma, called &#x27;heiden&#x27; (‘heathens’) by the Dutch, wandered throughout the rural areas of Europe and became the societal pariahs of the age. &quot;Heidenjachten&quot;, translated as &quot;heathen hunt&quot; happened throughout the Dutch Republic in an attempt to eradicate them.

Although some Roma could be kept as slaves in Wallachia and Moldavia until abolition in 1856, the majority traveled as free nomads with their wagons, as alluded to in the spoked wheel symbol in the Romani flag. Elsewhere in Europe, they were subjected to ethnic cleansing, abduction of their children, and forced labour. In Britain, Roma were sometimes expelled from small communities or hanged; in France, they were branded, and their heads were shaved; in Moravia and Bohemia, the women were marked by their ears being severed. As a result, large groups of the Roma moved to the East, toward Poland, which was more tolerant, and Russia, where the Roma were treated more fairly as long as they paid the annual taxes.

=== Modern history ===

Roma began emigrating to North America in colonial times, with small groups recorded in Virginia and French Louisiana. Larger-scale Roma emigration to the United States began in the 1860s, with Romanichal groups from Great Britain. The most significant number immigrated in the early 20th century, mainly from the Vlax group of Kalderash. Many Roma also settled in South America.

==== World War II ====
During World War II and the Holocaust, the Nazis committed a systematic genocide against the Roma. In the Romani language, this genocide is known as the &quot;Porajmos&quot;. Romanies were marked for extermination and sentenced to forced labor and imprisonment in concentration camps. They were often killed on sight, especially by the Einsatzgruppen (paramilitary death squads) on the Eastern Front. The total number of victims has been variously estimated at between 220,000 and 1,500,000.

The Roma were also persecuted in Nazi puppet states. In the Independent State of Croatia, the Ustaša killed almost the entire Romani population of 25,000. The concentration camp system of Jasenovac, run by the Ustaša militia and the Croat political police, was responsible for the deaths of between 15,000 and 20,000 Roma.

==== Post-1945 ====
In Czechoslovakia, they were labeled a &quot;socially degraded stratum&quot;, and Romani women were sterilized as part of a state policy to reduce their population. This policy was implemented with large financial incentives, with threats of denying future welfare payments, with misinformation, or after administering drugs.

An official inquiry from the Czech Republic, resulting in a report (December 2005), concluded that the Communist authorities had practised an assimilation policy towards Roma, which &quot;included efforts by social services to control the birth rate in the Romani community. The problem of sexual sterilisation carried out in the Czech Republic, either with improper motivation or illegally, exists,&quot; said the Czech Public Defender of Rights, recommending state compensation for women affected between 1973 and 1991. New cases were revealed up until 2004, in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland &quot;all have histories of coercive sterilization of minorities and other groups&quot;.

== Society and traditional culture ==

The traditional Romanies place a high value on the extended family. Traditionally, virginity is essential in unmarried women. However, Eastern European Roma are more likely to find it acceptable for girls to have sex before marriage compared to other Eastern Europeans. Both men and women usually marry young; there has been controversy in several countries over the Romani practice of child marriage. Romani law establishes that the man&#x27;s family must pay a bride price to the bride&#x27;s parents, but only traditional families still follow it.

Once married, the woman joins the husband&#x27;s family, where her main job is to tend to her husband&#x27;s and her children&#x27;s needs and take care of her in-laws. The power structure in the traditional Romani household has at its top the oldest man or grandfather, and men, in general, have more authority than women. Women gain respect and power as they get older. Young wives begin gaining authority once they have children.

Traditionally, as can be seen on paintings and photos, some Romani men wear shoulder-length hair and a mustache, as well as an earring. Romani women generally have long hair, and Xoraxane Romani women often dye it blonde with henna.

Romani social behavior has traditionally been regulated by Indian social customs (&quot;marime&quot; or &quot;marhime&quot;) which are still respected by most Roma (and by most older generations of Sinti). This regulation affects many aspects of life and is applied to actions, people and things: parts of the human body are considered impure, the genital organs (because they produce emissions) and the rest of the lower body. Clothes for the lower body, as well as the clothes of menstruating women, are washed separately. Items used for eating are also washed in a different place. Childbirth is considered impure and must occur outside the dwelling place. The mother is deemed to be impure for forty days after giving birth.

Death is considered impure, and affects the whole family of the dead, who remain impure for a period of time. In contrast to the practice of cremating the dead, Romani dead must be buried. Cremation and burial are both known from the time of the Rigveda, and both are widely practiced in Hinduism today (the general tendency is for Hindus to practice cremation, though some communities in modern-day south India tend to bury their dead). Animals that are considered to be having unclean habits are not eaten by the community.

=== Belonging and exclusion ===

In Romani philosophy, &quot;Romanipen&quot; (also &quot;romanypen&quot;, &quot;romanipe&quot;, &quot;romanype&quot;, &quot;romanimos&quot;, &quot;romaimos&quot;, &quot;romaniya&quot;) is the totality of the Romani spirit, Romani culture, Romani Law, being a Romani, a set of Romani strains.

An ethnic Rom is considered a gadjo in Romani society if they have no &quot;Romanipen&quot;. Sometimes a non-Rom may be considered a Rom if they do have &quot;Romanipen&quot;. Usually this is an adopted child. It has been hypothesized that this owes more to a framework of culture than a simple adherence to historically received rules.

=== Religion ===

Most Roma are Christian, but many are Muslims; some retained their ancient faith of Hinduism from their original homeland of India, while others have their own religion and political organization. In parts of Southeast Europe, particularly in Bulgaria, some Roma who are Muslim identify as ethnic Turks, and over generations have adopted the Turkish language. Theravada Buddhism influenced by the Dalit Buddhist movement have become popular in recent times among Hungarian Roma.

Some Roma practice witchcraft and palmistry.

==== Beliefs ====
The modern-day Roma often adopted Christianity or Islam depending on which was the dominant religion in the regions through which they had migrated. It is likely that the adherence to differing religions prevented families from engaging in intermarriage. In Eastern Europe, most Roma are Orthodox Christians, Muslims or Catholics. In Bulgaria, Greece, Moldova, Romania and Serbia, the majority of Romani inhabitants are Orthodox Christians. In Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo, the majority are Muslims. In Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, the majority are Catholics. In Western Europe, the majority of Romani inhabitants are Catholic or Protestant. In Crimea and Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Iraq and Iran, the majority of Romani inhabitants are Muslim. In the United States, the majority of Romani inhabitants adhere to some branch of Christianity.

==== Deities and saints ====
Blessed Ceferino Giménez Malla is recently considered a patron saint of the Roma in Roman Catholicism. Saint Sarah, or Sara e Kali, has also been venerated as a patron saint in her shrine at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, France. Since the turn of the 21st century, Sara e Kali is understood to have been Kali, an Indian deity brought from India by the refugee ancestors of the Roma; as the Roma became Christianized, she was absorbed in a syncretic way and venerated as a saint.
Saint Sarah is now increasingly being considered as &quot;a Romani Goddess, the Protectress of the Roma&quot; and an &quot;indisputable link with Mother India&quot;.

==== The Balkans/Southeast Europe ====
For the Romani communities that have resided in Southeast Europe for numerous centuries, the following apply with regard to religious beliefs:
* Albania - The majority of the Romani population in Albania is Muslim.
* Bosnia and Herzegovina – The majority of the Romani population in Bosnia and Herzegovina is Muslim.
* Bulgaria – The majority of the Romani population in Bulgaria is Christian (mostly Orthodox). In northwestern Bulgaria, in addition to Sofia and Kyustendil, Christianity is the dominant faith among the Roma, and a major conversion to Eastern Orthodox Christianity among the Roma has occurred. In southeastern Bulgaria, Islam is the dominant religion among the Roma, with a smaller section of the Roma declaring themselves as &quot;Turks&quot;, continuing to mix ethnicity with Islam.

* Croatia – The majority of the Romani population in Croatia is Christian (mostly Catholic). After the Second World War, a large number of Muslim Roma relocated to Croatia, the majority moving from Kosovo. Their language differs from those living in Međimurje and those who survived Romani Holocaust.
* Greece – The majority of the Romani population in Greece is Christian. The descendants of groups, such as Sepečides or Sevljara, Kalpazaja, Filipidži and others, living in Athens, Thessaloniki, central Greece and Greek Macedonia are mostly Orthodox Christians, with Islamic beliefs held by a minority of the population. Following the Peace Treaty of Lausanne of 1923, many Muslim Roma moved to Turkey in the subsequent population exchange between Turkey and Greece.
* Hungary – The majority of the Romani population in Hungary is Christian. The country experienced an influx of Muslim Roma during the Ottoman period in Hungary, who later converted to Catholicism.

* Kosovo – The majority of the Romani population in Kosovo are Muslim and Speak Albanian. Some Roma in Kosovo speak Serbian and are Orthodox Christians. 
* Montenegro – The majority of the Romani population in Montenegro is Muslim.
* North Macedonia –The majority of the Romani population in North Macedonia is Muslim.
* Romania – The majority of the Romani population in Romania is Christian (mostly Orthodox). In Dobruja, there is a small community that are Muslim and also speak Turkish.
* Serbia – The majority of the Romani population in Serbia is Christian (mostly Orthodox). There are some Muslim Roma in southern Serbia, who are mainly refugees from Kosovo.
* Slovenia – The majority of the Romani population in Slovenia is Christian (mostly Catholic), although a sizeable proportion are Muslim.

==== Other regions ====

In Ukraine and Russia, the Romani populations are Christian and Muslim. Their ancestors settled on the Crimean peninsula during the 17th and 18th centuries, but some migrated to Ukraine, southern Russia and the Povolzhie (along the Volga River). These communities are recognized for their staunch preservation of the Romani language and identity.

In the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia, Romani populations are Roman Catholic, many times adopting and following local, cultural Catholicism as a syncretic system of belief that incorporates distinct Roma beliefs and cultural aspects. For example, many Polish Roma delay their Church wedding due to the belief that sacramental marriage is accompanied by divine ratification, creating a virtually indissoluble union until the couple consummate, after which the sacramental marriage is dissoluble only by the death of a spouse. Therefore, for Polish Roma, once married, one can&#x27;t ever divorce. Another aspect of Polish Roma&#x27;s Catholicism is a tradition of pilgrimage to the Jasna Góra Monastery.

In southern Spain, many Romanies are Pentecostal, but this is a small minority that has emerged in contemporary times. The majority of the Romani people in France are Catholic or Protestant (mostly Pentecostal).

=== Music ===


Romani music plays an important role in central and eastern European countries such as Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania, and the style and performance practices of Romani musicians have influenced European classical composers such as Franz Liszt and Johannes Brahms. The &quot;lăutari&quot; who perform at traditional Romanian weddings are virtually all Romani.

Probably the most internationally prominent contemporary performers in the &quot;lăutari&quot; tradition are Taraful Haiducilor. Bulgaria&#x27;s popular &quot;wedding music&quot;, too, is almost exclusively performed by Romani musicians such as Ivo Papasov, a virtuoso clarinetist closely associated with this genre and Bulgarian pop-folk singer Azis.

Many famous classical musicians, such as the Hungarian pianist Georges Cziffra, are Romani, as are many prominent performers of manele. Zdob și Zdub, one of the most prominent rock bands in Moldova, although not Romanies themselves, draw heavily on Romani music, as do Spitalul de Urgență in Romania, Shantel in Germany, Goran Bregović in Serbia, Darko Rundek in Croatia, Beirut and Gogol Bordello in the United States.

Another tradition of Romani music is the genre of the Romani brass band, with such notable practitioners as Boban Marković of Serbia, and the brass &quot;lăutari&quot; groups Fanfare Ciocărlia and Fanfare din Cozmesti of Romania.

The distinctive sound of Romani music has also strongly influenced bolero, jazz, and flamenco (especially &quot;cante jondo&quot;) in Spain.

Dances such as the flamenco and bolero of Spain were influenced by the Roma. Antonio Cansino blended Romani and Spanish flamenco and is credited with creating modern-day Spanish dance. The Dancing Cansinos popularized flamenco and bolero dancing in the United States. Famous dancer and actress, Rita Hayworth, is the granddaughter of Antonio Cansino.

European-style gypsy jazz (&quot;jazz Manouche&quot; or &quot;Sinti jazz&quot;) is still widely practiced among the original creators (the Romanie People); one who acknowledged this artistic debt was guitarist Django Reinhardt. Contemporary artists in this tradition known internationally include Stochelo Rosenberg, Biréli Lagrène, Jimmy Rosenberg, Paulus Schäfer and Tchavolo Schmitt.

The Roma in Turkey have achieved musical acclaim from national and local audiences. Local performers usually perform for special holidays. Their music is usually performed on instruments such as the darbuka, gırnata and cümbüş.

==Folklore==

&quot;Paramichia&quot; is a term used to refer to Romani legends and folktales. A popular legend among the Vlach Roma is of the hero Mundro Salamon, also known by other Roma subgroups as Wise Solomon or O Godjiaver Yanko.

Some Roma believe in the &quot;mulo&quot; or &quot;mullo,&quot; meaning &quot;one who is dead&quot;; the Romani version of the vampire. The Roma from Slavic countries believe in werewolves. Roma figure prominently in the 1941 film &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; and the 2010 remake.

==Cuisine==

The Roma believe that some foods are auspicious, or lucky (&quot;baxtalo&quot;), such as foods with pungent tastes like garlic, lemon, tomato, and peppers, and fermented foods such as sauerkraut, pickles and sour cream. Hedgehogs are a delicacy among some Roma.

== Contemporary art and culture ==
Romani contemporary art emerged at the climax of the process that began in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, when the interpretation of the cultural practice of minorities was enabled by a paradigm shift, commonly referred to in specialist literature as the &quot;cultural turn&quot;. The idea of the cultural turn was introduced; and this was also the time when the notion of cultural democracy became crystallized in the debates carried on at various public forums. Civil society gained strength, and civil politics appeared, which is a prerequisite for cultural democracy. This shift of attitude in scholarly circles derived from concerns specific not only to ethnicity but also to society, gender and class.

== Language ==
Most Roma speak one of several dialects of the Romani language, an Indo-Aryan language, with roots in Sanskrit. They also often speak the languages of the countries they live in. Typically, they also incorporate loanwords and calques into Romani from the languages of those countries and especially words for terms that the Romani language does not have. Most of the &quot;Ciganos&quot; of Portugal, the of Spain, the Romanichal of Great Britain, and Scandinavian Travellers have lost their knowledge of pure Romani, and speak the mixed languages Caló, Angloromany, and Scandoromani, respectively. Most of the Romani language-speaking communities in these regions consist of later immigrants from eastern or central Europe.

There are no concrete statistics for the number of Romani speakers, both in Europe and globally. However, a conservative estimate is 3.5 million speakers in Europe and a further 500,000 elsewhere, though the actual number may be considerably higher. This makes Romani the second-largest minority language in Europe, behind Catalan.

In regards to the diversity of dialects, Romani works in the same way as most other European languages. Cross-dialect communication is dominated by the following features:
* All Romani speakers are bilingual, accustomed to borrowing words or phrases from a second language; this makes it difficult to communicate with Roma from different countries
* Romani was traditionally a language shared between extended family and a close-knit community. This has resulted in the inability to comprehend dialects from other countries, and is why Romani is sometimes considered to be several different languages.
* There is no tradition or literary standard for Romani speakers to use as a guideline for their language use.

== Persecutions ==

=== Roma enslavement ===

One of the most enduring persecutions against the Roma was their enslavement. Slavery was widely practiced in medieval Europe, including the territory of present-day Romania from before the founding of the principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia in the 13th–14th centuries. Legislation decreed that all the Roma living in these states, as well as any others who immigrated there, were classified as slaves. Slavery was gradually abolished during the 1840s and 1850s.

The exact origins of slavery in the Danubian Principalities are not known. There is some debate over whether the Roma came to Wallachia and Moldavia as free men or were brought there as slaves. Historian Nicolae Iorga associated the Roma&#x27;s arrival with the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe and he also considered their enslavement a vestige of that era, in which the Romanians took the Roma from the Mongols and preserved their status as slaves so they could use their labor. Other historians believe that the Roma were enslaved while they were being captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners of war may have also been adopted from the Mongols.

Some Roma may have been slaves of the Mongols or the Tatars, or they may have served as auxiliary troops in the Mongol or Tatar armies. However, most of them migrated from south of the Danube at the end of the 14th century, some time after the founding of Wallachia. By then, the institution of slavery was already established in Moldavia and it was possibly established in both principalities. After the Roma migrated into the area, slavery became a widespread practice among the majority of the population. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Romani population.

=== Historical persecution ===

Some branches of the Roma reached western Europe in the 15th century, fleeing from the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans as refugees. Although the Roma were refugees from the conflicts in southeastern Europe, they were often suspected of being associated with the Ottoman invasion by certain populations in the West because their physical appearance was exotic. (The Imperial Diet at Landau and Freiburg in 1496–1498 declared that the Roma were spies for the Turks). In western Europe, such suspicions and discrimination against people who constituted a visible minority resulted in persecution, often violent, with attempts to commit ethnic cleansing until the modern era. In times of social tension, the Romani suffered as scapegoats; for instance, they were accused of bringing the plague during times of epidemics.

On 30 July 1749, Spain conducted &quot;The Great Roundup&quot; of Roma (Gitanos) in its territory. The Spanish Crown ordered a nationwide raid that led to the break-up of families because all able-bodied men were interned in forced labor camps in an attempt to commit ethnic cleansing. The measure was eventually reversed and the Roma were freed as protests began to erupt in different communities, sedentary Roma were highly esteemed and protected in rural Spain.

Later in the 19th century, Romani immigration was forbidden on a racial basis in areas outside Europe, mostly in the English-speaking world. In 1880, Argentina prohibited immigration by Roma, as did the United States in 1885.

=== Forced assimilation ===

In the Habsburg monarchy under Maria Theresa (1740–1780), a series of decrees tried to integrate the Romanies to get them to permanently settle, removed their rights to horse and wagon ownership (1754) to reduce citizen-mobility, renamed them &quot;New Citizens&quot; and obliged Romani boys into military service just as any other citizens were if they had no trade (1761, and Revision 1770), required them to register with the local authorities (1767), and another decree prohibited marriages between Romanies (1773) to integrate them into the local population. Her successor Josef II prohibited the wearing of traditional Romani clothing along with the use of the Romani language, both of which were punishable by flogging. During this time, the schools were obliged to register and integrate Romani children; this policy was the first of the modern policies of integration. In Spain, attempts to assimilate the Gitanos were under way as early as 1619, when the Gitanos were forcibly settled, the use of the Romani language was prohibited, Gitano men and women were sent to separate workhouses and their children were sent to orphanages. King Charles III took a more progressive approach to Gitano assimilation, proclaiming that they had the same rights as Spanish citizens and ending the official denigration of them which was based on their race. While he prohibited their nomadic lifestyle, their use of the Calo language, the manufacture and wearing of Romani clothing, their trade in horses and other itinerant trades, he also forbade any form of discrimination against them and he also forbade the guilds from barring them. The use of the word &quot;gitano&quot; was also forbidden to further their assimilation, it was replaced with &quot;New Castilian&quot;, a designation which was also applied to former Jews and Muslims.

Most historians believe that Charles III&#x27;s pragmática failed for three main reasons, reasons which were ultimately derived from its implementation outside major cities as well as in marginal areas: The difficulty which the Gitano community faced in changing its nomadic lifestyle, the marginal lifestyle to which the community had been driven by society and the serious difficulties of applying the pragmática in the fields of education and work. One author ascribes its failure to the overall rejection of the integration of the Gitanos by the wider population.

Other policies of forced assimilation were implemented in other countries, one of these countries was Norway, where a law which permitted the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions was passed in 1896. This resulted in some 1,500 Romani children being taken from their parents in the 20th century.

=== Porajmos (Romani Holocaust) ===

During World War II and the Holocaust, the persecution of the Roma reached a peak during the Romani Holocaust (the Porajmos), the genocide which was perpetrated against them by Nazi Germany. In 1935, Roma living in Germany were stripped of citizenship by the Nuremberg laws and subsequently subjected to violence and imprisonment in concentration camps. During the war, the policy was extended to areas under German occupation, and it was also implemented by other axis countries, most notably, by the Independent State of Croatia, Romania, and Hungary. From 1942, Roma were subjected to genocide in extermination camps.

Because no accurate pre-war census figures exist for the Roma, the actual number of Romani victims who were killed in the Romani Holocaust cannot be assessed. Estimates range from 90,000 victims to as high as 4,000,000, with a majority falling between 200,000 and 500,000. Lower estimates do not include those Roma who were killed in all Axis-controlled countries. A detailed study by Sybil Milton, a former senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, contained an estimate of at least 220,000, possibly as many as 500,000. Ian Hancock, Director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, argues in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000.

== Contemporary issues ==

In Europe, Roma are associated with poverty, high crime rates, and behavior that is considered antisocial or inappropriate by the rest of the European population. Partly for this reason, discrimination against the Roma has continued to be practiced to the present day, although efforts are being made to address it.

Amnesty International reports continued to document instances of Antizigan discrimination during the late 20th century, particularly in Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Kosovo. The European Union has recognized that discrimination against Roma must be addressed, and with the national Roma integration strategy they encourage member states to work towards greater Romani inclusion and upholding the rights of the Roma in the European Union.
In eastern Europe, Romani children often attend Roma Special Schools, separate from non-Romani children; these schools tend to offer a lower quality of education than the traditional education options accessible by non-Romani children, putting the Romani children at an educational disadvantage.

The Roma of Kosovo have been severely persecuted by ethnic Albanians since the end of the Kosovo War, and for the most part, the region&#x27;s Romani community has been annihilated.

Czechoslovakia carried out a policy of sterilization of Romani women, starting in 1973. The dissidents of the Charter 77 denounced it in 1977–78 as a genocide, but the practice continued through the Velvet Revolution of 1989. A 2005 report by the Czech Republic&#x27;s independent ombudsman, Otakar Motejl, identified dozens of cases of coercive sterilization between 1979 and 2001, and called for criminal investigations and possible prosecution against several health care workers and administrators.

In 2008, following the rape and subsequent murder of an Italian woman in Rome at the hands of a young man from a local Romani encampment, the Italian government declared that Italy&#x27;s Romani population represented a national security risk and it also declared that it was required to take swift action to address the &quot;emergenza nomadi&quot; (&quot;nomad emergency&quot;). Specifically, officials in the Italian government accused the Romanies of being responsible for rising crime rates in urban areas.

The 2008 deaths of Cristina and Violetta Djeordsevic, two Romani children who drowned while Italian beach-goers remained unperturbed, brought international attention to the relationship between Italians and Roma. Reviewing the situation in 2012, one Belgian magazine observed:

The 2016 Pew Research poll found that Italians, in particular, hold strong anti-Roma views, with 82% of Italians expressing negative opinions about Roma. In Greece, 67%, in Hungary 64%, in France 61%, in Spain 49%, in Poland 47%, in the UK 45%, in Sweden 42%, in Germany 40%, and in the Netherlands 37% had an unfavourable view of Roma. The 2019 Pew Research poll found that 83% of Italians, 76% of Slovaks, 72% of Greeks, 68% of Bulgarians, 66% of Czechs, 61% of Lithuanians, 61% of Hungarians, 54% of Ukrainians, 52% of Russians, 51% of Poles, 44% of French, 40% of Spaniards, and 37% of Germans held unfavorable views of Roma. IRES published in 2020 a survey which revealed that 72% of Romanians have a negative opinion about them.

As of 2019, reports of anti-Roma incidents are increasing across Europe. Discrimination against Roma remains widespread in Kosovo, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic, against which the European Court of Human Rights has ruled in Romani advocates&#x27; favor on the subject of discriminatory and segregationist education and housing practices. Romani communities across Ukraine have been the target of violent attacks.

Roma refugees fleeing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine have faced discrimination in Europe, including in Poland, the Czech Republic, and Moldova.

Concerning employment, a 2019 report by the FRA revealed that, across the European states that were surveyed, on average 34% of Romani men and 16% of Romani women were in paid work.

=== Forced repatriation ===

In the summer of 2010, French authorities demolished at least 51 Roma camps and began the process of repatriating their residents to their countries of origin. This followed tensions between the French state and Romani communities, which had been heightened after a traveller drove through a French police checkpoint, hit an officer, attempted to hit two more officers, and was then shot and killed by the police. In retaliation a group of Roma, armed with hatchets and iron bars, attacked the police station of Saint-Aignan, toppled traffic lights and road signs and burned three cars. The French government has been accused of perpetrating these actions to pursue its political agenda. EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding stated that the European Commission should take legal action against France over the issue, calling the deportations &quot;a disgrace&quot;. A leaked file dated 5 August, sent from the Interior Ministry to regional police chiefs, included the instruction: &quot;Three hundred camps or illegal settlements must be cleared within three months, Roma camps are a priority.&quot;

=== Voluntarily assimilated groups ===
Some Romani people have been known to assimilate en masse with and even be absorbed by other ethnic groups. Assimilated Romani people often keep their identity a secret from outsiders, so it is very hard to determine the extent to which Romani peoples voluntarily assimilate into Gadjo society.

The most notable case of large-scale Romani assimilation is of the Romani Crimean Tatars. Several independent waves of Romani people undertook complete or near-complete assimilation into the Crimean Tatar people. Romani Crimean Tatars are the fourth largest subethnic group of the Crimean Tatar nation. For centuries, the Crimean Roma have been honest workers who contributed to the Crimean economy as artisans, musicians, entertainers, and in a variety of blue-collar professions such as porters and blacksmiths. Almost all Romani Crimean Tatars living in Crimea today are legally Gadjo because they are recorded as ethnic Crimean Tatars, not Gypsies, in their internal passports and national censuses and consider their Crimean Tatar identity to be their primary identity. Mixed marriages between Romani Crimean Tatars and other Crimean Tatars without Romani backgrounds are accepted by the Crimean Roma. Many prominent Crimean Tatar celebrities are of Romani descent, such as Enver Sherfedinov and Sabriye Erecepova. Historian Olga Kucherenko postulates that while Crimean Tatars were in exile, additional Romani people of non-Crimean origin were also absorbed into the Romani Crimean Tatars.

In Basque Country, the Erromintxela people are assimilated descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically, linguistically, and culturally, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern Basque Country. Over time the Erromintxela replaced many of their Romani customs with Gadjo Basque customs. Their Erromintxela language is a mixture of Basque and the Romani languages, but there are very few speakers left due to assimilation. The younger generation of Erromintxela Roma are overwhelmingly shifting away from their Erromintxela language in favor of the Basque and Spanish languages.

In the United States, there are an estimated one million Americans who are of Romani descent, although most are not open about their background and keep a low profile. Most Americans know very little about Romani people, so they face less discrimination in the US than Europe, although they can still be victims of anti-Romani racism. Prominent Americans of Romani descent include Charlie Chaplin and President Bill Clinton.

== Artistic representations ==

Many depictions of the Roma in literature and art present romanticized narratives of the mystical powers of fortune telling or as people who have an irascible or passionate temper paired with an indomitable love of freedom and a habit of criminality. The Roma were a popular subject in Venetian painting from the time of Giorgione at the start of the 16th century. The inclusion of such a figure adds an exotic oriental flavor to scenes. A Venetian Renaissance painting by Paris Bordone (c. 1530, Strasbourg) of the Holy Family in Egypt makes Elizabeth a Romani fortune-teller; the scene is otherwise located in a distinctly European landscape.

<doc id="26154" wikidata="Q3286938" url="?curid=26154" title="Roman Inquisition">
<text>The Roman Inquisition, formally , was a system of partisan tribunals developed by the Holy See of the Catholic Church, during the second half of the 16th century, responsible for prosecuting individuals accused of a wide array of crimes according to Catholic law and doctrine, relating to Catholic religious life or alternative religious or secular beliefs. It was established in 1542 by the leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Paul III. In the period after the Medieval Inquisition, it was one of three different manifestations of the wider Catholic Inquisition, the other two being the Spanish Inquisition and Portuguese Inquisition.

==Function and functioning==
The main function of the institution was to maintain and implement papal bulls and other church rulings, in addition to their function of administering legalistic ramifications upon deviants of Catholic orthodoxy within states that cooperated with the pope and ostensibly exhibiting proper procedure to Catholic states in the process of formulating the Counter-Reformation. The papal bull &quot;Ad abolendam&quot;, by Lucius III, prescribed penalties for heretical clerics and laymen and established a procedure of systematic inquisition by bishops; the third canon of the fourth Lateran Council (1215) specified procedures against heretics and their accomplices. Clerics were to be degraded from their orders, lay persons were to be branded as infamous and not be admitted to public offices or councils or to run a business, will not have the freedom to make a will nor shall succeed to an inheritance, goods were to be confiscated. A secular leader who &quot;neglects to cleanse his territory of this heretical filth&quot; would be excommunicated and the supreme pontiff could declare his vassals absolved from their fealty to him and make the land available for occupation by Catholics who would possess it unopposed and preserve it in the purity of the faith.

The organisational system of the Roman Inquisition did differ essentially from that of the Medieval Inquisition. Typically, the pope appointed one cardinal to preside over meetings of the Congregation. Though often referred to in historical literature as &quot;Grand Inquisitors&quot;, the role was substantially different from the formally appointed Grand Inquisitor of the Spanish Inquisition. There were usually ten other cardinals who were members of the Congregation, as well as a prelate and two assistants all chosen from the Dominican Order. The Holy Office also had an international group of consultants; experienced scholars of theology and canon law who advised on specific questions. The congregation, in turn, presided over the activity of local tribunals.

==History==
The Roman Inquisition began in 1542 as part of the Catholic Church&#x27;s Counter-Reformation against the spread of Protestantism, but it represented a less harsh affair than the previously established Spanish Inquisition. 
In 1588, Pope Sixtus V established, with &quot;Immensa Aeterni Dei&quot;, 15 congregations of the Roman Curia of which the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition was one. In 1908, the congregation was renamed the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, in 1965 it was renamed again to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and in 2022 it was renamed once again to the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.

While the Roman Inquisition was originally designed to combat the spread of Protestantism in Italy, the institution outlived that original purpose and the system of tribunals lasted until the mid 18th century, when pre-unification Italian states began to suppress the local inquisitions, effectively eliminating the power of the church to prosecute heretical crimes.

==Notable subjects of investigation==

===Copernicus===

Nicolaus Copernicus circulated for scholarly discussion his hypothesis of a cosmos that was heliocentric and an Earth that rotated around its own axis, first, in 1514 in a manuscript essay, &quot;&quot; (Brief Commentary on the Hypotheses of Heavenly Movements), and then more robustly in the book &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot;), in 1543. The book was dedicated to Pope Paul III, who was known for his interests in astronomy. Both works were known in Rome, and neither attracted adverse theological responses in the sixteenth century.

Some seven decades following Copernicus&#x27;s death, specialists in mathematics, philosophy, and Catholic theology, whom the Roman Inquisition consulted in response to complaints made against Galileo in 1616, judged the proposition that the sun is immobile and at the center of the universe and that the Earth moves around it, to be &quot;foolish and absurd in philosophy&quot; and that the first was &quot;formally heretical&quot; while the second was &quot;at least erroneous in faith&quot;.

While the Inquisition refrained from condemning either Copernicus or his book (or Galileo) on the basis of this assessment, several theological claims in &quot;De revolutionibus&quot; were ordered to be excised in future publications. Unexpurgated versions of &quot;On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres&quot; were placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (Index of Forbidden Books).

===Galileo===
Galileo Galilei revised the Copernican theories and was admonished for his views on heliocentrism in 1615. The Roman Inquisition concluded that his theory could only be supported as a possibility, not as an established fact. Galileo later defended his views in &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; (1632), which attacked Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until that point.

He was tried by the Inquisition in 1633. Galileo was found &quot;vehemently suspect of heresy&quot;, forced to recant, and the &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot; was placed on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot; (Index of Forbidden Books). He spent the rest of his life under house arrest at his villa in Arcetri near the city of Florence.

===John Bargrave===
17th century English traveler and author, John Bargrave, gave an account of his interactions with the Roman Inquisition. Arriving in the city of Reggio (having travelled from Modena), Bargrave was stopped by the city guard who inspected his books on suspicion some may have been on the &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum&quot;. Bargrave was brought before the city&#x27;s chief inquisitor who suggested they converse in Latin rather than Italian so that the guards might be prevented from understanding them. The inquisitor told him that the inquisition were not accustomed to stopping visitors or travellers unless someone had suggested they do so (Bargrave suspected that Jesuits in Rome had made accusations against him). Nonetheless, Bargrave was told he was required to hold a license from the inquisition. Even with a license, Bargrave was prohibited from carrying any books &quot;printed at any heretical city, as Geneva, Amsterdam, Leyden, London, or the like&quot;. Bargrave provided a catalogue of his books to the inquisition and was provided with a license to carry them for the rest of his journey.

===Others===
Among the subjects of this Inquisition were Franciscus Patricius, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella, Gerolamo Cardano, Cesare Cremonini and Camilla Erculiani an Italian apothecary, writer, natural philosopher, and a women&#x27;s advocate. Of these, only Bruno was executed, in 1600. The miller Domenico Scandella was also burned at the stake on the orders of Pope Clement VIII in 1599 for his belief that God was created from chaos. The friar Fulgenzio Manfredi, who had preached against the pope, was tried by the Inquisition and executed in 1610.

The Inquisition also concerned itself with the Benandanti in the Friuli region, but considered them a lesser danger than the Protestant Reformation and only handed out light sentences.

==Inquisition in Italy and Malta==
The Inquisition in Malta (1561 to 1798) is generally considered to have been gentler.

Italian historian Andrea Del Col estimates that out of 51,000–75,000 cases judged by Inquisition in Italy after 1542, around 1,250 resulted in a death sentence.

==Historiography and witchcraft accusations==
The Inquisitions have long been one of the primary subjects in the scholarly debates regarding witchcraft accusations of the early modern period. Historian Henry Charles Lea places an emphasis on torture methods employed to force confessions from the convicted. Carlo Ginzburg, in &quot;The Night Battles&quot;, discussed how Inquisitorial propaganda of demonology distorted popular folk beliefs. In similar light, Elliott P. Currie saw the Inquisitions as one singular, ongoing phenomenon, which drove the witch-hunt to its peak. Currie argued that the methods pioneered by the Inquisition indirectly guided continental Europe to a series of persecutions motivated by profit. Second-wave feminism also saw a surge of historical interpretation of the witch-hunt. A number of 100,000 to 9,000,000 executions was given, all of which was attributed to the Inquisition. Feminist scholars Claudia Honeger and Nelly Moia saw the early modern witch-craze as a product of Inquisitorial influence, namely the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;. Feminist writers Mary Daly, Barbara Walker, and Witch Starhawk argued that the Inquisitions were responsible for countless, &quot;hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions&quot;, deaths, most of them women. This notion was similarly echoed by Third-wave feminist writer Elizabeth Connor, who agreed with the notion of &quot;gynocide&quot;, or &quot;woman hunting&quot;, inaugurated by the &quot;Malleus&quot;. The same sentiment regarding the Inquisition&#x27;s notorious reputation of torture was shared by American writer and attorney Jonathan Kirsch. In his book, &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&#x27;s Manual: A History of Terror in the Name of God&quot;, Kirsch argued that the Inquisition&#x27;s use of torture not only applied to the witch-craze which peaked in early 17th century, but also to the Salem witch trials. This model of repressive system, Kirsch argued, was also applied in Nazism, Soviet Russia, Japanese internment camps, McCarthyism, and most recently, the War on Terror.

Through further research and available evidence, the Roman Inquisition was seen in a different light. In contrast with feminist arguments historians like Clarke Garrett, Brian P. Levack, John Tedeschi, Matteo Duni, and Diane Purkiss pointed out that most witch trials and executions were conducted by local and secular authorities. Clarke Garrett mentioned the quick decline and insignificance of the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;. In-depth historical research regarding minor details of different types of magic, theological heresies, and political climate of The Reformation further revealed that Inquisitorial procedures greatly restrained witch hunting in Italy. Scholars specializing in the Renaissance and Early Modern period such as Guido Ruggiero, Christopher F. Black, and Mary O&#x27;Neil also discussed the importance of proper procedures and sparse use of torture. The low rate of torture and lawful interrogation, Black argued, means that trials tended to focus more on individual accusation, instead of groups. For the same reason, the notion of the Black Sabbath was much less accepted in contemporary Italian popular culture. The Holy Office&#x27;s function in the disenchantment of popular culture also helped advance rationalism by getting rid of superstitions. Jeffrey R. Watt refutes the feminist claim that the Inquisition was responsible for the death of so many women. Watt points out that in 1588 the Roman Curia stated it would only allow testimony about participation in a Sabbath by the practitioners themselves and not by outside witnesses. Additionally, the Inquisition would eventually ban torture for the procurement of a witchcraft confession. The Holy Office also began seeking less harsh punishment for witches and viewed witches as those who had simply lost their way and who could be redeemed, not as apostates deserving death.

Historians who leaned toward the witch-hunt-restraining argument were more inclined to differentiate different Inquisitions, and often drew contrast between Italy versus Central Europe. The number of executed witches is also greatly lowered, to between 45,000 and 60,000. Those who argued for the fault of the Inquisition in the witch-craze are more likely to contrast continental Europe to England, as well as seeing the Inquisitions as one singular event which lasted 600 years since its founding in the 11th or 12th century. The significance and emphasis of the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; is seen more frequently in arguments which hold the Inquisition accountable for the witch-craze.

<text>Romare Bearden (, ) (September 2, 1911 – March 12, 1988) was an American artist, author, and songwriter. He worked with many types of media including cartoons, oils, and collages. Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, Bearden grew up in New York City and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and graduated from New York University in 1935.

He began his artistic career creating scenes of the American South. Later, he worked to express the humanity he felt was lacking in the world after his experience in the US Army during World War II on the European front. He returned to Paris in 1950 and studied art history and philosophy at the Sorbonne.

Bearden&#x27;s early work focused on unity and cooperation within the African-American community. After a period during the 1950s when he painted more abstractly, the theme reemerged in his collage works of the 1960s. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Bearden as &quot;the nation&#x27;s foremost collagist&quot; in his 1988 obituary. Bearden became a founding member of the Harlem-based art group known as Spiral, formed to discuss the responsibility of the African-American artist in the civil rights movement.

Bearden was the author or coauthor of several books. He also was a songwriter, known as co-writer of the jazz classic &quot;Sea Breeze&quot;, which was recorded by Billy Eckstine, a former high school classmate at Peabody High School, and Dizzy Gillespie. He had long supported young, emerging artists and he and his wife established the Bearden Foundation to continue this work, as well as to support young scholars. In 1987, Bearden was awarded the National Medal of Arts.

== Early life and education ==
Bearden was born September 2, 1911, in Charlotte. Bearden and his family moved to New York City when he was a toddler, as part of the Great Migration. After enrolling in P.S. 5 in 1917, on 141 Street and Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem, he attended P.S. 139 and then DeWitt Clinton High School. In 1927 he moved to East Liberty, Pittsburgh with his grandparents and then returned to New York City. The Bearden household soon became a meeting place for major figures of the Harlem Renaissance. His father, Howard Bearden, was a pianist. Romare&#x27;s mother, Bessye Bearden, played an active role with the New York City Board of Education, and also was the founder and president of the Colored Women&#x27;s Democratic League. She was a New York correspondent for &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot;, an African-American newspaper. Romare had Cherokee, Italian, and African ancestry. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described him as &quot;African American.&quot; His fair skin allowed him to cross boundaries which many other Black people were unable to access.

In 1929, Romare Bearden graduated from Peabody High School in Pittsburgh. He enrolled in Lincoln University, the nation&#x27;s second oldest historically Black college, founded in 1854. He transferred to Boston University where he served as the art director for &quot;Beanpot&quot;, Boston University&#x27;s student humor magazine. He continued his studies at New York University (NYU), where he started to focus more on his art and less on athletics, and became a lead cartoonist and art editor for &quot;The Medley&quot;, the monthly journal of the secretive Eucleian Society at NYU. Bearden studied art, education, science, and mathematics graduating with a degree in science and education in 1935.

Bearden continued his artistic study under German artist George Grosz at the Art Students League in 1936 and 1937. During this time he supported himself by working as a political cartoonist for African-American newspapers, including the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American,&quot; where he published a weekly cartoon from 1935 until 1937.

== Semi-professional baseball career ==
As a child, Bearden played baseball in empty lots in his neighborhood. He enjoyed sports, throwing discus for his high school track team and trying out for football. After his mother became the New York editor for the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, he did some writing for the paper, including some stories about baseball. But once Bearden transferred from Lincoln University to Boston University, he became the starting fullback for the school football team (1931-2) and then began pitching - first for the freshman team and eventually for the school&#x27;s varsity baseball team. He was awarded a certificate of merit for his pitching at BU, which he hung with pride in subsequent homes throughout his life.

While at Boston University he played for the Boston Tigers, a semi-professional, all Black team based in the neighborhood of Roxbury. He tended to play with them during the BU baseball off-season and had opportunities to play both iconic Negro League and white baseball teams. For example, he pitched against Satchel Paige while playing for the Pittsburgh Crawfords for a summer, and played exhibition games against teams such as the House of David and the Kansas City Monarchs. When Philadelphia Athletics catcher, Mickey Cochrane, brought a number of teammates to play a game against BU, Bearden gave up only one hit—impressing Athletics owner Connie Mack. Mack offered Bearden a place on the Athletics fifteen years before Jackie Robinson became the first Black player in major league baseball. There are conflicting sources as to whether Mack thought Bearden was white or told Bearden he would have to pass for white. Despite the Athletics winning the World Series in 1929 and 1930, and the American League pennant in 1931, Bearden decided he did not want to hide his identity and chose not to play for the Athletics. After two summers with the Boston Tigers, an injury made him rethink the attention he was giving to baseball and he put greater focus into his art, instead.

==Career as an artist==

Bearden grew as an artist by exploring his life experiences. His early paintings were often of scenes in the American South, and his style was strongly influenced by the Mexican muralists, especially Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. In 1935, Bearden became a case worker for the Harlem office of the New York City Department of Social Services. Throughout his career as an artist, Bearden worked as a case worker off and on to supplement his income. During World War II, Bearden joined the United States Army, serving from 1942 until 1945, largely in Europe.

After serving in the army, Bearden joined the Samuel Kootz Gallery, a commercial gallery in New York that featured avant-garde art. He produced paintings at this time in &quot;an expressionistic, linear, semi-abstract style.&quot; He returned to Europe in 1950 to study philosophy with Gaston Bachelard and art history at the Sorbonne, under the auspices of the G.I. Bill. Bearden traveled throughout Europe, visiting Picasso and other artists.

Making major changes in his art, he started producing abstract representations of what he deemed as human, specifically scenes from the Passion of Jesus. He had evolved from what Edward Alden Jewell, a reviewer for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, called a &quot;debilitating focus on Regionalist and ethnic concerns&quot; to what became known as his stylistic approach, which participated in the post-war aims of avant-garde American art. His works were exhibited at the Samuel M. Kootz gallery until it was deemed not abstract enough.

During Bearden&#x27;s success in the gallery, however, he produced &quot;Golgotha,&quot; a painting from his series of the Passion of Jesus (see Figure 1). &quot;Golgotha&quot; is an abstract representation of the Crucifixion. The eye of the viewer is drawn to the middle of the image first, where Bearden has rendered Christ&#x27;s body. The body parts are stylized into abstract geometric shapes, yet are still too realistic to be concretely abstract; this work has a feel of early Cubism. The body is in a central position and darkly contrasted with the highlighted crowds. The crowds of people are on the left and right, and are encapsulated within large spheres of bright colors of purple and indigo. The background of the painting is depicted in lighter jewel tones dissected with linear black ink. Bearden used these colors and contrasts because of the abstract influence of the time, but also for their meanings.
Bearden wanted to explore the emotions and actions of the crowds gathered around the Crucifixion. He worked hard to &quot;depict myths in an attempt to convey universal human values and reactions.&quot; According to Bearden, Christ&#x27;s life, death, and resurrection are the greatest expressions of man&#x27;s humanism, because of the idea of him that lived on through other men. It is why Bearden focuses on Christ&#x27;s body first, to portray the idea of the myth, and then highlights the crowd, to show how the idea is passed on to men.

Bearden was focusing on the spiritual intent. He wanted to show ideas of humanism and thought that cannot be seen by the eye, but &quot;must be digested by the mind&quot;. This is in accordance with his times, during which other noted artists created abstract representations of historically significant events, such as Robert Motherwell&#x27;s commemoration of the Spanish Civil War, Jackson Pollock&#x27;s investigation of Northwest Coast Indian art, Mark Rothko&#x27;s and Barnett Newman&#x27;s interpretations of Biblical stories, etc. Bearden depicted humanity through abstract expressionism after feeling he did not see it during the war. Bearden&#x27;s work was less abstract than these other artists, and Sam Kootz&#x27;s gallery ended its representation of him.

Bearden turned to music, co-writing the hit song &quot;Sea Breeze&quot;, which was recorded by Billy Eckstine and Dizzy Gillespie. It is still considered a jazz classic.
In the late 1950s, Bearden&#x27;s work became more abstract. He used layers of oil paint to produce muted, hidden effects. In 1956, Bearden began studying with a Chinese calligrapher, whom he credits with introducing him to new ideas about space and composition which he used in painting. He also spent much time studying famous European paintings he admired, particularly the work of the Dutch artists Johannes Vermeer, Pieter de Hooch, and Rembrandt. He began exhibiting again in 1960. About this time he and his wife established a second home on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten. In 1961, Bearden joined the Cordier and Ekstrom Gallery in New York City, which would represent him for the rest of his career.

In the early 1960s in Harlem, Bearden was a founding member of the art group known as Spiral, formed &quot;for the purpose of discussing the commitment of the Negro artist in the present struggle for civil liberties, and as a discussion group to consider common aesthetic problems.&quot; The first meeting was held in Bearden&#x27;s studio on July 5, 1963, and was attended by Bearden, Hale Woodruff, Charles Alston, Norman Lewis, James Yeargans, Felrath Hines, Richard Mayhew, and William Pritchard. Woodruff was responsible for naming the group Spiral, suggesting the way in which the Archimedean spiral ascends upward as a symbol of progress. Over time the group expanded to include Merton Simpson, Emma Amos, Reginald Gammon, Alvin Hollingsworth, Calvin Douglas, Perry Ferguson, William Majors and Earle Miller. Stylistically the group ranged from Abstract Expressionists to social protest painters.

Bearden&#x27;s collage work began in 1963 or 1964. He first combined images cut from magazines and colored paper, which he would often further alter with the use of sandpaper, bleach, graphite or paint. Bearden enlarged these collages through the photostat process. Building on the momentum from a successful exhibition of his photostat pieces at the Cordier and Ekstrom Gallery in 1964, Bearden was invited to do a solo exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. This heightened his public profile. Bearden&#x27;s collage techniques changed over the years, and in later pieces he would use blown-up photostat photographic images, silk-screens, colored paper, and billboard pieces to create large collages on canvas and fiberboard. In 1970, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts.

In 1971, the Museum of Modern Art held a retrospective exhibition of Bearden&#x27;s work, which traveled to the University Art Museum in Berkeley, California. The City of Berkeley then commissioned Bearden to create a mural for the City Council chambers. The sixteen-foot-wide mural, incorporating many visual aspects of the city in collage style, was installed in late 1973 and received positive reviews. It was taken down and loaned to a National Gallery of Art Bearden retrospective in 2003 that traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Following that tour it has been in storage while the City Hall building has awaited a seismic retrofit and the city council has been meeting elsewhere. A portion of the mural inspired the city&#x27;s current logo.

During the 1970s, he participated in a community art space called Communications Village operated by printmaker Benjamin Leroy Wigfall in Kingston, NY. Andrews made prints with the help of printer assistants who had been taught printmaking by Wigfall, and he exhibited there.

In the early 1980s, the Maryland Transit Authority commissioned Bearden $114,000 to create &quot;Baltimore Uproar&quot;, a 14&#x27; x 46&#x27; Venetian glass mosaic for the Upton–Avenue Market station. Featuring Baltimore-native Billie Holiday, the mosaic was first built in Italy, and then reassembled upon arrival in Baltimore, before being unveiled in December 1982.

Following Bearden&#x27;s death in March 1988, the Metropolitan Transit Authority in New York City unveiled &quot;City of Glass&quot;, a colored-glass installation situated within the Westchester Sq-E Tremont Av station on the 6 line, made by the artist in collaboration with Benoit Gilsoul and Helmut Schardt, the fabricators. Bearden had originally worked on the project in 1982.

==Personal life and death==
In 1954, at age 42, Bearden married Nanette Rohan, a 27-year-old dancer from Staten Island, New York. She later became an artist and critic. The couple eventually created the Bearden Foundation to assist young artists.

Bearden died in New York City on March 12, 1988, due to complications from bone cancer. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described Bearden in its obituary as &quot;one of America&#x27;s pre-eminent artists&quot; and &quot;the nation&#x27;s foremost collagist.&quot;

==Early works==
His early works suggest the importance of African Americans&#x27; unity and cooperation. For instance, &quot;The Visitation&quot; implies the importance of collaboration of black communities by depicting intimacy between two black women who are holding hands. Bearden&#x27;s vernacular realism represented in the work makes &quot;The Visitation&quot; noteworthy; he describes two figures in &quot;The Visitation&quot; somewhat realistically but does not fully follow pure realism, and distorts and exaggerates some parts of their bodies to &quot;convey an experiential feeling or subjective disposition.&quot; Bearden said, &quot;the Negro artists [...] must not be content with merely recording a scene as a machine. He must enter wholeheartedly into the situation he wishes to convey.&quot;

In 1942, Bearden produced &quot;Factory Workers&quot; (gouache on casein on brown kraft paper mounted on board), which was commissioned by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine to accompany an article titled &quot;The Negro&#x27;s War&quot;. The article &quot;examined the social and financial costs of racial discrimination during wartime and advocated for full integration of the American workplace.&quot; &quot;Factory Workers&quot; and its companion piece &quot;Folk Musicians&quot; serve as prime examples of the influence that Mexican muralists played in Bearden&#x27;s early work.

==Collage==

Bearden had struggled with two artistic sides of himself: his background as &quot;a student of literature and of artistic traditions, and being a black human being involves very real experiences, figurative and concrete,&quot; which was at combat with the mid-twentieth century &quot;exploration of abstraction&quot;. His frustration with abstraction won over, as he himself described his paintings&#x27; focus as coming to a plateau. Bearden then turned to a completely different medium at a very important time for the country.

During the civil rights movement, Bearden started to experiment again, this time with forms of collage. After helping to found an artists group in support of civil rights, Bearden expressed representational and more overtly socially conscious aspects in his work. He used clippings from magazines, which in and of itself was a new medium, as glossy magazines were fairly new. He used these glossy scraps to incorporate modernity in his works, trying to show how African-American rights were moving forward, and so was his socially conscious art. In 1964, he held an exhibition he called &quot;Projections&quot;, where he introduced his new collage style. These works were very well received and are generally considered to be his best work.

Bearden had numerous museum shows of his work since then, including a 1971 show at the Museum of Modern Art entitled &quot;Prevalence of Ritual&quot;, an exhibition of his prints, entitled &quot;A Graphic Odyssey&quot; showing the work of the last fifteen years of his life; and the 2005 National Gallery of Art retrospective entitled &quot;The Art of Romare Bearden&quot;. In 2011, Michael Rosenfeld Gallery exhibited its second show of the artist&#x27;s work, &quot;Romare Bearden (1911–1988): Collage, A Centennial Celebration&quot;, an intimate grouping of 21 collages produced between 1964 and 1983.

One of his most famous series, &quot;Prevalence of Ritual&quot;, concentrates mostly on southern African-American life. He used these collages to show his rejection of the Harmon Foundation&#x27;s (a New York City arts organization) emphasis on the idea that African Americans must reproduce their culture in their art. Bearden found this approach to be a burden on African artists, because he saw the idea as creating an emphasis on reproduction of something that already exists in the world. He used this new series to speak out against this limitation on Black artists, and to emphasize modern art.

In this series, one of the pieces is entitled &quot;Baptism&quot;. Bearden was influenced by Francisco de Zurbarán, and based &quot;Baptism&quot; on Zurbarán&#x27;s painting &quot;The Virgin Protectress of the Carthusians&quot;. Bearden wanted to show how the water that is about to be poured on the subject being baptized is always moving, giving the whole collage a feel and sense of temporal flux. He wanted to express how African Americans&#x27; rights were always changing, and society itself was in a temporal flux at the time. Bearden wanted to show that nothing is fixed, and expressed this idea throughout the image: not only is the subject about to have water poured from the top, but the subject is also to be submerged in water. Every aspect of the collage is moving and will never be the same more than once, which was congruent with society at the time.

In &quot;The Art of Romare Bearden&quot;, Ruth Fine describes his themes as &quot;universal&quot;. &quot;A well-read man whose friends were other artists, writers, poets and jazz musicians, Bearden mined their worlds as well as his own for topics to explore. He took his imagery from both the everyday rituals of African American rural life in the south and urban life in the north, melding those American experiences with his personal experiences and with the themes of classical literature, religion, myth, music and daily human ritual.&quot;

In 2008 a 1984 mural by Romare Bearden in the Gateway Center subway station in Pittsburgh was estimated as worth $15 million, more than the cash-strapped transit agency expected. It raised questions about how it should be cared for once it is removed before the station is demolished.

&quot;We did not expect it to be that much,&quot; Port Authority of Allegheny County spokeswoman Judi McNeil said. &quot;We don&#x27;t have the wherewithal to be a caretaker of such a valuable piece.&quot; It would cost the agency more than $100,000 a year to insure the tile mural, McNeil said. Bearden was paid $90,000 for the project, titled &quot;Pittsburgh Recollections&quot;. It was installed in 1984.

Before his death, Bearden claimed the collage fragments aided him to usher the past into the present: &quot;When I conjure these memories, they are of the present to me, because after all, the artist is a kind of enchanter in time.&quot;

&quot;The Return of Odysseus&quot;, one of his collage works held by the Art Institute of Chicago, exemplifies Bearden&#x27;s effort to represent African-American rights in a form of collage. This collage describes one of the scenes in Homer&#x27;s epic &quot;Odyssey&quot;, in which the hero Odysseus is returning home from his long journey. The viewer&#x27;s eye is first captured by the main figure, Odysseus, situated at the center of the work and reaching his hand to his wife. All the figures are black, enlarging the context of the Greek legend. This is one of the ways in which Bearden works to represent African-American rights; by replacing white characters with blacks, he attempts to defeat the rigidity of historical roles and stereotypes and open up the possibilities and potential of blacks. &quot;Bearden may have seen Odysseus as a strong mental model for the African-American community, which had endured its own adversities and setbacks.&quot; By portraying Odysseus as black, Bearden maximizes the potential for empathy by black audiences.

Bearden said that he used collage because &quot;he felt that art portraying the lives of African Americans did not give full value to the individual. [...] In doing so he was able to combine abstract art with real images so that people of different cultures could grasp the subject matter of the African American culture: The people. This is why his theme always exemplified people of color.&quot; In addition, he said that collage&#x27;s technique of gathering several pieces together to create one assembled work &quot;symbolizes the coming together of tradition and communities.&quot;

== Music ==
In addition to painting, collage, and athletics, Bearden enjoyed music and even composed a number of songs.

In 1960, Loften Mitchell released the three act play, &quot;Star of the Morning&quot;, for which he wrote the script and music, and Bearden and Clyde Fox wrote the lyrics.

A selection of them can be heard on the 2003 album &quot;Romare Bearden Revealed,&quot; created by the Branford Marsalis Quartet.

==Legacy==

The Romare Bearden Foundation was founded two years after his death. The non-profit organization is not only Bearden&#x27;s official estate; it helps &quot;to preserve and perpetuate the legacy of this preeminent American artist.&quot; As of 2015 it has been developing grant-giving programs aimed at funding and supporting children, young (emerging) artists, and scholars.

In Charlotte, a street was named after Bearden, intersecting West Boulevard on the west side of the city. Romare Bearden Drive is lined by the West Boulevard Public Library and rows of townhouses.

Inside the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Main Library (310 N. Tryon Street) is Bearden&#x27;s mosaic, &quot;Before Dawn&quot;. After Bearden&#x27;s death Nanette Rohan, his widow, selected a collage of his to be recreated in smalti (glass tiles) by Crovatto Mosaics in Spilimbergo, Italy for the grand reopening gala (June 18, 1989) of the &quot;new&quot; library. She was honored at the ceremony for her contribution. The reinterpreted work is tall and wide.

The ground breaking for Romare Bearden Park in Charlotte was on September 2, 2011 and the completed park opened in late August 2013. It is situated on a parcel which is located in Third Ward between Church and Mint streets. Bearden lived near the new park for a time as a child, at the corner of what is now MLK Boulevard and Graham Street. The park design is based on work of public artist Norie Sato. Her concepts were inspired by his multimedia collages. Fittingly, the park serves as an entryway to a minor league baseball stadium, BB&amp;T Charlotte Knights Ballpark.
Bearden&#x27;s home in Harlem, New York is a Historic Landmark Preservation site.

DC Moore Gallery currently represents the estate of Romare Bearden. The first exhibition of his works at the gallery was in September 2008. In 2014-15, Columbia University hosted a major Smithsonian Institution travelling exhibition of Bearden&#x27;s work and an accompanying series of lectures, readings, performances, and other events celebrating the artist. On display at the Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Gallery on Columbia&#x27;s Morningside campus, and also at Columbia&#x27;s Global Centers in Paris and Istanbul, &quot;Romare Bearden: A Black Odyssey&quot; focused on the cycle of collages and watercolors Bearden completed in 1977 based on Homer&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;The Odyssey&quot;.

For a 2005 U.S. postal stamp sheet commemorating ten important milestones of the Civil Rights Movement, Beardon&#x27;s 1984 lithograph &quot;The Lamp&quot; was selected to illustrate the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision.

In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service released a set of Forever stamps featuring four of Bearden&#x27;s paintings during a first-day-of-issuance ceremony at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.

In 2017, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond announced acquisition of Romare Bearden&#x27;s collage, &quot;Three Folk Musicians&quot;, as part of the museum&#x27;s permanent collection. The collage, which shows two guitar players and a banjo player, is often cited in art history books. It was shown at the VMFA for the first time in February 2017 in the museum&#x27;s mid- to late 20th-century galleries.

<doc id="26158" wikidata="Q1584348" url="?curid=26158" title="REO Motor Car Company">
<text>The REO Motor Car Company was a company based in Lansing, Michigan, which produced automobiles and trucks from 1905 to 1975. At one point, the company also manufactured buses on its truck platforms.

Ransom E. Olds was an entrepreneur who founded multiple companies in the automobile industry. In 1897 Olds founded Oldsmobile. In 1905 Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Olds had 52% of the stock and the titles of president and general manager. To ensure a reliable supply of parts, he organized a number of subsidiary firms, like the National Coil Company, the Michigan Screw Company, and the Atlas Drop Forge Company.

Originally the company was to be called &quot;R. E. Olds Motor Car Company&quot;, but the owner of Olds&#x27; previous company, then called Olds Motor Works, objected and threatened legal action on the grounds of likely confusion of names by consumers.
Olds then changed the name to his initials. Olds Motor Works soon adopted the popular name of its vehicles, Oldsmobile (which, along with Buick and Cadillac, became a founding division of General Motors Corporation).

The company&#x27;s name was spelled alternately in all capitals REO or with only an initial capital as Reo, and the company&#x27;s own literature was inconsistent in this regard, with early advertising using all capitals, and later advertising using the &quot;Reo&quot; capitalization. The pronunciation, however, was as a single word. Lansing is home to the R. E. Olds Transportation Museum.

== Early production ==

By 1907, REO had gross sales of $4.5 million, and the company was one of the four wealthiest automobile manufacturers in the U.S. After 1908, however, despite the introduction of improved cars designed by Olds, REO&#x27;s share of the automobile market decreased due in part to competition from emerging companies like Ford and General Motors.

REO added a truck-manufacturing division and a Canadian plant in St Catharines, Ontario, in 1910. Two years later, Olds claimed that he had built the best car he could, a tourer able to seat two, four, or five, with a engine, wheelbase, and wheels, for $1,055 (not including top, windshield, or gas tank, which were US$100 extra); self-starter was $25 on top of that.
In 1915, Olds relinquished the title of general manager to his protégé Richard H. Scott, and eight years later he ended his tenure as the company&#x27;s presidency as well, retaining the position of chairman of the board.

Perhaps the most famous REO episode was the 1912 Trans-Canada journey. Traveling from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Vancouver, British Columbia, in a 1912 REO special touring car, mechanic/driver Fonce V. (Jack) Haney and journalist Thomas W. Wilby made the first trip by automobile across Canada (including one short jaunt into northeastern Washington State when the Canadian roads were virtually impassable).

From 1915 to 1925, under Scott&#x27;s direction, REO remained profitable. In 1923, the company sold an early recreational vehicle, called the &quot;Motor Pullman Car&quot;. Designed by Battle Creek, Michigan, newspaper editor J. H. Brown, the automobile included a drop-down sleeping extension, a built-in gas cooking range, and a refrigerator. During 1925, however, Scott, like many of his contemporaries/competitors, began an ambitious expansion program designed to make the company more competitive with other automobile manufacturers by offering cars in different price ranges. The failure of this program and the effects of the Great Depression caused such losses that Olds ended his retirement during 1933 and assumed control of REO again, but resigned in 1934. During 1936, REO abandoned the manufacture of automobiles to concentrate on trucks.

== Reo Flying Cloud and Reo Royale ==

REO&#x27;s two most memorable cars were its Reo Flying Cloud introduced in 1927 and the Reo Royale 8 of 1931.

The Flying Cloud was the first car to use Lockheed&#x27;s new hydraulic internal expanding brake system and featured styling by Fabio Segardi. While Ned Jordan is credited with changing the way advertising was written with his &quot;Somewhere West of Laramie&quot; ads for his Jordan Playboy, Reo&#x27;s Flying Cloud—a name that provoked evocative images of speed and lightness—changed the way automobiles would be named in the future. It had a wheelbase. The final REO model of 1936 was a Flying Cloud.

In April 1927, Reo introduced the Wolverine brand of cars as a companion model to the Flying Cloud. With a Continental engine, artillery wheels, and a different pattern of horizontal radiator louvers from the Flying Cloud, the Wolverine was made until 1928.

The 1931 Reo Royale was a trendsetting design, introducing design elements that were a precedent for true automotive streamlining in the American market. The 8-cylinder model was sold through 1933 with minor updates. The name was used on a lower-priced 6-cylinder model through 1935. Beverly Rae Kimes, editor of the &quot;Standard Catalog of American Cars,&quot; terms the Royale &quot;the most fabulous Reo of all&quot;. In addition to its coachwork by Murray designed by their Amos Northup, the Royale also provided buyers with a straight-eight with a nine-bearing crankshaft, one-shot lubrication, and thermostatically-controlled radiator shutters. The Royale rode upon factory wheelbases of (Model 8-31) and (Model 8-35); a 1932 custom version rode upon a wheelbase (Model 8-52). As many as 3 Dietrich coachbuilt bodies were built on wheelbases in 1931. Beginning in 1933, the Royale also featured as an option REO&#x27;s semi-automatic transmission, the Self-Shifter. This unit was unreliable, and Consumers Union Reports advised readers to avoid it. The Model 8-31 was priced at $2,145. The model 8-35 was priced from $2,745 for the sedan to $3,000 for the convertible coupe. The coachbuilt cars were priced close to $6,000. A convertible Victoria was listed at $3,195 but only one is known to have been built. The 8-35 &amp; 8-52 are considered full CCCA classics.

== After passenger cars ==
Although truck orders during World War II enabled it to revive somewhat, the company remained unstable in the postwar era, resulting in a bankruptcy reorganization. In 1954, the company was still underperforming, and sold its vehicle manufacturing operations (the primary asset of the company) to the Bohn Aluminum and Brass Corporation of Detroit. Three years later, in 1957, Reo&#x27;s vehicle manufacturing operation became a subsidiary of the White Motor Company. White then merged REO with Diamond T Trucks in 1967 to form Diamond Reo Trucks. In 1975, this company filed for bankruptcy and most of its assets were liquidated. Volvo later took over White and thus currently owns the rights to the REO brand name.

Meanwhile, after selling Reo&#x27;s vehicle manufacturing operation to Bohn in 1954, management began liquidating the remainder of the company. For tax reasons a group of shareholders successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The resulting Nuclear Corporation of America, Inc., diversified and purchased other companies to become a conglomerate, spreading into an array of fields including prefabricated housing and steel joist manufacturing in addition to nuclear services. Most of these businesses failed and the company was bankrupt again by 1966. After reorganizing, only the successful steel-joist business remained; the company started producing recycled steel and eventually renamed itself Nucor.

== Studebaker agreement ==

Most Studebaker US6 trucks were built by Studebaker. However, during the Second World War, REO produced a number of them under license from Studebaker. The REO versions of the truck had some changes, such as different door handles and a more powerful engine. It is estimated that REO produced around 20,000 of these trucks and, unlike the original Studebaker trucks which were also used by the United States, the REO versions were only for export to the Soviet Union.

* The band REO Speedwagon took their name from the REO Speed Wagon light delivery truck, an ancestor of pickup trucks.
* The band Diamond Rio took their name from REO&#x27;s successor company Diamond Reo Trucks. The band misspelled &quot;Reo&quot; as &quot;Rio&quot;, but lead singer Marty Roe decided to make a virtue out of his mistake, saying &quot;I like it like that. It has a country-Southwestern flavor&quot;.
* A REO is mentioned in a humorous 1933 short story &quot;The Car We Had to Push&quot; by James Thurber. It tells the story of Thurber’s family car, which would only start if pushed a long way. After several odd adventures, the car is destroyed by a trolley car.
* The Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus exhibited sideshow performers, Tiny Tim and Tom Thumb, driving a scaled-down version of the 1906 Reo Model-A Light Touring Car known as the &quot;Baby Reo&quot;.

<text>Rehavam Ze&#x27;evi ( ; 20 June 1926 – 17 October 2001) was an Israeli general and politician who founded the far-right nationalist Moledet party, mainly advocating for cleansing of the complete Palestinian population through population transfer.

He was assassinated by Hamdi Quran of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) Abu Ali Mustafa Brigades in retaliation for Israel&#x27;s assassination of Abu Ali Mustafa, the Secretary General of the PFLP.

==Biography==
Ze&#x27;evi was born on 20 June 1926 in Jerusalem to a religious Jewish family from the Yemin Moshe neighborhood that had lived in Jerusalem for six generations, and raised on a collective farm. He joined the Palmach in 1942, and served in the Israel Defense Forces after the creation of the State of Israel.

During his youth, Ze&#x27;evi went to school in Givat HaShlosha. One night he shaved his head, wrapped a towel round his waist and entered the food hall. The shaved head and towel around his waist gave an appearance reminiscent of Mohandas Gandhi and earned him &quot;Gandhi&quot; as his nickname, which stuck with him for the rest of his life. The nickname is also attributed to a long Arab dress he wore during his underground days in Palmach. Ze&#x27;evi had five children, Palmach, Sayar, Masada, Tze&#x27;ela and Arava. Palmach is also a member of Moledet and competed with Binyamin Elon for the party&#x27;s leadership.

=== Military career ===

In 1948, Rehavam Ze&#x27;evi was a platoon commander in the IDF. In 1964–1968, he served as Chief of the Department of Staff in the Israeli General Staff. In the late 1960s, Ze&#x27;evi formed the elite Sayeret Kharuv, an anti-terror battalion, at the time when IDF Chief of Staff Haim Bar-Lev had begun to focus manpower and budget on armoured tank units, resulting in huge cutbacks in infantry forces. Over the next five years he served as the Commander of the Central Military District (Hebrew: אלוף פיקוד המרכז). He retired in September 1973, but rejoined the army when the Yom Kippur War broke out on 6 October 1973. A close friend of IDF Chief of Staff David Elazar, he was appointed Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff. He retired with the rank of major-general (אלוף) in 1974.

Ze&#x27;evi, known for his concern for Israel&#x27;s captured or missing soldiers, wore a military identity disc with their names around his neck.

It was revealed in 2004 that Ze&#x27;evi had been chosen to be responsible for the building of the Singapore Armed Forces at a time when he was deputy head of the Operations Branch in IDF. After a secret visit in 1965, he appointed then Colonel to be head of the team of secret military delegation, along with then Lieutenant Colonel and other IDF officers to train and build up Singapore Armed Forces. They were nicknamed &quot;Mexicans&quot; during their stay in Singapore.

=== Political career ===
In 1974, Ze&#x27;evi became consultant on combating terrorism, in the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. The following year he became the prime minister&#x27;s adviser on matters of intelligence. Ze&#x27;evi resigned from this position in 1977, when Likud&#x27;s Menachem Begin became prime minister. In 1988, Ze&#x27;evi established the Moledet (Homeland) party advocating the population transfer of Arabs from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip to the neighboring Arab countries. In the election of that year, he won a seat in the Knesset which he held until his death. 

After the Madrid Conference of 1991, Ze&#x27;evi withdrew from the Likud government of Yitzhak Shamir, remaining in the opposition for a decade. He disagreed strongly with the Labour governments of 1992–1996 (led by Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres) and 1999–2001 (Ehud Barak), however, he looked favourably on the Netanyahu government of 1996–1999 and supported it from the outside.

In 1999, Moledet united with Herut – The National Movement and Tkuma into a single faction – the National Union. Following the election of Ariel Sharon in February 2001, Ze&#x27;evi joined the coalition and was appointed Tourism Minister of Israel. Just two days before his killing he tendered his resignation from the post of tourism minister.

=== Eretz Yisrael Museum ===
In 1981, Ze&#x27;evi was appointed director of what was then the Israel Museum in Tel Aviv and got its name changed to the Eretz Israel Museum – the change having political connotations, given the associations with Eretz Israel. In 1987, he co-edited a series of books describing various aspects of the Land of Israel, based on artifacts from the museum. Ze&#x27;evi was famous for having one of the largest collection of books about Israel and its history.

=== Assassination ===
Ze&#x27;evi was shot in the Dan Jerusalem Hotel, formerly called at the time, the Jerusalem Hyatt Hotel, in Mount Scopus on 17 October 2001 by four Palestinian gunmen. He was taken to the Hadassah Medical Center hospital where he died before 10 am. He was buried in the military cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine took credit for the killing and stated that it was in revenge for the assassination of their secretary-general Abu Ali Mustafa, killed by Israel in August that year. Israel alleges that Ahmed Saadat ordered Ze&#x27;evi&#x27;s assassination. Thousands took part in his funeral. The four gunmen, Hamdi Quran, Basel al-Asmar, Majdi Rahima Rimawi, and Ahad Olma, fled to the Palestinian National Authority. Israel placed Yasser Arafat under siege in the Ramallah compound to force the handing over of the suspects. In April 2002 the US brokered a plan where the suspects were to be jailed in Jericho instead. The four killers were arrested together with the head of Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), Ahmad Sa&#x27;adat. They were imprisoned in a jail in Jericho and guarded by American and British forces. On 14 March 2006, the American and British guards left the jail, charging that the Palestinian Authority was not adhering to the agreement reached with Israel. Israel then launched Operation Bringing Home the Goods, in which it raided the Jericho prison and seized the five.
In December 2007, Hamdi Quran confessed in an Israeli court to assassinating Ze&#x27;evi together with Basel al-Asmar after being instructed by PFLP member Majdi Rahima Rimawi. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. 
In August 2007, Basel al-Asmar was convicted of murder by an Israeli court. In May 2008, he was sentenced to 45 years in prison.
In July 2008, Majdi Rahima Rimawi was convicted of murder by an Israeli court for his part in planning the assassination. According to the verdict, Rehima was the one who supplied the gunmen with a photo of Ze&#x27;evi, details of the hotel in which he would be staying and information on the hotel layout. He was sentenced to life in prison and an additional 80 years.
In December 2008, Ahad Olma, head of the PLFP&#x27;s military wing at the time of the assassination, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his role in instigating and planning the assassination.
In December 2008, an Israeli military court sentenced Ahmad Sa&#x27;adat, leader of the Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), to 30 years in prison for heading an &quot;illegal terrorist organization&quot; and for his responsibility for all actions carried out by his organization.

==Political views==

A few days after the Six Day War, Ze&#x27;evi submitted a plan for the creation of a Palestinian state called the State of Ishmael, with Nablus as its capital. He urged Israel&#x27;s leaders to establish this state as soon as possible, claiming that: &quot;Protracted Israeli military rule will expand the hate and the abyss between the residents of the West Bank and Israel, due to the objective steps that will have to be taken in order to ensure order and security.&quot;

Ze&#x27;evi later advocated the population transfer by agreement of 3.3 million residents of the West Bank and Gaza to Arab nations. He believed this could be accomplished by making life difficult, so they would relocate on their own, through use of military force during wartime, or by agreement with Arab nations. In July 1987, Ze&#x27;evi presented his ideas at a forum in Tel Aviv, describing the plan as a voluntary transfer and the only way to make peace with the Arabs. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, Ze&#x27;evi proposed transferring Palestinians to the east side of the Jordan River to serve as a buffer zone against any Iraqi attempt to attack Israel.

In a radio interview in July 2001, Ze&#x27;evi stated that 180,000 Palestinians worked and lived illegally in Israel. He described them as a &quot;cancer,&quot; and said Israel should rid itself of those who were not Israeli citizens &quot;the same way you get rid of lice.&quot; He called for denying the vote to Arab citizens who did not serve in the army. He believed that Jordan historically belonged to the Tribes of Israel – Gad, Reuven, and Menashe. Zeevi urged Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to &quot;lay waste to the Palestinian Authority&quot; and assassinate PLO leader Yasser Arafat.

Reporting his assassination, the BBC described Ze&#x27;evi as &quot;one of the most controversial politicians in Israel&quot; who &quot;repeatedly called for Arabs to be transferred out of the state and is notorious for using the line: &#x27;Let the Arabs go back to Mecca&#x27;&quot;. Binyamin Elon, leader of the Moledet party after Ze&#x27;evi&#x27;s murder, maintains that Ze&#x27;evi did not hate Arabs. Despite being accused of racism, one of Ze&#x27;evi&#x27;s closest friends was the Muslim Israeli-Arab officer and war hero Amos Yarkoni. Ze&#x27;evi and Yarkoni had worked together in the IDF, and after Yarkoni&#x27;s death Ze&#x27;evi loudly criticised the decision not to bury him in a military cemetery for &quot;halakhic&quot; reasons.

==Controversy==

In 1975, Ehud Olmert, later Prime Minister of Israel, accused Ze&#x27;evi of protecting organized crime figures. Ze&#x27;evi sued Olmert for libel but lost the case. In September 1991, while serving as Minister without Portfolio, he called then US President George H. W. Bush an &quot;anti-Semite.&quot;

In 1997, he called then US Ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk a &quot;yehudon&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;Jewboy&quot;) and challenged him to a fistfight. Indyk responded by calling him a &quot;son of a bitch&quot;. The insult was apparently because the ambassador was urging Israel to make concessions in talks with the Palestinians.

A report in 2016 by a television news magazine aired allegations that Ze&#x27;evi killed unarmed Bedouins, conspired in an attempted murder of a reporter, and raped a soldier under his command. The publication drew calls for an end to government funding for programs that honor the late minister.

== Legacy and commemoration ==
In July 2005, the Knesset passed a law to commemorate Ze&#x27;evi&#x27;s memory. Route 90 was renamed Gandi&#x27;s Road in his honor. Eilat&#x27;s promenade was named for him and there is a life-size statue of him there as well. The community settlement of Merhav Am and the West Bank settlement Ma&#x27;ale Rehav&#x27;am also bear his name.

<text>Robert Fulton (November 14, 1765 – February 24, 1815) was an American engineer and inventor who is widely credited with developing the world&#x27;s first commercially successful steamboat, the (also known as &quot;Clermont&quot;). In 1807, that steamboat traveled on the Hudson River with passengers from New York City to Albany and back again, a round trip of , in 62 hours. The success of his steamboat changed river traffic and trade on major American rivers.

In 1800, Fulton had been commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte, leader of France, to attempt to design a submarine; he then produced , the first practical submarine in history. Fulton is also credited with inventing some of the world&#x27;s earliest naval torpedoes for use by the Royal Navy.

Fulton became interested in steam engines and the idea of steamboats in 1777 when he was around age 12 and visited state delegate William Henry of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who was interested in this topic. Henry had learned about inventor James Watt and his Watt steam engine on an earlier visit to England.

==Early life==

Robert Fulton was born on a farm in Little Britain, Pennsylvania, on November 14, 1765. His father, Robert Fulton, married Mary Smith, daughter of Captain Joseph Smith and sister of Col. Lester Smith, a comparatively well off family. He had three sisters, Isabella, Elizabeth, and Mary, and a younger brother, Abraham.

For six years, he lived in Philadelphia, where he painted portraits and landscapes, drew houses and machinery, and was able to send money home to help support his mother. In 1785, Fulton bought a farm at Hopewell Township in Washington County near Pittsburgh for £80 (equivalent to $ in 2018), and moved his mother and family into it.

==Career==
===Career in Europe (1786–1806)===


In early 1786, Fulton developed symptoms of tuberculosis and was advised by an eminent doctor to take an ocean voyage for the benefit of his health. Fulton traveled to Europe, where he would live for the next twenty years. He left for England in the autumn of 1786, carrying several letters of introduction to Americans abroad from prominent individuals he had met in Philadelphia. He already corresponded with artist Benjamin West; their fathers had been close friends. West took Fulton into his home, where Fulton lived for several years and studied painting. Fulton gained many commissions painting portraits and landscapes, which allowed him to support himself. He continued to experiment with mechanical inventions.

Fulton became caught up in the enthusiasm of the &quot;Canal Mania&quot;. In 1793, he began developing his ideas for canals with inclined planes instead of locks. He obtained a patent for this idea in 1794, and also began working on ideas for the steam power of boats. He published a pamphlet about canals and patented a dredging machine and several other inventions. In 1794, he moved to Manchester to gain practical knowledge of English canal engineering. While there he became friendly with Robert Owen, a cotton manufacturer and early socialist. Owen agreed to finance the development and promotion of Fulton&#x27;s designs for inclined planes and earth-digging machines; he was instrumental in introducing the American to a canal company, which awarded him a sub-contract. But Fulton was not successful at this practical effort and he gave up the contract after a short time.

As early as 1793, Fulton proposed plans for steam-powered vessels to both the United States and British governments. The first steamships had appeared considerably earlier. The earliest steam-powered ship, in which the engine moved oars, was built by Claude de Jouffroy in France. Called &quot;Palmipède&quot;, it was tested on the Doubs in 1776. In 1783, de Jouffroy built , the first paddle steamer, which sailed successfully on the Saône. The first successful trial run of a steamboat in America had been made by inventor John Fitch, on the Delaware River on August 22, 1787. William Symington had successfully tried steamboats in 1788, and it seems probable that Fulton was aware of these developments.

In Britain, Fulton met the Duke of Bridgewater, Francis Egerton, whose canal, the first to be constructed in the country, was being used for trials of a steam tug. Fulton became very enthusiastic about the canals, and wrote a 1796 treatise on canal construction, suggesting improvements to locks and other features. Working for the Duke of Bridgewater between 1796 and 1799, Fulton had a boat constructed in the Duke&#x27;s timber yard, under the supervision of Benjamin Powell. After installation of the machinery supplied by the engineers Bateman and Sherratt of Salford, the boat was duly christened &quot;Bonaparte&quot; in honour of Fulton having served under Napoleon. After expensive trials, because of the configuration of the design, the team feared the paddles might damage the clay lining of the canal and eventually abandoned the experiment. In 1801, Bridgewater instead ordered eight vessels for his canal based on , constructed by Symington.

In 1797, Fulton went to Paris, where he was well known as an inventor. He studied French and German, along with mathematics and chemistry. Fulton also exhibited the first panorama painting to be shown in Paris, Pierre Prévost&#x27;s &quot;Vue de Paris depuis les Tuileries&quot; (1800), on what is still called &quot;Rue des Panoramas&quot; (Panorama Street) today. While living in France, Fulton designed the first working muscle-powered submarine, , between 1793 and 1797. He also experimented with torpedoes. When tested, his submarine operated underwater for 17 minutes in 25 feet of water. He asked the government to subsidize its construction, but he was turned down twice. Eventually, he approached the Minister of Marine and, in 1800, was granted permission to build. The shipyard Perrier in Rouen built it, and the submarine sailed first in July 1800 on the Seine River in the same city.

In France, Fulton met Robert R. Livingston, who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to France in 1801. He also had a scientifically curious mind, and the two men decided to collaborate on building a steamboat and to try operating it on the Seine. Fulton experimented with the water resistance of various hull shapes, made drawings and models, and had a steamboat constructed. At the first trial the boat ran perfectly, but the hull was later rebuilt and strengthened. On August 9, 1803, when this boat was driven up the River Seine, it sank. The boat was long, with an beam, and made between against the current.

In 1804, Fulton switched allegiance and moved to Britain, where he was commissioned by Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger to build a range of weapons for use by the Royal Navy during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion scares. Among his inventions were the world&#x27;s first modern naval &quot;torpedoes&quot; (modern &quot;mines&quot;). These were tested, along with several other of his inventions, during the 1804 Raid on Boulogne, but met with limited success. Although Fulton continued to develop his inventions with the British until 1806, the crushing naval victory by Admiral Horatio Nelson at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar greatly reduced the risk of French invasion. Fulton was increasingly sidelined as a result.

===Career in the United States (1806–1815)===
In 1806, Fulton returned to the United States. In 1807, he and Robert R. Livingston built the first commercially successful steamboat, (later known as &quot;Clermont&quot;). Livingston&#x27;s shipping company began using it to carry passengers between New York City and up the Hudson River to the state capital Albany. &quot;Clermont&quot; made the trip in 32 hours. Passengers on the maiden voyage included a lawyer Jones and his family from Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. His infant daughter Alexandra Jones later served as a Union nurse on a steamboat hospital in the American Civil War.

The Clermont was the first successful steamboat in America. While it was being built people called it &quot;Fulton&#x27;s Folly&quot;. The Clermont had sails as well as a steam engine. At each end of the boat was a short mast with a small square sail that could be unfurled when needed. The engine was in the center of the boat and was surrounded by cord wood. The engine was 24-horsepower. Above the engine was a tall and slender smoke stack. On each side was a big paddle wheel that was open and uncovered. The diameter of the paddle wheels was . The boat itself was long and wide. Its displacement was 160 tons. Fulton received two patents for his steamboat, one in 1809 and the other in 1811.

From 1811 until his death, Fulton was a member of the Erie Canal Commission, appointed by the Governor of New York.

Fulton&#x27;s final design was the floating battery . This, the first steam-driven warship in the world, was built for the United States Navy for the War of 1812. The heavy vessel was not completed until after Fulton&#x27;s death and was named in his honor.

From October 1811 to January 1812, Fulton, along with Livingston and Nicholas Roosevelt (1767–1854), worked together on a joint project to build a new steamboat, , sturdy enough to take down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans, Louisiana. It traveled from industrial Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it was built, with stops at Wheeling, West Virginia; Cincinnati, Ohio; past the &quot;Falls of the Ohio&quot; at Louisville, Kentucky; to near Cairo, Illinois, and the confluence with the Mississippi River; and down past Memphis, Tennessee, and Natchez, Mississippi, to New Orleans some by river from the Gulf of Mexico coast. This was less than a decade after the United States had acquired the Louisiana Territory from France. These rivers were not well settled, mapped, or protected. By achieving this first breakthrough voyage and also proving the ability of the steamboat to travel upstream against powerful river currents, Fulton changed the entire trade and transportation outlook for the American heartland.

Fulton was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.

==Personal life==

Prior to his marriage in 1808, Robert Fulton had a variety of homosexual and polyamorous relationships. Famous among them was a ménage à trois with noted philanthropist couple Ruth and Joel Barlow while living in Paris with them for six years. Letters between them reveal a sexual relationship among all three, including notes from American Revolutionary and patriot Joel Barlow requesting in baby-talk language for him &quot;to have a wonderful summer of sexual pleasure with his wife&quot; while he was away, and, importantly, that &quot;he must not let...his beautiful body be deranged, and if he does anything wrong, he&#x27;ll come and cut off his penis.&quot; After he left Paris, he lived for two years at the castle of William Courtenay, 9th Earl of Devon, a known homosexual, although there is no confirmed epistolary evidence of an explicit sexual relationship between them

On January 8, 1808, Fulton married Harriet Livingston (1783–1826), the daughter of Walter Livingston and niece of Robert R. Livingston, prominent men in the Hudson River area, whose family dated to the colonial era. During his marriage, he proposed a foursome with himself, his wife, and Ruth and Joel Barlow in Washington, DC, but Harriet rejected the offer. Harriet, who was nineteen years his junior, was well educated and was an accomplished amateur painter and musician. Together, they had four children:

* Robert Barlow Fulton (1808–1841), who died unmarried.
* Julia Fulton (1810–1848), who married lawyer Charles Blight of Philadelphia.
* Cornelia Livingston Fulton (1812–1893), who married lawyer Edward Charles Crary (1806–1848) in 1831.
* Mary Livingston Fulton (1813–1861), who married Robert Morris Ludlow (1812–1894), parents of Robert Fulton Ludlow.

Fulton died in 1815 in New York City from tuberculosis (then known as &quot;consumption&quot;). He had been walking home on the frozen Hudson River when one of his friends, Thomas Addis Emmet, fell through the ice. In rescuing his friend, Fulton got soaked with icy water. He is believed to have contracted pneumonia. When he got home, his sickness worsened. He was diagnosed with consumption and died at 49 years old. After his death, his widow remarried to Charles Augustus Dale on November 26, 1816.

He is buried in the Trinity Church Cemetery for Trinity Church (Episcopal) at Wall Street in New York City, near other notable Americans such as former U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton and Albert Gallatin. His descendants include Cory Lidle, a former Major League Baseball pitcher.

==Legacy==
===Posthumous honors===
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania donated a marble statue of Fulton to the National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol. Fulton was also honored for his development of steamship technology in New York City&#x27;s Hudson-Fulton Celebration of the Centennial in 1909. A replica of his first steam-powered steam vessel, &quot;Clermont&quot;, was built for the occasion.

Five ships of the United States Navy have borne the name in honor of Robert Fulton.

Fulton Hall at the United States Merchant Marine Academy houses the Department of Marine Engineering and included laboratories for diesel and steam engineering, refrigeration, marine engineering, thermodynamics, materials testing, machine shop, mechanical engineering, welding, electrical machinery, control systems, electric circuits, engine room simulators and graphics.

Bronze statues of Fulton and Christopher Columbus represent commerce on the balustrade of the galleries of the Main Reading Room in the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. They are two of 16 historical figures, each pair representing one of the 8 pillars of civilization.

The Guatemalan government in 1910 erected a bust of Fulton in one of the parks of Guatemala City.

In 2006, Fulton was inducted into the &quot;National Inventors Hall of Fame&quot; in Alexandria, Virginia.

===In popular culture===
20th Century-Fox&#x27;s 1940 film, &quot;Little Old New York&quot;, based on a 1920 play by Rida Johnson Young, is a fictionalized version of Fulton&#x27;s life from his arrival in New York to the first sailing of &quot;Clermont&quot;. British actor Richard Greene starred as Fulton with Brenda Joyce as Harriet Livingston. Alice Faye and Fred MacMurray played wharf friends who help Fulton overcome problems to realize his dream.

A fictionalized account of Fulton&#x27;s role was produced by BBC television during the 1960s. In the first serial, &quot;Triton&quot; (1961, re-made in 1968), two British naval officers, Captain Belwether and Lieutenant Lamb, are involved in spying on Fulton while he is working for the French. In the sequel, &quot;Pegasus&quot; (1969), they are surprised to find themselves working with Fulton after he changed sides. In the 1961 series, Fulton was played by Reed De Rouen, in the 1968 and 1969 series he was played by Robert Cawdron.

A Robert Fulton cartoon character appears in the 1955 Casper the Friendly Ghost short film &quot;Red, White, and Boo&quot;.

Author James McGee used Fulton&#x27;s experiments in early submarine warfare (against wooden warships) as a major plot element in his 2006 novel &quot;Ratcatcher&quot;.

&quot;Invasion&quot; (2009), the tenth novel in the &quot;Kydd&quot; naval warfare series by Julian Stockwin, uses Fulton and his submarine as an important plot element.

Until 2016, Disney Springs at Walt Disney World had a restaurant named Fulton&#x27;s Crab House with a building in the shape of a steamboat.

<doc id="26162" wikidata="Q682598" url="?curid=26162" title="Real-Time Streaming Protocol">
<text>The Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is an application-level network protocol designed for multiplexing and packetizing multimedia transport streams (such as interactive media, video and audio) over a suitable transport protocol. RTSP is used in entertainment and communications systems to control streaming media servers. The protocol is used for establishing and controlling media sessions between endpoints. Clients of media servers issue commands such as &quot;play&quot;, &quot;record&quot; and &quot;pause&quot;, to facilitate real-time control of the media streaming from the server to a client (video on demand) or from a client to the server (voice recording).

== History ==
RTSP was developed by RealNetworks, Netscape and Columbia University. The first draft was submitted to IETF in October 1996 by Netscape and Progressive Networks, after which Henning Schulzrinne from Columbia University submitted &quot;RTSP՚&quot; (&quot;RTSP prime&quot;) in December 1996. The two drafts were merged for standardization by the Multiparty Multimedia Session Control Working Group (MMUSIC WG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and further drafts were published by the working group. The Proposed Standard for RTSP was published as RFC 2326 in 1998.&lt;br&gt;
RTSP 2.0 published as RFC 7826 in 2016 as a replacement of RTSP 1.0. RTSP 2.0 is based on RTSP 1.0 but is not backwards compatible other than in the basic version negotiation mechanism, and remains a Proposed Standard.

== RTP ==

The transmission of streaming data itself is not a task of RTSP. Most RTSP servers use the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) in conjunction with Real-time Control Protocol (RTCP) for media stream delivery. However, some vendors implement proprietary transport protocols. The RTSP server software from RealNetworks, for example, also used RealNetworks&#x27; proprietary Real Data Transport (RDT).

==Protocol directives==
While similar in some ways to HTTP, RTSP defines control sequences useful in controlling multimedia playback. While HTTP is stateless, RTSP has a state; an identifier is used when needed to track concurrent sessions. Like HTTP, RTSP uses TCP to maintain an end-to-end connection and, while most RTSP control messages are sent by the client to the server, some commands travel in the other direction (i.e. from server to client).

Presented here are the basic RTSP requests. Some typical HTTP requests, like the OPTIONS request, are also available. The default transport layer port number is 554 for both TCP and UDP, the latter being rarely used for the control requests.

=== OPTIONS ===
: An OPTIONS request returns the request types the server will accept.
=== DESCRIBE ===
: A DESCRIBE request includes an RTSP URL (rtsp://...), and the type of reply data that can be handled. This reply includes the presentation description, typically in Session Description Protocol (SDP) format. Among other things, the presentation description lists the media streams controlled with the aggregate URL. In the typical case, there is one media stream each for audio and video streams. The media stream URLs are either obtained directly from the SDP control fields or they are obtained by appending the SDP control field to the aggregate URL.
=== SETUP ===
: A SETUP request specifies how a single media stream must be transported. This must be done before a PLAY request is sent. The request contains the media stream URL and a transport specifier. This specifier typically includes a local port for receiving RTP data (audio or video), and another for RTCP data (meta information). The server reply usually confirms the chosen parameters, and fills in the missing parts, such as the server&#x27;s chosen ports. Each media stream must be configured using SETUP before an aggregate play request may be sent.
=== PLAY ===
: A PLAY request will cause one or all media streams to be played. Play requests can be stacked by sending multiple PLAY requests. The URL may be the aggregate URL (to play all media streams), or a single media stream URL (to play only that stream). A range can be specified. If no range is specified, the stream is played from the beginning and plays to the end, or, if the stream is paused, it is resumed at the point it was paused.
=== PAUSE ===
: A PAUSE request temporarily halts one or all media streams, so it can later be resumed with a PLAY request. The request contains an aggregate or media stream URL. A range parameter on a PAUSE request specifies when to pause. When the range parameter is omitted, the pause occurs immediately and indefinitely.
=== RECORD ===
: This method initiates recording a range of media data according to the presentation description. The timestamp reflects the start and end time(UTC). If no time range is given, use the start or end time provided in the presentation description. If the session has already started, commence recording immediately. The server decides whether to store the recorded data under the request URI or another URI. If the server does not use the request URI, the response should be 201 and contain an entity which describes the states of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location header.
=== ANNOUNCE ===
The ANNOUNCE method serves two purposes:
: When sent from client to server, ANNOUNCE posts the description of a presentation or media object identified by the request URL to a server. When sent from server to client, ANNOUNCE updates the session description in real time. If a new media stream is added to a presentation (e.g., during a live presentation), the whole presentation description should be sent again, rather than just the additional components, so that components can be deleted.
=== TEARDOWN ===
: A TEARDOWN request is used to terminate the session. It stops all media streams and frees all session-related data on the server.
=== GET_PARAMETER ===
: The GET_PARAMETER request retrieves the value of a parameter of a presentation or stream specified in the URI. The content of the reply and response is left to the implementation. GET_PARAMETER with no entity body may be used to test client or server liveness (&quot;ping&quot;).
=== SET_PARAMETER ===
: This method requests to set the value of a parameter for a presentation or stream specified by the URI.
=== REDIRECT ===
: A REDIRECT request informs the client that it must connect to another server location. It contains the mandatory header Location, which indicates that the client should issue requests for that URL. It may contain the parameter Range, which indicates when the redirection takes effect. If the client wants to continue to send or receive media for this URI, the client MUST issue a TEARDOWN request for the current session and a SETUP for the new session at the designated host.
=== Embedded (Interleaved) Binary Data ===
: Certain firewall designs and other circumstances may force a server to interleave RTSP methods and stream data. This interleaving should generally be avoided unless necessary since it complicates client and server operation and imposes additional overhead. Interleaved binary data SHOULD only be used if RTSP is carried over TCP. Stream data such as RTP packets is encapsulated by an ASCII dollar sign (24 hexadecimal), followed by a one-byte channel identifier, followed by the length of the encapsulated binary data as a binary, two-byte integer in network byte order. The stream data follows immediately afterwards, without a CRLF, but including the upper-layer protocol headers. Each $ block contains exactly one upper-layer protocol data unit, e.g., one RTP packet.
== RTSP over HTTP ==
RTSP over HTTP was defined by Apple in 1999 and . It interleaves the RTP Video and Audio data into the RTSP Command Connection (as defined in RFC2326), and then sends the RTSP Command Connection via a pair of HTTP connections, one is a long running GET connection and the other is a long running POST connection.

This method is also used in the ONVIF IP Camera standard and can be combined with HTTPS for secure and encrypted video and audio.

== RTSP Encryption and RTSPS ==
There are several different methods for encrypting RTSP command messages and the RTP Video and Audio data.

RTSP 2.0 (RFC7826) defines several methods for encryption and introduces a new rtsps:// URL and many of these have been incorporated into RFC2326 RTSP 1.0 Clients and Servers.

* RTSPS URL (using the rtsps:// URL) - This method uses a TLS Socket (default of Port 322) to establish an encrypted connection between the RTSP client and the RTSP Server.&lt;br&gt;Video and Audio can then sent in one of two ways
** TCP Video/Audio - The RTP Video and Audio is sent interleaved with the RTSP Commands over the already encrypted TLS Connection
** UDP and Multicast-UDP Video/Audio - the RTP Video and Audio is encrypted using the Secure RTP (SRTP) protocol and sent in parallel to the RTSPS TLS connection
* RTSP over HTTPS - this method interleaves the RTP Video and Audio data into the RTSP Command Connection (as defined in RFC2326) and then sends the RTSP Command Connection via a pair of encrypted HTTPS connections. It uses Port 443 by default.

IANA have reserved the rtsps:// URL prefix and Port 322 for RTSPS. As of September 2024, RTSP over HTTPS has been implemented in several ONVIF IP Cameras and RTSPS (using the rtsps:// URL) has been implemented by Axis and Bosch CCTV Cameras, FFmpeg, GStreamer, MediaMTX, Ant Media Server and SharpRTSP.

<text>The Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) is a network protocol for delivering audio and video over IP networks. RTP is used in communication and entertainment systems that involve streaming media, such as telephony, video teleconference applications including WebRTC, television services and web-based push-to-talk features.

RTP typically runs over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). RTP is used in conjunction with the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). While RTP carries the media streams (e.g., audio and video), RTCP is used to monitor transmission statistics and quality of service (QoS) and aids synchronization of multiple streams. RTP is one of the technical foundations of Voice over IP and in this context is often used in conjunction with a signaling protocol such as the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) which establishes connections across the network.

RTP was developed by the Audio-Video Transport Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and first published in 1996 as which was then superseded by in 2003.

==Overview==
Research on audio and video over packet-switched networks dates back to the early 1970s. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) published in 1977 and began developing RTP in 1992, and would go on to develop Session Announcement Protocol (SAP), the Session Description Protocol (SDP), and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

RTP is designed for end-to-end, real-time transfer of streaming media. The protocol provides facilities for jitter compensation and detection of packet loss and out-of-order delivery, which are common, especially during UDP transmissions on an IP network. RTP allows data transfer to multiple destinations through IP multicast. RTP is regarded as the primary standard for audio/video transport in IP networks and is used with an associated profile and payload format. The design of RTP is based on the architectural principle known as application-layer framing where protocol functions are implemented in the application as opposed to the operating system&#x27;s protocol stack.

Real-time multimedia streaming applications require timely delivery of information and often can tolerate some packet loss to achieve this goal. For example, loss of a packet in an audio application may result in loss of a fraction of a second of audio data, which can be made unnoticeable with suitable error concealment algorithms. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), although standardized for RTP use, is not normally used in RTP applications because TCP favors reliability over timeliness. Instead, the majority of the RTP implementations are built on the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Other transport protocols specifically designed for multimedia sessions are SCTP and DCCP, although, , they were not in widespread use.

RTP was developed by the Audio/Video Transport working group of the IETF standards organization. RTP is used in conjunction with other protocols such as H.323 and RTSP. The RTP specification describes two protocols: RTP and RTCP. RTP is used for the transfer of multimedia data, and the RTCP is used to periodically send control information and QoS parameters.

The data transfer protocol, RTP, carries real-time data. Information provided by this protocol includes timestamps (for synchronization), sequence numbers (for packet loss and reordering detection) and the payload format which indicates the encoded format of the data. The control protocol, RTCP, is used for quality of service (QoS) feedback and synchronization between the media streams. The bandwidth of RTCP traffic compared to RTP is small, typically around 5%.

RTP sessions are typically initiated between communicating peers using a signaling protocol, such as H.323, the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), RTSP, or Jingle (XMPP). These protocols may use the Session Description Protocol to specify the parameters for the sessions.

An RTP session is established for each multimedia stream. Audio and video streams may use separate RTP sessions, enabling a receiver to selectively receive components of a particular stream. The RTP and RTCP design is independent of the transport protocol. Applications most typically use UDP with port numbers in the unprivileged range (1024 to 65535). The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) may be used when a reliable transport protocol is desired. The RTP specification recommends even port numbers for RTP and the use of the next odd port number for the associated RTCP session. A single port can be used for RTP and RTCP in applications that multiplex the protocols. 

RTP is used by real-time multimedia applications such as voice over IP, audio over IP, WebRTC, Internet Protocol television, and professional video over IP including SMPTE 2022 and SMPTE 2110.

==Profiles and payload formats==
RTP is designed to carry a multitude of multimedia formats, which permits the development of new formats without revising the RTP standard. To this end, the information required by a specific application of the protocol is not included in the generic RTP header. For each class of application (e.g., audio, video), RTP defines a &quot;profile&quot; and associated &quot;payload formats&quot;. Every instantiation of RTP in a particular application requires a profile and payload format specifications.

The profile defines the codecs used to encode the payload data and their mapping to payload format codes in the protocol field &quot;Payload Type&quot; (PT) of the RTP header. Each profile is accompanied by several payload format specifications, each of which describes the transport of particular encoded data. Examples of audio payload formats are G.711, G.723, G.726, G.729, GSM, QCELP, MP3, and DTMF, and examples of video payloads are H.261, H.263, H.264, H.265 and MPEG-1/MPEG-2. The mapping of MPEG-4 audio/video streams to RTP packets is specified in , and H.263 video payloads are described in .

Examples of RTP profiles include:
* The &quot;RTP profile for Audio and video conferences with minimal control&quot; () defines a set of static payload type assignments, and a dynamic mechanism for mapping between a payload format, and a PT value using Session Description Protocol (SDP).
* The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) () defines an RTP profile that provides cryptographic services for the transfer of payload data.
* The experimental &quot;Control Data Profile for RTP&quot; (RTP/CDP) for machine-to-machine communications.

==Packet header==
RTP packets are created at the application layer and handed to the transport layer for delivery. Each unit of RTP media data created by an application begins with the RTP packet header.
The RTP header has a minimum size of 12 bytes. After the header, optional header extensions may be present. This is followed by the RTP payload, the format of which is determined by the particular class of application. The fields in the header are as follows:
* Version: (2 bits) Indicates the version of the protocol. Current version is 2.
* P (Padding): (1 bit) Used to indicate if there are extra padding bytes at the end of the RTP packet. Padding may be used to fill up a block of certain size, for example as required by an encryption algorithm. The last byte of the padding contains the number of padding bytes that were added (including itself).
* X (Extension): (1 bit) Indicates presence of an &quot;extension header&quot; between the header and payload data. The extension header is application or profile specific.
* CC (CSRC count): (4 bits) Contains the number of CSRC identifiers (defined below) that follow the SSRC (also defined below).
* M (Marker): (1 bit) Signaling used at the application level in a profile-specific manner. If it is set, it means that the current data has some special relevance for the application.
* PT (Payload type): (7 bits) Indicates the format of the payload and thus determines its interpretation by the application. Values are profile specific and may be dynamically assigned.
* Sequence number: (16 bits) The sequence number is incremented for each RTP data packet sent and is to be used by the receiver to detect packet loss and to accommodate out-of-order delivery. The initial value of the sequence number should be randomized to make known-plaintext attacks on Secure Real-time Transport Protocol more difficult.
* Timestamp: (32 bits) Used by the receiver to play back the received samples at appropriate time and interval. When several media streams are present, the timestamps may be independent in each stream. The granularity of the timing is application specific. For example, an audio application that samples data once every 125 μs (8 kHz, a common sample rate in digital telephony) would use that value as its clock resolution. Video streams typically use a 90 kHz clock. The clock granularity is one of the details that is specified in the RTP profile for an application.
* SSRC: (32 bits) &quot;Synchronization source identifier&quot; uniquely identifies the source of a stream. The synchronization sources within the same RTP session will be unique.
* CSRC: (32 bits each, the number of entries is indicated by the &quot;CSRC count&quot; field) &quot;Contributing source IDs&quot; enumerate contributing sources to a stream that has been generated from multiple sources.
* Header extension: (optional, presence indicated by &quot;Extension&quot; field) The first 32-bit word contains a profile-specific identifier (16 bits) and a length specifier (16 bits) that indicates the length of the extension in 32-bit units, excluding the 32 bits of the extension header. The extension header data follows.

==Application design==
A functional multimedia application requires other protocols and standards used in conjunction with RTP. Protocols such as SIP, Jingle, RTSP, H.225 and H.245 are used for session initiation, control and termination. Other standards, such as H.264, MPEG and H.263, are used for encoding the payload data as specified by the applicable RTP profile.

An RTP sender captures the multimedia data, then encodes, frames and transmits it as RTP packets with appropriate timestamps and increasing timestamps and sequence numbers. The sender sets the &quot;payload type&quot; field in accordance with connection negotiation and the RTP profile in use. The RTP receiver detects missing packets and may reorder packets. It decodes the media data in the packets according to the payload type and presents the stream to its user.

<text>Robert Newton Calvert (9 March 1945 – 14 August 1988) was a South African-British writer, poet, and musician. He is principally known for his role as lyricist, performance poet and lead vocalist of the space rock band Hawkwind.

==Early life==
Calvert was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and moved with his parents to England when he was two. He attended school in London and Margate, living in a flat in Arlington House. Having finished school he joined the Air Training Corps, in which he became a corporal and played trumpet for the 438 Squadron band. He then went on to college in Canterbury. After leaving college, and having been denied his childhood dream of becoming a fighter pilot, he slowly acquainted himself with the UK&#x27;s bohemian scene. Calvert began his career in earnest by writing poetry.

==Career==
In 1967 he formed the street theatre group &#x27;Street Dada Nihilismus&#x27;.

At the end of the 1960s, he returned to London and joined the city&#x27;s flourishing psychedelic subculture. He soon became one of its most active members; joining, amongst other activities, &quot;Frendz&quot;, one of the leading underground magazines of the time. During that time he acquainted himself with New Wave science fiction writers and befriended author Michael Moorcock. Calvert&#x27;s poems were published in &quot;New Worlds&quot; and other magazines. Although he was influenced by the New Wave, Calvert developed a distinct style of his own. His ability to change fluently between poetry, music and theatre allowed him to develop into a multimedia artist.

===Hawkwind===
A childhood friend of Hawkwind co-founder Nik Turner, Calvert joined Hawkwind as a lyricist, performance poet and occasional lead vocalist in 1971. Following a two-year absence, he rejoined as the band&#x27;s principal lead vocalist in 1975 before leaving once again in 1979. Calvert co-wrote Hawkwind&#x27;s hit single &quot;Silver Machine&quot;, which reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart. Although Lemmy sings on the single version, this is an overdub of a live recording taken at the Roundhouse in London with Calvert on vocals. &quot;They tried everyone else singing it except me&quot;, Lemmy later said. Calvert also directed the &quot;Space Ritual&quot; tour, which is widely perceived as the band&#x27;s artistic zenith.

During periods away from Hawkwind duties, Calvert worked on his solo career; his solo creative output included albums, stage plays, poetry, and a novel. His first solo album, &quot;Captain Lockheed and the Starfighters&quot;, was released in 1974. The record is a concept album, an amalgam of music and theatre focused around the Lockheed bribery scandals. In 1975, he won the Capital Radio poetry competition with his poem &quot;Circle Line&quot;. In 1975, musician and producer Brian Eno produced and played on Calvert&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Lucky Leif and the Longships&quot;, a concept album which looked at the history of the US and the Vikings, who crossed the Atlantic to reach America before Columbus. In 1977, Hawkwind performed &quot;Quark, Strangeness and Charm&quot; on Marc Bolan&#x27;s TV series, &quot;Marc&quot;.

As well as Michael Moorcock and Brian Eno, Calvert&#x27;s collaborators included Arthur Brown, Steve Peregrin Took, Jim Capaldi, Steve Pond, Inner City Unit, Vivian Stanshall, Nektar, John Greaves, Adrian Wagner, Amon Düül II and, posthumously, Spirits Burning, Dave Brock, and Krankschaft.

Calvert suffered from bipolar disorder, which often caused a fractious relationship with his fellow musicians. At one point he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

==Death==
Aged 43, Calvert died of a heart attack in 1988 in Ramsgate, England, outside of the &quot;Corner House&quot; café. As he approached the street, he reached for a pay phone, but the nearest phone had been disconnected. He was buried in Minster Cemetery at Minster-in-Thanet. His gravestone is engraved with the line &quot;Love&#x27;s not Time&#x27;s fool&quot;, from William Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnet 116.

<text>Rhythm and blues, frequently abbreviated as R&amp;B or R&#x27;n&#x27;B, is a genre of popular music that originated within the Black American community in the 1940s. The term was originally used by record companies to describe recordings marketed predominantly to African Americans, at a time when &quot;rocking, jazz based music ... [with a] heavy, insistent beat&quot; was starting to become more popular.
In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of a piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists. R&amp;B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American history and experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of societal racism, oppression, relationships, economics, and aspirations.

The term &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; has undergone a number of shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-1950s, after this style of music had contributed to the development of rock and roll, the term &quot;R&amp;B&quot; became used in a wider context. It referred to music styles that developed from and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. By the 1970s, the term &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; had changed once again and was used as a blanket term for soul and funk.

In the late 1980s, a newer style of R&amp;B developed, becoming known as &quot;contemporary R&amp;B&quot;. This contemporary form combines rhythm and blues with various elements of pop, soul, funk, disco, hip hop, and electronic music.

==Etymology, definitions and description==
Although Jerry Wexler of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine is credited with coining the term &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; as a musical term in the United States in 1948, the term had been used in &quot;Billboard&quot; as early as 1943. However, the company&#x27;s first list of songs popular among African Americans was named Harlem Hit Parade; created in 1942, it listed the &quot;most popular records in Harlem,&quot; and is the predecessor to the &quot;Billboard&quot; RnB chart. &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot; replaced the common term &quot;race music&quot;, a term coined by Okeh producer Ralph Peer based on the common self description by the African American press as &quot;people of race.&quot; The term &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; was then used by &quot;Billboard&quot; in its chart listings from June 1949 until August 1969, when its &quot;Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues Singles&quot; chart was renamed as &quot;Best Selling Soul Singles&quot;.
Before the &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot; name was instated, various record companies had already begun replacing the term &quot;race music&quot; with the term &quot;sepia series&quot;. &quot;Rhythm and blues&quot; is often abbreviated as &quot;R&amp;B&quot; or &quot;R&#x27;n&#x27;B&quot;.

In the early 1950s, the term &quot;rhythm &amp; blues&quot; was frequently applied to blues records. Writer and producer Robert Palmer defined rhythm &amp; blues as &quot;a catchall term referring to any music that was made by and for black Americans&quot;. He has also used the term &quot;R&amp;B&quot; as a synonym for jump blues. However, AllMusic separates it from jump blues because of R&amp;B&#x27;s stronger gospel influences. Lawrence Cohn, author of &quot;Nothing but the Blues&quot;, writes that &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; was an umbrella term invented for industry convenience. According to him, the term embraced all black music except classical music and religious music, unless a gospel song sold enough to break into the charts. Well into the 21st century, the term R&amp;B continues in use (in some contexts) to categorize music made by black musicians, as distinct from styles of music made by other musicians.

In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, and saxophone. Arrangements were rehearsed to the point of effortlessness and were sometimes accompanied by background vocalists. Simple repetitive parts mesh, creating momentum and rhythmic interplay producing mellow, lilting, and often hypnotic textures while calling attention to no individual sound. While singers are emotionally engaged with the lyrics, often intensely so, they remain cool, relaxed, and in control. The bands dressed in suits, and even uniforms, a practice associated with the modern popular music that rhythm and blues performers aspired to dominate. Lyrics often seemed fatalistic, and the music typically followed predictable patterns of chords and structure. R&amp;B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, as well as triumphs and failures in terms of relationships, economics, and aspirations.

One publication of the Smithsonian Institution provided this summary of the origins of the genre in 2016.&quot;A distinctly African American music drawing from the deep tributaries of African American expressive culture, it is an amalgam of jump blues, big band swing, gospel, boogie, and blues that was initially developed during a thirty-year period that bridges the era of legally sanctioned racial segregation, international conflicts, and the struggle for civil rights&quot;.

The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame defines some of the originators of R&amp;B, including Joe Turner&#x27;s big band, Louis Jordan&#x27;s Tympany Five, James Brown and LaVern Baker. In fact, this source states that &quot;Louis Jordan joined Turner in laying the foundation for R&amp;B in the 1940s, cutting one swinging rhythm &amp; blues masterpiece after another&quot;. Other artists who were &quot;cornerstones of R&amp;B and its transformation into rock &amp; roll&quot; include Etta James, Fats Domino, Roy Brown, Little Richard and Ruth Brown. The &quot;doo wop&quot; groups were also noteworthy, including the Orioles, the Ravens and the Dominoes.

The term &quot;rock and roll&quot; had a strong sexual connotation in jump blues and R&amp;B, but when DJ Alan Freed referred to rock and roll on mainstream radio in the mid-1950s, &quot;the sexual component had been dialed down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing&quot;.

==History==
===Precursors===
The great migration of Black Americans to the urban industrial centers of Chicago, Detroit, New York City, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and elsewhere in the 1920s and 1930s created a new market for jazz, blues, and related genres of music. These genres of music were often performed by full-time musicians, either working alone or in small groups. The precursors of rhythm and blues came from jazz and blues, which overlapped in the late-1920s and 30s through the work of musicians such as the Harlem Hamfats, with their 1936 hit &quot;Oh Red&quot;, as well as Lonnie Johnson, Leroy Carr, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, and T-Bone Walker. There was also increasing emphasis on the electric guitar as a lead instrument, as well as the piano and saxophone.

===Late 1940s===
R&amp;B originated in African-American communities in the 1940s. In 1948, RCA Victor was marketing black music under the name &quot;Blues and Rhythm&quot;. In that year, Louis Jordan dominated the top five listings of the R&amp;B charts with three songs, and two of the top five songs were based on the boogie-woogie rhythms that had come to prominence during the 1940s. Jordan&#x27;s band, the Tympany Five (formed in 1938), consisted of him on saxophone and vocals, along with musicians on trumpet, tenor saxophone, piano, bass and drums. Lawrence Cohn described the music as &quot;grittier than his boogie-era jazz-tinged blues&quot;. Robert Palmer described it as &quot;urbane, rocking, jazz-based music ... [with a] heavy, insistent beat&quot;. Jordan&#x27;s music, along with that of Big Joe Turner, Roy Brown, Billy Wright, and Wynonie Harris, before 1949, was referred to as jump blues. Then, Paul Gayten, Roy Brown, and others had had hits in the style now referred to as rhythm and blues. In 1948, Wynonie Harris&#x27;s remake of Brown&#x27;s 1947 recording &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot; reached number two on the charts, following band leader Sonny Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Long Gone&quot; at number one.

In 1949, the term &quot;Rhythm and Blues&quot; (R&amp;B) replaced the Billboard category &quot;Harlem Hit Parade&quot;. Also in that year, &quot;The Huckle-Buck&quot;, recorded by band leader and saxophonist Paul Williams, was the number one R&amp;B tune, remaining on top of the charts for nearly the entire year. Written by musician and arranger Andy Gibson, the song was described as a &quot;dirty boogie&quot; because it was risque and raunchy. Paul Williams and His Hucklebuckers&#x27; concerts were sweaty riotous affairs that got shut down on more than one occasion. Their lyrics, by Roy Alfred (who later co-wrote the 1955 hit &quot;(The) Rock and Roll Waltz&quot;), were mildly sexually suggestive, and one teenager from Philadelphia said &quot;That Hucklebuck was a very nasty dance&quot;. Also in 1949, a new version of a 1920s blues song, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&#x27;s Business&quot; was a number four hit for Jimmy Witherspoon, and Louis Jordan and the Tympany Five once again made the top five with &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot;. Many of these hit records were issued on new independent record labels, such as Savoy (founded 1942), King (founded 1943), Imperial (founded 1945), Specialty (founded 1946), Chess (founded 1947), and Atlantic (founded 1948).

===Afro-Cuban rhythmic influence===
African American music began incorporating Afro-Cuban rhythmic motifs in the 1800s with the popularity of the Cuban contradanza (known outside of Cuba as the habanera). The &quot;habanera rhythm&quot; can be thought of as a combination of tresillo and the backbeat.

For the more than a quarter-century in which the cakewalk, ragtime and proto-jazz were forming and developing, the Cuban genre &quot;habanera&quot; exerted a constant presence in African American popular music. Jazz pioneer Jelly Roll Morton considered the tresillo/habanera rhythm (which he called the Spanish tinge) to be an essential ingredient of jazz. There are examples of tresillo-like rhythms in some African American folk music such as the hand-clapping and foot-stomping patterns in ring shout, post-Civil War drum and fife music, and New Orleans second line music. Wynton Marsalis considers tresillo to be the New Orleans &quot;clave&quot; (although technically, the pattern is only half a clave). Tresillo is the most basic duple-pulse rhythmic cell in Sub-Saharan African music traditions, and its use in African American music is one of the clearest examples of African rhythmic retention in the United States. The use of tresillo was continuously reinforced by the consecutive waves of Cuban music, which were adopted into North American popular culture. In 1940 Bob Zurke released &quot;Rhumboogie&quot;, a boogie-woogie with a tresillo bass line, and lyrics proudly declaring the adoption of Cuban rhythm:

Although originating in the metropolis at the mouth of the Mississippi River, New Orleans blues, with its Afro-Caribbean rhythmic traits, is distinct from the sound of the Mississippi Delta blues. In the late 1940s, New Orleans musicians were especially receptive to Cuban influences precisely at the time when R&amp;B was first forming. The first use of tresillo in R&amp;B occurred in New Orleans. Robert Palmer recalls:


In a 1988 interview with Palmer, Bartholomew (who had the first R&amp;B studio band), revealed how he initially superimposed tresillo over swing rhythm:
Bartholomew referred to the Cuban son by the misnomer &quot;rumba&quot;, a common practice of that time. Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, produced by Bartholomew, is another example of this now classic use of tresillo in R&amp;B. Bartholomew&#x27;s 1949 tresillo-based &quot;Oh Cubanas&quot; is an attempt to blend African American and Afro-Cuban music. The word &quot;mambo&quot;, larger than any of the other text, is placed prominently on the record label. In his composition &quot;Misery&quot;, New Orleans pianist Professor Longhair plays a habanera-like figure in his left hand. The deft use of triplets is a characteristic of Longhair&#x27;s style.

Gerhard Kubik notes that with the exception of New Orleans, early blues lacked complex polyrhythms, and there was a &quot;very specific absence of asymmetric time-line patterns (key patterns) in virtually all early-twentieth-century African American music... only in some New Orleans genres does a hint of simple time line patterns occasionally appear in the form of transient so-called &#x27;stomp&#x27; patterns or stop-time chorus. These do not function in the same way as African timelines.&quot; In the late 1940s, this changed somewhat when the two-celled timeline structure was brought into the blues. New Orleans musicians such as Bartholomew and Longhair incorporated Cuban instruments, as well as the clave pattern and related two-celled figures in songs such as &quot;Carnival Day&quot;, (Bartholomew 1949) and &quot;Mardi Gras In New Orleans&quot; (Longhair 1949). While some of these early experiments were awkward fusions, the Afro-Cuban elements were eventually integrated fully into the New Orleans sound.

Robert Palmer reports that, in the 1940s, Professor Longhair listened to and played with musicians from the islands and &quot;fell under the spell of Perez Prado&#x27;s mambo records.&quot; He was especially enamored with Afro-Cuban music. Michael Campbell states: &quot;Professor Longhair&#x27;s influence was... far-reaching. In several of his early recordings, Professor Longhair blended Afro-Cuban rhythms with rhythm and blues. The most explicit is &#x27;Longhair&#x27;s Blues Rhumba,&#x27; where he overlays a straightforward blues with a clave rhythm.&quot; Longhair&#x27;s particular style was known locally as &quot;rumba-boogie&quot;. In his &quot;Mardi Gras in New Orleans&quot;, the pianist employs the 2–3 clave onbeat/offbeat motif in a rumba boogie &quot;guajeo&quot;.

The syncopated, but straight subdivision feel of Cuban music (as opposed to swung subdivisions) took root in New Orleans R&amp;B during this time. Alexander Stewart states that the popular feel was passed along from &quot;New Orleans—through James Brown&#x27;s music, to the popular music of the 1970s,&quot; adding: &quot;The singular style of rhythm &amp; blues that emerged from New Orleans in the years after World War II played an important role in the development of funk. In a related development, the underlying rhythms of American popular music underwent a basic, yet generally unacknowledged transition from a triplet or shuffle feel to even or straight eighth notes. Concerning the various funk motifs, Stewart states that this model &quot;...is different from a time line (such as clave and tresillo) in that it is not an exact pattern, but more of a loose organizing principle.&quot;

Johnny Otis released the R&amp;B mambo &quot;Mambo Boogie&quot; in January 1951, featuring congas, maracas, claves, and mambo saxophone guajeos in a blues progression. Ike Turner recorded &quot;Cubano Jump&quot; (1954) an electric guitar instrumental, which is built around several 2–3 clave figures, adopted from the mambo. The Hawketts, in &quot;Mardi Gras Mambo&quot; (1955) (featuring the vocals of a young Art Neville), make a clear reference to Perez Prado in their use of his trademark &quot;Unhh!&quot; in the break after the introduction.

Ned Sublette states: &quot;The electric blues cats were very well aware of Latin music, and there was definitely such a thing as &quot;rhumba blues&quot;; you can hear Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf playing it.&quot; He also cites Otis Rush, Ike Turner and Ray Charles, as R&amp;B artists who employed this feel.

The use of clave in R&amp;B coincided with the growing dominance of the backbeat, and the rising popularity of Cuban music in the U.S. In a sense, clave can be distilled down to tresillo (three-side) answered by the backbeat (two-side).


The &quot;Bo Diddley beat&quot; (1955) is perhaps the first true fusion of 3–2 clave and R&amp;B/rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Bo Diddley has given different accounts of the riff&#x27;s origins. Sublette asserts: &quot;In the context of the time, and especially those maracas [heard on the record], &#x27;Bo Diddley&#x27; has to be understood as a Latin-tinged record. A rejected cut recorded at the same session was titled only &#x27;Rhumba&#x27; on the track sheets.&quot; Johnny Otis&#x27;s &quot;Willie and the Hand Jive&quot; (1958) is another example of this successful blend of 3–2 claves and R&amp;B. Otis used the Cuban instruments claves and maracas on the song.

Afro-Cuban music was the conduit by which African American music was &quot;re-Africanized&quot;, through the adoption of two-celled figures like clave and Afro-Cuban instruments like the conga drum, bongos, maracas and claves. According to John Storm Roberts, R&amp;B became the vehicle for the return of Cuban elements into mass popular music. Ahmet Ertegun, producer for Atlantic Records, is reported to have said that &quot;Afro-Cuban rhythms added color and excitement to the basic drive of R&amp;B.&quot; As Ned Sublette points out though: &quot;By the 1960s, with Cuba the object of a United States embargo that still remains in effect today, the island nation had been forgotten as a source of music. By the time people began to talk about rock and roll as having a history, Cuban music had vanished from North American consciousness.&quot;

===Early to mid-1950s===

At first, only African Americans were buying R&amp;B discs. According to Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records, sales were localized in African-American markets; there were no white sales or white radio play. During the early 1950s, more white teenagers started to become aware of R&amp;B and began purchasing the music. For example, 40% of 1952 sales at Dolphin&#x27;s of Hollywood record shop, located in an African-American area of Los Angeles, were to whites. Eventually, white teens across the country turned their musical taste toward rhythm and blues.

Johnny Otis, who had signed with the Newark, New Jersey–based Savoy Records, produced many R&amp;B hits in 1951, including &quot;Double Crossing Blues&quot;, &quot;Mistrustin&#x27; Blues&quot; and &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, all of which hit number one that year. Otis scored ten top ten hits that year. Other hits include &quot;Gee Baby&quot;, &quot;Mambo Boogie&quot; and &quot;All Nite Long&quot;. The Clovers, a quintet consisting of a vocal quartet with accompanying guitarist, sang a distinctive-sounding combination of blues and gospel. They had the number five hit of the year with &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know I Love You&quot; on Atlantic. Also in July 1951, Cleveland, Ohio DJ Alan Freed started a late-night radio show called &quot;The Moondog Rock Roll House Party&quot; on WJW (850 AM). Freed&#x27;s show was sponsored by Fred Mintz, whose R&amp;B record store had a primarily African-American clientele. Freed began referring to the rhythm and blues music he played as &quot;rock and roll&quot;.

In 1951 Little Richard Penniman began recording for RCA Records in the jump blues style of late 1940s stars Roy Brown and Billy Wright. However, it was not until he recorded a demo in 1954 that caught the attention of Specialty Records that the world would start to hear his new uptempo funky rhythm and blues that would catapult him to fame in 1955 and help define the sound of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. A rapid succession of rhythm and blues hits followed, beginning with &quot;Tutti Frutti&quot; and &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, which would influence performers such as James Brown, Elvis Presley, and Otis Redding.

Also in 1951, the song Rocket 88 was recorded by Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm at a studio owned by Sam Phillips with the vocal by Jackie Brenston. This song is often cited as a precursor to rock and roll or as one of the first records in that genre. In a later interview, however, Ike Turner offered this comment: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. I think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is R&amp;B, but I think &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is the &quot;cause&quot; of rock and roll existing&quot;.

Ruth Brown, performing on the Atlantic label, placed hits in the top five every year from 1951 through 1954: &quot;Teardrops from My Eyes&quot;, &quot;Five, Ten, Fifteen Hours&quot;, &quot;(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean&quot; and &quot;What a Dream&quot;. Faye Adams&#x27;s &quot;Shake a Hand&quot; made it to number two in 1952. In 1953, the R&amp;B record-buying public made Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s original recording of Leiber and Stoller&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; the year&#x27;s number three hit. Ruth Brown was very prominent among female R&amp;B stars; her popularity most likely came from &quot;her deeply rooted vocal delivery in African American tradition&quot;. That same year The Orioles, a doo-wop group, had the number four hit of the year with &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot;.

Fats Domino made the top 30 of the pop charts in 1952 and 1953, then the top 10 with &quot;Ain&#x27;t That a Shame&quot;. Ray Charles came to national prominence in 1955 with &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;. Big Bill Broonzy said of Charles&#x27;s music: &quot;He&#x27;s mixing the blues with the spirituals... I know that&#x27;s wrong.&quot;

In 1954 the Chords&#x27; &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; became the first hit to cross over from the R&amp;B chart to hit the top 10 early in the year. Late in the year, and into 1955, &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot; by the Charms made the top 20.

At Chess Records in the spring of 1955, Bo Diddley&#x27;s debut record &quot;Bo Diddley&quot;/&quot;I&#x27;m a Man&quot; climbed to number two on the R&amp;B charts and popularized Bo Diddley&#x27;s own original rhythm and blues clave-based vamp that would become a mainstay in rock and roll.

At the urging of Leonard Chess at Chess Records, Chuck Berry reworked a country fiddle tune with a long history, entitled &quot;Ida Red&quot;. The resulting &quot;Maybellene&quot; was not only a number three hit on the R&amp;B charts in 1955, but also reached into the top 30 on the pop charts. Alan Freed, who had moved to the much larger market of New York City in 1954, helped the record become popular with white teenagers. Freed had been given part of the writing credit by Chess in return for his promotional activities, a common practice at the time.

R&amp;B was also a strong influence on rock and roll. A 1985 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, titled, &quot;Rock! It&#x27;s Still Rhythm and Blues&quot; reported that the &quot;two terms were used interchangeably&quot; until about 1957. The other sources quoted in the article said that rock and roll combined R&amp;B with pop and country music.

Fats Domino was not convinced that there was any new genre. In 1957, he said, &quot;What they call rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll now is rhythm and blues. I&#x27;ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&amp;B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties&quot;.

===Late 1950s===

In 1956, an R&amp;B &quot;Top Stars of &#x27;56&quot; tour took place, with headliners Al Hibbler, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and Carl Perkins, whose &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; was very popular with R&amp;B music buyers. Some of the performers completing the bill were Chuck Berry, Cathy Carr, Shirley &amp; Lee, Della Reese, Sam &quot;T-Bird&quot; Jensen, the Cleftones, and the Spaniels with Illinois Jacquet&#x27;s Big Rockin&#x27; Rhythm Band. Cities visited by the tour included Columbia, South Carolina; Annapolis, Maryland; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, New York; and other cities. In Columbia, the concert ended with a near riot as Perkins began his first song as the closing act. Perkins is quoted as saying, &quot;It was dangerous. Lot of kids got hurt&quot;. In Annapolis, 50,000 to 70,000 people tried to attend a sold-out performance with 8,000 seats. Roads were clogged for seven hours.
Filmmakers took advantage of the popularity of &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; musicians as &quot;rock n roll&quot; musicians beginning in 1956. Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Big Joe Turner, the Treniers, the Platters, and the Flamingos all made it onto the big screen.

Two Elvis Presley records made the R&amp;B top five in 1957: &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;/&quot;Treat Me Nice&quot; at number one, and &quot;All Shook Up&quot; at number five, an unprecedented acceptance of a non-African American artist into a music category known for being created by blacks. Nat King Cole, also a jazz pianist who had two hits on the pop charts in the early 1950s (&quot;Mona Lisa&quot; at number two in 1950 and &quot;Too Young&quot; at number one in 1951), had a record in the top five in the R&amp;B charts in 1958, &quot;Looking Back&quot;/&quot;Do I Like It&quot;.

In 1959, two black-owned record labels, one of which would become hugely successful, made their debut: Sam Cooke&#x27;s Sar and Berry Gordy&#x27;s Motown Records. Brook Benton was at the top of the R&amp;B charts in 1959 and 1960 with one number one and two number two hits. Benton had a certain warmth in his voice that attracted a wide variety of listeners, and his ballads led to comparisons with performers such as
Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett. Lloyd Price, who in 1952 had a number one hit with &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, regained predominance with a version of &quot;Stagger Lee&quot; at number one and &quot;Personality&quot; at number five in 1959.

The white bandleader of the Bill Black Combo, Bill Black, who had helped start Elvis Presley&#x27;s career and was Elvis&#x27;s bassist in the 1950s, was popular with black listeners. Ninety percent of his record sales were from black people, and his &quot;Smokie, Part 2&quot; (1959) rose to the number one position on black music charts. He was once told that &quot;a lot of those stations still think you&#x27;re a black group because the sound feels funky and black.&quot; Hi Records did not feature pictures of the Combo on early records.

===1960s–1970s===
Sam Cooke&#x27;s number five hit &quot;Chain Gang&quot; is indicative of R&amp;B in 1960, as is pop rocker Chubby Checker&#x27;s number five hit &quot;The Twist&quot;. By the early 1960s, the music industry category previously known as rhythm and blues was being called soul music, and similar music by white artists was labeled blue-eyed soul. Motown Records had its first million-selling single in 1960 with the Miracles&#x27; &quot;Shop Around&quot;, and in 1961, Stax Records had its first hit with Carla Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Gee Whiz (Look at His Eyes)&quot;. Stax&#x27;s next major hit, The Mar-Keys&#x27; instrumental &quot;Last Night&quot; (also released in 1961), introduced the rawer Memphis soul sound for which Stax became known. In Jamaica, R&amp;B influenced the development of ska. In 1969, black culture and rhythm and blues reached another great achievement when the Grammys added the Rhythm and Blues category, giving academic recognition to the category.

By the 1970s, the term &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; was being used as a blanket term for soul, funk, and disco.

===Since the 1980s===

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, hip-hop started to capture the imagination of America&#x27;s youth. R&amp;B started to become homogenized, with a group of high-profile producers responsible for most R&amp;B hits. It was hard for R&amp;B artists of the era to sell their music or even have their music heard because of the rise of hip-hop, but some adopted a &quot;hip-hop&quot; image, were marketed as such, and often featured rappers on their songs. In 1990, &quot;Billboard&quot; reintroduced R&amp;B to categorize all of Black popular music other than hip-hop. Newer artists such as Usher, R. Kelly, Janet Jackson, TLC, Aaliyah, Brandy, Destiny&#x27;s Child, Tevin Campbell and Mary J. Blige enjoyed success. L.A. Reid, the CEO of LaFace Records, was responsible for some of R&amp;B&#x27;s greatest successes in the 1990s in the form of Usher, TLC and Toni Braxton. Later, Reid successfully marketed Boyz II Men. In 2004, 80% of the songs that topped the R&amp;B charts were also at the top of the Hot 100. That period was the all-time peak for R&amp;B and hip hop on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and on Top 40 Radio. From about 2005 to 2013, R&amp;B sales declined. However, since 2010, hip-hop has started to take cues from the R&amp;B sound, choosing to adopt a softer, smoother sound that incorporates traditional R&amp;B with rappers such as Drake, who has opened an entire new door for the genre. This sound has gained in popularity and created great controversy for both hip-hop and R&amp;B as to how to identify it. In 2010, the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame was founded by LaMont &quot;ShowBoat&quot; Robinson.

==Jewish influence in the business end of rhythm and blues==

According to the Jewish writer, music publishing executive, and songwriter Arnold Shaw, during the 1940s in the US, there was generally little opportunity for Jews in the WASP-controlled realm of mass communications, but the music business was &quot;wide open for Jews as it was for blacks&quot;. Jews played a key role in developing and popularizing African American music, including rhythm and blues, and the independent record business was dominated by young Jewish men who promoted the sounds of black music.

==British rhythm and blues==
British rhythm and blues and blues rock developed in the early 1960s, largely as a response to the recordings of American artists, often brought over by African American servicemen stationed in Britain or seamen visiting ports such as London, Liverpool, Newcastle and Belfast. Many bands, particularly in the developing London club scene, tried to emulate black rhythm and blues performers, resulting in a &quot;rawer&quot; or &quot;grittier&quot; sound than the more popular &quot;beat groups&quot;. During the 1960s, Geno Washington, the Foundations, and the Equals gained pop hits. Many British black musicians helped form the British R&amp;B scene. These included Geno Washington, an American singer stationed in England with the Air Force. He was invited to join what became Geno Washington &amp; the Ram Jam Band by guitarist Pete Gage in 1965 and enjoyed top 40 hit singles and two top 10 albums before the band split up in 1969. Another American GI, Jimmy James, born in Jamaica, moved to London after two local number one hits in 1960 with The Vagabonds, who built a strong reputation as a live act. They released a live album and their studio debut, &quot;The New Religion,&quot; in 1966 and achieved moderate success with a few singles before the original Vagabonds broke up in 1970. White blues rock musician Alexis Korner formed new jazz rock band CCS in 1970. Interest in the blues would influence major British rock musicians, including Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, Peter Green, and John Mayall, the groups Free and Cream adopted an interest in a wider range of rhythm and blues styles.

The Rolling Stones became the second most popular UK band (after the Beatles) and led the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of the US pop charts. The Rolling Stones covered Bobby Womack &amp; the Valentinos&#x27; song &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot;, giving them their first UK number one in 1964. Under the influence of blues and R&amp;B, bands such as the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, and the Animals, and more jazz-influenced bands like the Graham Bond Organisation and Zoot Money, had blue-eyed soul albums. White R&amp;B musicians popular in the UK included Steve Winwood, Frankie Miller, Scott Walker &amp; the Walker Brothers, the Animals from Newcastle, the Spencer Davis Group, and Van Morrison &amp; Them from Belfast. None of these bands exclusively played rhythm and blues, but it remained at the core of their early albums.

Champion Jack Dupree was a New Orleans blues and boogie woogie pianist who toured Europe and settled there from 1960, living in Switzerland and Denmark, then in Halifax, England in the 1970s and 1980s, before finally settling in Germany. From the 1970s to 1980s, Carl Douglas, Hot Chocolate, Delegation, Junior, Central Line, Princess, Jacki Graham, David Grant, the Loose Ends, the Pasadenas and Soul II Soul gained hits on the pop or R&amp;B charts. The music of the British mod subculture grew out of rhythm and blues and later soul performed by artists who were not available to the small London clubs where the scene originated. In the late 1960s, the Who performed American R&amp;B songs such as the Motown hit &quot;Heat Wave&quot;, a song which reflected the young mod lifestyle. Many of these bands enjoyed national success in the UK, but found it difficult to break into the American music market. The British white R&amp;B bands produced music which was very different in tone from that of African-American artists.

<text>René-Théophile-Hyacinthe Laennec (; 17 February 1781 – 13 August 1826) was a French physician and musician. His skill at carving his own wooden flutes led him to invent the stethoscope in 1816, while working at the Hôpital Necker. He pioneered its use in diagnosing various chest conditions.
He became a lecturer at the in 1822 and professor of medicine in 1823. His final appointments were that of head of the medical clinic at the Hôpital de la Charité and professor at the Collège de France. He went into a coma and subsequently died of tuberculosis on 13 August 1826, at age 45.

==Early life==
Laennec was born in Quimper (Brittany). His mother died of tuberculosis when he was five years old, and he went to live with his great-uncle the Abbé Laennec (a priest). As a child, Laennec became ill with lassitude and repeated instances of pyrexia. Laennec was also thought to have asthma. At the age of twelve, he proceeded to Nantes, where his uncle, Guillaime-François Laennec, worked in the faculty of medicine at the university. Laennec was a gifted student.

His father (a lawyer) later discouraged him from continuing as a doctor and René then had a period of time where he took long walks in the country, danced, studied Greek, and wrote poetry. However, in 1799 he returned to study. Laennec studied medicine at the University of Paris under several famous physicians, including Dupuytren and Jean-Nicolas Corvisart-Desmarets. There he was trained to use sound as a diagnostic aid. Corvisart advocated the re-introduction of percussion during the French Revolution.

==Invention of the stethoscope==
René Laennec wrote in the classic treatise &quot;De l&#x27;Auscultation Médiate&quot;,

In 1816, [he was] consulted by a young woman laboring under general symptoms of diseased heart, and in whose case percussion and the application of the hand were of little avail on account of the great degree of fatness. The other method just mentioned direct auscultation being rendered inadmissible by the age and sex of the patient, I happened to recollect a simple and well-known fact in acoustics, ... the great distinctness with which we hear the scratch of a pin at one end of a piece of wood on applying our ear to the other. Immediately, on this suggestion, I rolled a quire of paper into a kind of cylinder and applied one end of it to the region of the heart and the other to my ear, and was not a little surprised and pleased to find that I could thereby perceive the action of the heart in a manner much more clear and distinct than I had ever been able to do by the immediate application of my ear.

Laennec had discovered that the new stethoscope was superior to the normally used method of placing the ear over the chest, particularly if the patient was overweight. A stethoscope also avoided the embarrassment of placing the ear against the chest of a woman.

Laennec is said to have seen school children playing with a long piece of solid wood in the days leading up to his innovation.
The children held their ear to one end of the stick while the opposite end was scratched with a pin, the stick transmitted and amplified the scratch. His skill as a flautist may also have inspired him. He built his first instrument as a 25 cm by 2.5 cm hollow wooden cylinder, which he later refined into three detachable parts. The refined design featured a funnel-shaped cavity to augment the sound, separable from the body of the stethoscope.

His clinical work allowed him to follow chest patients from bedside to the autopsy table. He was therefore able to correlate sounds captured by his new instruments with specific pathological changes in the chest, in effect pioneering a new non-invasive diagnostic tool. Pulmonary phthisis, for example, was one ailment he could more clearly identify using his knowledge of typical and atypical chest sounds. Laennec was the first to classify and discuss the terms rales, rhonchi, crepitance, and egophony – terms that doctors now use on a daily basis during physical exams and diagnoses. Laënnec presented his findings and research on the stethoscope to the French Academy of Sciences, and in 1819 he published his masterpiece &quot;On Mediate Auscultation&quot;.

Laennec coined the phrase &quot;mediate auscultation&quot; (indirect listening), as opposed to the popular practice at the time of directly placing the ear on the chest (immediate auscultation). He named his instrument the stethoscope, from the Greek words &quot;[stethos]&quot; (chest), and &quot;[skopos]&quot; (examination).

The stethoscope quickly gained popularity as &quot;De l&#x27;Auscultation Médiate&quot; was translated and distributed across France, England, Italy, and Germany in the early 1820s. However, not all doctors readily embraced the new stethoscope. Although the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; reported the invention of the stethoscope two years later in 1821, as late as 1885, a professor of medicine stated, &quot;He that hath ears to hear, let him use his ears and not a stethoscope.&quot; Even the founder of the American Heart Association, L.A. Connor (1866–1950), carried a silk handkerchief with him to place on the wall of the chest for ear auscultation.

Laennec often referred to the stethoscope as &quot;the cylinder&quot;, and as he neared death only a few years later, he bequeathed his own stethoscope to his nephew, referring to it as &quot;the greatest legacy of my life&quot;.

The modern type, with two earpieces, was invented in 1851 by A. Leared; in 1852 G.P. Cammann perfected the design of the instrument for commercial production, which has become the current standard form.

==Other medical contributions==

He developed the understanding of peritonitis and cirrhosis. Although the disease of cirrhosis was known, Laennec gave cirrhosis its name, using the Greek word ( &quot;kirrhos&quot;, tawny) that referred to the tawny, yellow nodules characteristic of the disease.

He coined the term &quot;melanoma&quot; and described &quot;metastases&quot; of melanoma to the lungs. In 1804, while still a medical student, he was the first person to lecture on melanoma. This lecture was subsequently published in 1805. Laennec actually used the term &quot;melanose&quot;, which he derived from the Greek (, &quot;melan&quot;, &quot;mela&quot;) for &quot;black&quot;. Over the years, there were bitter exchanges between Laennec and Dupuytren, the latter objecting that there was no mention of his work in this area and his role in its discovery.

He also studied tuberculosis. Coincidentally, his nephew, Mériadec Laennec, is said to have diagnosed tuberculosis in Laennec using Laennec&#x27;s stethoscope. Laennec wrote &quot;A Treatise on the Disease of the Chest&quot;, in which he focused on diseases of the chest such as &quot;phthisis pulmonalis&quot; (tuberculosis) and diagnostics such as &quot;pectoriloquy&quot;. He discussed the symptoms of Phthisis pulmonalis and what parts of the body it affects. It was written in an academic manner for learning purposes.

Laennec advocated objective scientific observation. Professor Benjamin Ward Richardson stated in &quot;Disciples of Aesculapius&quot; that &quot;the true student of medicine reads Laennec&#x27;s treatise on mediate auscultation and the use of the stethoscope once in two years at least as long as he is in practice. It ranks with the original work of Vesalius, Harvey and Hippocrates.&quot;

== Religious views ==

Laennec &quot;was intensely religious and was a devout Catholic all his life&quot;. He was noted as a very kind man and his charity to the poor became proverbial. Austin Flint, the 1884 president of the American Medical Association, said that &quot;Laennec&#x27;s life affords a striking instance among others disproving the vulgar error that the pursuit of science is unfavourable to religious faith.&quot;

In J. Forbes&#x27; annotated translation of Laennec&#x27;s treatise, Forbes reported:

== Laennec in fiction ==
A Rene Laennec appears in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Rewards and Fairies&quot;, the second of two books where two children, Dan and Una, encounter past inhabitants of England. In the short section &quot;Marlake Witches&quot;, set during the Napoleonic Wars, Una meets a consumptive young lady who speaks of being treated by a French doctor, a prisoner on parole, one Rene Laennec. This prisoner discusses with a local herbalist the use of &#x27;wooden trumpets&#x27; for listening to patients&#x27; chests, much to the distrust of the local doctor. Obviously, Kipling was aware of Laennec&#x27;s work and invented an English connection.

He was the subject of a 1949 French film &quot;Doctor Laennec&quot; in which he was played by Pierre Blanchar.

==Laennec&#x27;s landmarks in Paris==
On the exterior wall of the &quot;Hôpital Necker – Enfants Malades&quot;, where Laennec wrote &quot;Mediate auscultation&quot;, near the entrance of the hospital in 149, Rue de Sèvres, there is a marble memorial tablet with an engraved portrait of Laennec and this inscription: &quot;Dans cet hôpital Laennec découvrit l&#x27;auscultation. 1781–1826&quot;.

<doc id="26171" wikidata="Q122634" url="?curid=26171" title="Robin Hood">
<text>Robin Hood is a legendary heroic outlaw originally depicted in English folklore and subsequently featured in literature, theatre, and cinema. According to legend, he was a highly skilled archer and swordsman. In some versions of the legend, he is depicted as being of noble birth, and in modern retellings he is sometimes depicted as having fought in the Crusades before returning to England to find his lands taken by the Sheriff. In the oldest known versions, he is instead a member of the yeoman class. He is traditionally depicted dressed in Lincoln green. Today, he is most closely associated with his stance of &quot;robbing the rich to give to the poor&quot; (i.e. redistribution of income and wealth).

There exists no canonical version of the Robin Hood mythos, which has resulted in different creators imbuing their adaptations with different messages over the centuries. Adaptations have often vacillated between a libertarian version of Robin Hood perceived to oppose oppressive taxation and a socialist version perceived to propound wealth redistribution. The latter vision is the one most congruent with pop culture representations of the 20th and 21st centuries and is thus the one most familiar to most people nowadays.

Through retellings, additions, and variations, a body of familiar characters associated with Robin Hood has been created. These include his lover, Maid Marian; his band of outlaws, the Merry Men; and his chief opponent, the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Sheriff is often depicted as assisting Prince John in usurping the rightful but absent King Richard, to whom Robin Hood remains loyal. He became a popular folk figure in the Late Middle Ages, and his partisanship of the common people and opposition to the Sheriff are some of the earliest-recorded features of the legend, whereas his political interests and setting during the Angevin era developed in later centuries. The earliest known ballads featuring him are from the 15th century.

There have been numerous variations and adaptations of the story over the subsequent years, and the story continues to be widely represented in literature, film, and television media today. Robin Hood is considered one of the best-known tales of English folklore. In popular culture, the term &quot;Robin Hood&quot; is often used to describe a heroic outlaw or rebel against tyranny.

The origins of the legend as well as the historical context have been debated for centuries. There are numerous references to historical figures with similar names that have been proposed as possible evidence of his existence, some dating back to the late 13th century. At least eight plausible origins to the story have been mooted by historians and folklorists, including suggestions that &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was a stock alias used by or in reference to bandits.

==Ballads and tales==
The first clear reference to &quot;rhymes of Robin Hood&quot; is from the alliterative poem &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;, thought to have been composed in the 1370s, followed shortly afterwards by a quotation of a later common proverb, &quot;many men speak of Robin Hood and never shot his bow&quot;, in &quot;Friar Daw&#x27;s Reply&quot; ( 1402) and a complaint in &quot;Dives and Pauper&quot; (1405–1410) that people would rather listen to &quot;tales and songs of Robin Hood&quot; than attend Mass. Robin Hood is also mentioned in a famous Lollard tract dated to the first half of the fifteenth century (thus also possibly predating his other earliest historical mentions) alongside several other folk heroes such as Guy of Warwick, Bevis of Hampton, and Sir Lybeaus.

However, the earliest surviving copies of the narrative ballads that tell his story date to the second half of the 15th century, or the first decade of the 16th century. In these early accounts, Robin Hood&#x27;s partisanship of the lower classes, his devotion to the Virgin Mary and associated special regard for women, his outstanding skill as an archer, his anti-clericalism, and his particular animosity towards the Sheriff of Nottingham are already clear. Little John, Much the Miller&#x27;s Son, and Will Scarlet (as Will &quot;Scarlok&quot; or &quot;Scathelocke&quot;) all appear, although not yet Maid Marian or Friar Tuck. The friar has been part of the legend since at least the later 15th century, when he is mentioned in a Robin Hood play script.

In modern popular culture, Robin Hood is typically seen as a contemporary and supporter of the late-12th-century king Richard the Lionheart, Robin being driven to outlawry during the misrule of Richard&#x27;s brother John while Richard was away at the Third Crusade. This view first gained currency in the 16th century. It is not supported by the earliest ballads. The early compilation, &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;, names the king as &#x27;Edward&#x27;; and while it does show Robin Hood accepting the King&#x27;s pardon, he later repudiates it and returns to the greenwood. The oldest surviving ballad, &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot;, gives even less support to the picture of Robin Hood as a partisan of the true king. The setting of the early ballads is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th century or the 14th, although it is recognised they are not necessarily historically consistent.

The early ballads are also quite clear on Robin Hood&#x27;s social status: he is a yeoman. While the precise meaning of this term changed over time, including free retainers of an aristocrat and small landholders, it always referred to commoners. The essence of it in the present context was &quot;neither a knight nor a peasant or &#x27;husbonde&#x27; but something in between&quot;. Artisans (such as millers) were among those regarded as &#x27;yeomen&#x27; in the 14th century. From the 16th century on, there were attempts to elevate Robin Hood to the nobility, such as in Richard Grafton&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle at Large&quot;; Anthony Munday presented him at the very end of the century as the Earl of Huntingdon in two extremely influential plays, as he is still commonly presented in modern times.

As well as ballads, the legend was also transmitted by &#x27;Robin Hood games&#x27; or plays that were an important part of the late medieval and early modern May Day festivities. The first record of a Robin Hood game was in 1426 in Exeter, but the reference does not indicate how old or widespread this custom was at the time. The Robin Hood games are known to have flourished in the later 15th and 16th centuries. It is commonly stated as fact that Maid Marian and a jolly friar (at least partly identifiable with Friar Tuck) entered the legend through the May Games.

=== Early ballads ===

The earliest surviving text of a Robin Hood ballad is the 15th-century &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot;. This is preserved in Cambridge University manuscript Ff.5.48. Written after 1450, it contains many of the elements still associated with the legend, from the Nottingham setting to the bitter enmity between Robin and the local sheriff.

The first printed version is &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; ( 1500), a collection of separate stories that attempts to unite the episodes into a single continuous narrative. After this comes &quot;Robin Hood and the Potter&quot;, contained in a manuscript of 1503. &quot;The Potter&quot; is markedly different in tone from &quot;The Monk&quot;: whereas the earlier tale is &quot;a thriller&quot; the latter is more comic, its plot involving trickery and cunning rather than straightforward force.

Other early texts are dramatic pieces, the earliest being the fragmentary &quot;Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham&quot; ( 1475). These are particularly noteworthy as they show Robin&#x27;s integration into May Day rituals towards the end of the Middle Ages; &quot;Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham&quot;, among other points of interest, contains the earliest reference to Friar Tuck.

The plots of neither &quot;the Monk&quot; nor &quot;the Potter&quot; are included in the &quot;Gest&quot;; and neither is the plot of &quot;Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne&quot;, which is probably at least as old as those two ballads although preserved in a more recent copy. Each of these three ballads survived in a single copy, so it is unclear how much of the medieval legend has survived, and what has survived may not be typical of the medieval legend. It has been argued that the fact that the surviving ballads were preserved in written form in itself makes it unlikely they were typical; in particular, stories with an interest for the gentry were by this view more likely to be preserved. The story of Robin&#x27;s aid to the &#x27;poor knight&#x27; that takes up much of the Gest may be an example.

The character of Robin in these first texts is rougher edged than in his later incarnations. In &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot;, for example, he is shown as quick tempered and violent, assaulting Little John for defeating him in an archery contest; in the same ballad, Much the Miller&#x27;s Son casually kills a &quot;little page&quot; in the course of rescuing Robin Hood from prison. No extant early ballad actually shows Robin Hood &quot;giving to the poor&quot;, although in &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; Robin does make a large loan to an unfortunate knight, which he does not in the end require to be repaid; and later in the same ballad Robin Hood states his intention of giving money to the next traveller to come down the road if he happens to be poor.

As it happens the next traveller is not poor, but it seems in context that Robin Hood is stating a general policy. The first explicit statement to the effect that Robin Hood habitually robbed from the rich to give the poor can be found in John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Annales of England&quot; (1592), about a century after the publication of the Gest. But from the beginning Robin Hood is on the side of the poor; the Gest quotes Robin Hood as instructing his men that when they rob:

And in its final lines the &quot;Gest&quot; sums up:

Within Robin Hood&#x27;s band, medieval forms of courtesy rather than modern ideals of equality are generally in evidence. In the early ballad, Robin&#x27;s men usually kneel before him in strict obedience: in &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; the king even observes that &quot;&quot; Their social status, as yeomen, is shown by their weapons: they use swords rather than quarterstaffs. The only character to use a quarterstaff in the early ballads is the potter, and Robin Hood does not take to a staff until the 17th-century &quot;Robin Hood and Little John&quot;.

The political and social assumptions underlying the early Robin Hood ballads have long been controversial. J. C. Holt influentially argued that the Robin Hood legend was cultivated in the households of the gentry, and that it would be mistaken to see in him a figure of peasant revolt. He is not a peasant but a yeoman, and his tales make no mention of the complaints of the peasants, such as oppressive taxes. He appears not so much as a revolt against societal standards as an embodiment of them, being generous, pious, and courteous, opposed to stingy, worldly, and churlish foes. Other scholars have by contrast stressed the subversive aspects of the legend, and see in the medieval Robin Hood ballads a plebeian literature hostile to the feudal order.

===Early plays, May Day games, and fairs===

By the early 15th century at the latest, Robin Hood had become associated with May Day celebrations, with revellers dressing as Robin or as members of his band for the festivities. This was not common throughout England, but in some regions the custom lasted until Elizabethan times, and during the reign of Henry VIII, was briefly popular at court. Robin was often allocated the role of a May King, presiding over games and processions, but plays were also performed with the characters in the roles, sometimes performed at church ales, a means by which churches raised funds.

A complaint of 1492, brought to the Star Chamber, accuses men of acting riotously by coming to a fair as Robin Hood and his men; the accused defended themselves on the grounds that the practice was a long-standing custom to raise money for churches, and they had not acted riotously but peaceably.

It is from the association with the May Games that Robin&#x27;s romantic attachment to Maid Marian (or Marion) apparently stems. A &quot;Robin and Marion&quot; figured in 13th-century French &#x27;pastourelles&#x27; (of which &quot;Jeu de Robin et Marion&quot; 1280 is a literary version) and presided over the French May festivities; &quot;This Robin and Marion tended to preside, in the intervals of the attempted seduction of the latter by a series of knights, over a variety of rustic pastimes.&quot; In the &quot;Jeu de Robin and Marion&quot;, Robin and his companions have to rescue Marion from the clutches of a &quot;lustful knight&quot;. This play is distinct from the English legends, although Dobson and Taylor regard it as &#x27;highly probable&#x27; that this French Robin&#x27;s name and functions travelled to the English May Games, where they fused with the Robin Hood legend. Both Robin and Marian were certainly associated with May Day festivities in England (as was Friar Tuck), but these may have been originally two distinct types of performance. Alexander Barclay in his &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, writing in 1500, refers to &quot; – but the characters were brought together. Marian did not immediately gain the unquestioned role; in &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Birth, Breeding, Valor, and Marriage&quot;, his sweetheart is &quot;Clorinda the Queen of the Shepherdesses&quot;. Clorinda survives in some later stories as an alias of Marian.

The earliest preserved script of a Robin Hood play is the fragmentary &quot;Robyn Hod and the Shryff off Notyngham&quot; This apparently dates to the 1470s and circumstantial evidence suggests it was probably performed at the household of Sir John Paston. This fragment appears to tell the story of Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne. There is also an early playtext appended to a 1560 printed edition of the Gest. This includes a dramatic version of the story of Robin Hood and the Curtal Friar and a version of the first part of the story of Robin Hood and the Potter. (Neither of these ballads is known to have existed in print at the time, and there is no earlier record known of the &quot;Curtal Friar&quot; story.) The publisher describes the text as a &quot;, but does not seem to be aware that the text actually contains two separate plays. An especial point of interest in the &quot;Friar&quot; play is the appearance of a ribald woman who is unnamed but apparently to be identified with the bawdy Maid Marian of the May Games. She does not appear in extant versions of the ballad.

===Early modern stage===
James VI of Scotland was entertained by a Robin Hood play at Dirleton Castle produced by his favourite the Earl of Arran in May 1585, while there was plague in Edinburgh.

In 1598, Anthony Munday wrote a pair of plays on the Robin Hood legend, &quot;The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington&quot; (published 1601). These plays drew on a variety of sources, including apparently &quot;A Gest of Robin Hood&quot;, and were influential in fixing the story of Robin Hood to the period of Richard I. Stephen Thomas Knight has suggested that Munday drew heavily on Fulk Fitz Warin, a historical 12th century outlawed nobleman and enemy of King John, in creating his Robin Hood. The play identifies Robin Hood as Robert, Earl of Huntingdon, following in Richard Grafton&#x27;s association of Robin Hood with the gentry, and identifies Maid Marian with &quot;one of the semi-mythical Matildas persecuted by King John&quot;. The plays are complex in plot and form, the story of Robin Hood appearing as a play-within-a-play presented at the court of Henry VIII and written by the poet, priest and courtier John Skelton. Skelton himself is presented in the play as acting the part of Friar Tuck. Some scholars have conjectured that Skelton may have indeed written a lost Robin Hood play for Henry VIII&#x27;s court, and that this play may have been one of Munday&#x27;s sources. Henry VIII himself with eleven of his nobles had impersonated &quot;Robyn Hodes men&quot; as part of his &quot;Maying&quot; in 1510. Robin Hood is known to have appeared in a number of other lost and extant Elizabethan plays. In 1599, the play &quot;George a Green, the Pinner of Wakefield&quot; places Robin Hood in the reign of Edward IV. &quot;Edward I&quot;, a play by George Peele first performed in 1590–91, incorporates a Robin Hood game played by the characters. Llywelyn the Great, the last independent Prince of Wales, is presented playing Robin Hood.

Fixing the Robin Hood story to the 1190s had been first proposed by John Major in his &quot;Historia Majoris Britanniæ&quot; (1521), (and he also may have been influenced in so doing by the story of Warin); this was the period in which King Richard was absent from the country, fighting in the Third Crusade.

William Shakespeare makes reference to Robin Hood in his late-16th-century play &quot;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;. In it, the character Valentine is banished from Milan and driven out through the forest where he is approached by outlaws who, upon meeting him, desire him as their leader. They comment, &quot;By the bare scalp of Robin Hood&#x27;s fat friar, This fellow were a king for our wild faction!&quot; Robin Hood is also mentioned in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. When asked about the exiled Duke Senior, the character of Charles says that he is &quot;already in the forest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England&quot;. Justice Silence sings a line from an unnamed Robin Hood ballad, the line is &quot;Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John&quot; in Act 5 scene 3 of Henry IV, part 2. In Henry IV part 1 Act 3 scene 3, Falstaff refers to Maid Marian, implying she is a by-word for unwomanly or unchaste behaviour.

Ben Jonson produced the incomplete masque &quot;The Sad Shepherd, or a Tale of Robin Hood&quot; in part as a satire on Puritanism. It is about half finished and his death in 1637 may have interrupted writing. Jonson&#x27;s only pastoral drama, it was written in sophisticated verse and included supernatural action and characters. It has had little impact on the Robin Hood tradition but earns mention as the work of a major dramatist.

The 1642 London theatre closure by the Puritans interrupted the portrayal of Robin Hood on the stage. The theatres would reopen with the Restoration in 1660. Robin Hood did not appear on the Restoration stage, except for &quot;Robin Hood and his Crew of Souldiers&quot; acted in Nottingham on the day of the coronation of Charles II in 1661. This short play adapts the story of the king&#x27;s pardon of Robin Hood to refer to the Restoration.

However, Robin Hood appeared on the 18th-century stage in various farces and comic operas. Alfred, Lord Tennyson would write a four-act Robin Hood play at the end of the 19th century, &quot;The Forrestors&quot;. It is fundamentally based on the Gest but follows the traditions of placing Robin Hood as the Earl of Huntingdon in the time of Richard I and making the Sheriff of Nottingham and Prince John rivals with Robin Hood for Maid Marian&#x27;s hand. The return of King Richard brings a happy ending.

===Broadside ballads and garlands===
With the advent of printing came the Robin Hood broadside ballads. Exactly when they displaced the oral tradition of Robin Hood ballads is unknown but the process seems to have been completed by the end of the 16th century. Near the end of the 16th century an unpublished prose life of Robin Hood was written, and included in the Sloane Manuscript. Largely a paraphrase of the Gest, it also contains material revealing that the author was familiar with early versions of a number of the Robin Hood broadside ballads. Not all of the medieval legend was preserved in the broadside ballads, there is no broadside version of Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne or of Robin Hood and the Monk, which did not appear in print until the 18th and 19th centuries respectively. However, the Gest was reprinted from time to time throughout the 16th and 17th centuries.

No surviving broadside ballad can be dated with certainty before the 17th century, but during that century, the commercial broadside ballad became the main vehicle for the popular Robin Hood legend. These broadside ballads were in some cases newly fabricated but were mostly adaptations of the older verse narratives. The broadside ballads were fitted to a small repertoire of pre-existing tunes resulting in an increase of &quot;stock formulaic phrases&quot; making them &quot;repetitive and verbose&quot;, they commonly feature Robin Hood&#x27;s contests with artisans: tinkers, tanners, and butchers. Among these ballads is Robin Hood and Little John telling the famous story of the quarter-staff fight between the two outlaws.

Dobson and Taylor wrote, &#x27;More generally the Robin of the broadsides is a much less tragic, less heroic and in the last resort less mature figure than his medieval predecessor&#x27;. In most of the broadside ballads Robin Hood remains a plebeian figure, a notable exception being Martin Parker&#x27;s attempt at an overall life of Robin Hood, A True Tale of Robin Hood, which also emphasises the theme of Robin Hood&#x27;s generosity to the poor more than the broadsheet ballads do in general.

The 17th century introduced the minstrel Alan-a-Dale. He first appeared in a 17th-century broadside ballad, and unlike many of the characters thus associated, managed to adhere to the legend. The prose life of Robin Hood in Sloane Manuscript contains the substance of the Alan-a-Dale ballad but tells the story about Will Scarlet.
In the 18th century, the stories began to develop a slightly more farcical vein. From this period there are a number of ballads in which Robin is severely &#x27;drubbed&#x27; by a succession of tradesmen including a tanner, a tinker, and a ranger. In fact, the only character who does not get the better of Hood is the luckless Sheriff. Yet even in these ballads Robin is more than a mere simpleton: on the contrary, he often acts with great shrewdness. The tinker, setting out to capture Robin, only manages to fight with him after he has been cheated out of his money and the arrest warrant he is carrying. In &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Golden Prize&quot;, Robin disguises himself as a friar and cheats two priests out of their cash. Even when Robin is defeated, he usually tricks his foe into letting him sound his horn, summoning the Merry Men to his aid. When his enemies do not fall for this ruse, he persuades them to drink with him instead (see Robin Hood&#x27;s Delight).

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the Robin Hood ballads were mostly sold in &quot;Garlands&quot; of 16 to 24 Robin Hood ballads; these were crudely printed chap books aimed at the poor. The garlands added nothing to the substance of the legend but ensured that it continued after the decline of the single broadside ballad. In the 18th century also, Robin Hood frequently appeared in criminal biographies and histories of highwaymen compendia.

===Rediscovery: Percy and Ritson===
In 1765, Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore) published &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot;, including ballads from the 17th-century Percy Folio manuscript which had not previously been printed, most notably Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne which is generally regarded as in substance a genuine late medieval ballad.

In 1795, Joseph Ritson published an enormously influential edition of the Robin Hood ballads &quot;Robin Hood: A collection of all the Ancient Poems Songs and Ballads now extant, relative to that celebrated Outlaw&quot;. &#x27;By providing English poets and novelists with a convenient source book, Ritson gave them the opportunity to recreate Robin Hood in their own imagination,&#x27; Ritson&#x27;s collection included the Gest and put the Robin Hood and the Potter ballad in print for the first time. The only significant omission was Robin Hood and the Monk which would eventually be printed in 1806. In all, Ritson printed 33 Robin Hood ballads (and a 34th, now commonly known as Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon that he included as the second part of Robin Hood Newly Revived which he had retitled &quot;Robin Hood and the Stranger&quot;). Ritson&#x27;s interpretation of Robin Hood was also influential, having influenced the modern concept of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor as it exists today. Himself a supporter of the principles of the French Revolution and admirer of Thomas Paine, Ritson held that Robin Hood was a genuinely historical, and genuinely heroic, character who had stood up against tyranny in the interests of the common people. J. C. Holt has been quick to point out, however, that Ritson &quot;began as a Jacobite and ended as a Jacobin,&quot; and &quot;certainly reconstructed him [Robin] in the image of a radical.&quot;

In his preface to the collection, Ritson assembled an account of Robin Hood&#x27;s life from the various sources available to him, and concluded that Robin Hood was born in around 1160, and thus had been active in the reign of Richard I. He thought that Robin was of aristocratic extraction, with at least &#x27;some pretension&#x27; to the title of Earl of Huntingdon, that he was born in an unlocated Nottinghamshire village of Locksley and that his original name was Robert Fitzooth. Ritson gave the date of Robin Hood&#x27;s death as 18 November 1247, when he would have been around 87 years old. In copious and informative notes Ritson defends every point of his version of Robin Hood&#x27;s life. In reaching his conclusion Ritson relied or gave weight to a number of unreliable sources, such as the Robin Hood plays of Anthony Munday and the Sloane Manuscript. Nevertheless, Dobson and Taylor credit Ritson with having &#x27;an incalculable effect in promoting the still continuing quest for the man behind the myth&#x27;, and note that his work remains an &#x27;indispensable handbook to the outlaw legend even now&#x27;.

Ritson&#x27;s friend Walter Scott used Ritson&#x27;s anthology collection as a source for his picture of Robin Hood in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;, written in 1818, which did much to shape the modern legend.

===Child ballads===

In the decades following the publication of Ritson&#x27;s book, other ballad collections would occasionally publish stray Robin Hood ballads Ritson had missed. In 1806, Robert Jamieson published the earliest known Robin Hood ballad, &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot; in Volume II of his &quot;Popular Ballads and Songs From Tradition&quot;. In 1846, the Percy Society included The Bold Pedlar and Robin Hood in its collection, &quot;Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the Peasantry of England&quot;. In 1850, John Mathew Gutch published his own collection of Robin Hood ballads, &quot;Robin Hood Garlands and Ballads, with the tale of the lytell Geste&quot;, that in addition to all of Ritson&#x27;s collection, also included Robin Hood and the Pedlars and Robin Hood and the Scotchman.

In 1858, Francis James Child published his &quot;English and Scottish Ballads&quot; which included a volume grouping all the Robin Hood ballads in one volume, including all the ballads published by Ritson, the four stray ballads published since then, as well as some ballads that either mentioned Robin Hood by name or featured characters named Robin Hood but weren&#x27;t traditional Robin Hood stories. For his more scholarly work, &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot;, in his volume dedicated to the Robin Hood ballads, published in 1888, Child removed the ballads from his earlier work that weren&#x27;t traditional Robin Hood stories, gave the ballad Ritson titled &quot;Robin Hood and the Stranger&quot; back its original published title Robin Hood Newly Revived, and separated what Ritson had printed as the second part of &quot;Robin Hood and the Stranger&quot; as its own separate ballad, Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon. He also included alternate versions of ballads that had distinct, alternate versions. He numbered these 38 Robin Hood ballads among the 305 ballads in his collection as Child Ballads Nos 117–154, which is how they&#x27;re often referenced in scholarly works.

===&quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;===

In the 19th century, the Robin Hood legend was first specifically adapted for children. Children&#x27;s editions of the garlands were produced and in 1820, a children&#x27;s edition of Ritson&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot; collection was published. Children&#x27;s novels began to appear shortly thereafter. It is not that children did not read Robin Hood stories before, but this is the first appearance of a Robin Hood literature specifically aimed at them. A very influential example of these children&#x27;s novels was Pierce Egan the Younger&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood and Little John&quot; (1840). This was adapted into French by Alexandre Dumas in &quot;Le Prince des Voleurs&quot; (1872) and &quot;Robin Hood Le Proscrit&quot; (1873). Egan made Robin Hood of noble birth but raised by the forestor Gilbert Hood.

Another very popular version for children was Howard Pyle&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, which influenced accounts of Robin Hood through the 20th century. Pyle&#x27;s version firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor. Nevertheless, the adventures are still more local than national in scope: while King Richard&#x27;s participation in the Crusades is mentioned in passing, Robin takes no stand against Prince John, and plays no part in raising the ransom to free Richard. These developments are part of the 20th-century Robin Hood myth. Pyle&#x27;s Robin Hood is a yeoman and not an aristocrat.

The idea of Robin Hood as a high-minded Saxon fighting Norman lords also originates in the 19th century. The most notable contributions to this idea of Robin are Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1825) and Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1819). In this last work in particular, the modern Robin Hood—&#x27;King of Outlaws and prince of good fellows!&#x27; as Richard the Lionheart calls him—makes his debut.

===Forresters Manuscript===
In 1993, a previously unknown manuscript of 21 Robin Hood ballads (including two versions of &quot;The Jolly Pinder of Wakefield&quot;) turned up in an auction house and eventually wound up in the British Library. Called The Forresters Manuscript, after the first and last ballads, which are both titled Robin Hood and the Forresters, it was published in 1998 as &quot;Robin Hood: The Forresters Manuscript&quot;. It appears to have been written in the 1670s. While all the ballads in the Manuscript had already been known and published during the 17th and 18th centuries (although most of the ballads in the Manuscript have different titles then ones they have listed under the Child Ballads), 13 of the ballads in Forresters are noticeably different from how they appeared in the broadsides and garlands. Nine of these ballads are significantly longer and more elaborate than the versions of the same ballads found in the broadsides and garlands. For four of these ballads, the Forresters Manuscript versions are the earliest known versions.

===20th century onwards===
The 20th century grafted still further details on to the original legends. The 1938 film &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, starring Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, portrayed Robin as a hero on a national scale, leading the oppressed Saxons in revolt against their Norman overlords while Richard the Lionheart fought in the Crusades; this movie established itself so definitively that many studios resorted to movies about his son (invented for that purpose) rather than compete with the image of this one.

In 1953, during the McCarthy era, a Republican member of the Indiana Textbook Commission called for a ban of Robin Hood from all Indiana school books for its alleged communist connotations. This proposal prompted a short-lived college protest against McCarthyism and book censorship in the United States that was launched on the Indiana University Bloomington campus and within a course of weeks had grown into a nationwide campus movement, known as the Green Feather Movement.

===Films, animations, new concepts, and other adaptations===
====Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;====
In the 1973 animated Disney film &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, the title character is portrayed as an anthropomorphic fox voiced by Brian Bedford. Years before &quot;Robin Hood&quot; had even entered production, Disney had considered doing a project on Reynard the Fox; however, due to concerns that Reynard was unsuitable as a hero, animator Ken Anderson adapted some elements from Reynard into &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, making the title character a fox.

====&quot;Robin and Marian&quot;====
The 1976 British-American film &quot;Robin and Marian&quot;, starring Sean Connery as Robin Hood and Audrey Hepburn as Maid Marian, portrays the figures in later years after Robin has returned from service with Richard the Lionheart in a foreign crusade and Marian has gone into seclusion in a nunnery. This is the first in popular culture to portray King Richard as less than perfect.

====Muslim Merry Men====
Since the 1980s, it has become commonplace to include a Saracen (Arab/Muslim) among the Merry Men, a trend that began with the character Nasir in the 1984 ITV &quot;Robin of Sherwood&quot; television series. Later versions of the story have followed suit: a version of Nasir appears in the 1991 movie &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; (Azeem) and the 2006 BBC TV series &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (Djaq). Spoofs have also followed this trend, with the 1990s BBC sitcom &quot;Maid Marian and her Merry Men&quot; parodying the Moorish character with Barrington, a Rastafarian rapper played by Danny John-Jules, and Mel Brooks comedy &quot;Robin Hood: Men in Tights&quot; featuring Isaac Hayes as Asneeze and Dave Chappelle as his son Ahchoo. The 2010 movie version &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, did not include a Saracen character. The 2018 adaptation &quot;Robin Hood&quot; portrays the character of Little John as a Muslim named Yahya, played by Jamie Foxx.

====France====
Between 1963 and 1966, French television broadcast a medievalist series entitled &quot;Thierry La Fronde&quot; (&quot;Thierry the Sling&quot;). This successful series, which was also shown in Canada, Poland (&quot;Thierry Śmiałek&quot;), Australia (&quot;The King&#x27;s Outlaw&quot;), and the Netherlands (&quot;Thierry de Slingeraar&quot;), transposes the English Robin Hood narrative into late medieval France during the Hundred Years&#x27; War.

The original ballads and plays, including the early medieval poems and the latter broadside ballads and garlands have been edited and translated for the very first time in French in 2017 by Jonathan Fruoco. Until then, the texts had been unavailable in France.

==Historicity==
The historicity of Robin Hood has been debated for centuries. A difficulty with any such historical research is that Robert was a very common given name in medieval England, and &#x27;Robin&#x27; (or Robyn) was its very common diminutive, especially in the 13th century; it is a French hypocorism, already mentioned in the &quot;Roman de Renart&quot; in the 12th century. The surname Hood (by any spelling) was also fairly common because it referred either to a hooder, who was a maker of hoods, or alternatively to somebody who wore a hood as a head-covering. It is therefore unsurprising that medieval records mention a number of people called &quot;Robert Hood&quot; or &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, some of whom are known criminals.

Another view on the origin of the name is expressed in the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; which remarks that &quot;hood&quot; was a common dialectical form of &quot;wood&quot; (compare Dutch , , also meaning &quot;wood&quot;), and that the outlaw&#x27;s name has been given as &quot;Robin Wood&quot;. There are a number of references to Robin Hood as Robin Wood, or Whood, or Whod, from the 16th and 17th centuries. The earliest recorded example, in connection with May games in Somerset, dates from 1518.

===Early references===
The oldest references to Robin Hood are not historical records, or even ballads recounting his exploits, but hints and allusions found in various works. From 1261 onward, the names &quot;Robinhood&quot;, &quot;Robehod&quot;, or &quot;Robbehod&quot; occur in the rolls of several English Justices as nicknames or descriptions of malefactors. The majority of these references date from the late 13th century. Between 1261 and 1300, there are at least eight references to &quot;Rabunhod&quot; in various regions across England, from Berkshire in the south to York in the north.

Leaving aside the reference to the &quot;rhymes&quot; of Robin Hood in Piers Plowman in the 1370s, and the scattered mentions of his &quot;tales and songs&quot; in various religious tracts dating to the early 15th century, the first mention of a quasi-historical Robin Hood is given in Andrew of Wyntoun&#x27;s &quot;Orygynale Chronicle&quot;, written in about 1420. The following lines occur with little contextualisation under the year 1283:

In a petition presented to Parliament in 1439, the name is used to describe an itinerant felon. The petition cites one Piers Venables of Aston, Derbyshire, &quot;who having no liflode, ne sufficeante of goodes, gadered and assembled unto him many misdoers, beynge of his clothynge, and, in manere of insurrection, wente into the wodes in that countrie, like as it hadde be Robyn Hude and his meyne.&quot;

The next historical description of Robin Hood is a statement in the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;, composed by John of Fordun between 1377 and 1384, and revised by Walter Bower in about 1440. Among Bower&#x27;s many interpolations is a passage that directly refers to Robin. It is inserted after Fordun&#x27;s account of the defeat of Simon de Montfort and the punishment of his adherents, and is entered under the year 1266 in Bower&#x27;s account. Robin is represented as a fighter for de Montfort&#x27;s cause. This was in fact true of the historical outlaw of Sherwood Forest Roger Godberd, whose points of similarity to the Robin Hood of the ballads have often been noted.

Then arose the famous murderer, Robert Hood, as well as Little John, together with their accomplices from among the disinherited, whom the foolish populace are so inordinately fond of celebrating both in tragedies and comedies, and about whom they are delighted to hear the jesters and minstrels sing above all other ballads.

The word translated here as &#x27;murderer&#x27; is the Latin &quot;sicarius&quot; (literally &#x27;dagger-man&#x27; but actually meaning, in classical Latin, &#x27;assassin&#x27; or &#x27;murderer&#x27;), from the Latin &quot;sica&quot; for &#x27;dagger&#x27;, and descends from its use to describe the Sicarii, assassins operating in Roman Judea. Bower goes on to relate an anecdote about Robin Hood in which he refuses to flee from his enemies while hearing Mass in the greenwood, and then gains a surprise victory over them, apparently as a reward for his piety; the mention of &quot;tragedies&quot; suggests that some form of the tale relating his death, as per &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;, might have been in currency already.

Another reference, discovered by Julian Luxford in 2009, appears in the margin of the &quot;Polychronicon&quot; in the Eton College library. Written around the year 1460 by a monk in Latin, it says:

Around this time [i.e., reign of Edward I], according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, infested Sherwood and other law-abiding areas of England with continuous robberies.

Following this, John Major mentions Robin Hood within his &quot;Historia Majoris Britanniæ&quot; (1521), casting him in a positive light by mentioning his and his followers&#x27; aversion to bloodshed and ethos of only robbing the wealthy; Major also fixed his &quot;floruit&quot; not to the mid-13th century but the reigns of Richard I of England and his brother, King John. Richard Grafton, in his &quot;Chronicle at Large&quot; (1569) went further when discussing Major&#x27;s description of &quot;Robert Hood&quot;, identifying him for the first time as a member of the gentry, albeit possibly &quot;being of a base stock and linaege, was for his manhood and chivalry advanced to the noble dignity of an Earl&quot; and not the yeomanry, foreshadowing Anthony Munday&#x27;s casting of him as the dispossessed Earl of Huntingdon. The name nevertheless still had a reputation of sedition and treachery in 1605, when Guy Fawkes and his associates were branded &quot;Robin Hoods&quot; by Robert Cecil. In 1644, jurist Edward Coke described Robin Hood as a historical figure who had operated in the reign of King Richard I around Yorkshire; he interpreted the contemporary term &quot;roberdsmen&quot; (outlaws) as meaning followers of Robin Hood.

===Robert Hod of York===
The earliest known legal records mentioning a person called Robin Hood (Robert Hod) are from 1226, found in the York Assizes, when that person&#x27;s goods, worth 32 shillings and 6 pence, were confiscated and he became an outlaw. Robert Hod owed the money to St Peter&#x27;s in York. The following year, he was called &quot;Hobbehod&quot;, and also came to known as &quot;Robert Hood&quot;. Robert Hod of York is the only early Robin Hood known to have been an outlaw. In 1936, L.V.D. Owen floated the idea that Robin Hood might be identified with an outlawed Robert Hood, or Hod, or Hobbehod, all apparently the same man, referred to in nine successive Yorkshire Pipe Rolls between 1226 and 1234. There is no evidence however that this Robert Hood, although an outlaw, was also a bandit.

===Robert and John Deyville===
Historian Oscar de Ville discusses the career of John Deyville and his brother Robert, along with their kinsmen Jocelin and Adam, during the Second Barons&#x27; War, specifically their activities after the Battle of Evesham. John Deyville was granted authority by the faction led by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester over York Castle and the Northern Forests during the war in which they sought refuge after Evesham. John, along with his relatives, led the remaining rebel faction on the Isle of Ely following the Dictum of Kenilworth. De Ville connects their presence there with Bower&#x27;s mention of &quot;Robert Hood&quot; during the aftermath of Evesham in his annotations to the &quot;Scotichronicon&quot;.

While John was eventually pardoned and continued his career until 1290, his kinsmen are no longer mentioned by historical records after the events surrounding their resistance at Ely, and de Ville speculates that Robert remained an outlaw. Other points de Ville raises in support of John and his brothers&#x27; exploits forming the inspiration for Robin Hood include their properties in Barnsdale, John&#x27;s settlement of a mortgage worth £400 paralleling Robin Hood&#x27;s charity of identical value to Sir Richard at the Lee, relationship with Sir Richard Foliot, a possible inspiration for the former figure, and ownership of a fortified home at Hood Hill, near Kilburn, North Yorkshire. The last of these is suggested to be the inspiration for Robin Hood&#x27;s second name as opposed to the more common theory of a head covering. Perhaps not coincidentally, a &quot;Robertus Hod&quot; is mentioned in records among the holdouts at Ely.

Although de Ville does not explicitly connect John and Robert Deyville to Robin Hood, he discusses these parallels in detail and suggests that they formed prototypes for this ideal of heroic outlawry during the tumultuous reign of Henry III&#x27;s grandson and Edward I&#x27;s son, Edward II of England.

===Roger Godberd===
David Baldwin identifies Robin Hood with the historical outlaw Roger Godberd, who was a die-hard supporter of Simon de Montfort, which would place Robin Hood around the 1260s. There are certainly parallels between Godberd&#x27;s career and that of Robin Hood as he appears in the Gest. John Maddicott has called Godberd &quot;that prototype Robin Hood&quot;. Some problems with this theory are that there is no evidence that Godberd was ever known as Robin Hood and no sign in the early Robin Hood ballads of the specific concerns of de Montfort&#x27;s revolt.

===Robin Hood of Wakefield===
The antiquarian Joseph Hunter (1783–1861) believed that Robin Hood had inhabited the forests of Yorkshire during the early decades of the fourteenth century. Hunter pointed to two men whom, believing them to be the same person, he identified with the legendary outlaw:

# Robert Hood who is documented as having lived in the city of Wakefield at the start of the fourteenth century.
# &quot;Robyn Hode&quot; who is recorded as being employed by Edward II of England during 1323.

Hunter developed a fairly detailed theory implying that Robert Hood had been an adherent of the rebel Earl of Lancaster, who was defeated by Edward II at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322. According to this theory, Robert Hood was thereafter pardoned and employed as a bodyguard by King Edward, and in consequence he appears in the 1323 court roll under the name of &quot;Robyn Hode&quot;. Hunter&#x27;s theory has long been recognised to have serious problems, one of the most serious being that recent research has shown that Hunter&#x27;s Robyn Hood had been employed by the king before he appeared in the 1323 court roll, thus casting doubt on this Robyn Hood&#x27;s supposed earlier career as outlaw and rebel.

===Alias===
It has long been suggested, notably by John Maddicott, that &quot;Robin Hood&quot; was a stock alias used by thieves. What appears to be the first known example of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; as a stock name for an outlaw dates to 1262 in Berkshire, where the surname &quot;Robehod&quot; was applied to a man apparently because he had been outlawed. This could suggest two main possibilities: either that an early form of the Robin Hood legend was already well established in the mid-13th century; or alternatively that the name &quot;Robin Hood&quot; preceded the outlaw hero that we know; so that the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; of legend was so called because that was seen as an appropriate name for an outlaw.

==Mythology==
There is at present little or no scholarly support for the view that tales of Robin Hood have stemmed from mythology or folklore, from fairies or other mythological origins, any such associations being regarded as later development. It was once a popular view, however. The &quot;mythological theory&quot; dates back at least to 1584, when Reginald Scot identified Robin Hood with the Germanic goblin &quot;Hudgin&quot; or Hodekin and associated him with Robin Goodfellow. Maurice Keen provides a brief summary and useful critique of the evidence for the view Robin Hood had mythological origins. While the outlaw often shows great skill in archery, swordplay and disguise, his feats are no more exaggerated than those of characters in other ballads, such as &quot;Kinmont Willie&quot;, which were based on historical events.

Robin Hood has also been claimed for the pagan witch-cult supposed by Margaret Murray to have existed in medieval Europe, and his anti-clericalism and Marianism interpreted in this light. The existence of the witch cult as proposed by Murray is now generally discredited.

==Associated locations==

===Sherwood Forest===

The early ballads link Robin Hood to identifiable real places. In popular culture, Robin Hood and his band of &quot;merry men&quot; are portrayed as living in Sherwood Forest, in Nottinghamshire. Notably, the &quot;Lincoln Cathedral Manuscript&quot;, which is the first officially recorded Robin Hood song (dating from approximately 1420), makes an explicit reference to the outlaw that states that &quot;Robyn hode in scherewode stod&quot;. In a similar fashion, a monk of Witham Priory (1460) suggested that the archer had &#x27;infested shirwode&#x27;. His chronicle entry reads: 

===Nottinghamshire===
Specific sites in the county of Nottinghamshire directly linked to the Robin Hood legend include Robin Hood&#x27;s Well, near Newstead Abbey (within the boundaries of Sherwood Forest), the Church of St. Mary in the village of Edwinstowe and most famously of all, the Major Oak also in the village of Edwinstowe. The Major Oak, which resides in the heart of Sherwood Forest, is popularly believed to have been used by the Merry Men as a hide-out. Dendrologists have contradicted this claim by estimating the tree&#x27;s true age at around eight hundred years; it would have been relatively a sapling in Robin&#x27;s time, at best.

===Yorkshire===
Nottinghamshire&#x27;s claim to Robin Hood&#x27;s heritage is disputed, with Yorkists staking a claim to the outlaw. In demonstrating Yorkshire&#x27;s Robin Hood heritage, the historian J. C. Holt drew attention to the fact that although Sherwood Forest is mentioned in &quot;Robin Hood and the Monk&quot;, there is little information about the topography of the region, and thus suggested that Robin Hood was drawn to Nottinghamshire through his interactions with the city&#x27;s sheriff. Moreover, the linguist Lister Matheson has observed that the language of the &quot;Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; is written in a definite northern dialect, probably that of Yorkshire. In consequence, it seems probable that the Robin Hood legend actually originates from the county of Yorkshire. Robin Hood&#x27;s Yorkshire origins are generally accepted by professional historians.

===Barnsdale===

A tradition dating back at least to the end of the 16th century gives Robin Hood&#x27;s birthplace as Loxley, Sheffield, in South Yorkshire. The original Robin Hood ballads, which originate from the fifteenth century, set events in the medieval forest of Barnsdale. Barnsdale was a wooded area covering an expanse of no more than thirty square miles, ranging six miles from north to south, with the River Went at Wentbridge near Pontefract forming its northern boundary and the villages of Skelbrooke and Hampole forming the southernmost region. From east to west the forest extended about five miles, from Askern on the east to Badsworth in the west. At the northernmost edge of the forest of Barnsdale, in the heart of the Went Valley, resides the village of Wentbridge. Wentbridge is a village in the City of Wakefield district of West Yorkshire, England. It lies around southeast of its nearest township of size, Pontefract, close to the A1 road. During the medieval age Wentbridge was sometimes locally referred to by the name of Barnsdale because it was the predominant settlement in the forest. Wentbridge is mentioned in an early Robin Hood ballad, entitled, &quot;Robin Hood and the Potter&quot;, which reads, &quot;Y mete hem bot at Went breg,&#x27; syde Lyttyl John&quot;. And, while Wentbridge is not directly named in &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot;, the poem does appear to make a cryptic reference to the locality by depicting a poor knight explaining to Robin Hood that he &#x27;went at a bridge&#x27; where there was wrestling&#x27;. A commemorative Blue Plaque has been placed on the bridge that crosses the River Went by Wakefield City Council.

===Saylis===
The &quot;Gest&quot; makes a specific reference to the Saylis at Wentbridge. Credit is due to the nineteenth-century antiquarian Joseph Hunter, who correctly identified the site of the Saylis. From this location it was once possible to look out over the Went Valley and observe the traffic that passed along the Great North Road. The Saylis is recorded as having contributed towards the aid that was granted to Edward III in 1346–47 for the knighting of the Black Prince. An acre of landholding is listed within a glebe terrier of 1688 relating to Kirk Smeaton, which later came to be called &quot;Sailes Close&quot;. Professor Dobson and Mr. Taylor indicate that such evidence of continuity makes it virtually certain that the Saylis that was so well known to Robin Hood is preserved today as &quot;Sayles Plantation&quot;. It is this location that provides a vital clue to Robin Hood&#x27;s Yorkshire heritage. One final locality in the forest of Barnsdale that is associated with Robin Hood is the village of Campsall.

===Church of Saint Mary Magdalene at Campsall===
The historian John Paul Davis wrote of Robin&#x27;s connection to the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene at Campsall in South Yorkshire. &quot;A Gest of Robyn Hode&quot; states that the outlaw built a chapel in Barnsdale that he dedicated to Mary Magdalene:


Davis indicates that there is only one church dedicated to Mary Magdalene within what one might reasonably consider to have been the medieval forest of Barnsdale, and that is the church at Campsall. The church was built in the early twelfth century by Robert de Lacy, the 2nd Baron of Pontefract. Local legend suggests that Robin Hood and Maid Marion were married at the church.

===Abbey of Saint Mary at York===
The backdrop of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York plays a central role in the &quot;Gest&quot; as the poor knight whom Robin aids owes money to the abbot.

===Grave at Kirklees===
At Kirklees Priory in West Yorkshire stands an alleged grave with a spurious inscription, which relates to Robin Hood. The fifteenth-century ballads relate that before he died, Robin told Little John where to bury him. He shot an arrow from the Priory window, and where the arrow landed was to be the site of his grave. The &quot;Gest&quot; states that the Prioress was a relative of Robin&#x27;s. Robin was ill and staying at the Priory where the Prioress was supposedly caring for him. However, she betrayed him, his health worsened, and he eventually died there. The inscription on the grave reads,

Despite the unconventional spelling, the verse is in Modern English, not the Middle English of the 13th century. The date is also incorrectly formatted – using the Roman calendar, &quot;24 kal Decembris&quot; would be the twenty-third day &quot;before&quot; the beginning of December, that is, 8 November. The tomb probably dates from the late eighteenth century.

The grave with the inscription is within sight of the ruins of the Kirklees Priory, behind the Three Nuns pub in Mirfield, West Yorkshire. Though local folklore suggests that Robin is buried in the grounds of Kirklees Priory, this theory has now largely been abandoned by professional historians.

===All Saints&#x27; Church at Pontefract===
Another theory is that Robin Hood died at Kirkby, Pontefract. Michael Drayton&#x27;s &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; Song 28 (67–70), published in 1622, speaks of Robin Hood&#x27;s death and clearly states that the outlaw died at &#x27;Kirkby&#x27;. This is consistent with the view that Robin Hood operated in the Went Valley, located three miles to the southeast of the town of Pontefract. The location is approximately three miles from the site of Robin&#x27;s robberies at the now famous Saylis. In the Anglo-Saxon period, Kirkby was home to All Saints&#x27; Church, Pontefract. All Saints&#x27; Church had a priory hospital attached to it. The Tudor historian Richard Grafton stated that the prioress who murdered Robin Hood buried the outlaw beside the road,

Where he had used to rob and spoyle those that passed that way ... and the cause why she buryed him there was, for that common strangers and travailers, knowing and seeing him there buryed, might more safely and without feare take their journeys that way, which they durst not do in the life of the sayd outlaes.

All Saints&#x27; Church at Kirkby, modern Pontefract, which was located approximately three miles from the site of Robin Hood&#x27;s robberies at the Saylis, is consistent with Richard Grafton&#x27;s description because a road ran directly from Wentbridge to the hospital at Kirkby.

===Place-name locations===
Within close proximity of Wentbridge reside several notable landmarks relating to Robin Hood. One such place-name location occurred in a cartulary deed of 1422 from Monkbretton Priory, which makes direct reference to a landmark named Robin Hood&#x27;s Stone, which resided upon the eastern side of the Great North Road, a mile south of Barnsdale Bar. The historians Barry Dobson and John Taylor suggested that on the opposite side of the road once stood Robin Hood&#x27;s Well, which has since been relocated six miles north-west of Doncaster, on the south-bound side of the Great North Road. Over the next three centuries, the name popped-up all over the place, such as at Robin Hood&#x27;s Bay, near Whitby in Yorkshire, Robin Hood&#x27;s Butts in Cumbria, and Robin Hood&#x27;s Walk at Richmond, Surrey.

Robin Hood type place-names occurred particularly everywhere except Sherwood. The first place-name in Sherwood does not appear until the year 1700. The fact that the earliest Robin Hood type place-names originated in West Yorkshire is deemed to be historically significant because, generally, place-name evidence originates from the locality where legends begin. The overall picture from the surviving early ballads and other early references indicate that Robin Hood was based in the Barnsdale area of what is now South Yorkshire, which borders Nottinghamshire.

====Other place-names and references====
The Sheriff of Nottingham also had jurisdiction in Derbyshire that was known as the &quot;Shire of the Deer&quot;, and this is where the Royal Forest of the Peak is found, which roughly corresponds to today&#x27;s Peak District National Park. The Royal Forest included Bakewell, Tideswell, Castleton, Ladybower and the Derwent Valley near Loxley. The Sheriff of Nottingham possessed property near Loxley, among other places both far and wide including Hazlebadge Hall, Peveril Castle and Haddon Hall. Mercia, to which Nottingham belonged, came to within three miles of Sheffield City Centre. But before the Law of the Normans was the Law of the Danes, The Danelaw had a similar boundary to that of Mercia but had a population of &quot;Free Peasantry&quot; that were known to have resisted the Norman occupation. Many outlaws could have been created by the refusal to recognise Norman Forest Law. The supposed grave of Little John can be found in Hathersage, also in the Peak District.

Further indications of the legend&#x27;s connection with West Yorkshire (and particularly Calderdale) are noted in the fact that there are pubs called the Robin Hood in both nearby Brighouse and at Cragg Vale; higher up in the Pennines beyond Halifax, where Robin Hood Rocks can also be found. Robin Hood Hill is near Outwood, West Yorkshire, not far from Lofthouse. There is a village in West Yorkshire called Robin Hood, on the A61 between Leeds and Wakefield and close to Rothwell and Lofthouse. Considering these references to Robin Hood, it is not surprising that the people of both South and West Yorkshire lay some claim to Robin Hood, who, if he existed, could easily have roamed between Nottingham, Lincoln, Doncaster and right into West Yorkshire.

A British Army Territorial (reserves) battalion formed in Nottingham in 1859 was known as The Robin Hood Battalion through various reorganisations until the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; name finally disappeared in 1992. With the 1881 Childers Reforms that linked regular and reserve units into regimental families, the Robin Hood Battalion became part of The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment).

A Neolithic causewayed enclosure on Salisbury Plain has acquired the name Robin Hood&#x27;s Ball, although had Robin Hood existed it is doubtful that he would have travelled so far south.

==List of traditional ballads==

Ballads dating back to the 15th century are the oldest existing form of the Robin Hood legends, although none of them were recorded at the time of the first allusions to him, and many are from much later. They share many common features, often opening with praise of the greenwood and relying heavily on disguise as a plot device, but include a wide variation in tone and plot. The ballads are sorted into four groups, very roughly according to date of first known free-standing copy. Ballads whose first recorded version appears (usually incomplete) in the Percy Folio may appear in later versions and may be much older than the mid-17th century when the Folio was compiled. Any ballad may be older than the oldest copy that happens to survive, or descended from a lost older ballad. For example, the plot of &quot;Robin Hood&#x27;s Death&quot;, found in the Percy Folio, is summarised in the 15th-century A Gest of Robyn Hode, and it also appears in an 18th-century version.

NB. The first two ballads listed here (the &quot;Death&quot; and &quot;Gisborne&quot;), although preserved in 17th-century copies, are generally agreed to preserve the substance of late medieval ballads. The third (the &quot;Curtal Friar&quot;) and the fourth (the &quot;Butcher&quot;), also probably have late medieval origins. An * before a ballad&#x27;s title indicates there is also a version of this ballad in the Forresters Manuscript.

Some ballads, such as &quot;Erlinton&quot;, feature Robin Hood in some variants, where the folk hero appears to be added to a ballad pre-existing him and in which he does not fit very well. He was added to one variant of &quot;Rose Red and the White Lily&quot;, apparently on no more connection than that one hero of the other variants is named &quot;Brown Robin&quot;. Francis James Child indeed retitled Child ballad 102; though it was titled &quot;The Birth of Robin Hood&quot;, its clear lack of connection with the Robin Hood cycle (and connection with other, unrelated ballads) led him to title it &quot;Willie and Earl Richard&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in his collection.

<text>Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting (&quot;sawm&quot;), prayer (&quot;salah&quot;), reflection, and community. It is also the month in which the Quran is believed to have been revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam and lasts twenty-nine to thirty days, from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next.

Fasting from dawn to sunset is obligatory (&quot;fard&quot;) for all adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill, travelling, elderly, breastfeeding, diabetic, pregnant, or menstruating. The predawn meal is referred to as &quot;suhur&quot;, and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called &quot;iftar&quot;. Although rulings (&quot;fatawa&quot;) have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca, it is common practice to follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day.

The spiritual rewards (&quot;thawab&quot;) of fasting are believed to be multiplied during Ramadan. Accordingly, during the hours of fasting, Muslims refrain not only from food and drink, but also from all behavior deemed to be sinful in Islam, devoting themselves instead to prayer and study of the Quran.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Ramadan&quot; derives from the Arabic root &quot;R-M-Ḍ&quot; () &quot;scorching heat&quot;, which is the Classical Arabic verb &quot;&quot;ramiḍa&quot; ()&quot; meaning &quot;become intensely hot – become burning; become scorching; be blazing; be glowing&quot;.

Ramadan is thought of as one of the names of God in Islam by some, and as such it is reported in many hadiths that it is prohibited to say only &quot;Ramadan&quot; in reference to the calendar month and that it is necessary to say &quot;month of Ramadan&quot;, as reported in Sunni, Shia and Zaydi sources. However, the report has been graded by others as Mawḍūʻ (fabricated) and inauthentic.

In the Persian language, the Arabic letter (&quot;Ḍād&quot;) is pronounced as /z/. The Muslim communities in some countries with historical Persian influence, such as Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, India, Pakistan and Turkey, use the word &quot;Ramazan&quot; or &quot;Ramzan&quot;. The word &quot;Romzan&quot; is used in Bangladesh.

== History ==

Muslims hold that all scriptures were revealed during Ramadan, the scrolls of Abraham, Torah, Psalms, Gospel, and Quran having been handed down during that month. Muhammad is said to have received his first quranic revelation on &quot;Laylat al-Qadr&quot;, one of five odd-numbered nights that fall during the last ten days of Ramadan.

Although Muslims were first commanded to fast in the second year of &quot;Hijra&quot; (624 CE), they believe that the practice of fasting is not in fact an innovation of monotheism but rather has always been necessary for believers to attain fear of God (&quot;taqwa&quot;). They point to the fact that the pre-Islamic pagans of Mecca fasted on the tenth day of Muharram to expiate sin and avoid drought. Philip Jenkins argues that the observance of Ramadan fasting grew out of &quot;the strict Lenten discipline of the Syrian Churches,&quot; a postulation corroborated by other scholars, including theologian Paul-Gordon Chandler, but disputed by some Muslim academics. The Quran itself emphasizes that the fast it prescribes had already been prescribed to earlier biblical communities (2:183), even though an explicit intertext for this pre-Islamic practice does not exist.

== Important dates ==
The Islamic calendar is a lunar one, where each month begins when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. The Islamic year consists of 12 lunar cycles, and consequently it is 10 to 11 days shorter than the solar year, and as it contains no intercalation, Ramadan migrates throughout the seasons. The Islamic day starts after sunset. The estimated start and end dates for Ramadan, based on the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia, are:


Many Muslims insist on the local physical sighting of the moon to mark the beginning of Ramadan, but others use the calculated time of the new moon or the Saudi Arabian declaration to determine the start of the month. Since the new moon is not in the same state at the same time globally, the beginning and ending dates of Ramadan depend on what lunar sightings are received in each respective location. As a result, Ramadan dates vary in different countries, but usually only by a day. This is due to the cycles of the moon; the moon may not meet the criteria to qualify as a waxing crescent, which delineates the change in months, at the time of sundown in one location while later meeting it in another location. Astronomical projections that approximate the start of Ramadan are available.

=== Beginning ===

Because the &quot;hilāl&quot;, or crescent moon, typically occurs approximately one day after the new moon, Muslims can usually estimate the beginning of Ramadan; however, many Muslims prefer to confirm the opening of Ramadan by direct visual observation of the crescent.

=== &quot;Laylat al-Qadr&quot; ===
The &quot;Laylat al-Qadr&quot; () or &quot;Night of Power&quot; is the night that Muslims believe the Quran was first sent down to the world, and Muhammad received his first quranic revelation from it. The night is considered to be the holiest night of the year. It is generally believed to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan; the Dawoodi Bohra believe that &quot;Laylat al-Qadr&quot; was the twenty-third night of Ramadan.

=== &quot;Eid&quot; ===

The holiday of &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot; (Arabic: عيد الفطر), which marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of &quot;Shawwal&quot;, the next lunar month, is declared after a crescent new moon has been sighted or after completion of thirty days of fasting if no sighting of the moon is possible. &quot;Eid&quot; celebrates the return to a more natural disposition (&quot;fitra&quot;) of eating, drinking, and marital intimacy.

== Religious practices ==

The common practice is to fast from dawn to sunset. The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the &quot;suhur&quot;, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is called &quot;iftar&quot;.

Muslims devote more time to prayer and acts of charity, striving to improve their self-discipline, motivated by hadith: &quot;When Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of hell are locked up and devils are put in chains.&quot;

=== Fasting ===

Ramadan is a time of spiritual reflection, self-improvement, and heightened devotion and worship. Muslims are expected to put more effort into following the teachings of Islam. The fast (&quot;sawm&quot;) begins at dawn and ends at sunset. In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims abstain from sexual relations and sinful speech and behaviour during Ramadan. Fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities, and to cleanse the soul by freeing it from harmful impurities. Muslims believe that Ramadan teaches them to practice self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate, thus encouraging actions of generosity and compulsory charity (&quot;zakat&quot;).

Exemptions from fasting include those traveling, menstruating, severely ill, pregnant, or breastfeeding. Those unable to fast are obligated to make up the missed days later.

==== &quot;Suhur&quot; ====
Each day before dawn, Muslims observe a pre-fast meal called the &quot;suhur&quot;. After stopping a short time before dawn, Muslims begin the first prayer of the day, Fajr.

==== &quot;Iftar&quot; ====
At sunset, families break the fast with the &quot;iftar&quot;, traditionally opening the meal by eating dates to commemorate Muhammad&#x27;s practice of breaking the fast with three dates. They then adjourn for Maghrib, the fourth of the five required daily prayers, after which the main meal is served. 

Social gatherings, many times in buffet style, are frequent at &quot;iftar&quot;. Traditional dishes are often highlighted, including traditional desserts, particularly those made only during Ramadan. Water is usually the beverage of choice, but juice and milk are also often available, as are soft drinks and caffeinated beverages.

In the Middle East, &quot;iftar&quot; consists of water, juices, dates, salads and appetizers; one or more main dishes; and rich desserts, with dessert considered the most important aspect of the meal. Typical main dishes include lamb stewed with wheat berries, lamb kebabs with grilled vegetables, and roasted chicken served with chickpea-studded rice pilaf. Desserts may include lokma, baklava or knafeh.

Over time, the practice of &quot;iftar&quot; has evolved into banquets that may accommodate hundreds or even thousands of diners. The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, the largest mosque in the UAE, feeds up to thirty thousand people every night. 
=== Charity ===

&quot;Zakat&quot;, often translated as &quot;the poor-rate&quot;, is the fixed percentage of income a believer is required to give to the poor; the practice is obligatory as one of the pillars of Islam. Muslims believe that good deeds are rewarded more handsomely during Ramadan than at any other time of the year; consequently, many Muslims donate a larger portionor even allof their yearly &quot;zakat&quot; during this month.

=== Nightly prayers ===
&quot;Tarawih&quot; () are extra nightly prayers performed during the month of Ramadan. Contrary to popular belief, they are not compulsory.

=== Recitation of the Quran ===
Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Quran, which comprises thirty &quot;juz&#x27;&quot; (sections), over the thirty days of Ramadan.

== Cultural practices ==

In some Islamic countries, lights (&quot;fanous&quot;) are strung up in public squares and across city streets, a tradition believed to have originated during the Fatimid Caliphate, where the rule of Caliph al-Mu&#x27;izz li-Din Allah was acclaimed by people holding lanterns.

On the island of Java, many believers bathe in holy springs to prepare for fasting, a ritual known as &quot;Padusan&quot;. The city of Semarang marks the beginning of Ramadan with the Dugderan carnival, which involves parading the warak ngendog, a horse-dragon hybrid creature allegedly inspired by the Buraq. In the Chinese-influenced capital city of Jakarta, firecrackers are widely used to celebrate Ramadan, although they are officially illegal. Towards the end of Ramadan, most employees receive a one-month bonus known as &quot;Tunjangan Hari Raya&quot;. Certain kinds of food are especially popular during Ramadan, such as large beef or buffalo in Aceh and snails in Central Java. The iftar meal is announced every evening by striking the bedug, a giant drum, in the mosque.

Common greetings during Ramadan include &quot;Ramadan mubarak&quot; and &quot;Ramadan kareem&quot;, which mean (have a) &quot;blessed Ramadan&quot; and &quot;generous Ramadan&quot; respectively.

During Ramadan in the Middle East, a &quot;mesaharati&quot; beats a drum across a neighbourhood to wake people up to eat the suhoor meal. Similarly in Southeast Asia, the &quot;kentongan&quot; slit drum is used for the same purpose.

Ramadan attracts significant increases in television viewership, as the usual prime time hours coincide with the &quot;iftar&quot;, and are commonly extended into the late-night hours to coincide with the s&quot;uhur&quot;. Broadcasters in the Arab world traditionally premiere serial dramas known as &quot;musalsal&quot; during Ramadan; they are similar in style to Latin American telenovelas, and are typically around 30 episodes in length so that they run over the length of the month. Advertisers in the region have considered Ramadan to be comparable to the Super Bowl on U.S. television in terms of impact and importance; the cost of a 30-second commercial in peak time during Ramadan is usually more than double than normal. 

== Observance ==
According to a 2012 Pew Research Centre study, there was widespread Ramadan observance, with a median of 93 percent across the thirty-nine countries and territories studied. Regions with high percentages of fasting among Muslims include Southeast Asia, South Asia, Middle East and North Africa, Horn of Africa and most of Sub-Saharan Africa. Percentages are lower in Central Asia and Southeast Europe.

=== Ramadan in polar regions ===

The length of the dawn to sunset time varies in different parts of the world according to summer or winter solstices of the Sun. Most Muslims fast for eleven to sixteen hours during Ramadan. However, in polar regions, the period between dawn and sunset may exceed twenty-two hours in summer. For example, in 2014, Muslims in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Trondheim, Norway, fasted almost twenty-two hours, while Muslims in Sydney, Australia, fasted for only about eleven hours. In areas characterized by continuous night or day, some Muslims follow the fasting schedule observed in the nearest city that experiences sunrise and sunset, while others follow Mecca time.

===Ramadan in Earth orbit===
As sunrise and sunset occur sixteen times each a day in low-Earth orbit, Muslim astronauts in space schedule religious practices around the time zone of the last place on Earth they were on. For example, this means an astronaut from Malaysia launching from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida would center their fast according to sunrise and sunset times in Cape Canaveral, in Florida&#x27;s Eastern Time. This includes times for daily prayers, as well as sunset and sunrise for Ramadan.

== Laws ==
In some Muslim countries, eating in public during daylight hours in Ramadan is a crime. The sale of alcohol becomes prohibited during Ramadan in Egypt. The penalty for publicly eating, drinking or smoking during Ramadan can result in fines or incarceration in the countries of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Algeria and Malaysia. In the United Arab Emirates, the punishment is community service.

In some countries, on the contrary, the observance of Ramadan has been restricted by governments. In the USSR, the practice of Ramadan was suppressed by officials. In Albania, Ramadan festivities were banned during the communist period. However, many Albanians continued to fast secretly during this period.

China is reported to have banned Ramadan fasting for officials, students, and teachers in Xinjiang since 2012. Radio Free Asia alleged that residents in Kashgar Prefecture were encouraged to report those who fasted to the authorities. The ban has been denied by Chinese diplomats and Muslim associations in Xinjiang. Antara News, &quot;Daily Times&quot;, and &quot;Pakistan Today&quot; have also brought up accounts of residents in Xinjiang fasting. According to a 2024 visit to Xinjiang by a reporter from the British magazine The Economist, many Uyghurs do not fast during Ramadan because, according to locals, &quot;the Chinese government guarantees freedom of religion&quot;.

== Employment during Ramadan ==
Muslims continue to work during Ramadan; however, in some countries, such as Oman and Lebanon, working hours are shortened. It is often recommended that working Muslims inform their employers if they are fasting, given the potential for the observance to impact performance at work. The extent to which Ramadan observers are protected by religious accommodation varies by country. Policies putting them at a disadvantage compared to other employees have been met with discrimination claims in the United Kingdom and the United States. An Arab News article reported that Saudi Arabian businesses were unhappy with shorter working hours during Ramadan, some reporting a decline in productivity of 35–50%. The Saudi businesses proposed awarding salary bonuses in order to incentivize longer hours. Despite the reduction in productivity, merchants can enjoy higher profit margins in Ramadan due to increase in demand.

Some countries impose modified work schedules. In the UAE, Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and Kuwait, employees may work no more than six hours per day and thirty-six hours per week.

== Health effects ==
There are various health effects of fasting in Ramadan. Ramadan fasting is considered safe for healthy individuals; it may pose risks for individuals with certain pre-existing conditions. Most Islamic scholars hold that fasting is not required for those who are ill. Additionally, the elderly and pre-pubertal children are exempt from fasting. Pregnant or lactating women are also exempt from fasting during Ramadan. There are known health risks involved in pregnant women who fast, which include the potential of induced labour and gestational diabetes.

There are some health benefits of fasting in Ramadan including increasing insulin sensitivity and reducing insulin resistance. It has also been shown that there is a significant improvement in 10 years coronary heart disease risk score and other cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids profile, systolic blood pressure, weight, BMI and waist circumference in subjects with a previous history of cardiovascular disease. The fasting period is usually associated with modest weight loss, but weight can return afterwards.

In many cultures, it is associated with heavy food and water intake during Suhur and Iftar times, which may do more harm than good. Ramadan fasting is safe for healthy people provided that overall food and water intake is adequate but those with medical conditions should seek medical advice if they encounter health problems before or during fasting.

The education departments of Berlin and the United Kingdom have tried to discourage students from fasting during Ramadan, as they claim that not eating or drinking can lead to concentration problems and bad grades.

A review of the literature by an Iranian group suggested fasting during Ramadan might produce renal injury in patients with moderate (GFR &lt;60 ml/min) or severe kidney disease but was not injurious to renal transplant patients with good function or most stone-forming patients.

A study on 55 professional Algerian soccer players showed that performance during Ramadan declined significantly for speed, agility, dribbling speed and endurance, and most stayed low 2 weeks after the conclusion of Ramadan.

<text>Around the start of the Common Era, the family trees of the gens Julia and the gens Claudia became intertwined into the Julio-Claudian family tree as a result of marriages and adoptions.

==Descendancy of the emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty==

The Julio-Claudian dynasty was the first dynasty of Roman emperors. All emperors of that dynasty descended from Julii Caesares and/or from Claudii. Marriages between descendants of Sextus Julius Caesar and Claudii had occurred from the late stages of the Roman Republic, but the intertwined Julio-Claudian family tree resulted mostly from adoptions and marriages in Imperial Rome&#x27;s first decades. Note that descendancy of the Julii Caesares before the generation of Julius Caesar&#x27;s grandfather is in part conjectural, but as presented by scholars.

===Simplified===









==By generation==
In the Julio-Claudian dynasty of Roman emperors, the lineage of the Julii Caesares was separated from those of the Claudii up to Augustus&#x27; generation. The next generation had both Claudii with a Julia as ancestor, as Claudii adopted into the Julii Caesares family. After Tiberius, the remaining three emperors of the dynasty had, outside adoptions, ancestors in both the Julian and the Claudian families.

===Generation of Julius Caesar&#x27;s grandfather===
Gaius Julius Caesar II and Lucius Julius Caesar II may have had Sextus Julius Caesar, the military tribune of 181 BC, as a common ancestor.




===Generation of Julius Caesar&#x27;s father===
This generation of Julii Caesares has two consuls: Sextus Julius Caesar in 91 BC, and Lucius Julius Caesar the next year. This generation has also two female descendants very close to the centers of power by their marriages: Julia, the daughter of Gaius Julius Caesar II was married to seven-times consul Gaius Marius, while Julia, the daughter of Lucius Julius Caesar II was married to the two-times consul and Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who had successfully challenged Marius&#x27; power. For ensuing generations, Gaius Julius Caesar (proconsul of Asia), married to a consul&#x27;s daughter, and Lucius Julius Caesar proved to be quintessential ancestors of those who held Imperial power in the Julio-Claudian dynasty.




===Julius Caesar&#x27;s generation===
Following Sulla&#x27;s example Julius Caesar&#x27;s and Pompey&#x27;s first marriages were with women of their own generation, later marrying women of a younger generation. After being betrothed to Cossutia, Julius Caesar&#x27;s first wife was Cornelia, the mother of Julia. The younger of Caesar&#x27;s two sisters married Marcus Atius Balbus: they were ancestors of all the Julio-Claudian emperors, apart from Tiberius.

This is also the generation of Mark Antony&#x27;s parents. Mark Antony&#x27;s mother Julia was the daughter of Lucius Julius Caesar: she was an ancestor of the last three emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.




===Generation of Julius Caesar&#x27;s daughter===
By this time marriages with a political agenda among the powerful families were in full swing, however not yet between Julii Caesares and Claudii. Pompey married Julius Caesar&#x27;s daughter Julia. Julius Caesar&#x27;s second wife Pompeia, possibly a great-granddaughter of Lucius Julius Caesar II, was a granddaughter of Sulla. His third wife Calpurnia is said to be younger than his daughter. His son Caesarion resulted from his relation with Cleopatra.

Atia, the daughter of Julius Caesar&#x27;s sister, married Gaius Octavius: they became the parents of the first emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, then still called Octavianus. Their daughter Octavia the Younger became an ancestor to the last three emperors of that dynasty. In this generation Mark Antony had children by, among others, Antonia Hybrida Minor, and Fulvia.







===Generation of the Octavias===
The Claudii were a powerful gens with consuls and other high ranking politicians in several of its families across several generations. In this generation the first marriages between Claudii and descendants of the Julii Caesares took place. This however didn&#x27;t mean yet that the dynastic family trees of both gentes got merged into a single one: that didn&#x27;t happen until the adoption of Claudii by (adopted) Julii Caesares in the generations to come.

Octavia the Younger&#x27;s first husband was a Claudius from the Marcelli family. Claudia, descending from Claudii, became the first wife of Octavian, who by then was adopted in the Julii Caesares family by the testament of his uncle Julius Caesar. After her first husband&#x27;s death, Octavia married Mark Antony, who besides the offspring of his first three marriages had had children by Cleopatra.

Augustus daughter Julia the Elder&#x27;s first marriage was to Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa; their daughter Julia the Younger married Lucius Aemilius Paullus; their youngest child was Junia Lepida married to Gaius Cassius Longinus (consul AD 30). Junia and Gaius granddaughter Domitia Longina married twice: 1) Lucius Aelius Lamia Plautius Aelianus and 2) Emperor Domitian of the Flavian dynasty. Issue from Domitia Longina first marriage was Lucius Fundanius Lamia Aelianus and Plautia, their children married into the Antonine dynasty.



 




===Antonia Major&#x27;s generation===
Octavianus, becoming Augustus the first Roman emperor, married Scribonia who gave him a daughter (Julia the Elder). His last marriage was with Livia, a Claudia who had been married to a Claudius. Their son Tiberius, by birth a Claudius, was later adopted by Augustus, thus, like his stepfather Augustus, becoming one of the Julii Caesares by adoption.




===Antonia Minor&#x27;s generation===
Antonia Minor&#x27;s husband Nero Claudius Drusus, a.k.a. Drusus the Elder, was a Claudian like his brother emperor Tiberius: they were the sons of Tiberius Claudius Nero, the praetor of 42 BC.




===Agrippina the Elder&#x27;s generation===
Without son, Augustus had adopted his grandsons (by his only daughter Julia) Gaius, Lucius and Postumus, and his stepson Tiberius, in order to ensure an heir and successor. Around the time of his death only Tiberius remained and he became the next emperor. Tiberius, a Claudius by birth had become one of the Julii Caesares by adoption: from this moment this first dynasty of Roman emperors was both Julian and Claudian. The further emperors of this dynasty had both Julian and Claudian ancestors.




===Agrippina the Younger&#x27;s generation===
Caligula was the last emperor adopted into the family of the Julii Caesares. He was a Claudius by descendance, although he had Julii Caesares among his ancestors, from both his mother&#x27;s and his father&#x27;s side.


Most marriages remained childless and many potential successors in the dynasty were eliminated after rampant accusations.




Claudius, the fourth emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, was a brother to Caligula&#x27;s father Germanicus. He belonged to the gens Claudia with, from his mother&#x27;s side, Julian ancestors.




===Poppaea Sabina&#x27;s generation===
Nero, the last emperor of the dynasty, was by birth a Domitius with as well Julian ancestors (from both his mother&#x27;s as his father&#x27;s side), as Claudian (from his mother&#x27;s side). He became a Claudian himself, by adoption by his stepfather emperor Claudius, a brother to his grandfather from his mother&#x27;s side, or, from his father&#x27;s side, a son of his grandmother&#x27;s sister.

<text>The Rainhill trials were a competition run from the 6 to 14 October 1829, to test George Stephenson&#x27;s argument that locomotives would have the best motive power for the then nearly-completed Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR). Ten locomotives were entered, of which five were able to compete, running along a length of level track at Rainhill, in Lancashire (now Merseyside).

Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket was the only locomotive to complete the trials, and was declared the winner. The directors of the L&amp;MR accepted that locomotives should operate services on their new line, and George and Robert Stephenson were given the contract to produce locomotives for the railway.

==Background==
The directors of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway had originally intended to use stationary steam engines to haul trains along the railway using cables. They had appointed George Stephenson as their engineer of the line in 1826, and he strongly advocated for the use of steam locomotives instead. As the railway was approaching completion, the directors decided to hold a competition to decide whether locomotives could be used to pull the trains; these became the Rainhill trials. A prize of £500 (equal to £ today) was offered to the winner of the trials.

Three engineers were selected as judges: John Urpeth Rastrick, a locomotive engineer of Stourbridge, Nicholas Wood, a mining engineer from Killingworth with considerable locomotive design experience, and John Kennedy, a Manchester cotton spinner and a major proponent of the railway.

== Rules ==
The L&amp;MR company set the rules for the trials. The rules went through several revisions; the final set, under which the competition was held, was:




== Entries ==
Ten locomotives were officially entered for the trials, but on the day the competition began – 6 October 1829 – only five locomotives were available to run:

*&quot;Cycloped&quot;, a horse-powered locomotive built by Thomas Shaw Brandreth.
*&quot;Novelty&quot;, the world&#x27;s first tank locomotive, built by John Ericsson and John Braithwaite.
*&quot;Perseverance&quot;, a Vertical boilered locomotive, built by Timothy Burstall.
*&quot;Rocket&quot;, designed by George and Robert Stephenson; built by Robert Stephenson and Company.
*&quot;Sans Pareil&quot;, built by Timothy Hackworth.

== Competition ==
The length of the L&amp;MR that ran past Rainhill village was straight and level for over , and was chosen as the site for the trials. The locomotives were to run at Kenrick&#x27;s Cross, on the mile east from the Manchester side of Rainhill Bridge. Two or three locomotives ran each day, and several tests for each locomotive were performed over the course of six days. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people turned up to watch the trials and bands provided musical entertainment on both days.

&quot;Cycloped&quot; was the first to drop out of the competition. It used a horse walking on a drive belt for power and was withdrawn after an accident caused the horse to burst through the floor of the engine.

The next locomotive to retire was &quot;Perseverance&quot;, which was damaged in transit to the competition. Burstall spent the first five days of the trials repairing his locomotive, and though it ran on the sixth day, it failed to reach the required speed and was withdrawn from the trial. It was granted a £25 consolation prize (equal to £ today).

&quot;Sans Pareil&quot; nearly completed the trials, though at first there was some doubt as to whether it would be allowed to compete as it was overweight. However, it did eventually complete eight trips before cracking a cylinder. Despite the failure it was purchased by the L&amp;MR, where it ran for two years before being leased to the Bolton and Leigh Railway.

The last locomotive to drop out was &quot;Novelty&quot; which used advanced technology for 1829 and was lighter and considerably faster than the other locomotives in the competition. It was the crowd favourite and reached a then-astonishing on the first day of competition. It later suffered damage to a boiler pipe which could not be fixed properly on site. Nevertheless, it ran the next day and reached before the repaired pipe failed and damaged the engine severely enough that it had to be withdrawn.

The &quot;Rocket&quot; was the only locomotive that completed the trials. It averaged and achieved a top speed of ) hauling 13 tons, and was declared the winner of the £500 prize (equal to £ today). The Stephensons were given the contract to produce locomotives for the L&amp;MR.

&quot;The Times&quot; carried a full report of the trials on 12 October 1829 from which the following extract are taken:
==Additional trials==
After the Rainhill trials &quot;Rocket&quot; was tested on the Whiston Incline and was able to haul eight tons at and 12 tons at up the 1:96 gradient.

==Re-enactments==
=== &quot;Rocket&quot; 150 ===

In May 1980 the &quot;Rocket 150&quot; celebration was held to mark the 150th Anniversary of the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and the trials the year before.

A replica of &quot;Novelty&quot; was built for the event, which was also attended by replicas of &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; and &quot;Rocket&quot; (plus coach). On the first day of the Trials, the Rocket came off the rails as it was exiting the Bold Colliery sidings and buckled the rim of one of its large drive wheels. That evening, senior staff from a St Helens road transport company met a former colleague of the builder of the Rocket replica, at a Liverpool Hotel and agreed that, in the early hours of the following morning, they would urgently manufacture some steel parts (wedges) in their nearby workshops, to fix the bent drive wheel before the second day&#x27;s parade commenced. At the same time, BR agreed to put a team of staff into the sidings at Bold to straighten the bent rails. Both activities were achieved on time and the Rocket ran successfully on the following two days of the Trials, though Sans Pareil was pushed by Lion and Novelty was on a wagon hauled by LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 5000. As the line was then not electrified, the Advanced Passenger Train was also pushed, but by the latest diesel, Class 56, 077.

The &#x27;Grand Cavalcade&#x27; on each of the three days featured up to 40 steam and diesel locomotives and other examples of modern traction, including:
* &quot;Lion&quot;, at the time of &quot;Rocket&quot; 150 the oldest operable steam locomotive in existence&lt;br&gt;(The British-built US locomotive &quot;John Bull&quot;, seven years older, was steamed again in 1981)
* &quot;LNER Class A3 4-6-2 No. 4472 Flying Scotsman&quot;
* LMS 5XP Jubilee Class 4-6-0 No. 5690 &quot;Leander&quot;
* &quot;LNER Class A4 4-6-2 No. 4498 Sir Nigel Gresley&quot; 
* &quot;LNER Class V2 2-6-2 No. 4471 Green Arrow&quot;
* GWR 2551 Collett Goods 0-No. 3205
* LMS Ivatt Class 4 2-6-0 No. 43106
* BR Standard Class 9F 2-10-0 No. 92220 &#x27;Evening Star&#x27;, the last steam locomotive to be built by British Railways
* LMS Princess Royal Class 4-6-2 No. 6201 &quot;Princess Elizabeth&quot; 

Two Class 86 locomotives 86214 &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; and 86235 &quot;Novelty&quot; were painted in a variation of the Large Logo Rail Blue livery where the BR logo was replaced by &quot;Rocket&quot; 150 motif on a yellow background.

=== 2002 Restaging ===
In a 2002 restaging of the Rainhill trials using replica engines, neither &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; (11 out of 20 runs) nor &quot;Novelty&quot; (10 out of 20 runs) completed the course. In calculating the speeds and fuel efficiencies, it was found that &quot;Rocket&quot; would still have won, as its relatively modern technology made it a much more reliable locomotive than the others. &quot;Novelty&quot; almost matched it in terms of efficiency, but its firebox design caused it to gradually slow to a halt due to a buildup of molten ash (called &quot;clinker&quot;) cutting off the air supply. The restaged trials were run over the Llangollen Railway, Wales, and were the subject of a 2003 BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; documentary.

For the restaging, major compromises were made for television and because of the differences in crew experience, the fuel used, the modifications made to the replicas for modern safety rules, modern materials and construction methods, and following operating experience. Comparisons were made between the engines only after calculations took into account the differences.

<doc id="26176" wikidata="Q193709" url="?curid=26176" title="Rayleigh scattering">
<text>Rayleigh scattering ( ) is the scattering or deflection of light, or other electromagnetic radiation, by particles with a size much smaller than the wavelength of the radiation. For light frequencies well below the resonance frequency of the scattering medium (normal dispersion regime), the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength (e.g., a blue color is scattered much more than a red color as light propagates through air). The phenomenon is named after the 19th-century British physicist Lord Rayleigh (John William Strutt). 
Rayleigh scattering results from the electric polarizability of the particles. The oscillating electric field of a light wave acts on the charges within a particle, causing them to move at the same frequency. The particle, therefore, becomes a small radiating dipole whose radiation we see as scattered light. The particles may be individual atoms or molecules; it can occur when light travels through transparent solids and liquids, but is most prominently seen in gases.

Rayleigh scattering of sunlight in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere causes diffuse sky radiation, which is the reason for the blue color of the daytime and twilight sky, as well as the yellowish to reddish hue of the low Sun. Sunlight is also subject to Raman scattering, which changes the rotational state of the molecules and gives rise to polarization effects.

Scattering by particles with a size comparable to, or larger than, the wavelength of the light is typically treated by the Mie theory, the discrete dipole approximation and other computational techniques. Rayleigh scattering applies to particles that are small with respect to wavelengths of light, and that are optically &quot;soft&quot; (i.e., with a refractive index close to 1). Anomalous diffraction theory applies to optically soft but larger particles.

==History==
In 1869, while attempting to determine whether any contaminants remained in the purified air he used for infrared experiments, John Tyndall discovered that bright light scattering off nanoscopic particulates was faintly blue-tinted. He conjectured that a similar scattering of sunlight gave the sky its blue hue, but he could not explain the preference for blue light, nor could atmospheric dust explain the intensity of the sky&#x27;s color.

In 1871, Lord Rayleigh published two papers on the color and polarization of skylight to quantify Tyndall&#x27;s effect in water droplets in terms of the tiny particulates&#x27; volumes and refractive indices. In 1881, with the benefit of James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s 1865 proof of the electromagnetic nature of light, he showed that his equations followed from electromagnetism. In 1899, he showed that they applied to individual molecules, with terms containing particulate volumes and refractive indices replaced with terms for molecular polarizability.

==Small size parameter approximation==
The size of a scattering particle is often parameterized by the ratio

formula_1

where &quot;r&quot; is the particle&#x27;s radius, &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the light and &quot;x&quot; is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the particle&#x27;s interaction with the incident radiation such that: Objects with x ≫ 1 act as geometric shapes, scattering light according to their projected area. At the intermediate x ≃ 1 of Mie scattering, interference effects develop through phase variations over the object&#x27;s surface. Rayleigh scattering applies to the case when the scattering particle is very small (x ≪ 1, with a particle size &lt; 1/10 of wavelength) and the whole surface re-radiates with the same phase. Because the particles are randomly positioned, the scattered light arrives at a particular point with a random collection of phases; it is incoherent and the resulting intensity is just the sum of the squares of the amplitudes from each particle and therefore proportional to the inverse fourth power of the wavelength and the sixth power of its size. The wavelength dependence is characteristic of dipole scattering and the volume dependence will apply to any scattering mechanism. In detail, the intensity of light scattered by any one of the small spheres of radius &quot;r&quot; and refractive index &quot;n&quot; from a beam of unpolarized light of wavelength &quot;λ&quot; and intensity &quot;I&quot;0 is given by
formula_2
where &quot;R&quot; is the distance to the particle and &quot;θ&quot; is the scattering angle. Averaging this over all angles gives the Rayleigh scattering cross-section of the particles in air:
formula_3
Here &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index of the spheres that approximate the molecules of the gas; the index of the gas surrounding the spheres is neglected, an approximation that introduces an error of less than 0.05%.

The fraction of light scattered by scattering particles over the unit travel length (e.g., meter) is the number of particles per unit volume &quot;N&quot; times the cross-section. For example, air has a refractive index of 1.0002793 at atmospheric pressure, where there are about molecules per cubic meter, and therefore the major constituent of the atmosphere, nitrogen, has a Rayleigh cross section of at a wavelength of 532 nm (green light). This means that about a fraction 10−5 of the light will be scattered for every meter of travel.

The strong wavelength dependence of the scattering (~&quot;λ&quot;−4) means that shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer (red) wavelengths.

==From molecules==

The expression above can also be written in terms of individual molecules by expressing the dependence on refractive index in terms of the molecular polarizability &quot;α&quot;, proportional to the dipole moment induced by the electric field of the light. In this case, the Rayleigh scattering intensity for a single particle is given in CGS-units by
formula_4
and in SI-units by
formula_5

== Effect of fluctuations ==
When the dielectric constant formula_6 of a certain region of volume formula_7 is different from the average dielectric constant of the medium formula_8, then any incident light will be scattered according to the following equation

formula_9where formula_10 represents the variance of the fluctuation in the dielectric constant formula_6.

== Cause of the blue color of the sky==
{{Main|Diffuse sky radiation}}
The blue color of the sky is a consequence of three factors: 
*the blackbody spectrum of sunlight coming into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, 
*Rayleigh scattering of that light off oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and 
*the response of the human visual system.

The strong wavelength dependence of the Rayleigh scattering (~&quot;λ&quot;−4) means that shorter (blue) wavelengths are scattered more strongly than longer (red) wavelengths. This results in the indirect blue and violet light coming from all regions of the sky. The human eye responds to this wavelength combination as if it were a combination of blue and white light.

Some of the scattering can also be from sulfate particles. For years after large Plinian eruptions, the blue cast of the sky is notably brightened by the persistent sulfate load of the stratospheric gases. Some works of the artist J. M. W. Turner may owe their vivid red colours to the eruption of Mount Tambora in his lifetime.

In locations with little light pollution, the moonlit night sky is also blue, because moonlight is reflected sunlight, with a slightly lower color temperature due to the brownish color of the Moon. The moonlit sky is not perceived as blue, however, because at low light levels human vision comes mainly from rod cells that do not produce any color perception (Purkinje effect).

==Of sound in amorphous solids==
Rayleigh scattering is also an important mechanism of wave scattering in amorphous solids such as glass, and is responsible for acoustic wave damping and phonon damping in glasses and granular matter at low or not too high temperatures. This is because in glasses at higher temperatures the Rayleigh-type scattering regime is obscured by the anharmonic damping (typically with a ~&quot;λ&quot;−2 dependence on wavelength), which becomes increasingly more important as the temperature rises.

==In amorphous solids – glasses – optical fibers==
Rayleigh scattering is an important component of the scattering of optical signals in optical fibers. Silica fibers are glasses, disordered materials with microscopic variations of density and refractive index. These give rise to energy losses due to the scattered light, with the following coefficient:
formula_12

where &quot;n&quot; is the refraction index, &quot;p&quot; is the photoelastic coefficient of the glass, &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant, and &quot;β&quot; is the isothermal compressibility. &quot;T&quot;f is a &quot;fictive temperature&quot;, representing the temperature at which the density fluctuations are &quot;frozen&quot; in the material.

==In porous materials==

Rayleigh-type &quot;λ&quot;−4 scattering can also be exhibited by porous materials. An example is the strong optical scattering by nanoporous materials. The strong contrast in refractive index between pores and solid parts of sintered alumina results in very strong scattering, with light completely changing direction each five micrometers on average. The &quot;λ&quot;−4-type scattering is caused by the nanoporous structure (a narrow pore size distribution around ~70 nm) obtained by sintering monodispersive alumina powder.

<doc id="26179" wikidata="Q6053650" url="?curid=26179" title="Ron Popeil">
<text>Ronald Martin Popeil ( ; May 3, 1935 – July 28, 2021) was an American inventor and marketing personality, and founder of the direct response marketing company Ronco. He made appearances in infomercials for the Showtime Rotisserie and coined the phrase &quot;Set it, and forget it!&quot; as well as popularizing the phrase, &quot;But wait, there&#x27;s more!&quot; on television as early as the mid-1950s.

==Personal life and career==
Popeil was born to a Jewish family in Manhattan in 1935, the son of Julia (née Schwartz) and Samuel Popeil. When he was six, his parents divorced and he and his brother went to live in Florida with their grandparents. At age 17 in 1952, he went with his grandparents to work for his father at his company&#x27;s (Popeil Brothers) manufacturing facility in Chicago. His grandparents later returned to Florida and Popeil remained with his father.

When he was 18, Popeil attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he joined Alpha Epsilon Pi before withdrawing after six months. 

After returning from college, Popeil continued to work and learn from his father, who was also an inventor and salesman of numerous kitchen-related gadgets, such as the Chop-O-Matic and the Veg-O-Matic. The Chop-O-Matic retailed for US$3.98 and sold over two million units.

The invention of the Chop-O-Matic caused a problem that marked the entrance of Ron Popeil into television. The Chop-O-Matic was so efficient at chopping vegetables that it was impractical for salesmen to carry all the vegetables needed for the demonstrations over the course of a day. The solution was to tape the demonstration. Once the demonstration was taped, it was a short step to broadcasting it as a commercial.

Popeil initially operated as a distributor of his father&#x27;s kitchen products and later formed his own company, Ronco, in 1964. He continued as a distributor for his father and added additional products from other manufacturers. Ron Popeil and his father became competitors in the 1970s for the same retail store business.

Popeil received the Ig Nobel Prize in Consumer Engineering in 1993. The awards committee described him as the &quot;incessant inventor and perpetual pitchman of late night television&quot; and awarded the prize in recognition of his &quot;redefining the industrial revolution&quot; with his devices. He was a past member of the board of directors of Mirage Resorts, where he served for 22 years under Steve Wynn, as well as a past member of the board of directors of MGM Hotels for seven years under Kirk Kerkorian. He became the recipient of the Electronic Retail Association&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement award in 2001 and he is listed in the Direct Response Hall of Fame.

Popeil was previously a member of the advisory board for University of California, Los Angeles&#x27; Business, Management, and Legal Programs. In August 2005, he sold his company, Ronco, to Fi-Tek VII, a Denver holding company, for US$55 million, with plans to continue serving as the spokesman and inventor while being able to spend more time with his family.

In 1956, Popeil married Marilyn Greene, with whom he had two daughters; they divorced in 1963. He married Lisa Boehne some time after this and had one daughter with her. He and Boehne divorced sometime before 1995, when he married Robin Angers, with whom he had two more daughters. Ashley Tisdale and Jennifer Tisdale are his cousins.

==Death==
Popeil died on July 28, 2021, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at age 86. He had been sent there a day earlier for a medical emergency. No cause of death was given. According to his half-sister, Lisa Popeil, the cause of death was a brain hemorrhage.

==Inventions==

Popeil is noted for marketing and in some cases inventing a wide variety of products. Among the better known and more successful are the Chop-O-Matic hand food processor (&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I&#x27;m going to show you the greatest kitchen appliance ever made ... All your onions chopped to perfection without shedding a single tear.&quot;), the Dial-O-Matic successor to the Veg-O-Matic (&quot;Slice a tomato so thin it only has one side.&quot;), and the Ronco Pocket Fisherman. Popeil is also well known for his housewares inventions like his Giant Dehydrator and Beef Jerky Machine, his Electric Pasta Maker and his Showtime Rotisserie &amp; BBQ. His Showtime Rotisserie &amp; BBQ sold over eight million units in the US alone, helping Ronco&#x27;s housewares sales exceed $1 billion in sales. After retiring, Popeil continued to invent products including the 5-in-1 Turkey Fryer &amp; Food Cooking System which he had been developing for over ten years.

==Popular culture==
Popeil&#x27;s success in infomercials, memorable marketing personality, and ubiquity on American television have allowed him and his products to appear in a variety of popular media environments including cameo appearances on television shows such as &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing&quot;. Parodies of Popeil&#x27;s infomercials were done on the comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy and the &quot;Veg-O-Matic&quot; may have provided comedian Gallagher inspiration for the &quot;Sledge-O-Matic&quot; routine since the 1980s. The animated series &quot;VeggieTales&quot; once featured a parody of the &quot;Veg-O-Matic&quot; dubbed as the &quot;Forgive-O-Matic&quot;. &quot;Additionally, the professional wrestling tag team The Midnight Express dubbed their finishing move the Veg-O-Matic. 

Popeil was voted by &quot;Self&quot; magazine readers as one of the 25 people who have changed the way we eat, drink and think about food.

Popeil has been referenced in the music of Alice Cooper, the Beastie Boys, and &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Mr. Popeil&quot; was a tribute (and featured his sister Lisa Popeil on backing vocals). Ron Popeil later used this song in some of his infomercials.

In the 2007 film &quot;Funny Games&quot;, one of the characters is channel surfing and briefly flicks past an infomercial for Ron Popeil&#x27;s Vegetable Dehydrator. In the 1996 horror film &quot;Scream&quot;, the catchphrase is said (&quot;But wait, there&#x27;s more!&quot;), itself in the tradition of a horror film&#x27;s saying of a famous TV catchphrase, in the 1980s horror film &quot;The Shining&quot; saying of &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny!&quot; (Carson) by announcer Ed McMahon.

In Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s book &quot;What the Dog Saw: And Other Adventures&quot;, Popeil is interviewed and many of his products, most notably the Veg-O-Matic and Showtime Rotisserie, are discussed. Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s 2000 &quot;New Yorker&quot; piece &quot;The Pitchman&quot; about Popeil won Gladwell the 2001 National Magazine award.

<text>REO Speedwagon (originally stylized as R.E.O. Speedwagon), or simply REO, was an American rock band from Champaign, Illinois. Formed in 1967, the band cultivated a following during the 1970s and achieved significant commercial success throughout the 1980s. Their best-selling album, &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot; (1980), contained four US Top 40 hits and sold more than 10 million copies.

REO Speedwagon has sold more than 40 million records and charted 13 Top 40 hits, including the number ones &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot;.

==History==
===Formation===
In the fall of 1966, Neal Doughty was just beginning an electrical engineering program at the University of Illinois in Champaign, Illinois, as a junior. On his first night of classes, he met fellow student Alan Gratzer. Doughty had learned some Beatles songs on his parents&#x27; piano, and Gratzer had been a drummer in local bands since high school. The two held an impromptu jam session in the basement of their Illinois Street Residence Hall dormitory.

Gratzer continued to perform with his band (which had a keyboard-playing lead singer), and Doughty began turning up at gigs. Doughty eventually began sitting in on a few songs. On the last day of the university&#x27;s spring semester, guitarist Joe Matt called the band&#x27;s leader and told him that he and the other members (Gratzer and bassist Mike Blair) had decided to start a new band with Doughty where everyone but Doughty would sing.

The new band made a list of songs to learn over the summer break. Doughty landed a summer job and bought his first organ. On his Farfisa organ, he learned The Doors&#x27; &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. The members returned to school in the fall of 1967 and had their first rehearsal before classes started. They named the band REO Speedwagon, from the REO Speed Wagon, a 1915 truck designed by Ransom Eli Olds. Doughty had seen the name written on the blackboard when he walked into his History of Transportation class on the first day they had decided to look for a name. Rather than pronouncing REO as a single word as the motor company did , they chose to spell the word out, pronouncing each letter individually (&quot;R-E-O&quot;). An advertisement in the school newspaper produced their first job, a fraternity party that turned into a food fight. They continued to perform cover songs in campus bars, fraternity parties and university events.

In early 1968, Terry Luttrell became lead singer and Bob Crownover joined as the guitarist, replacing Matt after he graduated. When Mike Blair left the band in mid-1968, Gregg Philbin replaced Blair and Joe McCabe played sax until he moved on to Southern Illinois University. Marty Shepard then came aboard on trumpet, soon joined by a second trumpeter named Steve (last name unknown). Doughty joined them as a third horn player on some tunes. But Shepard left during the following year and horns were dropped from the group altogether by the summer of 1969.

Bob Crownover played guitar for the group until mid-1969, when Bill Fiorio replaced him. Fiorio then departed in late 1969, eventually assuming the name Duke Tumatoe, and went on to form the All Star Frogs. Steve Scorfina (who went on to found the band Pavlov&#x27;s Dog) came aboard for over a year, composing with the band and performing live, before being replaced by Gary Richrath in late 1970.

Richrath had driven 100 miles (160 km) to see the band and become a part of it, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be a part of that band whether they like it or not.&quot; He was a Peoria, Illinois-based guitarist and prolific songwriter who brought original compositions. With him on board, the band&#x27;s regional popularity grew tremendously. The St. Louis-based radio station KSHE, one of America&#x27;s most influential rock stations, began supporting it, elevating the band&#x27;s profile outside its Midwestern stronghold.

Epic Records signed the band to a recording contract in 1971 after Paul Leka, an East Coast record producer, saw them play before an enthusiastic outdoor crowd in Peoria during a rainstorm and brought the band to his recording studio in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where it recorded original material for its first album. The lineup on the first album consisted of Richrath, Gratzer, Doughty, Philbin and Luttrell.

===Early years=== 
In the early days, REO was managed by its University of Illinois classmate Irving Azoff, who later managed the Eagles and many others, becoming one of the most powerful people in the recording industry.

With its equipment hauled to gigs in a friend&#x27;s station wagon, REO played bars and clubs all over the Midwest. Its debut album, &quot;R.E.O. Speedwagon&quot;, was released on Epic Records in October 1971. The most popular track on this record was &quot;157 Riverside Avenue&quot;; it remains an in-concert favorite. The title is the address in Westport, Connecticut, where the band stayed while recording in Leka&#x27;s studio in Bridgeport.

Although the rest of the band&#x27;s lineup remained stable, REO Speedwagon switched lead vocalists three times for their first three albums. Luttrell left the band in early 1972, eventually becoming the vocalist for Starcastle. He was replaced by Kevin Cronin. Cronin recorded one album with the band, 1972&#x27;s &quot;R.E.O./T.W.O.&quot; but left during the recording sessions for 1973&#x27;s &quot;Ridin&#x27; the Storm Out&quot; because of internal conflicts. &quot;Ridin&#x27; the Storm Out&quot; was completed with Michael Bryan Murphy on lead vocal, and featured Doughty&#x27;s &quot;wailing storm siren&quot; synthesizer intro on the title track. Murphy stayed for two more albums, &quot;Lost in a Dream&quot; (1974) and &quot;This Time We Mean It&quot; (1975), before Cronin returned in January 1976 and recorded &quot;R.E.O.&quot;, released in July of that year.

Cronin&#x27;s return came after Greg X. Volz turned down the position for lead vocalist after becoming a Christian.

In 1977, REO convinced Epic Records that its strength was live performances. Epic agreed to let them produce the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;&quot; (January 1977), which was eventually certified platinum. That same year, the band moved to Los Angeles.

Also in 1977, Philbin left the band, either because he was disenchanted with the new corporate-structure REO where Cronin and Richrath got bigger slices of the pie instead of the equal credit they once shared as a &quot;garage band&quot;, or because he was asked to leave as his lifestyle issues affected the music quality. He was replaced by another Centennial High School alumnus, Bruce Hall, to record &quot;You Can Tune a Piano but You Can&#x27;t Tuna Fish&quot;. The album was released in March 1978 and has received much FM radio airplay over the years, thanks to songs like &quot;Roll with the Changes&quot; and &quot;Time for Me to Fly&quot;. It was REO&#x27;s first to make the Top 40, peaking at No. 29. It sold over two million copies in the US, ultimately achieving double platinum status.

In July 1979 the band turned back to hard rock with the release of &quot;Nine Lives&quot;.

===Mainstream success===
On November 21, 1980, Epic released &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot;, which represented a change in sound, going from hard rock to more pop-oriented material. &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot; spawned four hit singles by Richrath and Cronin, including the chart-topping &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; (Cronin), &quot;Take It on the Run&quot; (#5) (Richrath), &quot;In Your Letter&quot; (#20) (Richrath), and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Him Go&quot; (#24) (Cronin). It remained on the charts for 65 weeks, 32 of which were spent in the top ten, including 15 weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot; sold over ten million copies.

The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Good Trouble&quot;, was released in June 1982. Though not as successful as its predecessor, it performed moderately well commercially and featured the hit singles &quot;Keep the Fire Burnin&#x27;&quot; (U.S. #7), &quot;Sweet Time&quot; (U.S. #26), and the Album Rock chart hit &quot;The Key&quot;.

In November 1984, the band released &quot;Wheels Are Turnin&#x27;&quot;, an album that included the No. 1 hit single &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot; and three more hits: &quot;I Do&#x27; Wanna Know&quot; (U.S. #29), &quot;One Lonely Night&quot; (U.S. #19), and &quot;Live Every Moment&quot; (U.S. #34).

REO Speedwagon toured the US in 1985, including a sold-out concert in Madison, Wisconsin, in May. On July 13, on the way to a show in Milwaukee, the band stopped in Philadelphia to play at the US leg of Live Aid, which broke a record for number of viewers. They performed &quot;Can&#x27;t Fight This Feeling&quot; and &quot;Roll with the Changes&quot; with members of the Beach Boys, the band members&#x27; families, and Paul Shaffer on stage for backing vocals.

1987&#x27;s &quot;Life as We Know It&quot; saw a decline in sales, but still managed to provide the band with the top-20 hits &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Love&quot; (U.S. #16) and &quot;In My Dreams&quot; (U.S. #19).

&quot;The Hits&quot; was a 1988 compilation album which contained the new tracks &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Lose You&quot; and &quot;Here with Me&quot;. These were the last songs recorded with Richrath and Gratzer. &quot;Here with Me&quot; cracked the Top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and the top ten on the Adult Contemporary chart and was the group&#x27;s final Top 40 hit.

===Changes in the 1990s===
By the late 1980s, the band&#x27;s popularity was starting to decline. Gratzer left in September 1988 after he decided to retire from music to open a restaurant. In early 1989, Richrath left the band after tensions between him and Cronin boiled over. Cronin had been playing in The Strolling Dudes, a jazz ensemble that included jazz trumpet player Rick Braun (who had co-written &quot;Here with Me&quot; with Cronin), Miles Joseph on lead guitar, and Graham Lear on drums. Lear had already been invited to join REO in September 1988 as Gratzer&#x27;s successor and Joseph was brought in as a temporary stand-in for Richrath. Backup singers Carla Day and Melanie Jackson were also added. This lineup did only one show, on January 7, 1989, in Viña del Mar, Chile, where it won the award for best group at the city&#x27;s annual International Song Festival. After that, Joseph and the backup singers were dropped in favor of former Ted Nugent guitarist Dave Amato (brought aboard in May 1989) and keyboardist/songwriter/producer Jesse Harms.

The 1990 release &quot;The Earth, a Small Man, His Dog and a Chicken&quot;, with Bryan Hitt (formerly of Wang Chung) on drums, was a commercial disappointment. The album produced only one &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 single, to date the band&#x27;s last, &quot;Love Is a Rock&quot;, which peaked at No. 65. Disenchanted by the album&#x27;s failure, Harms left the group in early 1991.

Shortly after his departure, Richrath assembled former members of the Midwestern band Vancouver to form a namesake band, Richrath. After touring for several years, Richrath (the band) released &quot;Only the Strong Survive&quot; in 1992 on the GNP Crescendo label. Richrath continued to perform for several years before disbanding in the late 1990s. In September 1998, Gary Richrath briefly joined REO onstage at the County Fair in Los Angeles to play on the band&#x27;s encore song, &quot;157 Riverside Avenue&quot;. He rejoined REO in Los Angeles in May 2000 for the same encore, but no serious plans for a reunion ever materialized.

Having lost its recording contract with Epic, REO Speedwagon released &quot;Building the Bridge&quot; (July 1996) on the Priority/Rhythm Safari label. When that label went bankrupt, the album was released on Castle Records, which also experienced financial troubles. REO ultimately self-financed this effort, which failed to chart, though the title track made R&amp;R&#x27;s AC Top 30 chart.

===Revival of the hits===
The commercial failure of the band&#x27;s newer material with its revised lineup demanded a change in marketing strategy. As a consequence, Epic began rereleasing recordings from older albums with updated artwork and design. Since 1995, Epic has released over a dozen compilation albums featuring greatest hits, including 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Ballads&quot;, which features two new songs: &quot;Just for You&quot; (Cronin and Jim Peterik) and &quot;Till The River&#x27;s Run Dry&quot; (Cronin).

In 2000, REO teamed up with Styx for a joint tour, which included a June 9 appearance at Riverport Amphitheater in St. Louis, which was released as the live concert video &quot;Arch Allies: Live at Riverport&quot; (September 2000). REO&#x27;s portion of the show was released again under three separate titles: &quot;Live - Plus&quot; (2001), &quot;Live Plus 3&quot; (2001) and &quot;Extended Versions&quot; (2001), which was certified gold by the RIAA on April 26, 2006. REO once again teamed with Styx in 2003 for the Classic Rock&#x27;s Main Event tour, which included another band from their common rock era, Journey.

===2000–2024===
The band released a self-financed album entitled &quot;Find Your Own Way Home&quot; in April 2007. Though it did not chart as an album, it produced two singles, &quot;I Needed to Fall&quot; and &quot;Find Your Own Way Home&quot;, that appeared on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Contemporary radio chart.

REO Speedwagon continued to tour regularly, mostly performing their classic hits. It teamed up with Styx to record a new single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Rockin&#x27;&quot;, released in March 2009, as well as for a full tour that included special guest .38 Special.

In November 2009 REO Speedwagon released a Christmas album, &quot;Not So Silent Night...Christmas with REO Speedwagon.&quot; On December 2, the band released an online video game, &quot;Find Your Own Way Home&quot;, produced by digital design agency Curious Sense. The game was the first &quot;downloadable casual game&quot; produced with a rock band and was cited by numerous publications as an innovative marketing product for a music act. In mid-2010, the band—then touring with Pat Benatar—announced that it would release a 30th anniversary deluxe edition reissue of &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot;.

REO Speedwagon headlined the M&amp;I Classic Rock Stage at Summerfest in Milwaukee Wisconsin on June 30, 2011. On March 11, 2012, Cronin appeared on the Canadian reality TV series &quot;Star Académie&quot;. He sang a sampling of REO&#x27;s hits with the show&#x27;s singing finalists.

On November 22, 2013, REO announced a benefit concert with Styx, &quot;Rock to the Rescue&quot;, to raise money for families affected by the tornadoes in central Illinois. The concert was held on December 4, 2013, in Bloomington, Illinois. Richard Marx joined REO on stage for a joint performance of two of his hit songs. Gary Richrath reunited with REO one final time for a performance of &quot;Ridin&#x27; the Storm Out&quot; to end REO&#x27;s set at the sold-out concert. He stayed on stage to help with the encore of &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot;, along with Styx, Marx, and others. Richrath was originally from East Peoria, which was damaged during the storm. Families affected by the storm and first responders sat near the stage for this concert.

In early 2014, it was announced that REO Speedwagon and Chicago would team up for 15 dates throughout 2014. Gary Richrath died on September 13, 2015, of complications from surgery. In 2016, REO toured with Def Leppard and Tesla.

The band and Pitbull performed the song &quot;Messin&#x27; Around&quot; live on the ABC TV show &quot;Greatest Hits in 2016&quot;; that version of the song was released as a single on iTunes. The band toured the UK arena circuit with Status Quo in December 2016. The band toured the US with Styx and Don Felder on the &quot;United We Rock&quot; tour, debuting June 20, 2017, at the Sunlight Supply Amphitheater. In 2017, the &quot;Hi Infidelity&quot; album received the Diamond Award for official U.S. sales of over ten million copies. REO and Chicago teamed up again in 2018 for a 30-city tour.

The band appeared in an episode in the third season of the American TV series &quot;Ozark&quot;, which was released on Netflix on March 27, 2020. After the appearance, four of REO&#x27;s songs reentered the &quot;Billboard&quot; rock charts. The song &quot;Take it on the Run&quot; features prominently in a 2018 episode of the first season of the TV series &quot;Cobra Kai&quot;; Daniel and Johnny are riding in Johnny&#x27;s car when the song comes on the radio. Both men begin nodding their heads to the song, and Johnny, with some surprise, says to Daniel, &quot;You like Speedwagon?&quot; Daniel replies, &quot;What kind of man doesn&#x27;t!&quot;

In 2021 REO Speedwagon was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Illinois Rock &amp; Roll Museum in Joliet. The group spent summer 2022 touring with Styx, on the &quot;Live and Unzoomed Tour&quot;, with Loverboy serving as the opening act.

Gregg Philbin died on October 24, 2022.

On January 4, 2023, the band announced that its sole remaining original member, Neal Doughty, would retire from touring with the band after 55 years. Bassist Bruce Hall said Doughty would always be part of the REO brotherhood, and left open the opportunity for Doughty to appear at select dates. The band announced Derek Hilland (ex-Iron Butterfly) as a touring replacement for Doughty.

On November 7, 2023, Hall announced he was taking a leave of absence from touring to prepare for and undergo back surgery for an accident he had a number of years earlier. Hall was expected to rejoin the band on tour in 2024. Later that day, Cronin announced that bassist/singer Matt Bissonette would be Hall&#x27;s touring replacement.

On September 16, 2024, the band announced that they will cease touring effective January 1, 2025. The announcement said that Hall had not sufficiently recovered from his back surgery the year before, and that the situation had led to irreconcilable differences between Cronin and Hall. Other posts on the band&#x27;s Facebook page in the days leading up to the announcement said that Cronin had experienced illness and had undergone emergency surgery, resulting in cancelled tour dates. On December 21, 2024, Cronin confirmed that the show from that night was the last that would be performed under the REO Speedwagon moniker and the name would be retired. However, he would continue to play solo concerts with the same touring lineup and REO Speedwagon songs would still be performed.

<doc id="26181" wikidata="Q40640" url="?curid=26181" title="Ray Bradbury">
<text>Ray Douglas Bradbury ( ; August 22, 1920June 5, 2012) was an American author and screenwriter. One of the most celebrated 20th-century American writers, he worked in a variety of genres, including fantasy, science fiction, horror, mystery, and realistic fiction.

Bradbury is best known for his novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1953) and his short-story collections &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; (1950), &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; (1951), and &quot;The October Country&quot; (1955). Other notable works include the coming of age novel &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; (1957), the dark fantasy &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (1962) and the fictionalized memoir &quot;Green Shadows, White Whale&quot; (1992). He also wrote and consulted on screenplays and television scripts, including &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;. Many of his works were adapted into television and film productions as well as comic books. Bradbury also wrote poetry which has been published in several collections, such as &quot;They Have Not Seen the Stars&quot; (2001).

&quot;The New York Times&quot; called Bradbury &quot;An author whose fanciful imagination, poetic prose, and mature understanding of human character have won him an international reputation&quot; and &quot;the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream&quot;.

==Early life==
Bradbury was born on August 22, 1920, in Waukegan, Illinois, to Esther (née Moberg) Bradbury (1888–1966), a Swedish immigrant, and Leonard Spaulding Bradbury (1890–1957), a power and telephone lineman of English ancestry. He was given the middle name &quot;Douglas&quot; after actor Douglas Fairbanks.

Bradbury was surrounded by an extended family during his early childhood and formative years in Waukegan. An aunt read him short stories when he was a child. This period provided foundations for both the author and his stories. In Bradbury&#x27;s fiction, 1920s Waukegan becomes Green Town, Illinois.

The Bradbury family lived in Tucson, Arizona, during 1926–1927 and 1932–1933 while their father pursued employment, each time returning to Waukegan. While in Tucson, Bradbury attended Amphi Junior High School and Roskruge Junior High School. They eventually settled in Los Angeles in 1934 when Bradbury was 14. The family arrived with only US$40 (), which paid for rent and food until his father finally found a job making wire at a cable company for $14 a week (), allowing them to stay in Hollywood.

Bradbury attended Los Angeles High School and was active in the drama club. He often roller-skated through Hollywood in hopes of meeting celebrities. Among the creative people he met were special-effects pioneer Ray Harryhausen and radio star George Burns. Bradbury&#x27;s first pay as a writer, at age 14, was for a joke he sold to George Burns to use on the &quot; Burns and Allen&quot; radio show.

Bradbury was fascinated with carnivals from a young age, and they would feature in such works as &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;. He related a formative event of his youth:

I suppose the most important memory is of Mr. Electrico. On Labor Day weekend, 1932, when I was twelve years old, he came to my hometown with the Dill Brothers ... He was a performer sitting in an electric chair and a stagehand pulled a switch and he was charged with fifty thousand volts of pure electricity. Lightning flashed in his eyes and his hair stood on end. I sat below, in the front row, and he reached down with a flaming sword full of electricity and he tapped me on both shoulders and then the tip of my nose and he cried, &quot;Live, forever!&quot; And I thought, &quot;God, that&#x27;s wonderful. How do you do that?&quot; ... So when I left the carnival that day I stood by the carousel and I watched the horses running around and around to the music of &quot;Beautiful Ohio&quot; and I cried. Tears streamed down my cheeks because I knew something important had happened to me that day because of Mr. Electrico. I felt changed. And so I went home and within days I started to write. And I&#x27;ve never stopped.

==Influences==
===Literature===
Throughout his youth, Bradbury was an avid reader and writer and knew at a young age that he was &quot;going into one of the arts&quot;. Bradbury began writing his own stories at age 12 (1931), sometimes writing on butcher paper.

In his youth, he spent much time in the Carnegie Library in Waukegan, reading such authors as H. G. Wells, Jules Verne and Edgar Allan Poe. At 12, he began writing traditional horror stories and said he tried to imitate Poe until he was about 18. Bradbury&#x27;s favorite writers growing up included Katherine Anne Porter, Edith Wharton and Jessamyn West. He loved the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs, especially his John Carter of Mars series; &quot;The Warlord of Mars&quot; impressed him so much that at age 12, he wrote his own sequel. The young Bradbury was also a cartoonist and loved to illustrate. He wrote about Tarzan and drew his own Sunday panels. He listened to the radio show &quot;Chandu the Magician&quot;, and every night when the show went off the air, he wrote out the entire script from memory.

As a teen in Beverly Hills, he often visited his mentor and friend, science-fiction writer Bob Olsen, sharing ideas and maintaining contact. In 1936, at a secondhand bookstore in Hollywood, Bradbury discovered a handbill promoting meetings of the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society. Excited to find others who shared his interest, he joined a Thursday-night conclave at age 16.

Bradbury cited Verne and Wells as his primary science-fiction influences. He identified with Verne, saying: &quot;He believes the human being is in a strange situation in a very strange world, and he believes that we can triumph by behaving morally.&quot; Bradbury admitted that he stopped reading science-fiction books in his 20s and embraced a broad field of literature that included poets Alexander Pope and John Donne. He had just graduated from high school when he met Robert A. Heinlein, then 31. Bradbury recalled: &quot;He was well known, and he wrote humanistic science fiction, which influenced me to dare to be human instead of mechanical.&quot; During his young adulthood, Bradbury read stories published in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, and read everything by Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, as well as the early writings of Theodore Sturgeon and A. E. van Vogt.

===Hollywood===
The family lived about four blocks from the Fox Uptown Theatre on Western Avenue in Los Angeles, the flagship theater for MGM and Fox. There, Bradbury learned how to sneak in and watched previews almost every week. He roller skated there, as well as all over town, as he put it, &quot;hell-bent on getting autographs from glamorous stars. It was glorious.&quot; Among stars the young Bradbury was thrilled to encounter were Norma Shearer, Laurel and Hardy, and Ronald Colman. Sometimes he spent all day in front of Paramount Pictures or Columbia Pictures, then skated to the Brown Derby to watch the stars who came and went for meals. He recounted seeing Cary Grant, Marlene Dietrich and Mae West, who, he learned, made a regular appearance every Friday night, bodyguard in tow.

==Career==
Bradbury was free to start a career in writing when, owing to his bad eyesight, he was rejected for induction into the military during World War II. Inspired by science-fiction heroes such as Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, he began publishing science-fiction stories in fanzines in 1938. He was invited by Forrest J. Ackerman to attend the Los Angeles Science Fiction Society, which at the time met at Clifton&#x27;s Cafeteria in downtown Los Angeles. There he met Robert A. Heinlein, Emil Petaja, Fredric Brown, Henry Kuttner, Leigh Brackett and Jack Williamson. Bradbury&#x27;s first published story was &quot;Hollerbochen&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, in the January 1938 number of Ackerman&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Imagination!&quot;. In July 1939, Ackerman and his girlfriend Morojo gave 19-year-old Bradbury the money to head to New York for the First World Science Fiction Convention in New York City, and funded Bradbury&#x27;s fanzine, &quot;Futuria Fantasia&quot;. Bradbury wrote most of its four issues, each volume printed in limited number due to publishing costs. Between 1940 and 1947, he was a contributor to Rob Wagner&#x27;s film magazine, &quot;Script&quot;.

In 1939, Bradbury joined Laraine Day&#x27;s Wilshire Players Guild, where for two years he wrote and acted in several plays. They were, as Bradbury later described, &quot;so incredibly bad&quot; that he gave up play-writing for two decades. His first paid piece, &quot;Pendulum&quot;, written with Henry Hasse, was published in the pulp magazine &quot;Super Science Stories&quot; in November 1941, for which he earned $15.

Bradbury sold his first solo story, &quot;The Lake&quot;, for $13.75 at 22 and became a full-time writer by 24. His first collection of short stories, &quot;Dark Carnival&quot;, was published in 1947 by Arkham House, a small press in Sauk City, Wisconsin, owned by August Derleth. Reviewing &quot;Dark Carnival&quot; for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Will Cuppy proclaimed Bradbury &quot;suitable for general consumption&quot; and predicted that he would become a writer of the caliber of British fantasist John Collier.

After a rejection notice from the pulp &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, Bradbury submitted &quot;Homecoming&quot; to &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, where it was spotted by a young editorial assistant named Truman Capote. Capote picked the Bradbury manuscript from a slush pile, which led to its publication. &quot;Homecoming&quot; won a place in the O. Henry Award Stories of 1947.

Bradbury first published &quot;The Fireman&quot;, a short story about 25,000 words long, in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in February 1951. Bradbury was asked to extend it by 25,000 words so that it would be published as a novel. Bradbury got the title after the Los Angeles fire chief told him that book paper burns at 451 °F. In UCLA&#x27;s Powell Library, in a study room with typewriters for rent for ten cents per half-hour., Bradbury wrote his classic story of a book burning future, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, which was about 50,000 words long, costing $9.80 from the typewriter-rental fees. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was also published in serial form in the March, April and May 1954 issues of Playboy Magazine. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; remains a staple in discussions about censorship and dystopian futures.

A chance encounter in a Los Angeles bookstore with British expatriate writer Christopher Isherwood gave Bradbury the opportunity to put &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; into the hands of a respected critic. Isherwood&#x27;s glowing review followed.

==Writing==
Bradbury attributed his lifelong habit of writing every day to two incidents. The first, when he was three years old, was his mother&#x27;s taking him to see Lon Chaney in the 1923 silent film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. The second occurred in 1932, when a carnival entertainer, one Mr. Electrico, knighted the young man with an electrified sword and intoned: &quot;Live forever!&quot; Bradbury remarked: &quot;I felt that something strange and wonderful had happened to me because of my encounter with Mr. Electrico ... [he] gave me a future ... I began to write, full-time. I have written every single day of my life since that day 69 years ago.&quot; At that age, Bradbury first started to do magic, which was his first great love. He said that had he not discovered writing, he would have become a magician.

Bradbury claimed a wide variety of influences, and described discussions he might have had with his favorite writers, among them Robert Frost, William Shakespeare, John Steinbeck, Aldous Huxley, and Thomas Wolfe. From Steinbeck, he learned &quot;how to write objectively and yet insert all of the insights without too much extra comment.&quot; He studied Eudora Welty for her &quot;remarkable ability to give you atmosphere, character, and motion in a single line.&quot;

Bradbury was once described as a &quot;Midwest surrealist&quot; and is often labeled a science-fiction writer. He resisted that categorization, however, defining science fiction as &quot;the art of the possible.&quot;

Bradbury recounted when he came into his own as a writer, the afternoon he wrote a short story about his first encounter with death. When he was a boy, he met a young girl at a lake edge and she went out into the water and never came back. Years later, as he wrote about it in &quot;The Lake&quot;, tears flowed from him. He recognized he had taken the leap from emulating the many writers he admired to connecting with his voice as a writer.

When later asked about source of the lyrical power of his prose, he replied: &quot;From reading so much poetry every day of my life. My favorite writers have been those who&#x27;ve said things well.&quot; He said: &quot;If you&#x27;re reluctant to weep, you won&#x27;t live a full and complete life.&quot;

In high school, Bradbury was active in the poetry and drama clubs. Planning to become an actor, he became serious about writing as his high-school years progressed. He graduated from Los Angeles High School, where he took poetry classes with Snow Longley Housh and short-story writing courses taught by Jeannet Johnson. The teachers recognized his talent and furthered his interest in writing, but he did not attend college. Instead, he sold newspapers at the corner of South Norton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard. In regard to his education, Bradbury said:

He told &quot;The Paris Review&quot;: &quot;You can&#x27;t learn to write in college. It&#x27;s a very bad place for writers because the teachers always think they know more than you do—and they don&#x27;t.&quot;

He considered science to be &#x27;incidental&#x27; to his writing. He claimed not to be interested in the development of science, but hoped to use it as a form of social commentary and as an allegorical technique.

He described his inspiration: &quot;My stories run up and bite me in the leg—I respond by writing them down—everything that goes on during the bite. When I finish, the idea lets go and runs off&quot;.

===&quot;Green Town&quot;===
An imagined version of Waukegan, Green Town is a symbol of safety and home, which is often the setting for tales of the macabre and the dark fantastic. It serves as the setting of his semiautobiographical classics &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;, &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, and &quot;Farewell Summer&quot;, as well as many of his short stories. In Green Town, Bradbury&#x27;s favorite uncle sprouts wings, traveling carnivals conceal supernatural powers, and his grandparents provide room and board to Charles Dickens. Perhaps the definitive use of Green Town is in &quot;Summer Morning, Summer Night&quot;, a collection of short stories and vignettes exclusively set in the town. Bradbury returns to the signature locale as a look back at the rapidly disappearing small-town world of the American heartland, which was the foundation of his roots.

==Cultural contributions==
Bradbury wrote many short essays on culture and the arts, attracting the attention of critics in this field, using his fiction to explore and criticize his culture and society. He observed, for example, that &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; touched on the alienation of people by media:

Bradbury stated that the novel worked as a critique of the later development of political correctness:

In a 1982 essay, he wrote: &quot;People ask me to predict the Future, when all I want to do is prevent it.&quot; This intent had been expressed earlier by other authors, most of whom attributed it to him.

On May 24, 1956, Bradbury appeared on the popular quiz show &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; hosted by Groucho Marx. During his introductory comments and on-air banter with Marx, Bradbury briefly discussed some of his books and other works, including giving an overview of &quot;The Veldt&quot;, his short story published six years earlier in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; under the title &quot;The World the Children Made&quot;.

Bradbury was a consultant for the United States Pavilion at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair and wrote the narration script for The American Journey attraction there. He also worked on the original exhibit in Epcot&#x27;s Spaceship Earth geosphere at Walt Disney World. He focused on detective fiction in the 1980s. In the latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, he hosted &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot;, a televised anthology series based on his short stories.

Bradbury was a strong supporter of public libraries, raising money to prevent the closure of several libraries in California facing budgetary cuts. He said &quot;libraries raised me&quot;, and shunned colleges and universities, comparing his own lack of funds during the Depression with poor contemporary students. His opinion varied on modern technology. In 1985 Bradbury wrote: &quot;I see nothing but good coming from computers. When they first appeared on the scene, people were saying, &#x27;Oh my God, I&#x27;m so afraid.&#x27; I hate people like that—I call them the neo-Luddites&quot; and: &quot;In a sense, [computers] are simply books. Books are all over the place, and computers will be, too.&quot; He resisted the conversion of his work into e-books, saying in 2010: &quot;We have too many cellphones. We&#x27;ve got too many internets. We have got to get rid of those machines. We have too many machines now.&quot; When the publishing rights for &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; came up for renewal in December 2011, Bradbury permitted its publication in electronic form provided that the publisher, Simon &amp; Schuster, allowed the e-book to be digitally downloaded by any library patron. The title remains the only book in the Simon &amp; Schuster catalog for which this is possible.

Several comic-book writers have adapted Bradbury&#x27;s stories, particularly the authors of EC Comics&#x27;s line of horror and science-fiction comics. Initially, the writers plagiarized his stories, but a diplomatic letter from Bradbury led to the company&#x27;s paying him and negotiating properly licensed adaptations of his work. The comics featuring Bradbury&#x27;s stories included &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Crime Suspenstories&quot;, and &quot;Haunt of Fear&quot;.

Bradbury remained an enthusiastic playwright all his life, leaving a rich theatrical legacy as well as literary. He headed the Pandemonium Theatre Company in Los Angeles for many years, and had a five-year relationship with the Fremont Centre Theatre in South Pasadena.

Bradbury is featured prominently in two documentaries related to his classic 1950s–1960s era: Jason V Brock&#x27;s &quot;Charles Beaumont: The Life of Twilight Zone&#x27;s Magic Man&quot;, detailing his troubles with Rod Serling and his friendships with writers Charles Beaumont, George Clayton Johnson, and most especially his dear friend William F. Nolan; and Brock&#x27;s &quot;The AckerMonster Chronicles!&quot;, which delves into the life of former Bradbury agent, close friend, mega-fan and &quot;Famous Monsters of Filmland&quot; editor Forrest J Ackerman.

Bradbury&#x27;s legacy was celebrated by the bookstore Fahrenheit 451 Books in Laguna Beach, California, in the 1970s and 1980s. He and his favorite illustrator, Joseph Mugnaini, attended the opening of an addition to the store in the mid-1980s. It closed its doors in 1987, but in 1990, another shop of the same name (with different owners) opened in Carlsbad, California.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Bradbury served on the advisory board of the Los Angeles Student Film Institute.

==Personal life==
Bradbury lived in his parents&#x27; home until, in 1947, at age 27, he married Marguerite McClure (January 16, 1922 – November 24, 2003). They remained married until her death. Maggie, as she was affectionately called, was the only woman he ever dated. They had four daughters: Susan, Ramona, Bettina and Alexandra. Bradbury never obtained a driver&#x27;s license, but used public transportation or his bicycle.

He was raised Baptist by his parents, who were infrequent churchgoers. As an adult, Bradbury said he considered himself a &quot;delicatessen religionist&quot; who resisted categorization of his beliefs and took guidance from both Eastern and Western faiths. He felt that his career was &quot;a God-given thing, and I&#x27;m so grateful, so, so grateful. The best description of my career as a writer is &#x27;At play in the fields of the Lord&#x27;.&quot;

Bradbury was a close friend of Charles Addams, and Addams illustrated 1946&#x27;s &quot;Homecoming&quot;, the first of Bradbury&#x27;s stories about the Elliotts, a family that resembled Addams&#x27;s own Addams Family, transplanted to rural Illinois. Addams and Bradbury planned a larger collaborative work that would tell the family&#x27;s complete history, but it never materialized, and according to a 2001 interview, they went their separate ways. In October 2001, Bradbury published all the Family stories he had written in one book with a connecting narrative, &quot;From the Dust Returned&quot;, featuring a wraparound Addams cover of the original &quot;Homecoming&quot; illustration.

Another of Bradbury&#x27;s close friends was the special-effects expert Ray Harryhausen, who was best man at Bradbury&#x27;s wedding. During a BAFTA 2010 awards tribute honoring Harryhausen&#x27;s 90th birthday, Bradbury spoke about having first met him at Forrest J Ackerman&#x27;s house when they were both 18. Their shared love for science fiction, &quot;King Kong&quot;, and &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; was the beginning of a lifelong friendship. These early influences inspired them to believe in themselves and to affirm their career choices. After their first meeting, they kept in touch at least once a month: their friendship lasted more than 70 years.

Bradbury told of the following encounter with Sergei Bondarchuk, director of the 1966–1967 Soviet epic film &quot;War and Peace&quot;, at a Hollywood award ceremony in Bondarchuk&#x27;s honor:

Late in life, Bradbury retained his dedication and passion despite the &quot;devastation of illnesses and deaths of many good friends&quot;. Among them was the death of &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry, an intimate friend for many years. They remained close for nearly 30 years, after Roddenberry asked him to write for &quot;Star Trek&quot;; Bradbury declined, claiming that he &quot;never had the ability to adapt other people&#x27;s ideas into any sensible form&quot;.

Bradbury suffered a stroke in 1999 that left him partially dependent on a wheelchair. He made regular appearances at science-fiction conventions until 2009, when he retired from the circuit. He continued to write, contributing an essay to the science-fiction issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; about his inspiration for writing; it was published a week before his death.
Bradbury chose a burial place at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles, with a headstone that reads &quot;Author of Fahrenheit 451&quot;. On February 6, 2015, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the house Bradbury had lived and written in for 50 years, at 10265 Cheviot Drive in Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California, had been demolished by the buyer, architect Thom Mayne. Bradbury&#x27;s home office was moved and recreated in the Ray Bradbury Center in Indianapolis.

===Politics===
Bradbury considered himself a political independent. Raised a Democrat, he voted for the Democratic Party until 1968. In 1952, he took out an advertisement in &quot;Variety&quot; as an open letter to Republicans, stating: &quot;Every attempt that you make to identify the Democratic Party as the party of Communism, as the &#x27;left-wing&#x27; or &#x27;subversive&#x27; party, I will attack with all my heart and soul.&quot; However, Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s handling of the Vietnam War left Bradbury disenchanted, and from 1968 on he voted for the Republican Party in every presidential election with the exception of 1976, when he voted for Jimmy Carter. According to Bradbury&#x27;s biographer Sam Weller, Carter&#x27;s inept handling of the economy &quot;pushed [Bradbury] permanently away from the Democrats&quot;.

Bradbury called Ronald Reagan &quot;the greatest president&quot; whereas he dismissed Bill Clinton, calling him a &quot;shithead&quot;. In August 2001, shortly before the September 11 attacks, he described George W. Bush as &quot;wonderful&quot; and stated that the American education system was a &quot;monstrosity&quot;. He later criticized Barack Obama for ending NASA&#x27;s crewed space flight program.

In 2010, he criticized big government, saying that there was &quot;too much government&quot; in America, and &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in government. I hate politics. I&#x27;m against it. And I hope that sometimes this fall, we can destroy part of our government, and next year destroy even more of it. The less government, the happier I will be&quot;. Bradbury was against affirmative action, condemned what he called &quot;all this political correctness that&#x27;s rampant on campuses&quot;, and called for a ban of quotas in higher education. He asserted that &quot;[e]ducation is purely an issue of learning—we can no longer afford to have it polluted by damn politics&quot;.

===Death===
Bradbury died in Los Angeles, California, on June 5, 2012, at the age of 91, after a lengthy illness. His personal library was willed to the Waukegan Public Library, where he had many of his formative reading experiences.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; credited him with the ability &quot;to write lyrically and evocatively of lands an imagination away, worlds he anchored in the here and now with a sense of visual clarity and small-town familiarity&quot;. His grandson, Danny Karapetian, said Bradbury&#x27;s works had &quot;influenced so many artists, writers, teachers, scientists, and it&#x27;s always really touching and comforting to hear their stories&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted several modern-day technologies that Bradbury had envisioned much earlier, such as the idea of banking ATMs and earbuds and Bluetooth headsets in &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and the concepts of artificial intelligence in &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;.

===Legacy===
On June 6, 2012, in an official public statement from the White House Press Office, President Barack Obama said:

Several authors and filmmakers paid tribute to Bradbury, noting the influence of his works on their own. Steven Spielberg said that Bradbury was &quot;my muse for the better part of my sci-fi career ... On the world of science fiction and fantasy and imagination he is immortal.&quot; Neil Gaiman said that &quot;the landscape of the world we live in would have been diminished if we had not had him in our world&quot;. Joanne Harris called him &quot;a bright, burning spark.&quot; Stephen King released a statement on his website saying:

Margaret Atwood said she was &quot;warped early by Ray Bradbury.&quot; She wrote that Bradbury was:

The Ray Bradbury Center was established in 2007 as the Center for Ray Bradbury Studies and received Bradbury&#x27;s papers and artifacts following his death. It continues the work of documenting, preserving, and providing public access to Bradbury&#x27;s material legacy.

==Bibliography==
Bradbury authored &quot;more than 27 novels and story collections&quot;, which included many of his 600 short stories. More than eight million copies of his works, published in over 36 languages, have been sold around the world.
===First novel===
In 1949, Bradbury and his wife were expecting their first child. He took a Greyhound bus to New York and checked into a room at the YMCA for 50 cents a night. He took his short stories to a dozen publishers, but no one wanted them. Just before getting ready to go home, Bradbury had dinner with an editor at Doubleday. When Bradbury recounted that everyone wanted a novel and he did not have one, the editor, coincidentally named Walter Bradbury, asked if the short stories might be tied together into a book-length collection. The title was the editor&#x27;s idea; he suggested: &quot;You could call it &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.&quot; Bradbury liked the idea and recalled making notes in 1944 to do a book set on Mars. That evening, he stayed up all night at the YMCA and typed out an outline. He took it to the Doubleday editor the next morning, who read it and wrote Bradbury a check for $750. When Bradbury returned to Los Angeles, he connected all the short stories that became &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;.

===Intended first novel===
What was later issued as a collection of stories and vignettes, &quot;Summer Morning, Summer Night&quot;, started out to be Bradbury&#x27;s first true novel. The core of the work was Bradbury&#x27;s witnessing of the American small-town life in the American heartland.

In the winter of 1955–56, after a consultation with his Doubleday editor, Bradbury deferred publication of a novel based on Green Town, the pseudonym for his hometown. Instead, he extracted 17 stories and, with three other Green Town tales, bridged them into his 1957 book &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;. Later, in 2006, Bradbury published the original novel remaining after the extraction, and retitled it &quot;Farewell Summer&quot;. These two titles show what stories and episodes Bradbury decided to retain as he created the two books out of one.

The most significant of the remaining unpublished stories, scenes, and fragments were published under the originally intended name for the novel, &quot;Summer Morning, Summer Night&quot;, in 2007.

==Adaptations to other media==

From 1950 to 1954, 31 of Bradbury&#x27;s stories were adapted by Al Feldstein for EC Comics (seven of them uncredited in six stories, including &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; and &quot;Rocket Man&quot; being combined as &quot;Home To Stay&quot;—for which Bradbury was retroactively paid—and EC&#x27;s first version of &quot;The Handler&quot; under the title &quot;A Strange Undertaking&quot;) and 16 of these were collected in the paperbacks, &quot;The Autumn People&quot; (1965) and &quot;Tomorrow Midnight&quot; (1966), both published by Ballantine Books with cover illustrations by Frank Frazetta.
Also in the early 1950s, adaptations of Bradbury&#x27;s stories were televised in several anthology shows, including &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Lights Out&quot;, &quot;Out There&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, &quot;CBS Television Workshop&quot;, &quot;The Jane Wyman Show&quot;, &quot;Star Tonight&quot;, &quot;Windows&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. &quot;The Merry-Go-Round&quot;, a half-hour film adaptation of Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Black Ferris&quot;, praised by &quot;Variety&quot;, was shown on &quot;Starlight Summer Theater&quot; in 1954 and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sneak Preview&quot; in 1956. During that same period, several stories were adapted for radio drama, notably on the science fiction anthologies &quot;Dimension X&quot; and its successor &quot;X Minus One&quot;.

Producer William Alland first brought Bradbury to movie theaters in 1953 with &quot;It Came from Outer Space&quot;, a Harry Essex screenplay developed from Bradbury&#x27;s screen treatment &quot;Atomic Monster&quot;. Three weeks later came the release of Eugène Lourié&#x27;s &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; (1953), which featured one scene based on Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;The Fog Horn&quot;, about a sea monster mistaking the sound of a fog horn for the mating cry of a female. Bradbury&#x27;s close friend Ray Harryhausen produced the stop-motion animation of the creature. Bradbury later returned the favor by writing a short story &quot;Tyrannosaurus Rex&quot; about a stop-motion animator who strongly resembled Harryhausen. Over the next 50 years, more than 35 features, shorts, and TV movies were based on Bradbury&#x27;s stories or screenplays. Bradbury was hired in 1953 by director John Huston to work on the screenplay for his film version of Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), which stars Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab, Richard Basehart as Ishmael, and Orson Welles as Father Mapple. A significant result of the film was Bradbury&#x27;s book &quot;Green Shadows, White Whale&quot;, a semifictionalized account of the making of the film, including Bradbury&#x27;s dealings with Huston and his time in Ireland, where exterior scenes that were set in New Bedford, Massachusetts, were filmed.

Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot; (from the book of the same name) was adapted for the 100th episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The episode was first aired on May 18, 1962.

Bradbury and director Charles Rome Smith co-founded the Pandemonium Theatre Company in 1964. Its first production was &quot;The World of Ray Bradbury&quot;, consisting of one-act adaptations of &quot;The Pedestrian&quot;, &quot;The Veldt&quot;, and &quot;To the Chicago Abyss&quot;. It ran for four months at the Coronet Theatre in Los Angeles (October 1964 – February 1965); an off-Broadway production was presented in October 1965. Another Pandemonium Theatre Company production was mounted at the Coronet Theatre in 1965, again presenting adaptations of three Bradbury short stories: &quot;The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit&quot;, &quot;The Day It Rained Forever&quot;, and &quot;Device Out of Time&quot;. (The last was adapted from his 1957 novel &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot;). The original cast for this production featured Booth Coleman, Joby Baker, Fredric Villani, Arnold Lessing, Eddie Sallia, Keith Taylor, Richard Bull, Gene Otis Shane, Henry T. Delgado, F. Murray Abraham, Anne Loos, and Len Lesser. The director, again, was Charles Rome Smith.

Oskar Werner and Julie Christie starred in &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1966), an adaptation of Bradbury&#x27;s novel directed by François Truffaut.

In 1966, Bradbury helped Lynn Garrison create &quot;AVIAN&quot;, a specialist aviation magazine. For the first issue, Bradbury wrote a poem &quot;Planes That Land on Grass&quot;.

In 1969, &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; was brought to the big screen, starring Rod Steiger, Claire Bloom, and Robert Drivas. Containing the prologue and three short stories from the book, the film received mediocre reviews. The same year, Bradbury approached composer Jerry Goldsmith, who had worked with Bradbury in dramatic radio of the 1950s and later scored the film version, to compose a cantata &quot;Christus Apollo&quot; based on Bradbury&#x27;s text. The work premiered in late 1969, with the California Chamber Symphony performing with narrator Charlton Heston at UCLA.

&quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; was adapted for a low-budget 1972 British film, produced by the Forest Hill Film Unit &amp; Drama Troupe and directed by Colin Finbow.

 In 1972, &quot;The Screaming Woman&quot; was adapted as an ABC Movie-of-the-Week starring Olivia de Havilland.

&quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; became a three-part TV miniseries starring Rock Hudson, which was first broadcast by NBC in 1980. Bradbury found the miniseries &quot;just boring&quot;.

The 1982 television movie &quot;The Electric Grandmother&quot; was based on Bradbury&#x27;s short story &quot;I Sing the Body Electric&quot;.

The 1983 horror film &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, starring Jason Robards and Jonathan Pryce, is based on the Bradbury novel of the same name.

In 1984, Michael McDonough of Brigham Young University produced &quot;Bradbury 13&quot;, a series of 13 audio adaptations of famous stories from Bradbury, in conjunction with National Public Radio. The full-cast dramatizations featured adaptations of &quot;The Ravine&quot;, &quot;Night Call, Collect&quot;, &quot;The Veldt&quot;, &quot;There Was an Old Woman&quot;, &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;, &quot;Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed&quot;, &quot;The Screaming Woman&quot;, &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot;, &quot;The Man&quot;, &quot;The Wind&quot;, &quot;The Fox and the Forest&quot;, &quot;Here There Be Tygers&quot;, and &quot;The Happiness Machine&quot;. Voiceover actor Paul Frees provided narration, while Bradbury was responsible for the opening voiceover; Greg Hansen and Roger Hoffman scored the episodes. The series won a Peabody Award and two Gold Cindy awards and was released on CD on May 1, 2010. The series began airing on BBC Radio 4 Extra on June 12, 2011.

From 1985 to 1992, Bradbury hosted a syndicated anthology television series, &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot;, for which he adapted 65 of his stories. Each episode began with a shot of Bradbury in his office, gazing over mementoes of his life, which he states (in narrative) are used to spark ideas for stories. During the first two seasons, Bradbury also provided additional voiceover narration specific to the featured story and appeared on screen.

Deeply respected in the USSR, Bradbury&#x27;s fiction has been adapted into six episodes of the Soviet science-fiction TV series &quot;This Fantastic World&quot; which adapted the stories film version of &quot;Forever and the Earth&quot;, &quot;I Sing The Body Electric&quot;, &quot;The Smile&quot;, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, &quot;A Piece of Wood&quot;, and &quot;To the Chicago Abyss&quot;. In 1984 a cartoon adaptation of &quot;There Will Come Soft Rains&quot; («Будет ласковый дождь») came out by Uzbek director Nazim Tulyakhodzhayev. He made a film adaptation of &quot;The Veldt&quot; in 1987. In 1985, film adaptation of &quot;I Sing The Body Electric&quot; («Электронная бабушка») came out by Lithuanian director Algimantas Puipa. In 1989, a cartoon adaptation of &quot;Here There Be Tygers&quot; («Здесь могут водиться тигры») by director Vladimir Samsonov came out. In 1993, &quot;The Smile&quot; has been adapted as Viktor Chaika&#x27;s music video &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; which included footage from Soviet TV series &quot;This Fantastic World&quot;.

Bradbury wrote and narrated the 1993 animated television version of &quot;The Halloween Tree&quot;, based on his 1972 novel.

The 1998 film &quot;The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit&quot;, released by Touchstone Pictures, was written by Bradbury. It was based on his story &quot;The Magic White Suit&quot; originally published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; in 1957. The story had also previously been adapted as a play, a musical, and a 1958 television version.

In 2002, Bradbury&#x27;s own Pandemonium Theatre Company production of &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; at Burbank&#x27;s Falcon Theatre combined live acting with projected digital animation by the Pixel Pups. In 1984, Telarium released a game for Commodore 64 based on &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;.

In 2005, the film &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; was released, loosely based upon the short story of the same name. The film &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; revolves around the same theory as &quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; and contains many references to its inspiration. Short film adaptations of &quot;A Piece of Wood&quot; and &quot;The Small Assassin&quot; were released in 2005 and 2007, respectively.

In 2005, it was reported that Bradbury was upset with filmmaker Michael Moore for using the title &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, which is an allusion to Bradbury&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, for his documentary about the George W. Bush administration. Bradbury expressed displeasure with Moore&#x27;s use of the title, but stated that his resentment was not politically motivated, though Bradbury was conservative-leaning politically. Bradbury asserted that he did not want any of the money made by the movie, nor did he believe that he deserved it. He pressured Moore to change the name, but to no avail. Moore called Bradbury two weeks before the film&#x27;s release to apologize, saying that the film&#x27;s marketing had been set in motion a long time ago and it was too late to change the title.

In 2008, the film &quot;Ray Bradbury&#x27;s Chrysalis&quot; was produced by Roger Lay Jr. for Urban Archipelago Films, based upon the short story of the same name. The film won the best feature award at the International Horror and Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix. The film has international distribution by Arsenal Pictures and domestic distribution by Lightning Entertainment.

In 2010, &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; was adapted for radio by &quot;Colonial Radio Theatre on the Air&quot;.

Bradbury&#x27;s works and approach to writing are documented in Terry Sanders&#x27;s film &quot;Ray Bradbury: Story of a Writer&quot; (1963).

Bradbury&#x27;s poem &quot;Groon&quot; was voiced as a tribute in 2012.

Bradbury&#x27;s story &quot;Pendulum&quot; was adapted into the second episode of the science fiction podcast &quot;DUST&quot; (2019).

<text>Radio Row is a nickname for an urban street or district specializing in the sale of radio and electronic equipment and parts. Radio Rows arose in many cities with the 1920s rise of broadcasting and declined after the middle of the 20th century.

==New York City==
===Construction and existence===
New York City&#x27;s Radio Row, which existed from 1921 to 1966, was a warehouse district on the Lower West Side of Manhattan, New York City. Major firms that started there include Arrow Electronics, Avnet (founded by Charles Avnet in 1921), and Schweber Electronics.

The first of many radio-related stores was City Radio, opened in 1921 by Harry Schneck on Cortlandt Street, which became the central axis of a several-block area of electronics stores.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; made an early reference to &quot;Radio Row&quot; in 1927, when Cortlandt Street celebrated a &quot;Radio Jubilee&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; reported that &quot;Today ... Cortlandt Street is &#x27;Radio Row,&#x27; while Broadway is just a thoroughfare.&quot; The street was closed for vehicular traffic and decorated with flags and bunting, and the &quot;Times&quot; reported plans for New York&#x27;s acting mayor Joseph V. McKee to present a &quot;key to Cortland Street&quot; to the then-reigning Miss New York, Frieda Louise Mierse, while a contest was held to name a &quot;Miss Downtown Radio.&quot;

Pete Hamill recalled that, as a child, &quot;On Saturday mornings, I used to venture from Brooklyn with my father to Radio Row on Cortlandt Street in Lower Manhattan, where he and hundreds of other New York men moved from stall to stall in search of the elusive tube that would make the radio work again. Later, my brothers went there with him in search of television components. Radio Row was a piece of all our interior maps.&quot;

In 1930, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Radio Row as located on Greenwich Street &quot;where Cortlandt Street intersects it and the Ninth Avenue Elevated forms a canopy over the roadway...The largest concentration is in the block bounded by Dey Street on the north and Cortlandt on the south, but Radio Row does not stop there; it overflows around the corner, around several corners, embracing in all some five crowded blocks.&quot; It estimated 40 or 50 stores in the vicinity, &quot;all going full blast at the same time. There may be regulations prohibiting this vociferous practice, but if the radio dealers have anything to say it about it, it will never have the slightest effect along Radio Row...The clamor is heard even as one walks through the subway tunnel to the street exit...The first impression, and in fact the only one, is auditory, a reverberating bedlam, a confusion of sounds which only an army of loudspeakers could produce.&quot; It noted, in addition to merchants selling radio sets, &quot;others display mostly accessories...one shopkeeper last week featured a crystal set small enough to fit into a pocket, and another gave prominent position to a bucket of condensers about an inch in side.&quot;

In 1944, during World War II, &quot;The New York Times&quot; lamented that the &quot;one-time repository of nearly everything from a tube socket to a complete radio station&quot; was &quot;bargainless and practically setless, too, due to wartime scarcities&quot; but that it still catered to &quot;tinkerers and engineers&quot; and that an &quot;old spirit&quot; and &quot;magical quality&quot; were still there. One shop said it was practically able to stay in business just by &quot;making repairs on the electric meters burned out by the students of the city schools who were studying radio,&quot; and all were optimistic about growing public interest in &quot;two new kinds of radio: FM and television.&quot;

But Radio Row rebounded. The used radios, war surplus electronics (e.g., ARC-5 radios), junk, and parts often piled so high they would spill out onto the street, attracting collectors and scroungers. According to a business writer, it also was the origin of the electronic component distribution business.

===Demolition===
Radio Row was torn down in 1966 to make room for the World Trade Center. Five years earlier, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey rejected a proposal to build the new complex on the east side of Lower Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District. Instead, officials chose a site on the west side, near Hudson Terminal, and began planning to use eminent domain to remove the shops in the area bounded by Vesey, Church, Liberty, and West streets.

Local opposition arose to the decision to raze the streets on the west side for the World Trade Center. Sam Slate reported on this for WCBS Radio in 1962: The city also objected to the compensation given for the streets themselves obscured by the superblock.

A committee of small business owners led by Oscar Nadel took exception to the Port Authority&#x27;s offer of $30,000 to any business in the condemned area, regardless of its size or age. Nadel&#x27;s group, who estimated that businesses in the area employed 30,000 people and generated $300 million per year, sued the Port Authority. But the court ultimately threw out the case, called &quot;Courtesy Sandwich Shop v. Port of New York Authority,&quot; in November 1963 &quot;for want of a substantial federal question&quot;.

After the closing of these stores, the concentration of radio retailers was not duplicated elsewhere in New York. Some clusters of radio and electronics stores were created or added to in the Canal Street and Union Square areas. A large black-and-white photo mural of Radio Row can be viewed at the PATH&#x27;s World Trade Center station.

==Other American cities==
===Boston===

In 1923, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that a section of Boston&#x27;s North End had been dubbed &quot;Radio Row&quot; because of its many radio antennas. &quot;The hurdy-gurdy has a rival,&quot; wrote the &quot;Globe&quot;. &quot;No skyline anywhere else in the city or the suburbs is filled with so many antennae as the blocks stretching along some sections of Hanover and Salem sts. Many residents have three or four aerials—one has six—with wires leading down to receiving sets of all descriptions, in the homes of the foreign-born residents. It has all come about in a few months...All stairways lead to the roof, where [some residents] are arranging to rig up a loudspeaker, connected with instruments below. A survey of housetops...shows a whole population getting ready.&quot;

===Cleveland===
A section of Downtown Cleveland along Prospect Ave. from East 4th to East 9th Street was known as &quot;Radio Row&quot;, according to &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; in 1928.

===Los Angeles===
In Los Angeles during the 1940s and 1950s, &quot;Radio Row&quot; referred to the area near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood, where all four major radio networks had broadcasting facilities.

===Philadelphia===

In the 1950s and 1960s, Philadelphia&#x27;s Arch Street from 6th to 11th Streets was known as Radio Row, after its electronic-goods stores.

==Alternate meaning==

Radio Row may also refer to a large grouping of sports talk radio stations that broadcast from the Super Bowl media center during the week before the annual major football game.

<doc id="26185" wikidata="Q528261" url="?curid=26185" title="Ralph Cudworth">
<text>Ralph Cudworth ( ; 1617 – 26 June 1688) was an English Anglican clergyman, Christian Hebraist, classicist, theologian and philosopher, and a leading figure among the Cambridge Platonists who became 11th Regius Professor of Hebrew (1645–1688), 26th Master of Clare Hall (1645–1654), and 14th Master of Christ&#x27;s College (1654–1688). A leading opponent of Hobbes&#x27;s political and philosophical views, his &quot;magnum opus&quot; was his &quot;The True Intellectual System of the Universe&quot; (1678).

==Family background==
===Ancestry===
Cudworth&#x27;s family reputedly originated in Cudworth (near Barnsley), Yorkshire, moving to Lancashire with the marriage (1377) of John de Cudworth (died 1384) and Margery (died 1384), daughter of Richard de Oldham (living 1354), lord of the manor of Werneth, Oldham. The Cudworths of Werneth Hall, Oldham, were lords of the manor of Werneth/Oldham, until 1683. Ralph Cudworth (the philosopher)&#x27;s father, Ralph Cudworth (Snr), was the posthumous-born second son of Ralph Cudworth (d.1572) of Werneth Hall, Oldham.

===The Rev. Dr Ralph Cudworth Snr (1572/73–1624)===

The philosopher&#x27;s father, The Rev. Dr Ralph Cudworth (1572/73–1624), was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA (1592/93, MA (1596). Emmanuel College (founded by Sir Walter Mildmay (1584), and under the direction of its first Master, Laurence Chaderton) was, from its inception, a stronghold of Reformist, Puritan and Calvinist teaching, which shaped the development of puritan ministry, and contributed largely to the emigrant ministry in America.

Ordained in 1599 and elected to a college fellowship by 1600, Cudworth Snr was much influenced by William Perkins, whom he succeeded, in 1602, as Lecturer of the Parish Church of St Andrew the Great, Cambridge. He was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1603. He edited Perkins&#x27;s &quot;Commentary&quot; on St Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Galatians (1604), with a dedication to Robert, 3rd Lord Rich (later 1st Earl of Warwick), adding a commentary of his own with dedication to Sir Bassingbourn Gawdy. Lord Rich presented him to the Vicariate of Coggeshall, Essex (1606) to replace the deprived minister Thomas Stoughton, but he resigned this position (March 1608), and was licensed to preach from the pulpit by the Chancellor and Scholars of the University of Cambridge (November 1609). He then applied for the rectorate of Aller, Somerset (an Emmanuel College living) and, resigning his fellowship, was appointed to it in 1610.

His marriage (1611) to Mary Machell (&quot;c&quot;.1582–1634), (who had been &quot;nutrix&quot; – nurse, or preceptor – to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales) brought important connections. Cudworth Snr was appointed as one of James I&#x27;s chaplains. Mary&#x27;s mother (or aunt) was the sister of Sir Edward Lewknor, a central figure (with the Jermyn and Heigham families) among the puritan East Anglian gentry, whose children had attended Emmanuel College. Mary&#x27;s Lewknor and Machell connections with the Rich family included her first cousins Sir Nathaniel Rich and his sister Dame Margaret Wroth, wife of Sir Thomas Wroth of Petherton Park near Bridgwater, Somerset, influential promoters of colonial enterprise (and later of nonconformist emigration) in New England. Aller was immediately within their sphere.

Ralph Snr and Mary settled at Aller, where their children (listed below) were christened during the following decade. Cudworth continued to study, working on a complete survey of Case-Divinity, &quot;The Cases of Conscience in Family, Church and Commonwealth&quot; while suffering from the agueish climate at Aller. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity (1619), and was among the dedicatees of Richard Bernard&#x27;s 1621 edition of &quot;The Faithfull Shepherd&quot;. Ralph Snr died at Aller declaring a nuncupative will (7 August 1624) before Anthony Earbury and Dame Margaret Wroth.

==== Children ====
The children of Ralph Cudworth Snr and Mary (née Machell) Cudworth (&quot;c&quot;.1582–1634) were:

*General James Cudworth (1612–82) was Assistant Governor (1756–1758, 1674–1680) and Deputy Governor (1681–82) of Plymouth Colony, Massachusetts, and four-times Commissioner of the United Colonies (1657–1681), whose descendants form an extensive family of American Cudworths.
* Elizabeth Cudworth (1615–1654) married (1636) Josias Beacham of Broughton, Northamptonshire (Rector of Seaton, Rutland (1627–1676)), by whom she had several children. Beacham was ejected from his living by the Puritans (1653), but reinstated (by 1662).
* Ralph Cudworth (Jnr)
* Mary Cudworth
* John Cudworth (1622–1675) of London and Bentley, Suffolk, Alderman of London, and Master of the Worshipful Company of Girdlers (1667–68). On his death, John left four orphans of whom both Thomas Cudworth (1661–1726) and Benjamin Cudworth (1670–15 Sept. 1725) attended Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Benjamin Cudworth&#x27;s black memorial slab is in St. Margaret&#x27;s parish church, Southolt, Suffolk.
* Jane/Joan(?) Cudworth (born &quot;c&quot;.1624; fl. unmarried, 1647) may have been Ralph&#x27;s sister.

==Career==
===Education===
The second son, and third of five (probably six) children, Ralph Cudworth (Jnr) was born at Aller, Somerset, where he was baptised (13 July 1617). Following the death of his father, Ralph Cudworth Snr (1624), The Rev. Dr John Stoughton (1593–1639), (son of Thomas Stoughton of Coggeshall; also a Fellow of Emmanuel College), succeeded as Rector of Aller, and married the widow Mary (née Machell) Cudworth (&quot;c&quot;.1582–1634). Dr Stoughton paid careful attention to his stepchildren&#x27;s education, which Ralph later described as a &quot;diet of Calvinism&quot;. Letters, to Stoughton, by both brothers James and Ralph Cudworth make this plain; and, when Ralph matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1632), Stoughton thought him &quot;as wel grounded in Scho[o]l-Learning as any Boy of his Age that went to the University&quot;. Stoughton was appointed Curate and Preacher at St Mary Aldermanbury, London (1632), and the family left Aller. Ralph&#x27;s elder brother, James Cudworth, married and emigrated to Scituate, Plymouth Colony, New England (1634). Mary Machell Cudworth Stoughton died during summer 1634, and Dr Stoughton married a daughter of John Browne of Frampton and Dorchester.

===Pensioner, Student and Fellow of Emmanuel College (1630–1645)===

From a family background embedded in the early nonconformity and a diligent student, Cudworth was admitted (as a pensioner) to his father&#x27;s old college, Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1630), matriculated (1632), and graduated (BA (1635/36); MA (1639)). After some misgivings (which he confided in his stepfather), he was elected a Fellow of Emmanuel (1639), and became a successful tutor, delivering the Rede Lecture (1641). He published a tract entitled &quot;The Union of Christ and the Church, in a Shadow&quot; (1642), and another, &quot;A Discourse concerning the True Notion of the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; (1642), in which his readings of Karaite manuscripts (stimulated by meetings with Johann Stephan Rittangel) were influential.

===11th Regius Professor of Hebrew (1645) and 26th Master of Clare Hall (1645–1654)===

Following sustained correspondence with John Selden (to whom he supplied Karaite literature), he was elected (aged 28) as 11th Regius Professor of Hebrew (1645). In 1645, Thomas Paske had been ejected as Master of Clare Hall for his Anglican allegiances, and Cudworth (despite his immaturity) was selected as his successor, as 26th Master (but not admitted until 1650). Similarly, his fellow-theologian Benjamin Whichcote was installed as 19th Provost of King&#x27;s College. Cudworth attained the degree of Bachelor of Divinity (1646), and preached a sermon before the House of Commons of England (on 1 John 2, 3–4), which was later published with a Letter of Dedication to the House (1647). Despite these distinctions and his presentation, by Emmanuel College, to the rectorate of North Cadbury, Somerset (3 October 1650), he remained comparatively impoverished. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity (1651), and, in January 1651/2, his friend Dr John Worthington wrote of him, &quot;If through want of maintenance he should be forced to leave Cambridge, for which place he is so eminently accomplished with what is noble and Exemplarily Academical, it would be an ill omen.&quot;

===Marriage (1654) and 14th Master of Christ&#x27;s College (1654–1688)===

Despite his worsening sight, Cudworth was elected (29 October 1654) and admitted (2 November 1654), as 14th Master of Christ&#x27;s College. His appointment coincided with his marriage to Damaris (died 1695), daughter (by his first wife, Damaris) of Matthew Cradock (died 1641), first Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company. Hence Worthington commented &quot;After many tossings Dr Cudworth is through God&#x27;s good Providence returned to Cambridge and settled in Christ&#x27;s College, and by his marriage more settled and fixed.&quot;

In his Will (1641), Matthew Cradock had divided his estate beside the Mystic River at Medford, Massachusetts (which he had never visited, and was managed on his behalf) into two moieties: one was bequeathed to his daughter Damaris Cradock (died 1695), (later wife of Ralph Cudworth Jnr); and one was to be enjoyed by his widow Rebecca (during her lifetime), and afterwards to be inherited by his brother, Samuel Cradock (1583–1653), and his heirs male. Samuel Cradock&#x27;s son, Samuel Cradock Jnr (1621–1706), was admitted to Emmanuel (1637), graduated (BA (1640–1); MA (1644); BD (1651)), was later a Fellow (1645–56), and pupil of Benjamin Whichcote&#x27;s. After part of the Medford estate was rented to Edward Collins (1642), it was placed in the hands of an attorney; the widow Rebecca Cradock (whose second and third husbands were Richard Glover and Benjamin Whichcote, respectively), petitioned the General Court of Massachusetts, and the legatees later sold the estate to Collins (1652).

The marriage of the widow Rebecca Cradock to Cudworth&#x27;s colleague Benjamin Whichcote laid the way for the union between Cudworth and her stepdaughter Damaris (died 1695), which reinforced the connections between the two scholars through a familial bond. Damaris had first married (1642) Thomas Andrewes Jnr (died 1653) of London and Feltham, son of Sir Thomas Andrewes (died 1659), (Lord Mayor of London, 1649, 1651–2), which union had produced several children. The Andrewes family were also engaged in the Massachusetts project, and strongly supported puritan causes.

===Commonwealth and Restoration===
Cudworth emerged as a central figure among that circle of theologians and philosophers known as the Cambridge Platonists, who were (more or less) in sympathy with the Commonwealth: during the later 1650s, Cudworth was consulted by John Thurloe, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Secretary to the Council of State, with regard to certain university and government appointments and various other matters. During 1657, Cudworth advised Bulstrode Whitelocke&#x27;s sub-committee of the Parliamentary &quot;Grand Committee for Religion&quot; on the accuracy of editions of the English Bible. Cudworth was appointed Vicar of Great Wilbraham, and Rector of Toft, Cambridgeshire Ely diocese (1656), but surrendered these livings (1661 and 1662, respectively) when he was presented, by Dr Gilbert Sheldon, Bishop of London, to the Hertfordshire Rectory of Ashwell (1 December 1662).
Given Cudworth&#x27;s close cooperation with prominent figures in Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s regime (such as John Thurloe), Cudworth&#x27;s continuance as Master of Christ&#x27;s was challenged at the Restoration but, ultimately, he retained this post until his death. He and his family are believed to have resided in private lodgings at the &quot;Old Lodge&quot; (which stood between Hobson Street and the College Chapel), and various improvements were made to the college rooms in his time. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1662.

===Later life===
In 1665, Cudworth almost quarrelled with his fellow-Platonist, Henry More, because of the latter&#x27;s composition of an ethical work which Cudworth feared would interfere with his own long-contemplated treatise on the same subject. To avoid any difficulties, More published his &quot;Enchiridion ethicum&quot; (1666–69), in Latin; However, Cudworth&#x27;s planned treatise was never published. His own majestic work, &quot;The True Intellectual System of the Universe&quot; (1678), was conceived in three parts of which only the first was completed; he wrote: &quot;there is no reason why this volume should therefore be thought imperfect and incomplete, because it hath not all the Three Things at first Designed by us: it containing all that belongeth to its own particular Title and Subject, and being in that respect no Piece, but a Whole.&quot;
Cudworth was installed as Prebendary of Gloucester (1678). His colleague, Benjamin Whichcote, died at Cudworth&#x27;s house in Cambridge (1683), and Cudworth himself died (26 June 1688), and was buried in the Chapel of Christ&#x27;s College. An oil portrait of Cudworth (from life) hangs in the Hall of Christ&#x27;s College. During Cudworth&#x27;s time an outdoor Swimming Pool was created at Christ&#x27;s College (which still exists), and a carved bust of Cudworth there accompanies those of John Milton and Nicholas Saunderson.

Cudworth&#x27;s widow, Damaris (née Cradock) Andrewes Cudworth (died 1695), maintained close connections with her daughter, Damaris Cudworth Masham, at High Laver, Essex, which was where she died, and was commemorated in the church with a carved epitaph reputedly composed by the philosopher John Locke.

===Children===
The children of Ralph Cudworth and Damaris (née Cradock) Andrewes Cudworth (died 1695) were:

* John Cudworth (1656–1726) was admitted to Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1672), graduated (BA (1676–77); MA (1680)), and was a pupil of Mr Andrewes. He was a Fellow (1678–1698), was ordained a priest (1684), and later became Lecturer in Greek (1687/88) and Senior Dean (1690).
* Charles Cudworth (died 1684) was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge (1674–6), but may have not graduated, instead, making a career in the factories of Kasimbazar, West Bengal, India, which was where John Locke (friend of his sister Damaris Cudworth), corresponded with him (27 April 1683). He married (February 1683/84), Mary Cole, widow of Jonathan Prickman, Second for the English East India Company at Malda. Charles Cudworth died in March 1684.
* Thomas Cudworth graduated at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge (MA (1682)).
*Damaris Cudworth (1659–1708), a devout and talented woman, became the second wife (1685) of Sir Francis Masham, 3rd Baronet (c.1646–1723) of High Laver, Essex. Lady Masham was a friend of the philosopher John Locke, and also a correspondent of Gottfried Leibniz. Her son, Francis Cudworth Masham (died 1731), became Accountant-General to the Court of Chancery.

The stepchildren of Ralph Cudworth (children of Damaris (née Cradock) Andrewes (died 1695) and Thomas Andrewes (died 1653)) were:

* Richard Andrewes (living 1688) who, according to Peile, is &quot;not&quot; the Richard Andrewes who attended Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge during this period.
* John Andrewes (died after 1688?) matriculated at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge (1664), graduated (BA (1668/9); MA (1672)), was ordained deacon and priest (1669–70), and was a Fellow (1669–75). Peile suggests he died 1675, but he was a legatee in the will of his brother Thomas (1688). John Covel attended a &quot;Pastoral&quot; performed by Cudworth&#x27;s children contrived by John Andrewes.
* Thomas Andrewes (died 1688), Citizen and Dyer of London, was a linen draper. He married (August 1681), Anna, daughter of Samuel Shute, of St Peter&#x27;s, Cornhill.
* Mathew Andrewes (died 1674) was admitted to Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge (1663/4), and later elected a Fellow.
* Damaris Andrewes (died 1687) married (1661), (as his first wife) Sir Edward Abney (1631–1728), (a student at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge (BA 1649–52/53); Fellow (1655–61); and Doctor of both laws (1661)).

==Philosophy==
Cudworth was a member of the Cambridge Platonists, a group of English seventeenth-century thinkers associated with the University of Cambridge who were stimulated by Plato&#x27;s teachings but also were aware of and influenced by Descartes, Hobbes, Bacon, Boyle and Spinoza. The other important philosopher of this group was Henry More (1614–1687). More held that spiritual substance or mind controlled inert matter. Out of his correspondence with Descartes, he developed the idea that everything, whether material or non, had extension, an example of the latter being space, which is infinite (Newton) and which then is correlative to the idea of God (set out in his Enchiridion metaphysicum 1667). In developing this idea, More also introduced a causal agent between God and substance, or Nature, in his Hylarchic Principle, derived from Plato&#x27;s &quot;anima mundi&quot; or world soul, and the Stoic&#x27;s pneuma, which encapsulates the laws of nature, both for inert and vital nature, and involves a sympathetic resonance between soul (&quot;psyche&quot;) and body (&quot;soma&quot;).

=== Plastic principle ===
The role of nature was one faced by philosophers in the Age of Reason or Enlightenment. The prevailing view was either that of the Church of a personal deity intervening in his creation, producing miracles, or an ancient pantheism (atheism relative to theism) – deity pervading all things and existing in all things. However, the &quot;ideas of an all-embracing providential care of the world and of one universal vital force capable of organizing the world from within.&quot; presented difficulties for philosophers of a spiritual as well as materialistic bent.

Cudworth countered these mechanical, materialistic views of nature in his &quot;True intellectual system of the universe&quot; (1678), with the idea of &#x27;the Plastick Life of Nature&#x27;, a formative principle that contains both substance and the laws of motion, as well as a nisus or direction that accounts for design and goal in the natural world. He was stimulated by the Cartesian idea of the mind as self-consciousness to see God as consciousness. He first analysed four forms of atheism from ancient times to present, and showed that all misunderstood the principle of life and knowledge, which involved unsentient activity and self-consciousness, addressing the tension between theism and atheism, took both the Stoic idea of Divine Reason poured into the world, and the Platonic idea of the world soul (&quot;anima mundi&quot;) to posit a power that was polaric – &quot;either as a ruling but separate mind or as an informing vital principle – either nous hypercosmios or nous enkosmios.

:It is in connection with the refutation of hylozoic atheism that he brings forward the celebrated hypothesis, which he held in common with More, of a plastic nature,—a substance intermediate between matter and spirit,—a power which prosecutes certain ends but not freely or intelligently,—an instrument by which laws are able to act without the immediate agency of God...
All of the atheistic approaches posited nature as unconscious, which for Cudworth was ontologically unsupportable, as a principle that was supposed to be the ultimate source of life and meaning could only be itself self-conscious and knowledgeable, that is, rational, otherwise creation or nature degenerates into inert matter set in motion by random external forces (Coleridge&#x27;s &#x27;chance whirlings of unproductive particles&#x27;). Cudworth saw nature as a vegetative power endowed with plastic (forming) and spermatic (generative) forces, but one with Mind, or a self-conscious knowledge. This idea would later emerge in the Romantic period in German science as Blumenbach&#x27;s &quot;Bildungstreib&quot; (generative power) and the &quot;Lebenskraft&quot; (or &quot;Bildungskraft&quot;).

:...the life of the universe splits into two principles – the one transcendent and intellectual (« an animalish, sentient and intellectual nature, or a conscious soul and mind, that presided over the whole world »), the other immanent and devoid of perception (« a certain plastic nature, or spermatic principle which was properly the fate of all things »)

The essence of atheism for Cudworth was the view that matter was self-active and self-sufficient, whereas for Cudworth the plastic power was unsentient and under the direct control of the universal Mind or &quot;Logos&quot;. For him atheism, whether mechanical or material could not solve the &quot;phenomenon of nature.&quot; Henry More argued that atheism made each substance independent and self-acting such that it &#x27;deified&#x27; matter. Cudworth argued that materialism/mechanism reduced &quot;substance to a corporeal entity, its activity to causal determinism, and each single thing to fleeting appearances in a system dominated by material necessity.&quot;

Cudworth had the idea of a general plastic nature of the world, containing natural laws to keep all of nature, inert and vital in orderly motion, and particular plastic natures in particular entities, which serve as &#x27;Inward Principles&#x27; of growth and motion, but ascribes it to the Platonic tradition:
:The Platonists seem to affirm both these together, namely that there is a Plastick Nature lodged in all particular Souls of Animals, Brutes, and Men, and also that there is a Plastick or Spermatick Principle of the whole Universe distinct from the Higher Mundane Soul, though subordinate to it.(Cudworth, TIS, p. 165)
Further, Cudsworth&#x27;s plastic principle was also a functional polarity. As he wrote:
:The Seminary Reason or Plastick Nature of the Universe opposing the Parts to one another and making them severally Indigent, produces by that means War and Contention. And therefore though it be One, yet notwithstanding it consists of Different and Contrary things. For there being Hostility in its Parts, it is nevertheless Friendly and Agreeable in the Whole; after the same manner as in a Dramatick Poem, Clashings and Contentions are reconciled into one Harmony. And therefore the Seminary or Plastick Nature of the World, may fitly be resembled to the Harmony of Disagreeing things.

As another historian notes in conclusion, &quot;Cudworth’s theory of plastic natures is offered as an alternative to the interpretation of all of nature as either governed by blind chance, or, on his understanding of the Malebranchean view, as micro-managed by God.&quot;

==== Plastic Principle and mind ====
Cudworth&#x27;s plastic principle also involves a theory of mind that is active, that is, God or the Supreme Mind is &quot;the spermatic reason&quot; which gives rise to individual mind and reason. Human mind can also create, and has access to spiritual or super-sensible &#x27;Ideas&#x27; in the Platonic sense. Cudworth challenged Hobbesian determinism in arguing that will is not distinct from reason, but a power to act that is internal, and therefore, the voluntary will function involves self-determination, not external compulsion, though we have the power to act either in accordance with God&#x27;s will or not. Cudworth&#x27;s &#x27;hegemonikon&#x27; (taken from Stoicism) is a function within the soul that combines the higher functions of the soul (voluntary will and reason) on the one hand with the lower animal functions (instinct), and also constitutes the whole person, thus bridging the Cartesian dualism of body and soul or &quot;psyche&quot; and &quot;soma&quot;. This idea provided the basis for a concept of self-awareness and identity of an individual that is self-directed and autonomous, an idea that anticipates John Locke.

== Legacy ==
Locke examined how man came to knowledge via stimulus (rather than seeing ideas as inherent), which approach led to his idea of the &#x27;thinking&#x27; mind, which is both receptive and pro-active. The first involves receiving sensations (&#x27;simple ideas&#x27;) and the second by reflection – &quot;observation of its own inner operations&quot; (inner sense which leads to complex ideas), with the second activity acting upon the first. Thought is set in motion by outer stimuli which &#x27;simple ideas&#x27; are taken up by the mind&#x27;s self-activity, an &quot;active power&quot; such that the outer world can only be real-ized as action (natural cause) by the activity of consciousness. Locke also took the issue of life as lying not in substance but in the capacity of the self for consciousness, to be able to organize (associate) disparate events, that is to participate life by means of the sense experiences, which have the capacity to produce every kind of experience in consciousness. These ideas of Locke were taken over by Fichte and influenced German Romantic science and medicine. (See Romantic medicine and Brunonian system of medicine).
Thomas Reid and his &quot;Common Sense&quot; philosophy, was also influenced by Cudworth, taking his influence into the Scottish Enlightenment.

George Berkeley later developed the idea of a plastic life principle with his idea of an &#x27;aether&#x27; or &#x27;aetherial medium&#x27; that causes &#x27;vibrations&#x27; that animate all living beings. For Berkeley, it is the very nature of this medium that generates the &#x27;attractions&#x27; of entities to each other.

:The refraction of light is also thought to proceed from the different density and elastic force of this æthereal medium in different places. The vibrations of this medium, alternately concurring with or obstructing the motions of the rays of light, are supposed to produce the fits of easy reflection and transmission. Light by the vibrations of this medium is thought to communicate heat to bodies. Animal motion and sensation are also accounted for by the vibrating motions of this æthereal medium, propagated through the solid capillaments of the nerves. In a word, all the phenomena and properties of bodies that were before attributed to attraction, upon later thoughts seem ascribed to this æther, together with the various attractions themselves. (Berkeley V 107–8)

Berkeley meant this &#x27;aether&#x27; to supplant Newton&#x27;s gravity as the cause of motion (neither seeing the polarity involved between two forces, as Cudworth had in his plastic principle). However, in Berkeley&#x27;s conception, aether is both the movement of spirit and the motion of nature.

Both Cudworth&#x27;s views and those of Berkeley were taken up by Coleridge in his metaphor of the eolian harp in his &#x27;Effusion XXXV&#x27; as one commentator noted: &quot;what we see in the first manuscript is the articulation of Cudworth’s principle of plastic nature, which is then transformed in the published version into a Berkeleyan expression of the causal agency of motion performed by God’s immanent activity.&quot;

==Works==
===Sermons and Treatises===
Cudworth&#x27;s works included &quot;The Union of Christ and the Church, in a Shadow&quot; (1642); &quot;A Sermon preached before the House of Commons&quot; (1647); and &quot;A Discourse concerning the True Notion of the Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot; (1670). Much of Cudworth&#x27;s work remains in manuscript. However, certain surviving works have been published posthumously, such as &quot;A Treatise concerning eternal and immutable Morality, and A Treatise of Freewill. &quot;

====&quot;A Treatise concerning eternal and immutable Morality&quot; (posth.)====
Cudworth&#x27;s &quot;Treatise on eternal and immutable Morality&quot;, published with a preface by Edward Chandler (1731), is about the historical development of British moral philosophy. It answers, from the standpoint of Platonism, Hobbes&#x27;s famous doctrine that moral distinctions are created by the state. It argues that just as knowledge contains a permanent intelligible element over and above the flux of sense-impressions, so there exist eternal and immutable ideas of morality.

====&quot;A Treatise of Freewill&quot; (posth.)====
Another posthumous publication was Cudworth&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise of Freewill&quot;, edited by John Allen (1838). Both this and the &quot;Treatise on eternal and immutable Morality&quot; are connected with the design of his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;The True Intellectual System of the Universe&quot;.

===&quot;The True Intellectual System of the Universe&quot; (1678)===
In 1678, Cudworth published &quot;The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated&quot;, which had been given an Imprimatur for publication (29 May 1671).
The &quot;Intellectual System&quot; arose, according to Cudworth, from a discourse refuting &quot;fatal necessity&quot;, or determinism. Enlarging his plan, he proposed to prove three matters:
:(a) the existence of God;
:(b) the naturalness of moral distinctions; and
:(c) the reality of human freedom.

These three comprise, collectively, the intellectual (as opposed to the physical) system of the universe; and they are opposed, respectively, by three false principles: atheism, religious fatalism (which refers all moral distinctions to the will of God), and the fatalism of the ancient Stoics (who recognized God and yet identified him with nature). Only the first part, dealing with atheism, was ever published.

Cudworth criticizes two main forms of materialistic atheism: the atomic (adopted by Democritus, Epicurus and Thomas Hobbes); and the hylozoic (attributed to Strato of Lampsacus, which explains everything by the supposition of an inward self-organizing life in matter). Atomic atheism, to which Cudworth devotes the larger part of the work, is described as arising from the combination of two principles, neither of which is, individually, atheistic (namely atomism and corporealism, or the doctrine that nothing exists but body). The example of Stoicism, Cudworth suggests, shows that corporealism may be theistic.

Cudworth discusses the history of atomism at length. It is, in its purely physical application, a theory that he fully accepts. He holds that theistic atomism was taught by Pythagoras, Empedocles and many other ancient philosophers, and was only perverted to atheism by Democritus. Cudworth believes that atomism was first invented before the Trojan war by a Sidonian thinker named Moschus or Mochus (whom he identifies with Moses in the Old Testament).

Cudworth&#x27;s method in arranging his work was to marshal the atheistic arguments elaborately before refuting them in his final chapter. This led many readers to accuse Cudworth himself of atheism – as John Dryden remarked, &quot;he has raised such objections against the being of a God and Providence that many think he has not answered them&quot;. Much attention was also attached to a subordinate matter in the book, the conception of the &quot;Plastic Medium&quot; (a revival of Plato&#x27;s &quot;World-Soul&quot;) which was intended to explain the existence and laws of nature without referring to the direct operation of God. This theory occasioned a long-drawn controversy between Pierre Bayle and Georges-Louis Leclerc, with the former maintaining, and the latter denying, that the Plastic Medium is favourable to atheism.

Summing up the work, Andrew Dickson White wrote in 1896:
To this day he [Cudworth] remains, in breadth of scholarship, in strength of thought, in tolerance, and in honesty, one of the greatest glories of the English Church ... He purposed to build a fortress which should protect Christianity against all dangerous theories of the universe, ancient or modern ... While genius marked every part of it, features appeared which gave the rigidly orthodox serious misgivings. From the old theories of direct personal action on the universe by the Almighty he broke utterly. He dwelt on the action of law, rejected the continuous exercise of miraculous intervention, pointed out the fact that in the natural world there are &quot;errors&quot; and &quot;bungles&quot; and argued vigorously in favor of the origin and maintenance of the universe as a slow and gradual development of Nature in obedience to an inward principle.

<text>Roswell () is a city in and the county seat of Chaves County, New Mexico, United States. The population was 48,422 at the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most populous city in New Mexico. It is home to the New Mexico Military Institute (NMMI), founded in 1891. The city is also the location of an Eastern New Mexico University campus. Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge is located a few miles northeast of the city on the Pecos River. Bottomless Lakes State Park is located east of Roswell on US 380. Chaves County forms the entirety of the Roswell micropolitan area.

The Roswell incident was named after the town, though the crash site of the alleged UFO was some north of Roswell and closer to Corona. The investigation and debris recovery was handled by the local Roswell Army Air Field. On the 50th anniversary of the Roswell incident, an annual UFO Festival was started. In the 1930s, Roswell was a site for much of Robert H. Goddard&#x27;s early rocketry work. The Roswell Museum and Art Center maintains an exhibit that includes a recreation of Goddard&#x27;s rocket engine development workshop, and Goddard High School is named after him.

Roswell&#x27;s tourism industry is based on ufology museums and businesses, as well as alien-themed and spacecraft-themed iconography. The city also relies on New Mexico and Americana related tourism including the International UFO Museum and Research Center. Local American folk and New Mexico music performances occur near Pioneer Plaza and in parks around the city. It is a center for acequia-like irrigated farming, dairying, and ranching; it is also the location of several manufacturing, distribution, and petroleum related facilities. Roswell has a history of minor league baseball. This regional pride has resulted in Roswell receiving the All-America City Award multiple times, in 1978–79 and 2002.

==History==
The first non-indigenous settlers of the area around Roswell were a group of pioneers from Missouri, who attempted to start a settlement southwest of what is now Roswell in 1865, but were forced to abandon the site because of a lack of water. It was called Missouri Plaza. It also had many Hispanic people from Lincoln, New Mexico. John Chisum had his famous Jingle Bob Ranch about from the center of Roswell, at South Spring Acres. At the time, it was the largest ranch in the United States.

Van C. Smith, a businessman from Omaha, Nebraska, and his partner, Aaron Wilburn, constructed two adobe buildings in 1869 that began what is now Roswell. The two buildings became the settlement&#x27;s general store, post office, and sleeping quarters for paying guests. In 1871, Smith filed a claim with the federal government for the land around the buildings, and on August 20, 1873, he became the town&#x27;s first postmaster. Smith was the son of Roswell Smith, a prominent lawyer in Lafayette, Indiana, and Annie Ellsworth, daughter of U.S. Patent Commissioner Henry Leavitt Ellsworth. He called the town Roswell, after his father&#x27;s first name.

In 1877, Captain Joseph Calloway Lea and his family bought out Smith and Wilburn&#x27;s claim and became the owners of most of the land of Roswell and the area surrounding it. The town was relatively quiet during the Lincoln County War (1877–1879). A major aquifer was discovered when merchant Nathan Jaffa had a well drilled in his back yard on Richardson Avenue in 1890, resulting in the area&#x27;s first major growth and development spurt. The growth continued when the Pecos Valley Railroad arrived in 1892.

During World War II, a prisoner-of-war camp was located in nearby Orchard Park. The German prisoners of war were used to do major infrastructure work in Roswell, such as paving the banks of the North Spring River. Some POWs used rocks of different sizes to create the outline of an iron cross among the stones covering the north bank. Later, the iron cross was covered with a thin layer of concrete. In the 1980s, a crew cleaning the river bed cleared off the concrete and revealed the outline once more. The small park just south of the cross was then known as Iron Cross Park. On November 11, 1996, the park was renamed POW/MIA Park. The park displays a piece of the Berlin Wall, presented to the city of Roswell by the German Air Force.

Roswell was a location of military importance from 1941 to 1967. In 1967, the Walker Air Force Base was decommissioned. After the closure of the base, Roswell capitalized on its pleasant climate and reinvented itself as a retirement community.

Roswell has benefited from interest in the alleged UFO incident of 1947. It was the report of an object that crashed in the general vicinity in June or July 1947, allegedly an extraterrestrial spacecraft and its alien occupants. Since the late 1970s, the incident has been the subject of intense controversy and of a conspiracy theory regarding a classified program named &quot;Project Mogul&quot;. Many UFO proponents maintain that an alien craft was found and its occupants were captured, and that the military then engaged in a cover-up. In recent times, the business community has deliberately sought out tourists interested in UFOs, science fiction, and aliens.

Roswell hosted the record-breaking skydive by Felix Baumgartner on October 14, 2012.

==Geography==
Roswell is located in the High Great Plains of southeastern New Mexico, approximately west of the Pecos River and some east of highlands that rise to the Sierra Blanca range. U.S. Routes 70, 285 and 380 intersect in the city.

Summers are very hot (as is common with the High Plains of New Mexico and Colorado) and averages around 30 days per year when the temperature rises above , which can be unpleasant. The North American monsoon occurs during the summer, and can bring torrential downpours, severe thunderstorms (with high winds and hail) and sometimes even tornadoes. The rain can provide a cooling relief from the scorching great plains heat. Fall is usually warm and pleasant, but can be cold late in the season. Snow is possible generally from late October to March.

<text>The Red Sea is a sea inlet of the Indian Ocean, lying between Africa and Asia. Its connection to the ocean is in the south, through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait and the Gulf of Aden. To its north lie the Sinai Peninsula, the Gulf of Aqaba, and the Gulf of Suez—leading to the Suez Canal. It is underlain by the Red Sea Rift, which is part of the Great Rift Valley.

The Red Sea has a surface area of roughly , is about long, and wide at its widest point. It has an average depth of , and in the central Suakin Trough it reaches its maximum depth of .

Approximately 40% of the Red Sea is quite shallow at less than deep, and about 25% is less than deep. The extensive shallow shelves are noted for their marine life and corals. More than 1,000 invertebrate species and 200 types of soft and hard coral live in the sea. The Red Sea is the world&#x27;s northernmost tropical sea, and has been designated a Global 200 ecoregion.

== Extent ==
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Red Sea as follows:

== Names ==
Red Sea has names in many languages of the region

* Modern ; Medieval ;
* Coptic: ⲫⲓⲟⲙ ⲛ̀ϩⲁϩ &quot;Phiom Enhah&quot; or ⲫⲓⲟⲙ ⲛ̀ϣⲁⲣⲓ &quot;Phiom ǹšari&quot;
* Tigrinya: ቀይሕ ባሕሪ &quot;Qeyih Bahri&quot;
* Afar: Qasa Bad

The English term &quot;Red Sea&quot; is a direct translation of the Ancient Greek &quot;Erythra Thalassa&quot; (). The sea itself was once referred to as the Erythraean Sea by Europeans. As well as &quot;Mare Rubrum&quot; in Latin (alternatively &quot;Sinus Arabicus&quot;, literally &quot;Arabian Gulf&quot;), the Romans called it &quot;Pontus Herculis&quot; (Sea of Hercules). Other designations include the (alternatively &quot;Baḥr Al-Qulzum&quot;, literally &quot;the Sea of Clysma&quot;), the Coptic ⲫⲓⲟⲙ ̀ⲛϣⲁⲣⲓ &quot;Phiom ̀nšari&quot;, Syriac ܝܡܐ ܣܘܡܩܐ Yammāʾ summāqā, Somali &quot;Badda cas&quot; and Tigrinya &quot;Qeyyiḥ bāḥrī&quot; (ቀይሕ ባሕሪ). The name of the sea may signify the seasonal blooms of the red-coloured &quot;Trichodesmium erythraeum&quot; near the water&#x27;s surface. A theory favored by some modern scholars is that the name &quot;red&quot; is referring to the direction south, just as the Black Sea&#x27;s name may refer to north. The basis of this theory is that some Asiatic languages used color words to refer to the cardinal directions. Herodotus on one occasion uses Red Sea and Southern Sea interchangeably.

The name in Hebrew &quot;Yam Suph&quot; () is of biblical origin.

The name in &quot;Phiom Enhah&quot; (&quot;Sea of Hah&quot;) is connected to Ancient Egyptian root &quot;ḥ-ḥ&quot; which refers to water and sea (for example the names of the Ogdoad gods Heh and Hauhet).

Historically, it was also known to western geographers as &quot;Mare Mecca&quot; (Sea of Mecca), and &quot;Sinus Arabicus&quot; (Gulf of Arabia). Some ancient geographers called the Red Sea the Arabian Gulf or Gulf of Arabia.

The association of the Red Sea with the biblical account of the Israelites crossing the Red Sea is ancient, and was made explicit in the Septuagint translation of the Book of Exodus from Hebrew to Koine Greek in approximately the third century BC. In that version, the &quot;Yam Suph&quot; () is translated as &quot;Erythra Thalassa&quot; (Red Sea).

The Red Sea is one of four seas named in English after common color terms – the others being the Black Sea, the White Sea and the Yellow Sea. The direct rendition of the Greek &quot;Erythra thalassa&quot; in Latin as Mare Erythraeum refers to the north-western part of the Indian Ocean, and also to a region on Mars.

The earliest known exploration of the Red Sea was conducted by ancient Egyptians, as they attempted to establish commercial routes to Punt. One such expedition took place around 2500 BC, and another around 1500 BC (by Hatshepsut). Both involved long voyages down the Red Sea.

The biblical Book of Exodus tells the account of the Israelites&#x27; crossing of the sea, which the Hebrew text calls &quot;Yam Suph&quot; (). &quot;Yam Suph&quot; was traditionally identified as the Red Sea. Rabbi Saadia Gaon (882‒942), in his Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, identifies the crossing place of the Red Sea as &quot;Baḥar al-Qulzum&quot;, meaning the Gulf of Suez.

In the 6th century BC, Darius the Great, who was a prominent ruler of the Achaemenid Empire in Persia, undertook significant efforts to improve and extend navigation in the Red Sea. He sent reconnaissance missions to explore the Red Sea area and to identify its various navigational hazards, such as rocks and currents. This effort was significant, as it contributed to safer and more efficient navigation routes.

In addition to the maritime explorations, during the reign of Darius the Great, a canal was constructed linking the Nile River to the northern end of the Red Sea at Suez. This canal is sometimes referred to as the ancient Suez Canal. It played a pivotal role in improving trade and communication between the Nile Valley and the Red Sea, and beyond to the Indian Ocean. This canal was a predecessor to the modern Suez Canal, which was constructed in the 19th century and continues to be one of the world&#x27;s most important waterways.

The construction of the canal during Darius&#x27;s reign is evidenced by ancient records, including inscriptions. Darius commemorated the completion of the canal by creating stelae (stone monuments) with inscriptions in several languages, describing the construction and its benefits. The canal not only facilitated trade but also solidified Darius&#x27;s control over Egypt and enhanced the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s economic and political power in the region.

In the late 4th century BC, Alexander the Great sent Greek naval expeditions down the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean. Greek navigators continued to explore and compile data on the Red Sea. Agatharchides collected information about the sea in the 2nd century BC. The &quot;Periplus of the Erythraean Sea&quot; (&quot;Periplus of the Red Sea&quot;), a Greek periplus written by an unknown author around the 1st century, contains a detailed description of the Red Sea&#x27;s ports and sea routes. The Periplus also describes how Hippalus first discovered the direct route from the Red Sea to India.

The Red Sea was favored for Roman trade with India starting with the reign of Augustus, when the Roman Empire gained control over the Mediterranean, Egypt, and the northern Red Sea. The route had been used by previous states but grew in the volume of traffic under the Romans. From Indian ports goods from China were introduced to the Roman world. Contact between Rome and China depended on the Red Sea, but the route was broken by the Aksumite Empire around the 3rd century AD.
From antiquity until the 20th-century, the Red Sea was also a trade route of the Red Sea slave trade from Africa to the Middle East.

=== Middle Ages and modern era ===
During the Middle Ages, the Red Sea was an important part of the spice trade route. In 1183, Raynald of Châtillon launched a raid down the Red Sea to attack the Muslim pilgrim convoys to Mecca. The possibility that Raynald&#x27;s fleet might sack the holy cities of Mecca and Medina caused fury throughout the Muslim world. However, it appears that Raynald&#x27;s target was the lightly armed Muslim pilgrim convoys, rather than the well guarded cities of Mecca and Medina, and the belief in the Muslim world that Raynald was seeking to sack the holy cities, due to the proximity of those cities to the areas that Raynald raided.

In 1513, trying to secure that channel to Portugal, Afonso de Albuquerque laid siege to Aden but was forced to retreat. They cruised the Red Sea inside the Bab al-Mandab, as the first fleet from Europe in modern times to have sailed these waters. Later in 1524 the city was delivered to Governor Heitor da Silveira as an agreement for protection from the Ottomans.
In 1798, France ordered General Napoleon to invade Egypt and take control of the Red Sea. Although he failed in his mission, the engineer Jean-Baptiste Lepère, who took part in it, revitalised the plan for a canal which had been envisaged during the reign of the Pharaohs. Several canals were built in ancient times from the Nile to the Red Sea along or near the line of the present Sweet Water Canal, but none lasted for long. The Suez Canal was opened in November 1869. During the first half of the 20th-century, the Red Sea slave trade attracted substantional international condemnation.

After the Second World War, the Americans and Soviets exerted their influence whilst the volume of oil tanker traffic intensified. However, the Six-Day War culminated in the closure of the Suez Canal from 1967 to 1975. Today, in spite of patrols by the major maritime fleets in the waters of the Red Sea, the Suez Canal has never recovered its supremacy over the Cape route, which is believed to be less vulnerable to piracy.

===Red Sea crisis===

Iranian-backed Yemini Houthis have attacked Western ships, including warships, next to the Bab al-Mandeb during the Israel–Hamas war. One ship was hijacked and taken back to Yemen.

== Oceanography ==
The Red Sea is between arid land, desert and semi-desert. Reef systems are better developed along the Red Sea mainly because of its greater depths and an efficient water circulation pattern. The Red Sea water mass-exchanges its water with the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean via the Gulf of Aden. These physical factors reduce the effect of high salinity caused by evaporation in the north and relatively hot water in the south.

The climate of the Red Sea is the result of two monsoon seasons: a northeasterly monsoon and a southwesterly monsoon. Monsoon winds occur because of differential heating between the land and the sea. Very high surface temperatures and high salinities make this one of the warmest and saltiest bodies of seawater in the world. The average surface water temperature of the Red Sea during the summer is about in the north and in the south, with only about variation during the winter months. The overall average water temperature is . Temperature and visibility remain good to around . The sea is known for its strong winds and unpredictable local currents.

The rainfall over the Red Sea and its coasts is extremely low, averaging per year. The rain is mostly short showers, often with thunderstorms and occasionally with dust storms. The scarcity of rainfall and no major source of fresh water to the Red Sea result in excess evaporation as high as per year and high salinity with minimal seasonal variation. A recent underwater expedition to the Red Sea offshore from Sudan and Eritrea found surface water temperatures in winter and up to in the summer, but despite that extreme heat, the coral was healthy with much fish life with very little sign of coral bleaching, with only 9% infected by &quot;Thalassomonas loyana&quot;, the &#x27;white plague&#x27; agent. &quot;Favia favus&quot; coral there harbours a virus, BA3, which kills &quot;T. loyana&quot;.
Scientists are investigating the unique properties of these coral and their commensal algae to see if they can be used to salvage bleached coral elsewhere.

=== Salinity ===
The Red Sea is one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, owing to high evaporation and low precipitation; no significant rivers or streams drain into the sea, and its southern connection to the Gulf of Aden, an arm of the Indian Ocean, is narrow. Its salinity ranges from between ~36 ‰ in the southern part and 41 ‰ in the northern part around the Gulf of Suez, with an average of 40 ‰. (Average salinity for the world&#x27;s seawater is ~35 ‰ on the Practical Salinity Scale, or PSU; that translates to 3.5% of actual dissolved salts).

=== Tidal range ===
In general, tide ranges between in the north, near the mouth of the Gulf of Suez and in the south near the Gulf of Aden, but it fluctuates between and away from the nodal point. The central Red Sea (Jeddah area) is therefore almost tideless, and as such the annual water level changes are more significant. Because of the small tidal range the water during high tide inundates the coastal sabkhas as a thin sheet of water up to a few hundred metres rather than flooding the sabkhas through a network of channels. However, south of Jeddah in the Shoiaba area, the water from the lagoon may cover the adjoining sabkhas as far as , whereas north of Jeddah in the Al-Kharrar area the sabkhas are covered by a thin sheet of water as far as . The prevailing north and northeast winds influence the movement of water in the coastal inlets to the adjacent sabkhas, especially during storms. Winter mean sea level is higher than in summer. Tidal velocities passing through constrictions caused by reefs, sand bars and low islands commonly exceed . Coral reefs in the Red Sea are near Egypt, Eritrea, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Sudan.

=== Current ===
Detailed information regarding current data is lacking, partially because the currents are weak and both spatially and temporally variable. The variation of temporal and spatial currents is as low as and are governed all by wind. During the summer, northwesterly winds drive surface water south for about four months at a velocity of , whereas in winter the flow is reversed resulting in the inflow of water from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The net value of the latter predominates, resulting in an overall drift to the north end of the Red Sea. Generally, the velocity of the tidal current is with a maximum of at the mouth of the al-Kharrar Lagoon. However, the range of the north-northeast current along the Saudi coast is .

=== Wind regime ===
The north part of the Red Sea is dominated by persistent north-west winds, with speeds ranging between and . The rest of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden are subjected to regular and seasonally reversible winds. The wind regime is characterized by seasonal and regional variations in speed and direction with average speed generally increasing northward.

Wind is the driving force in the Red Sea to transport material as suspension or as bedload. Wind-induced currents play an important role in the Red Sea in resuspending bottom sediments and transferring materials from sites of dumping to sites of burial in quiescent environment of deposition. Wind-generated current measurement is therefore important in order to determine the sediment dispersal pattern and its role in the erosion and accretion of the coastal rock exposure and the submerged coral beds.

== Geology ==

The Red Sea was formed by the Arabian Peninsula being split from the Horn of Africa by movement of the Red Sea Rift. This split started in the Eocene and accelerated during the Oligocene. The sea is still widening (in 2005, following a three-week period of tectonic activity it had grown by ), and it is considered that it will become an ocean in time (as proposed in the model of John Tuzo Wilson). In 1949, a deep water survey reported anomalously hot brines in the central portion of the Red Sea. Later work in the 1960s confirmed the presence of hot, , saline brines and associated metalliferous muds. The hot solutions were emanating from an active subseafloor rift. Lake Asal in Djibouti is eligible as an experimental site to study the evolution of the deep hot brines of the Red Sea. By observing the strontium isotope composition of the Red Sea brines, it is possible to deduce how these salt waters found at the bottom of the Red Sea could have evolved in a similar way to Lake Asal, which ideally represents their compositional extreme. The high salinity of the waters was not hospitable to living organisms.

Sometime during the Tertiary period, the Bab el Mandeb closed and the Red Sea evaporated to an empty hot dry salt-floored sink. Effects causing this would have been:
* A &quot;race&quot; between the Red Sea widening and Perim Island erupting filling the Bab el Mandeb with lava.
* The lowering of world sea level during the Ice Ages because of much water being locked up in the ice caps.

A number of volcanic islands rise from the center of the sea. Most are dormant. However, in 2007, Jabal al-Tair island in the Bab el Mandeb strait erupted violently. Two new islands were formed in 2011 and 2013 in the Zubair Archipelago, a small chain of islands owned by Yemen. The first island, Sholan Island, emerged in an eruption in December 2011, the second island, Jadid, emerged in September 2013. Approximately 40% of the Red Sea is quite shallow at less than deep, with about 25% less than deep.

=== Oil and gas ===
Undiscovered oil reserves in the region have been estimated at . Undiscovered gas reserves in the region have been estimated at . Undiscovered natural gas reserves have been estimated at . Most of these plays are controlled by the structure of the basin. Normal faults are common as the Red Sea occupies an active diverging margin. These targets are commonly found below the Salt deposits of the Middle Miocene.

Modern development is focused on the following fields. The Durwara 2 Field was discovered in 1963, while the Suakin 1 Field and the Bashayer 1A Field were discovered in 1976, on the Egyptian side of the Red Sea. The Barqan Field was discovered in 1969, and the Midyan Field in 1992, both within the Midyan Basin on the Saudi Arabian side of the Red Sea. The 20-m thick Middle Miocene Maqna Formation is an oil source rock in the basin. Oil seeps occur near the Farasan Islands, the Dahlak Archipelago, along the coast of Eritrea, and in the southeastern Red Sea along the coasts of Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

=== Mineral resources ===

In terms of mineral resources the major constituents of the Red Sea sediments are as follows:
* Biogenic constituents:
: Nanofossils, foraminifera, pteropods, siliceous fossils
* Volcanogenic constituents:
:Tuffites, volcanic ash, montmorillonite, cristobalite, zeolites
* Terrigenous constituents:
: Quartz, feldspars, rock fragments, mica, heavy minerals, clay minerals
* Authigenic minerals:
: Sulfide minerals, aragonite, calcite, protodolomite, dolomite, quartz, chalcedony.
* Evaporite minerals:
: Magnesite, gypsum, anhydrite, halite, polyhalite
* Brine precipitate:
: Fe-montmorillonite, goethite, hematite, siderite, rhodochrosite, pyrite, sphalerite, anhydrite.

== Ecosystem ==

The Red Sea is a rich and diverse ecosystem. For example, more than 1200 fish species have been recorded in the Red Sea, of which 10% are endemic, found nowhere else.

Since the opening of the Suez Canal in November 1869, over a thousand marine species from the Red Sea—from plankton, seaweeds, invertebrates to fishes—have migrated northward and settled in the Mediterranean Sea. To the point that a number of them now form a significant component of the Mediterranean ecosystem. The resulting change in biodiversity, without precedent in human memory, is currently accelerating, in particular for fishes according to surveys engaged by the Mediterranean Science Commission.

The rich diversity of the Red Sea is in part due to the of coral reef extending along its coastline; these fringing reefs are 5000–7000 years old and are largely formed of stony acropora and porites corals. The reefs form platforms and sometimes lagoons along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders (such as the Blue Hole (Red Sea) at Dahab).

The Red Sea also hosts many offshore reefs, including several true atolls. Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic (i.e., Darwinian) coral reef classification schemes, and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area. Both offshore and coastal reefs are visited by pelagic species of fish, including many of the 44 recorded species of shark, and by many species (over 175) of nudibranch, many of which are endemic to the Red Sea. Other coastal Red Sea habitats include sea grass beds, salt pans, mangrove and salt marsh. Furthermore, the deep Red Sea brine pools have been extensively studied with regard to their microbial life, characterized by its diversity and adaptation to extreme environments.

The high marine biodiversity of the area is recognized by the Egyptian government, which set up the Ras Mohammed National Park in 1983. The rules and regulations governing this area protect local marine life, which has become a major draw for diving enthusiasts who should be aware that although most Red Sea species are innocuous, a few are hazardous to humans.

== Desalination plants ==
There is extensive demand for desalinated water to meet the needs of the population and the industries along the Red Sea.

There are at least 18 desalination plants along the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia which discharge warm brine and treatment chemicals (chlorine and anti-scalants) that bleach and kill corals and cause diseases in the fish. This is only localized, but it may intensify with time and profoundly impact the fishing industry.

== Trade ==
The Red Sea serves an important role in the global economy, with cargo vessels traveling between the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea every year, thus shortening the path between Asia and Europe almost by half (as compared to traveling around Africa via the Atlantic Ocean). 12% of global trade passes through the Red Sea. This includes 30% of global container traffic.

=== Tourism ===
The sea is known for its recreational diving sites, such as Ras Mohammed, SS Thistlegorm (shipwreck), Elphinstone Reef, The Brothers, Daedalus Reef, St. John&#x27;s Reef, Rocky Island in Egypt and less known sites in Sudan such as Sanganeb, Abington, Angarosh and Shaab Rumi.

The Red Sea became a popular destination for diving after the expeditions of Hans Hass in the 1950s, and later by Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Popular tourist resorts include El Gouna, Hurghada, Safaga, Marsa Alam, on the west shore of the Red Sea, and Sharm-el-Sheikh, Dahab, and Taba on the Egyptian side of Sinaï, as well as Aqaba in Jordan and Eilat in Israel in an area known as the Red Sea Riviera.

The popular tourist beach of Sharm el-Sheikh was closed to all swimming in December 2010 due to several serious shark attacks, including a fatality. As of December 2010, scientists are investigating the attacks and have identified, but not verified, several possible causes including over-fishing which causes large sharks to hunt closer to shore, tourist boat operators who chum offshore for shark-photo opportunities, and reports of ships throwing dead livestock overboard. The sea&#x27;s narrowness, significant depth, and sharp drop-offs, all combine to form a geography where large deep-water sharks can roam in hundreds of meters of water, yet be within a hundred meters of swimming areas. The Red Sea Project is building highest quality accommodation and a wide range of facilities on the coast line in Saudi Arabia. This will allow people to visit the coastline of the Red Sea by the end of 2022 but will be fully finished by 2030.

Tourism to the region has been threatened by occasional terrorist attacks, and by incidents related to food safety standards.

=== Security ===
The Red Sea is part of the sea roads between Europe, the Persian Gulf and East Asia, and as such has heavy shipping traffic. Government-related bodies with responsibility to police the Red Sea area include the Port Said Port Authority, Suez Canal Authority and Red Sea Ports Authority of Egypt, Jordan Maritime Authority, Israel Port Authority, Saudi Ports Authority and Sea Ports Corporation of Sudan.

Houthi rebels in Yemen have increased attacks on shipping vessels since mid-November 2023. The blocking of Israeli-linked ships was in response to Israel&#x27;s war on Gaza. In January 2024, it was reported that Red Sea shipping volumes have dropped to 30% of normal levels due to Houthi intervention. In response, the US has announced a maritime coalition to defend shipping in the Red Sea for the Operation Prosperity Guardian. In January 2024, US and British forces undertook dozens of air and sea strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen. US President Joe Biden reportedly authorized strikes, despite not having congressional approval.

== Bordering countries ==
The Red Sea may be geographically divided into three sections: the Red Sea proper, and in the north, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Gulf of Suez. The six countries bordering the Red Sea proper are:
* Eastern shore:
** Saudi Arabia
** Yemen
* Western shore:
** Egypt
** Sudan
** Eritrea
** Djibouti

The Gulf of Suez is entirely bordered by Egypt. The Gulf of Aqaba borders Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.

In addition to the standard geographical definition of the six countries bordering the Red Sea cited above, areas such as Somalia are sometimes also described as Red Sea territories. This is primarily due to their proximity to and geological similarities with the nations facing the Red Sea and/or political ties with them.

<text>Ronald William &quot;Josh&quot; Kirby (27 November 1928 – 23 October 2001) was a British commercial artist. Over a career spanning 60 years, he was the artist for the covers of many science fiction books including Terry Pratchett&#x27;s &quot;Discworld&quot; novels.

==Personal life==
He was born on 27 November 1928 at 58 Argo Road, Waterloo, Lancashire. His parents were Charles William and Ellen (née Marsh) Kirby who ran a grocery shop together, although his father was also a ship owner&#x27;s freight clerk. They named him Ronald William Kirby.

Kirby dreamed of a career in art from a young age. When he was seven, he made a trade sign that said &quot;KIRBY – ARTIST&quot;. He was also attracted to science fiction and fantasy from images seen in films and magazines.

At the beginning of the Second World War, his school was evacuated to Abercraf in South Wales. In 1943, he returned to Liverpool and attended the Junior then Senior Schools of the Liverpool City School of Art from the age of 14 until he was 20. He was trained in drawing, painting and lithography. While he was there, his Old Master-style portraits earned him the nickname &quot;Josh&quot; when colleagues likened his work to that of the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. The nickname stuck. He also met the model June Furlong in 1948 and they remained lifelong friends.

He moved to London in 1950. In 1965, he married Dianne Kingston and moved to The Old Rectory, Shelfanger, near Diss in Norfolk. He lived and worked there, in a cramped studio, until his death.

Kirby and Kingston divorced in 1982. He died of natural causes in his sleep at home in Shelfanger at the age of 72 on 23 October 2001 and was survived by his brother Len and two nephews.

In 2024, his family were looking for a philanthropist to support the conservation and exhibition of his body of work, around 400 finished paintings and several hundred sketches.

==Career==

He worked as freelance all his career, having left his only employment after half a day.

After leaving art school, Liverpool City Council commissioned him to paint the Lord Mayor, Alderman Joseph Jackson Cleary, in 1950. Kirby carried out the commission but decided against portraiture as a career and turned to illustration for film posters and books.

In the early 1950s, Kirby illustrated film posters for studios in both London and Paris and continued to do some film posters until the &#x27;80s. In the &#x27;70s, he undertook film poster art for publicity agency feref. Working alongside designer Eddie Paul, Kirby depicted the characters for Star Wars: &quot;Return of the Jedi;&quot; films &quot;The Beastmaster&quot; and &quot;Krull&quot;, among others. He also designed a poster for &quot;The Life of Brian&quot; inspired by Pieter Brueghel&#x27;s Tower Of Babel, but it was not used.

When the market for film poster illustration dried up in the mid 1980s, Kirby switched his attention to role-playing games. He provided cover art for &quot;Duelmasters&quot;, &quot;Tunnels &amp; Trolls&quot; and &quot;Wizards &amp; Warriors.&quot;

However, Kirby&#x27;s major output between the late 1950s to the 1980s was artwork for book covers for a very wide range of books including westerns, crime novels, science fiction and non-fiction, as well as covers and interior art for science fiction magazines. His first published book cover art was for the 1955 science fiction novel &quot;Cee-Tee Man&quot;, by Dan Morgan. In 1956, he created a cover for Ian Fleming&#x27;s book &quot;Moonraker&quot;. Working for publishers including Panther, Corgi, Four Square and NEL/Mayflower, he illustrated over 400 covers for authors including Brian Aldiss, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Stephen Briggs, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Craig Shaw Gardner, Ron Goulart, Robert Heinlein, Alfred Hitchcock, Jack Kerouac, Ursula Le Guin, Richard Matheson, Guy de Maupassant, Terry Pratchett, Robert Rankin, Jimmy Sangster, Jules Verne, and H. G. Wells.

Kirby&#x27;s most significant work in the 1980s was the covers for the &quot;Discworld&quot; series, a commission that Kirby thought would be a &quot;one-off&quot;. Starting with &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot;, he eventually produced the covers for 26 of the series until his death in 2001. Upon his passing, his successor Paul Kidby painted a portrait of Kirby into the cover art of the novel &quot;Night Watch&quot;, in tribute to the artist.

==Style==
Throughout his career, Kirby used oils, acrylics, gouache, or watercolor, often using more than one method on a single piece. Ultimately, he preferred oils as they would not dry too quickly and could be manipulated and applied in layers. This allowed them to be retouched or entirely painted over, whatever it took to achieve the result.

When asked about influences, he most often named three past artists. The oldest was Hieronymus Bosch, famous for his fantastic imagery, detailed landscapes and illustrations of religious concepts and narratives; next was Pieter Bruegel, whose religious and mythological depictions expanded the viewer&#x27;s perspective of reality; and finally muralist Frank Brangwyn, an avant-garde artist-craftsman notable for his boldly coloured murals.

Kirby worked slowly and meticulously. It would take him four to eight weeks to complete a single painting because his process included reading each novel before illustrating it. He would then draw a rough sketch in pencil to be approved by the art editor at the publisher. Unusually, he discussed the concept directly over the phone with Pratchett, rather than his publisher&#x27;s art director.

<doc id="26193" wikidata="Q193803" url="?curid=26193" title="Roger Penrose">
<text>Sir Roger Penrose (born 8 August 1931) is an English mathematician, mathematical physicist, philosopher of science and Nobel Laureate in Physics. He is Emeritus Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics in the University of Oxford, an emeritus fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and an honorary fellow of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and University College London.

Penrose has contributed to the mathematical physics of general relativity and cosmology. He has received several prizes and awards, including the 1988 Wolf Prize in Physics, which he shared with Stephen Hawking for the Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems, and the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics &quot;for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Colchester, Essex, Roger Penrose is a son of physician Margaret (née Leathes) and psychiatrist and geneticist Lionel Penrose. His paternal grandparents were J. Doyle Penrose, an Irish-born artist, and The Hon. Elizabeth Josephine Peckover, daughter of Alexander Peckover, 1st Baron Peckover; his maternal grandparents were physiologist John Beresford Leathes and Sonia Marie Natanson, a Russian Jew. His uncle was artist Sir Roland Penrose, whose son with American photographer Lee Miller is Antony Penrose. Penrose is the brother of physicist Oliver Penrose, of geneticist Shirley Hodgson and of chess Grandmaster Jonathan Penrose. Their stepfather was the mathematician and computer scientist Max Newman.

Penrose spent World War II as a child in Canada where his father worked in London, Ontario at the Ontario Hospital and Western University. Penrose studied at University College School. He then attended University College London, where he obtained a BSc degree with First Class Honours in mathematics in 1952.

In 1955, while a doctoral student, Penrose reintroduced the E. H. Moore generalised matrix inverse, also known as the Moore–Penrose inverse, after it had been reinvented by Arne Bjerhammar in 1951. Having started research under the professor of geometry and astronomy, Sir W. V. D. Hodge, Penrose received his PhD in algebraic geometry at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1957, with his thesis titled &quot;Tensor Methods in Algebraic Geometry&quot; supervised by algebraist and geometer John A. Todd. He devised and popularised the Penrose triangle in the 1950s in collaboration with his father, describing it as &quot;impossibility in its purest form&quot;, and exchanged material with the artist M. C. Escher, whose earlier depictions of impossible objects partly inspired it. Escher&#x27;s &quot;Waterfall&quot; and &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot; were in turn inspired by Penrose.
As reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:
== Research and career ==
Penrose spent the academic year 1956–57 as an assistant lecturer at Bedford College (now Royal Holloway, University of London) and was then a research fellow at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. During that three-year post, he married Joan Isabel Wedge, in 1959. Before the fellowship ended Penrose won a NATO Research Fellowship for 1959–61, first at Princeton and then at Syracuse University. Returning to the University of London, Penrose spent 1961–63 as a researcher at King&#x27;s College, London, before returning to the United States to spend 1963–64 as a visiting associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin. He later held visiting positions at Yeshiva University, Princeton and Cornell during 1966–67 and 1969.

In 1964, while a reader at Birkbeck College, London, (and having had his attention drawn from pure mathematics to astrophysics by the cosmologist Dennis Sciama, then at Cambridge) in the words of Kip Thorne of Caltech, &quot;Roger Penrose revolutionised the mathematical tools that we use to analyse the properties of spacetime&quot;. Until then, work on the curved geometry of general relativity had been confined to configurations with sufficiently high symmetry for Einstein&#x27;s equations to be solvable explicitly, and there was doubt about whether such cases were typical. One approach to this issue was by the use of perturbation theory, as developed under the leadership of John Archibald Wheeler at Princeton. The other, and more radically innovative, approach initiated by Penrose was to overlook the detailed geometrical structure of spacetime and instead concentrate attention just on the topology of the space, or at most its conformal structure, since it is the latter – as determined by the lay of the lightcones – that determines the trajectories of lightlike geodesics, and hence their causal relationships. The importance of Penrose&#x27;s epoch-making paper &quot;Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities&quot; (summarised roughly as that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of singularity) was not its only result. It also showed a way to obtain similarly general conclusions in other contexts, notably that of the cosmological Big Bang, which he dealt with in collaboration with Sciama&#x27;s most famous student, Stephen Hawking.
It was in the local context of gravitational collapse that the contribution of Penrose was most decisive, starting with his 1969 cosmic censorship conjecture, to the effect that any ensuing singularities would be confined within a well-behaved event horizon surrounding a hidden space-time region for which Wheeler coined the term black hole, leaving a visible exterior region with strong but finite curvature, from which some of the gravitational energy may be extractable by what is known as the Penrose process, while accretion of surrounding matter may release further energy that can account for astrophysical phenomena such as quasars.

Following up his &quot;weak cosmic censorship hypothesis&quot;, Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the &quot;strong censorship hypothesis&quot;. Together with the Belinski–Khalatnikov–Lifshitz conjecture and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in general relativity. Also from 1979, dates Penrose&#x27;s influential Weyl curvature hypothesis on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the second law of thermodynamics. Penrose and James Terrell independently realised that objects travelling near the speed of light will appear to undergo a peculiar skewing or rotation. This effect has come to be called the Terrell rotation or Penrose–Terrell rotation.
In 1967, Penrose invented the twistor theory, which maps geometric objects in Minkowski space into the 4-dimensional complex space with the metric signature (2,2).

Penrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of Penrose tilings, which are formed from two tiles that can only tile the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. In 1984, such patterns were observed in the arrangement of atoms in quasicrystals. Another noteworthy contribution is his 1971 invention of spin networks, which later came to form the geometry of spacetime in loop quantum gravity. He was influential in popularizing what are commonly known as Penrose diagrams (causal diagrams).

In 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at Rice University in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987. His doctoral students have included, among others, Andrew Hodges, Lane Hughston, Richard Jozsa, Claude LeBrun, John McNamara, Tristan Needham, Tim Poston, Asghar Qadir, and Richard S. Ward.

In 2004, Penrose released &quot;The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe&quot;, a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the Laws of Physics that includes an explanation of his own theory. The Penrose Interpretation predicts the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity, and proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference of space-time curvature attains a significant level.

Penrose is the Francis and Helen Pentz Distinguished Visiting Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Pennsylvania State University.

=== An earlier universe ===
In 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data of the cosmic microwave background sky, of an earlier universe existing before the Big Bang of our own present universe. He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book &quot;Cycles of Time&quot;, a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with Einstein&#x27;s field equations, the Weyl curvature C, and the Weyl curvature hypothesis (WCH), that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it. He made several conjectures about C and the WCH, some of which were subsequently proved by others, and he also popularized his conformal cyclic cosmology (CCC) theory. In this theory, Penrose postulates that at the end of the universe all matter is eventually contained within black holes, which subsequently evaporate via Hawking radiation. At this point, everything contained within the universe consists of photons, which &quot;experience&quot; neither time nor space. There is essentially no difference between an infinitely large universe consisting only of photons and an infinitely small universe consisting only of photons. Therefore, a singularity for a Big Bang and an infinitely expanded universe are equivalent.

In simple terms, Penrose believes that the singularity in Einstein&#x27;s field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.

=== Consciousness ===

Penrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind&quot; (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness. Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls &quot;correct quantum gravity&quot;). Penrose uses a variant of Turing&#x27;s halting theorem to demonstrate that a system can be deterministic without being algorithmic. (For example, imagine a system with only two states, ON and OFF. If the system&#x27;s state is ON when a given Turing machine halts and OFF when the Turing machine does not halt, then the system&#x27;s state is completely determined by the machine; nevertheless, there is no algorithmic way to determine whether the Turing machine stops.)

Penrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical wave function reduction, and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that computers today are unable to have intelligence because they are algorithmically deterministic systems. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer. This contrasts with supporters of strong artificial intelligence, who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically. He bases this on claims that consciousness transcends formal logic because factors such as the insolubility of the halting problem and Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem prevent an algorithmically based system of logic from reproducing such traits of human intelligence as mathematical insight. These claims were originally espoused by the philosopher John Lucas of Merton College, Oxford.

The Penrose–Lucas argument about the implications of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers. Many experts in these fields assert that Penrose&#x27;s argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack. Marvin Minsky, a leading proponent of artificial intelligence, was particularly critical, stating that Penrose &quot;tries to show, in chapter after chapter, that human thought cannot be based on any known scientific principle.&quot; Minsky&#x27;s position is exactly the opposite – he believed that humans are, in fact, machines, whose functioning, although complex, is fully explainable by current physics. Minsky maintained that &quot;one can carry that quest [for scientific explanation] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail. This is what I see in Penrose&#x27;s quest for a new basic principle of physics that will account for consciousness.&quot;

Penrose responded to criticism of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Mind&quot; with his follow-up 1994 book &quot;Shadows of the Mind&quot;, and in 1997 with &quot;The Large, the Small and the Human Mind&quot;. In those works, he also combined his observations with those of anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroff.

Penrose and Hameroff have argued that consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects in microtubules, which they dubbed Orch-OR (orchestrated objective reduction). Max Tegmark, in a paper in &quot;Physical Review E&quot;, calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the decoherence time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000. The reception of the paper is summed up by this statement in Tegmark&#x27;s support: &quot;Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM&#x27;s John A. Smolin, say the calculations confirm what they had suspected all along. &#x27;We&#x27;re not working with a brain that&#x27;s near absolute zero. It&#x27;s reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior&#x27;&quot;. Tegmark&#x27;s paper has been widely cited by critics of the Penrose–Hameroff position.

Phillip Tetlow, although himself supportive of Penrose&#x27;s views, acknowledges that Penrose&#x27;s ideas about the human thought process are at present a minority view in scientific circles, citing Minsky&#x27;s criticisms and quoting science journalist Charles Seife&#x27;s description of Penrose as &quot;one of a handful of scientists&quot; who believe that the nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.

In January 2014, Hameroff and Penrose ventured that a discovery of quantum vibrations in microtubules by Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the National Institute for Materials Science in Japan supports the hypothesis of Orch-OR theory. A reviewed and updated version of the theory was published along with critical commentary and debate in the March 2014 issue of &quot;Physics of Life Reviews&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Penrose&#x27;s first marriage was to American Joan Isabel Penrose (née Wedge), whom he married in 1959. They had three sons. Penrose is now married to Vanessa Thomas, director of Academic Development at Cokethorpe School and former head of mathematics at Abingdon School. They have one son.

=== Religious views ===

During an interview with BBC Radio 4 on 25 September 2010, Penrose stated, &quot;I&#x27;m not a believer myself. I don&#x27;t believe in established religions of any kind.&quot; He regards himself as an agnostic. In the 1991 film &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot;, he also said, &quot;I think I would say that the universe has a purpose, it&#x27;s not somehow just there by chance … some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along—it&#x27;s a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it.&quot;

Penrose is a patron of Humanists UK.

<text>A restriction enzyme, restriction endonuclease, REase, ENase or&quot; restrictase &quot; is an enzyme that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within molecules known as restriction sites. Restriction enzymes are one class of the broader endonuclease group of enzymes. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA substrate at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another. To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.

These enzymes are found in bacteria and archaea and provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a prokaryote, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up &quot;foreign&quot; DNA in a process called &quot;restriction digestion&quot;; meanwhile, host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme (a methyltransferase) that modifies the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage. Together, these two processes form the restriction modification system.

More than 3,600 restriction endonucleases are known which represent over 250 different specificities. Over 3,000 of these have been studied in detail, and more than 800 of these are available commercially. These enzymes are routinely used for DNA modification in laboratories, and they are a vital tool in molecular cloning.

== History ==

The term restriction enzyme originated from the studies of phage λ, a virus that infects bacteria, and the phenomenon of host-controlled restriction and modification of such bacterial phage or bacteriophage. The phenomenon was first identified in work done in the laboratories of Salvador Luria, Jean Weigle and Giuseppe Bertani in the early 1950s. It was found that, for a bacteriophage λ that can grow well in one strain of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, for example &quot;E. coli&quot; C, when grown in another strain, for example &quot;E. coli&quot; K, its yields can drop significantly, by as much as three to five orders of magnitude. The host cell, in this example &quot;E. coli&quot; K, is known as the restricting host and appears to have the ability to reduce the biological activity of the phage λ. If a phage becomes established in one strain, the ability of that phage to grow also becomes restricted in other strains. In the 1960s, it was shown in work done in the laboratories of Werner Arber and Matthew Meselson that the restriction is caused by an enzymatic cleavage of the phage DNA, and the enzyme involved was therefore termed a restriction enzyme.

The restriction enzymes studied by Arber and Meselson were type I restriction enzymes, which cleave DNA randomly away from the recognition site. In 1970, Hamilton O. Smith, Thomas Kelly and Kent Wilcox isolated and characterized the first type II restriction enzyme, HindII, from the bacterium &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. Restriction enzymes of this type are more useful for laboratory work as they cleave DNA at the site of their recognition sequence and are the most commonly used as a molecular biology tool. Later, Daniel Nathans and Kathleen Danna showed that cleavage of simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA by restriction enzymes yields specific fragments that can be separated using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, thus showing that restriction enzymes can also be used for mapping DNA. For their work in the discovery and characterization of restriction enzymes, the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Werner Arber, Daniel Nathans, and Hamilton O. Smith. The discovery of restriction enzymes allows DNA to be manipulated, leading to the development of recombinant DNA technology that has many applications, for example, allowing the large scale production of proteins such as human insulin used by diabetic patients.

==Origins==
Restriction enzymes likely evolved from a common ancestor and became widespread via horizontal gene transfer. In addition, there is mounting evidence that restriction endonucleases evolved as a selfish genetic element.

== Recognition site ==

Restriction enzymes recognize a specific sequence of nucleotides and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA. The recognition sequences can also be classified by the number of bases in its recognition site, usually between 4 and 8 bases, and the number of bases in the sequence will determine how often the site will appear by chance in any given genome, e.g., a 4-base pair sequence would theoretically occur once every 4^4 or 256bp, 6 bases, 4^6 or 4,096bp, and 8 bases would be 4^8 or 65,536bp. Many of them are palindromic, meaning the base sequence reads the same backwards and forwards. In theory, there are two types of palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA. The &quot;mirror-like&quot; palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence reads the same forward and backward on a single strand of DNA, as in GTAATG. The &quot;inverted repeat&quot; palindrome is also a sequence that reads the same forward and backward, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., of double-stranded DNA), as in GTATAC (GTATAC being complementary to CATATG). Inverted repeat palindromes are more common and have greater biological importance than mirror-like palindromes.

EcoRI digestion produces &quot;sticky&quot; ends,

whereas SmaI restriction enzyme cleavage produces &quot;blunt&quot; ends:

Recognition sequences in DNA differ for each restriction enzyme, producing differences in the length, sequence and strand orientation (5&#x27; end or 3&#x27; end) of a sticky-end &quot;overhang&quot; of an enzyme restriction.

Different restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence are known as neoschizomers. These often cleave in different locales of the sequence. Different enzymes that recognize and cleave in the same location are known as isoschizomers.

== Types ==
Naturally occurring restriction endonucleases are categorized into five groups (Types I, II, III, IV, and V) based on their composition and enzyme cofactor requirements, the nature of their target sequence, and the position of their DNA cleavage site relative to the target sequence. DNA sequence analysis of restriction enzymes however show great variations, indicating that there are more than four types. All types of enzymes recognize specific short DNA sequences and carry out the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific fragments with terminal 5&#x27;-phosphates. They differ in their recognition sequence, subunit composition, cleavage position, and cofactor requirements, as summarised below:

* Type I enzymes () cleave at sites remote from a recognition site; require both ATP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine to function; multifunctional protein with both restriction digestion and methylase () activities.
* Type II enzymes () cleave within or at short specific distances from a recognition site; most require magnesium; single function (restriction digestion) enzymes independent of methylase.
* Type III enzymes () cleave at sites a short distance from a recognition site; require ATP (but do not hydrolyse it); S-adenosyl-L-methionine stimulates the reaction but is not required; exist as part of a complex with a modification methylase ().
* Type IV enzymes target modified DNA, e.g. methylated, hydroxymethylated and glucosyl-hydroxymethylated DNA
* Type V enzymes utilize guide RNAs (gRNAs)

=== Type l ===
Type I restriction enzymes were the first to be identified and were first identified in two different strains (K-12 and B) of &quot;E. coli&quot;. These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions—one containing 3–4 nucleotides, and another containing 4–5 nucleotides—separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6–8 nucleotides. These enzymes are multifunctional and are capable of both restriction digestion and modification activities, depending upon the methylation status of the target DNA. The cofactors S-Adenosyl methionine (AdoMet), hydrolyzed adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and magnesium (Mg2+) ions, are required for their full activity. Type I restriction enzymes possess three subunits called HsdR, HsdM, and HsdS; HsdR is required for restriction digestion; HsdM is necessary for adding methyl groups to host DNA (methyltransferase activity), and HsdS is important for specificity of the recognition (DNA-binding) site in addition to both restriction digestion (DNA cleavage) and modification (DNA methyltransferase) activity.

=== Type II ===

Typical type II restriction enzymes differ from type I restriction enzymes in several ways. They form homodimers, with recognition sites that are usually undivided and palindromic and 4–8 nucleotides in length. They recognize and cleave DNA at the same site, and they do not use ATP or AdoMet for their activity—they usually require only Mg2+ as a cofactor. These enzymes cleave the phosphodiester bond of double helix DNA. It can either cleave at the center of both strands to yield a blunt end, or at a staggered position leaving overhangs called sticky ends. These are the most commonly available and used restriction enzymes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, new enzymes from this family were discovered that did not follow all the classical criteria of this enzyme class, and new subfamily nomenclature was developed to divide this large family into subcategories based on deviations from typical characteristics of type II enzymes. These subgroups are defined using a letter suffix.

Type IIB restriction enzymes (e.g., BcgI and BplI) are multimers, containing more than one subunit. They cleave DNA on both sides of their recognition to cut out the recognition site. They require both AdoMet and Mg2+ cofactors. Type IIE restriction endonucleases (e.g., NaeI) cleave DNA following interaction with two copies of their recognition sequence. One recognition site acts as the target for cleavage, while the other acts as an allosteric effector that speeds up or improves the efficiency of enzyme cleavage. Similar to type IIE enzymes, type IIF restriction endonucleases (e.g. NgoMIV) interact with two copies of their recognition sequence but cleave both sequences at the same time. Type IIG restriction endonucleases (e.g., RM.Eco57I) do have a single subunit, like classical Type II restriction enzymes, but require the cofactor AdoMet to be active. Type IIM restriction endonucleases, such as DpnI, are able to recognize and cut methylated DNA. Type IIS restriction endonucleases (e.g. FokI) cleave DNA at a defined distance from their non-palindromic asymmetric recognition sites; this characteristic is widely used to perform in-vitro cloning techniques such as Golden Gate cloning. These enzymes may function as dimers. Similarly, Type IIT restriction enzymes (e.g., Bpu10I and BslI) are composed of two different subunits. Some recognize palindromic sequences while others have asymmetric recognition sites.
=== Type III ===
Type III restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoP15) recognize two separate non-palindromic sequences that are inversely oriented. They cut DNA about 20–30 base pairs after the recognition site. These enzymes contain more than one subunit and require AdoMet and ATP cofactors for their roles in DNA methylation and restriction digestion, respectively. They are components of prokaryotic DNA restriction-modification mechanisms that protect the organism against invading foreign DNA. Type III enzymes are hetero-oligomeric, multifunctional proteins composed of two subunits, Res () and Mod (). The Mod subunit recognises the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification methyltransferase; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonuclease. Res is required for restriction digestion, although it has no enzymatic activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognise short 5–6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25–27 bp downstream to leave short, single-stranded 5&#x27; protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction digestion to occur. These enzymes methylate only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenine residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction digestion. Type III enzymes belong to the beta-subfamily of N6 adenine methyltransferases, containing the nine motifs that characterise this family, including motif I, the AdoMet binding pocket (FXGXG), and motif IV, the catalytic region (S/D/N (PP) Y/F).

=== Type IV ===
Type IV enzymes recognize modified, typically methylated DNA and are exemplified by the McrBC and Mrr systems of &quot;E. coli&quot;.

===Type V===
Type V restriction enzymes (e.g., the cas9-gRNA complex from CRISPRs) utilize guide RNAs to target specific non-palindromic sequences found on invading organisms. They can cut DNA of variable length, provided that a suitable guide RNA is provided. The flexibility and ease of use of these enzymes make them promising for future genetic engineering applications.

=== Artificial restriction enzymes ===
Artificial restriction enzymes can be generated by fusing a natural or engineered DNA-binding domain to a nuclease domain (often the cleavage domain of the type IIS restriction enzyme FokI). Such artificial restriction enzymes can target large DNA sites (up to 36 bp) and can be engineered to bind to desired DNA sequences. Zinc finger nucleases are the most commonly used artificial restriction enzymes and are generally used in genetic engineering applications, but can also be used for more standard gene cloning applications. Other artificial restriction enzymes are based on the DNA binding domain of TAL effectors.

In 2013, a new technology CRISPR-Cas9, based on a prokaryotic viral defense system, was engineered for editing the genome, and it was quickly adopted in laboratories. For more detail, read CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats).

In 2017, a group from University of Illinois reported using an Argonaute protein taken from &quot;Pyrococcus furiosus&quot; (PfAgo) along with guide DNA to edit DNA &quot;in vitro&quot; as artificial restriction enzymes.

Artificial ribonucleases that act as restriction enzymes for RNA have also been developed. A PNA-based system, called a PNAzyme, has a Cu(II)-2,9-dimethylphenanthroline group that mimics ribonucleases for specific RNA sequence and cleaves at a non-base-paired region (RNA bulge) of the targeted RNA formed when the enzyme binds the RNA. This enzyme shows selectivity by cleaving only at one site that either does not have a mismatch or is kinetically preferred out of two possible cleavage sites.

== Nomenclature ==

Since their discovery in the 1970s, many restriction enzymes have been identified; for example, more than 3500 different Type II restriction enzymes have been characterized. Each enzyme is named after the bacterium from which it was isolated, using a naming system based on bacterial genus, species and strain. For example, the name of the EcoRI restriction enzyme was derived as shown in the box.

==Applications==

Isolated restriction enzymes are used to manipulate DNA for different scientific applications.

They are used to assist insertion of genes into plasmid vectors during gene cloning and protein production experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short polylinker sequence (called the multiple cloning site, or MCS) rich in restriction recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since it is necessary to avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a DNA ligase.

Restriction enzymes can also be used to distinguish gene alleles by specifically recognizing single base changes in DNA known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This is however only possible if a SNP alters the restriction site present in the allele. In this method, the restriction enzyme can be used to genotype a DNA sample without the need for expensive gene sequencing. The sample is first digested with the restriction enzyme to generate DNA fragments, and then the different sized fragments separated by gel electrophoresis. In general, alleles with correct restriction sites will generate two visible bands of DNA on the gel, and those with altered restriction sites will not be cut and will generate only a single band. A DNA map by restriction digest can also be generated that can give the relative positions of the genes. The different lengths of DNA generated by restriction digest also produce a specific pattern of bands after gel electrophoresis, and can be used for DNA fingerprinting.

In a similar manner, restriction enzymes are used to digest genomic DNA for gene analysis by Southern blot. This technique allows researchers to identify how many copies (or paralogues) of a gene are present in the genome of one individual, or how many gene mutations (polymorphisms) have occurred within a population. The latter example is called restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).

Artificial restriction enzymes created by linking the FokI DNA cleavage domain with an array of DNA binding proteins or zinc finger arrays, denoted zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), are a powerful tool for host genome editing due to their enhanced sequence specificity. ZFN work in pairs, their dimerization being mediated in-situ through the FokI domain. Each zinc finger array (ZFA) is capable of recognizing 9–12 base pairs, making for 18–24 for the pair. A 5–7 bp spacer between the cleavage sites further enhances the specificity of ZFN, making them a safe and more precise tool that can be applied in humans. A recent Phase I clinical trial of ZFN for the targeted abolition of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV-1 has been undertaken.

Others have proposed using the bacteria R-M system as a model for devising human anti-viral gene or genomic vaccines and therapies since the RM system serves an innate defense-role in bacteria by restricting tropism by bacteriophages. There is research on REases and ZFN that can cleave the DNA of various human viruses, including HSV-2, high-risk HPVs and HIV-1, with the ultimate goal of inducing target mutagenesis and aberrations of human-infecting viruses. The human genome already contains remnants of retroviral genomes that have been inactivated and harnessed for self-gain. Indeed, the mechanisms for silencing active L1 genomic retroelements by the three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) and excision repair cross complementing 1(ERCC) appear to mimic the action of RM-systems in bacteria, and the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) that follows the use of ZFN without a repair template.
