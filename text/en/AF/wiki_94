<text>Samhain ( , , , ) or  () is a Gaelic festival on 1 November marking the end of the harvest season and beginning of winter or the &quot;darker half&quot; of the year. It is also the Irish and Scottish Gaelic name for November. Celebrations begin on the evening of 31 October, since the Celtic day began and ended at sunset. This is about halfway between the autumnal equinox and winter solstice. It is one of the four Gaelic seasonal festivals along with Imbolc, Bealtaine, and Lughnasa. Historically it was widely observed throughout Ireland, Scotland, and the Isle of Man. Its Brittonic Celtic equivalent is called &quot;Calan Gaeaf&quot; in Wales.

Samhain is believed to have Celtic pagan origins, and some Neolithic passage tombs in Great Britain and Ireland are aligned with the sunrise at the time of Samhain. As a festival for communing with the ancestors, however, it may predate the Celtic era. A number of stone circles and dolmens, including for example, Avebury, exhibit a west-south-west alignment, the azimuth angle of the setting sun on 31st October. 

Samhain is mentioned in the earliest Irish literature, from the 9th century, and is associated with many important events in Irish mythology. The early literature says Samhain was marked by great gatherings and feasts and was when the ancient burial mounds were open, which were seen as portals to the Otherworld. Some of the literature also associates Samhain with bonfires and sacrifices.

The festival was not recorded in detail until the early modern era. It was when cattle were brought down from the summer pastures and livestock were slaughtered. Special bonfires were lit, which were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers. Like Bealtaine, Samhain was a liminal or threshold festival, when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld blurred, making contact with the &quot;aos sí&quot; (the &#x27;spirits&#x27; or &#x27;fairies&#x27;) more likely. Most scholars see them as remnants of pagan gods. At Samhain, they were appeased with offerings of food and drink to ensure the people and livestock survived the winter. The souls of dead kin were also thought to revisit their homes seeking hospitality, and a place was set at the table for them during a meal. Mumming and guising were part of the festival from at least the early modern era, whereby people went door-to-door in costume, reciting verses in exchange for food. The costumes may have been a way of imitating and disguising oneself from the &quot;aos sí&quot;. Divination was also a big part of the festival and often involved nuts and apples. In the late 19th century, John Rhys and James Frazer suggested it had been the &quot;Celtic New Year&quot;, but that is disputed.

In the 9th century, the Western Church endorsed 1 November as the date of All Saints&#x27; Day, possibly due to the influence of Alcuin or Irish missionaries, and 2 November later became All Souls&#x27; Day. It is believed that Samhain and All Saints&#x27;/All Souls&#x27; influenced each other and the modern Halloween. Most American Halloween traditions were inherited from Irish and Scottish immigrants. Folklorists have used the name &#x27;Samhain&#x27; to refer to Gaelic &#x27;Halloween&#x27; customs until the 19th century.

Since the later 20th century Celtic neopagans and Wiccans have observed Samhain, or something based on it, as a religious holiday.

==Name==
In Modern Irish and Scottish Gaelic the name is , while the traditional Manx Gaelic name is . It is usually written with the definite article (Irish), (Scottish Gaelic), and (Manx). Older forms of the word include the Scottish Gaelic spellings and . The Gaelic names for the month of November are derived from &quot;Samhain&quot;. The Irish name for Samhain night is ( ).

The name of the superficially similar Galician festival of &quot;Samaín&quot; from the Cedeira comarca is etymologically unrelated, being derived from Latin &#x27;elderberry&#x27;.

===Etymology===
These names all come from the Old and Middle Irish &quot;Samain&quot; or &quot;Samuin&quot; , the name for the festival held on 1 November in medieval Ireland. Traditionally, it is derived from proto-Indo-European &quot;*semo&quot; (&#x27;summer&#x27;). However, as John T. Koch points out, it is unclear why a festival marking the beginning of winter would include the word for &#x27;summer&#x27;. Linguist Joseph Vendryes contends that it is unrelated, saying that the Celtic summer ended in August. More recently, linguists Xavier Delamarre and Ranko Matasović have proposed that it derives from proto-Celtic *&quot;samoni&quot; (&#x27;reunion, assembly&#x27;), cognate with Old Norse &quot;saman&quot;, Gothic &quot;samana&quot; and Sanskrit &quot;samāná&quot; (all meaning &#x27;together&#x27;), as well as the Old Irish term &quot;bech-samain&quot; (&#x27;bee swarm&#x27;). Delamarre further suggests it could refer to an &quot;assembly of the living and the dead&quot;.
The word &quot;Samain&quot; is believed to be related to the month name on the Gaulish Coligny calendar from the 2nd century CE. The seventeenth day of is marked as (&quot;the three nights of &quot;Samon&quot;&quot;), indicating a possible festival. This festival could represent the early November festival of Samain, or possibly the summer solstice. Six months later is the month , which appears to contain the word for &quot;winter&quot;. An early Irish glossary, &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot;, gives &quot;Gamain&quot; as &quot;November, the winter month after the festival of &quot;Samain&quot;&quot;.

==Origins==
&quot;Samain&quot; or &quot;Samuin&quot; was the name of the festival (&quot;feis&quot;) marking the beginning of winter in Gaelic Ireland. It is attested in the earliest Old Irish literature, which dates from the 9th century onward. Samhain was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: Samhain (~1 November), Imbolc (~1 February), Bealtaine (~1 May), and Lughnasa (~1 August). Of these, Samhain and Bealtaine, marking the transitions into winter and summer respectively, are thought to have been the most significant. Sir James George Frazer, in his 1890 book, &quot;The Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion&quot;, theorized that these festivals, particularly 1 May and 1 November, were significant to herding communities practicing seasonal transhumance. Cattle were driven to summer pastures in May and returned to lowlands in November, suggesting the festival&#x27;s pastoral origins.

Some Neolithic passage tombs in Ireland are aligned with the sunrise around the times of Samhain and Imbolc. These include the Mound of the Hostages (&quot;Dumha na nGiall&quot;) at the Hill of Tara, and Cairn L at Slieve na Calliagh.

==In Irish mythology==

While Irish mythology was originally a spoken tradition, much of it was eventually written down in the Middle Ages by Christian monks. The tenth-century tale &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot; (&#x27;The Wooing of Emer&#x27;) lists Samhain as the first of the four seasonal festivals of the year. The literature says a peace would be declared, and there were great gatherings where they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol, and held contests. These gatherings are a popular setting for early Irish tales. The tale &quot;Echtra Cormaic&quot; (&#x27;Cormac&#x27;s Adventure&#x27;) says that the Feast of Tara was held every seventh Samhain, hosted by the High King of Ireland, during which new laws and duties were ordained; anyone who broke the laws established during this time would be banished.

According to Irish mythology, Samhain (like Bealtaine) was a time when the &#x27;doorways&#x27; to the Otherworld opened, allowing supernatural beings and the souls of the dead to come into our world; while Bealtaine was a summer festival for the living, Samhain &quot;was essentially a festival for the dead&quot;. &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot; says that the &quot;sídhe&quot; (fairy mounds or portals to the Otherworld) &quot;were always open at Samhain&quot;. Each year the fire-breather Aillen emerges from the Otherworld and burns down the palace of Tara during the Samhain festival after lulling everyone to sleep with his music.
One Samhain, the young Fionn mac Cumhaill, stays awake and slays Aillen with a magical spear, for which he is made leader of the fianna. In a similar tale, one Samhain, the Otherworld being Cúldubh emerges from the burial mound on Slievenamon and snatches a roast pig. Fionn kills Cúldubh with a spear throw as he re-enters the mound. Fionn&#x27;s thumb is caught between the door and the post as it shuts, and he puts it in his mouth to ease the pain. As his thumb had been inside the Otherworld, Fionn is bestowed with great wisdom. This may refer to gaining knowledge from the ancestors. &quot;Acallam na Senórach&quot; (&#x27;Colloquy of the Elders&#x27;) tells how three female werewolves emerge from the cave of Cruachan (an Otherworld portal) each Samhain and kill livestock. When Cas Corach plays his harp, they take on human form, and the fianna warrior Caílte then slays them with a spear.

Some tales suggest that offerings or sacrifices were made at Samhain. In the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (or &#x27;Book of Invasions&#x27;), each Samhain the people of Nemed had to give two-thirds of their children, their corn, and their milk to the monstrous Fomorians. The Fomorians seem to represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature; personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight, and drought. This tribute paid by Nemed&#x27;s people may represent a &quot;sacrifice offered at the beginning of winter, when the powers of darkness and blight are in the ascendant&quot;. According to the later &quot;Dindsenchas&quot; and the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;—which were written by Christian monks—Samhain in ancient Ireland was associated with a god or idol called Crom Cruach. The texts claim that a firstborn child would be sacrificed at the stone idol of Crom Cruach in Magh Slécht. They say that King Tigernmas, and three-fourths of his people, died while worshiping Crom Cruach there one Samhain.

The legendary kings Diarmait mac Cerbaill and Muirchertach mac Ercae each die a threefold death on Samhain, which involves wounding, burning, and drowning, and of which they are forewarned. In the tale &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; (&#x27;The Destruction of Dá Derga&#x27;s Hostel&#x27;), king Conaire Mór also meets his death on Samhain after breaking his &quot;geasa&quot; (prohibitions or taboos). He is warned of his impending doom by three undead horsemen who are messengers of Donn, the god of the dead. &quot;The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn&quot; tells how each Samhain the men of Ireland went to woo a beautiful maiden who lives in the fairy mound on Brí Éile (Croghan Hill). It says that each year someone would be killed &quot;to mark the occasion&quot;, by persons unknown. Some academics suggest that these tales recall human sacrifice, and argue that several ancient Irish bog bodies (such as Old Croghan Man) appear to have been kings who were ritually killed, some of them around the time of Samhain.

In the &quot;Echtra Neraí&quot; (&#x27;The Adventure of Nera&#x27;), King Ailill of Connacht sets his retinue a test of bravery on Samhain night. He offers a prize to whoever can make it to a gallows and tie a band around a hanged man&#x27;s ankle. Demons thwart each challenger, who runs back to the king&#x27;s hall in fear. However, Nera succeeds, and the dead man asks for a drink. Nera carries him on his back, and they stop at three houses. They enter the third, where the dead man drinks and spits it on the householders, killing them. Returning, Nera sees a fairy host burning the king&#x27;s hall and slaughtering those inside. He follows the host through a portal into the Otherworld. Nera learns that what he saw was only a vision of what will happen the next Samhain unless something is done. He returns to the hall and warns the king.

The tale &quot;Aided Chrimthainn maic Fidaig&quot; (&#x27;The Killing of Crimthann mac Fidaig&#x27;) tells how Mongfind kills her brother, King Crimthann of Munster, so that one of her sons might become king. Mongfind offers Crimthann a poisoned drink at a feast, but he asks her to drink from it first. Having no other choice but to drink the poison, she dies on Samhain eve. The Middle Irish writer notes that Samhain is also called &quot;Féile Moingfhinne&quot; (the Festival of Mongfind or Mongfhionn) and that &quot;women and the rabble make petitions to her&quot; at Samhain.

Many other events in Irish mythology happen or begin on Samhain. The invasion of Ulster that makes up the main action of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (&#x27;Cattle Raid of Cooley&#x27;) begins on Samhain. As cattle-raiding typically was a summer activity, the invasion during this off-season surprised the Ulstermen. The &quot;Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh&quot; also begins on Samhain. The Morrígan and The Dagda meet and have sex before the battle against the Fomorians; in this way, the Morrígan acts as a sovereignty figure and gives the victory to the Dagda&#x27;s people, the Tuatha Dé Danann. In &quot;Aislinge Óengusa&quot; (&#x27;The Dream of Óengus&#x27;) it is when he and his bride-to-be switch from bird to human form, and in &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot; (&#x27;The Wooing of Étaín&#x27;) it is the day on which Óengus claims the kingship of Brú na Bóinne.
Several sites in Ireland are especially linked to Samhain. Each Samhain, a host of otherworldly beings was said to emerge from the Cave of Cruachan in County Roscommon. The Hill of Ward (or Tlachtga) in County Meath is thought to have been the site of a great Samhain gathering and bonfire; the Iron Age ringfort is said to have been where the goddess or druid Tlachtga gave birth to triplets and where she later died.

In &quot;The Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain&quot; (1996), Ronald Hutton writes: &quot;No doubt there were [pagan] religious observances as well, but none of the tales ever portrays any&quot;. The only historical reference to pagan religious rites is in the work of Geoffrey Keating (died 1644), but his source is unknown. Hutton says it may be that no religious rites are mentioned because, centuries after Christianization, the writers had no record of them. Hutton suggests Samhain may not have been &quot;particularly&quot; associated with the supernatural. He says that the gatherings of royalty and warriors on Samhain may have been an ideal setting for such tales, in the same way, that many Arthurian tales are set at courtly gatherings at Christmas or Pentecost.

==Historic customs==
Samhain was one of the four main festivals of the Gaelic calendar, marking the end of the harvest and the beginning of winter. Samhain customs are mentioned in several medieval texts. In &quot;Serglige Con Culainn&quot; (&#x27;Cúchulainn&#x27;s Sickbed&#x27;), it is said that the festival of the Ulaid at Samhain lasted a week: Samhain itself, and the three days before and after. It involved great gatherings where they held meetings, feasted, drank alcohol, and held contests. The &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; notes that bonfires were lit at Samhain and stones cast into the fires. It is mentioned in Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot;, which was written in the early 1600s but drew on earlier medieval sources, some of which are unknown. He claims that the &quot;feis&quot; of Tara was held for a week every third Samhain when the nobles and ollams of Ireland met to lay down and renew the laws, and to feast. He also claims that the druids lit a sacred bonfire at Tlachtga and made sacrifices to the gods, sometimes by burning their sacrifices. He adds that all other fires were doused and re-lit from this bonfire.

===Ritual bonfires===
Like Bealtaine, bonfires were lit on hilltops at Samhain, and there were rituals involving them. By the early modern era, they were most common in parts of the Scottish Highlands, on the Isle of Man, in north and mid-Wales, and in parts of Ulster. F. Marian McNeill says that they were formerly need-fires, but that this custom died out. Likewise, only certain kinds of wood were traditionally used, but later records show that many kinds of flammable material were burnt. It is suggested that the fires were a kind of imitative or sympathetic magic; mimicking the Sun, helping the &quot;powers of growth&quot; and holding back the decay and darkness of winter. They may also have served to symbolically &quot;burn up and destroy all harmful influences&quot;. Accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries suggest that the fires, smoke, and ashes were deemed to have protective and cleansing powers.

In 19th-century Moray, boys asked for bonfire fuel from each house in the village. When the fire was lit, &quot;one after another of the youths laid himself down on the ground as near to the fire as possible so as not to be burned and in such a position as to let the smoke roll over him. The others ran through the smoke and jumped over him&quot;. When the bonfire burnt, they scattered the ashes, vying for who should scatter them most. In some areas, two bonfires would be built side by side, and the people—sometimes with their livestock—would walk between them as a cleansing ritual. The bones of slaughtered cattle were said to have been cast upon bonfires.

People also took the flames from the bonfire back to their homes. During the 19th century, in parts of Scotland, torches of burning fir or turf were carried sunwise around homes and fields to protect them. In some places, people doused their hearth fires on Samhain night. Each family then solemnly re-lit its hearth from the communal bonfire, thus bonding the community. The 17th-century writer Geoffrey Keating claimed that this was an ancient tradition instituted by the druids. Dousing the old fire and bringing in the new may have been a way of banishing evil, which was part of New Year festivals in many countries.

===Divination===

The bonfires were used in divination. In 18th-century Ochtertyre, a ring of stones—one for each person—was laid around the fire, perhaps on a layer of ash. Everyone then ran around it with a torch, &quot;exulting&quot;. In the morning, the stones were examined, and if any were mislaid, it was said that the person it represented would not live out the year. A similar custom was observed in north Wales and in Brittany. James Frazer suggests this may come from &quot;an older custom of actually burning them&quot; (i.e. human sacrifice) or it may have always been symbolic. Divination has likely been a part of the festival since ancient times, and it has survived in some rural areas.

At household festivities throughout the Gaelic regions and Wales, many rituals were intended to divine the future of those gathered, especially concerning death and marriage. Apples and hazelnuts were often used in these divination rituals and games. In Celtic mythology, apples were strongly associated with the Otherworld and immortality, while hazelnuts were associated with divine wisdom. One of the most common games was apple bobbing. Another involved hanging a small wooden rod from the ceiling at head height, with a lit candle on one end and an apple hanging from the other. The rod was spun round, and everyone took turns to try to catch the apple with their teeth. Apples were peeled in one long strip, the peel tossed over the shoulder, and its shape was said to form the first letter of the future spouse&#x27;s name.

Two hazelnuts were roasted near a fire; one named for the person roasting them and the other for the person they desired. If the nuts jumped away from the heat, it was a bad sign, but if the nuts roasted quietly, it foretold an excellent match. Items were hidden in food—usually a cake, barmbrack, cranachan, champ or sowans — and portions of it served out at random. A person&#x27;s future was foretold by the item they happened to find; for example, a ring meant marriage, and a coin meant wealth. A salty oatmeal bannock was baked; the person ate it in three bites and then went to bed in silence without anything to drink. This was said to result in a dream in which their future spouse offers them a drink to quench their thirst. Egg whites were dropped in water, and the shapes foretold the number of future children. Young people would also chase crows and divine some of these things from the number of birds or the direction they flew.

===Spirits and souls===
Samhain was seen as a liminal time when the boundary between this world and the Otherworld could more easily be crossed. This meant the &quot;aos sí&quot;, the &#x27;spirits&#x27; or &#x27;fairies&#x27;, could more easily come into our world. Many scholars see the &quot;aos sí&quot; as remnants of pagan gods and nature spirits. At Samhain, it was believed that the &quot;aos sí&quot; needed to be propitiated to ensure that the people and their livestock survived the winter. Offerings of food and drink would be left outside for the &quot;aos sí&quot;, and portions of the crops might be left in the ground for them.

One custom—described as a &quot;blatant example&quot; of a &quot;pagan rite surviving into the Christian epoch&quot;—was recorded in the Outer Hebrides and Iona in the 17th century. On the night of 31 October, fishermen and their families would go down to the shore. One man would wade into the water up to his waist, where he would pour out a cup of ale and ask &#x27;Seonaidh&#x27; (&#x27;Shoney&#x27;), whom he called &quot;god of the sea&quot;, to bestow on them a good catch. The custom was ended in the 1670s after a campaign by ministers, but the ceremony shifted to the springtime and survived until the early 19th century.

People also took special care not to offend the &quot;aos sí&quot; and sought to ward off anyone out to cause mischief. They stayed near to home or, if forced to walk in the darkness, turned their clothing inside-out or carried iron or salt to keep them at bay. In southern Ireland, it was customary on Samhain to weave a small cross of sticks and straw called a &#x27;parshell&#x27; or &#x27;parshall&#x27;, which was similar to the Brigid&#x27;s cross and God&#x27;s eye. It was fixed over the doorway to ward-off bad luck, sickness, and witchcraft and would be replaced each Samhain.

The dead were also honoured at Samhain. The beginning of winter may have been seen as the most fitting time to do so, as it was a time of &#x27;dying&#x27; in nature. The souls of the dead were thought to revisit their homes, seeking hospitality. Places were set at the dinner table and by the fire to welcome them. The belief that the souls of the dead return home on one night of the year and must be appeased seems to have ancient origins and is found in many cultures throughout the world. James Frazer suggests, &quot;It was perhaps a natural thought that the approach of winter should drive the poor, shivering, hungry ghosts from the bare fields and the leafless woodlands to the shelter of the cottage&quot;. However, the souls of thankful kin could return to bestow blessings just as easily as that of a wronged person could return to wreak revenge.

===Mumming and guising===

In some areas, mumming and guising were part of Samhain. It was first recorded in 16th century Scotland and later in parts of Ireland, Mann, and Wales. People went from house to house in costume or disguise, usually reciting songs or verses in exchange for food. It may have evolved from a tradition whereby people impersonated the &quot;aos sí&quot;, or the souls of the dead, and received offerings on their behalf. Impersonating these spirits or souls was also believed to protect oneself from them. S. V. Peddle suggests the guisers &quot;personify the old spirits of the winter, who demanded reward in exchange for good fortune&quot;. McNeill suggests that the ancient festival included people in masks or costumes representing these spirits and that the modern custom came from this. In Ireland, costumes were sometimes worn by those who went about before nightfall collecting for a Samhain feast.

In Scotland, young men went house-to-house with masked, veiled, painted, or blackened faces, often threatening to do mischief if they were not welcomed. This was common in the 16th century in the Scottish countryside and persisted into the 20th. It is suggested that the blackened faces come from using the bonfire&#x27;s ashes for protection. In Ireland in the late 18th century, peasants carrying sticks went house-to-house on Samhain collecting food for the feast. Charles Vallancey wrote that they demanded this in the name of St Colm Cille, asking people to &quot;lay aside the fatted calf, and to bring forth the black sheep&quot;. In parts of southern Ireland during the 19th century, the guisers included a hobby horse known as the &quot;Láir Bhán&quot; (white mare). A man covered in a white sheet and carrying a decorated horse skull would lead a group of youths, blowing on cow horns, from farm to farm. At each, they recited verses, some of which &quot;savoured strongly of paganism&quot;, and the farmer was expected to donate food. By doing so, he could expect good fortune from the &#x27;Muck Olla&#x27;; not doing so would bring misfortune. This is akin to the &quot;Mari Lwyd&quot; (grey mare) procession in Wales, which takes place at Midwinter. In Wales, the white horse is often seen as an omen of death. Elsewhere in Europe, costumes, mumming, and hobby horses were part of other yearly festivals. However, in the Celtic-speaking regions, they were &quot;particularly appropriate to a night upon which supernatural beings were said to be abroad and could be imitated or warded off by human wanderers&quot;.
Hutton writes: &quot;When imitating malignant spirits, it was a very short step from guising to playing pranks&quot;. Playing pranks at Samhain is recorded in the Scottish Highlands as far back as 1736 and was also common in Ireland, which led to Samhain being nicknamed &quot;Mischief Night&quot; in some parts. Wearing costumes at Halloween spread to England in the 20th century, as did the custom of playing pranks, though there had been mumming at other festivals. At the time of mass transatlantic Irish and Scottish immigration, which popularised Halloween in North America, Halloween in Ireland and Scotland had a strong tradition of guising and pranks. Trick-or-treating may have come from the custom of going door-to-door collecting food for Samhain feasts, fuel for Samhain bonfires or offerings for the &quot;aos sí&quot;. Alternatively, it may have come from the Allhallowtide custom of collecting soul cakes.

The &quot;traditional illumination for guisers or pranksters abroad on the night in some places was provided by turnips or mangel wurzels, hollowed out to act as lanterns and often carved with grotesque faces&quot;. They were also set on windowsills. By those who made them, the lanterns were variously said to represent the spirits or supernatural beings, or were used to ward off evil spirits. These were common in parts of Ireland and the Scottish Highlands in the 19th century. They were also found in Somerset (see Punkie Night). In the 20th century, they spread to other parts of Britain and became generally known as jack-o&#x27;-lanterns.

===Livestock===
Traditionally, Samhain was a time to take stock of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter pastures after six months in the higher summer pastures (see transhumance). It was also the time to choose which animals would be slaughtered. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin&#x27;s Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal—usually a rooster, goose, or sheep—would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. A bit of the hide would be burnt, and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.

==Celtic Revival==
During the late 19th and early 20th century Celtic Revival, there was an upswell of interest in Samhain and the other Celtic festivals. Sir John Rhys put forth that it had been the &quot;Celtic New Year&quot;. He inferred it from contemporary folklore in Ireland and Wales, which he felt was &quot;full of Hallowe&#x27;en customs associated with new beginnings&quot;. He visited Mann and found that the Manx sometimes called 31 October &quot;New Year&#x27;s Night&quot; or &quot;Hog-unnaa&quot;. The &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot;, written in the Middle Ages, reckoned the year around the four festivals at the beginning of the seasons and put Samhain at the beginning of those. However, Hutton says that the evidence for it being the Celtic or Gaelic New Year&#x27;s Day is flimsy. Rhys&#x27;s theory was popularised by Sir James George Frazer, though at times he did acknowledge that the evidence is inconclusive. Frazer also said that Samhain had been the pagan Celtic festival of the dead and that it had been Christianized as All Saints and All Souls. Since then, Samhain has been popularly seen as the Celtic New Year and an ancient festival of the dead. The calendar of the Celtic League, for example, begins and ends at Samhain.

==Related holidays==
In the Brittonic branch of the Celtic languages, Samhain is known as the &quot;calends of winter&quot;. The Brittonic lands of Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany held festivals on 31 October similar to the Gaelic one. In Wales it is &quot;Calan Gaeaf&quot;, in Cornwall it is Allantide or &quot;Kalan Gwav&quot;, and in Brittany it is &quot;Kalan Goañv&quot;.

The Manx celebrate Hop-tu-Naa on 31 October, which is a celebration of the original New Year&#x27;s Eve. Traditionally, children carve turnips rather than pumpkins and carry them around the neighbourhood singing traditional songs relating to hop-tu-naa.

===Allhallowtide===
In 609, Pope Boniface IV endorsed 13 May as a holy day commemorating all Christian martyrs. By 800, churches in Gaelic Ireland and Anglo-Saxon Northumbria were holding a feast commemorating all saints on 1 November, which became All Saints&#x27; Day. There had been much Gaelic influence on Northumbria and its church. James Frazer suggested this date was a Celtic idea (being the date of Samhain), while Ronald Hutton suggests it was a Germanic idea, writing that the Irish church commemorated all saints on 20 April. Some manuscripts of the Irish &quot;Martyrology of Tallaght&quot; and &quot;Martyrology of Óengus&quot;, which date to this time, have a commemoration of all saints &quot;of Europe&quot; on 20 April, but a commemoration of all saints of the world on 1 November. In 835, the Frankish Empire officially adopted 1 November as the date of All Saints&#x27; Day. This may have been influenced by Alcuin of Northumbria, who was a member of Charlemagne&#x27;s court, or it may have been promoted by the Irish clerics and scholars who were also members of the Frankish court. The new date was eventually adopted by the rest of the Western Church, and in the 11th century, 2 November became established as All Souls&#x27; Day. This created the three-day observance known as Allhallowtide: All Hallows&#x27; Eve (31 October), All Hallows&#x27; Day (1 November), and All Souls&#x27; Day (2 November).

It is suggested that many of the modern secular customs of All Hallows&#x27; Eve (Halloween) were influenced by the festival of Samhain. Other scholars argue that Samhain&#x27;s influence has been exaggerated and that All Hallows&#x27; also influenced Samhain itself.

Most North American Halloween traditions were brought over by Irish and Scottish immigrants in the 19th century. Then, through American influence, these Halloween traditions spread to many other countries by the late 20th century.

==Modern paganism==

Samhain and Samhain-inspired festivals are held by some Modern Pagans. As there are many kinds of Neopaganism, their Samhain celebrations can be very different despite the shared name. Some try to emulate the historic festival as much as possible. Other Neopagans base their celebrations on sundry unrelated sources, Gaelic culture being only one of them. Folklorist Jenny Butler describes how Irish pagans pick some elements of historic Samhain celebrations and meld them with references to the Celtic past, making a new festival of Samhain that is uniquely part of the neo-pagan culture.

Neopagans usually celebrate Samhain on 31 October–1 November in the Northern Hemisphere and 30 April–1 May in the Southern Hemisphere, beginning and ending at sundown. Some Neopagans celebrate it at the astronomical midpoint between the autumnal equinox and winter solstice (or the full moon nearest this point), which is usually around 6 or 7 November in the Northern hemisphere.

===Celtic Reconstructionism===
Like other Reconstructionist traditions, Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (CRs) emphasize historical accuracy. They base their celebrations and rituals on traditional lore as well as research into the beliefs of the polytheistic Celts.
They celebrate Samhain around 1 November but may adjust the date to suit their regional climate, such as when the first winter frost arrives. Their traditions include saining the home and lighting bonfires. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and animals then pass between as a purification ritual. For CRs, it is a time when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small altar or shrine. They often have a meal where a place for the dead is set at the table, and they are invited to join. An untouched portion of food and drink is left outside as an offering. Traditional tales may be told, and traditional songs, poems, and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened, and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games. The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those particularly linked with this festival.

===Wicca===

Wiccans celebrate a variation of Samhain as one of their yearly Sabbats of the Wheel of the Year. It is deemed by most Wiccans to be the most important of the four &quot;greater Sabbats&quot;. Some Wiccans see Samhain as a time to celebrate the lives of those who have died, and it often involves paying respect to ancestors, family members, elders of the faith, friends, pets, and other loved ones who have died. In some rituals, the spirits of the dead are invited to attend the festivities. It is seen as a festival of darkness, which is balanced at the opposite point of the wheel by the spring festival of Bealtaine.

Wiccans believe that at Samhain, the veil between this world and the afterlife is at its thinnest point of the whole year, making it easier to communicate with those who have left this world.

<text>Stargate is a 1994 science fiction action-adventure film directed and co-written by Roland Emmerich. The film is the first entry in the &quot;Stargate&quot; media franchise and stars Kurt Russell, James Spader, Jaye Davidson, Alexis Cruz, Mili Avital, and Viveca Lindfors. The plot centers on the titular &quot;Stargate&quot;, an ancient ring-shaped device that creates a wormhole, enabling travel to a similar device elsewhere in the universe. The central plot explores the theory of extraterrestrial beings having an influence upon human civilization.

&quot;Stargate&quot; was released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States, while it was released by AMLF in France. The film received mixed reviews, with its atmosphere, story, characters, and graphic content both praised and criticized. The film grossed $196.6 million worldwide against a production budget of $55 million.

==Plot==
In 1928 at Giza, Egypt, archaeologist Professor Paul Langford, accompanied by his daughter Catherine, unearths cover stones (also called pyramidion or capstone) engraved with Egyptian hieroglyphs and other markings. Beneath he discovers a large metallic ring of unknown purpose.

In 1994, the now-elderly Catherine invites Egyptologist and linguist Daniel Jackson, Ph.D. to translate the hieroglyphs. The stones, located underground at a military installation in Colorado, are now part of a U.S. Air Force classified project overseen by Special Operations Colonel Jack O&#x27;Neil. Jackson determines that the hieroglyphs refer to a &quot;stargate&quot; which uses star constellations as spatial coordinates. He is then shown the Stargate, the ring device from Giza. They use his coordinates to align the Stargate&#x27;s rotating inner track with V-shaped markings (or &quot;chevrons&quot;) along its outside. When all seven chevrons are locked in, a wormhole opens, connecting the Stargate with a distant planet. Jackson joins O&#x27;Neil and his team (Reilly, Porro, Freeman, Brown, Ferretti, and Kawalsky) as they pass through the wormhole.

They emerge inside a pyramid on the arid desert planet of Abydos. Jackson attempts to locate the symbols required for the return journey through the Stargate but fails. O&#x27;Neil orders Kawalsky to set up camp. Jackson sees a mastadge, a large animal with a harness, which drags him off when he approaches it to investigate. O&#x27;Neil, Kawalsky and Brown follow and they discover a tribe of humans working to mine a strange mineral, which Brown identifies as the same material the Stargate is made of. O&#x27;Neil radios the others to secure basecamp. Following them back to their city, Jackson realizes that the people speak a variant of Ancient Egyptian and is able to communicate with them. He learns that the tribe sees him and his comrades as of their god Ra due to an amulet given to him by Catherine. The tribe&#x27;s chieftain Kasuf presents Jackson with his daughter Sha&#x27;uri as a gift, and although Jackson initially refuses her, he later becomes romantically attached to her. O&#x27;Neil befriends Kasuf&#x27;s teenaged son Skaara and his friends. That night, Ra&#x27;s ship lands atop the pyramid structure, and his soldiers capture Ferretti and Freeman while killing Porro and Reilly.

Through hidden markings and discussions with the tribe, Jackson learns that Ra is an alien being who came to Earth during the Ancient Egyptian period to possess human bodies to extend his own life. Ra enslaved these humans and used the Stargate to bring some of them to Abydos to mine the mineral that is used in the alien technology. Humans on Earth revolted, overthrew Ra&#x27;s overseers, and buried the Stargate to prevent its use. During this investigation, Jackson comes across a cartouche containing six of the seven symbols needed to configure the Stargate for the return to Earth, but the seventh has been broken off and has worn away.

When Jackson, O&#x27;Neil, Brown, and Kawalsky return to the pyramid, there is a firefight against Ra&#x27;s soldiers. Brown is killed and Kawalsky is injured. Jackson and O&#x27;Neil are captured and brought before Ra and his guards, who are revealed to be humanoids when they retract their armored head-pieces. A firefight ensues and Jackson is killed; O&#x27;Neil is incapacitated and is incarcerated with the others. Ra places Jackson&#x27;s body in a sarcophagus-like device that regenerates him. Ra then shows Jackson a nuclear bomb which O&#x27;Neil had secretly brought with him. Perceiving their arrival as an act of war, Ra declares his intentions to send the bomb back through the Stargate to Earth, along with a shipment of the mineral, which will increase its explosive power a hundred fold—essentially creating a world-ending event. Ra then orders the human tribe to watch as he prepares to force Jackson to execute the others to demonstrate his power, but Skaara and his friends create a diversion that allows Jackson, O&#x27;Neil, Kawalsky, and Ferretti to escape, while Freeman is killed. They flee to nearby caves to hide from Ra. Skaara and his friends celebrate, and Skaara draws a sign of victory on a wall, which Jackson recognizes as the final Stargate symbol needed for the return to Earth.

O&#x27;Neil and his remaining men aid Skaara in overthrowing the remaining overseers and then launch an attack on Ra, who sends out fighter ships to strafe the humans while he orders his ship to depart. The humans outside run out of ammunition and are forced to surrender to the fighter ships&#x27; pilots, but the rest of the tribe, seeing that their false gods are really humanoid, rebel against the guards and overthrow them. Sha&#x27;uri is killed, but Jackson takes her body and sneaks aboard Ra&#x27;s ship using a teleportation system, leaving O&#x27;Neil to fight Ra&#x27;s guard captain, Anubis. Jackson places Sha&#x27;uri in the regeneration device, and she recovers, but Ra discovers them and attempts to kill Jackson. O&#x27;Neil activates the teleportation system, killing Anubis and allowing Jackson and Sha&#x27;uri to escape the ship. O&#x27;Neil and Jackson teleport the bomb to Ra&#x27;s ship, destroying the ship and killing Ra. With the humans freed, the remaining team—O&#x27;Neil, Kawalsky, and Ferretti—return to Earth while Jackson chooses to stay behind with Sha&#x27;uri and the others.

==Cast==
* Kurt Russell as Colonel Jonathan J. &quot;Jack&quot; O&#x27;Neil, a career U.S. Air Force Special Operations officer, who suffers a period of suicidal depression after his son accidentally shoots and kills himself with O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s own pistol. When his commission is reactivated, he willingly enters the Stargate, fully aware that he will likely not survive to return to Earth. In real life, Kurt Russell served in the California Air National Guard and belonged to the 146th Tactical Airlift Wing, then based in Van Nuys. Russell turned down the role multiple times, until it was realized he was sent early version of the script, so he was sent the completed shooting script and accepted it.
* James Spader as Dr. Daniel Jackson, an archaeologist and linguist whose theory that the pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty did not build the Great Pyramid of Giza is not very widely accepted. Actor James Spader was intrigued by the script because he found it &quot;awful&quot;, but, after meeting director Roland Emmerich, got excited about it for he &quot;realized that making this picture was going to be such an adventure that out of that would come an adventure on screen.&quot;
* Jaye Davidson as Ra, a powerful alien in human form. After voyaging across the universe, searching for a new host that could sustain his dying body, Ra took the form of a curious adolescent boy and enslaved the people of his planet (Earth). Using a Stargate, he transported people from Earth to another planet until the humans on Earth rebelled and buried their Stargate. Reluctant to continue acting after his debut in &quot;The Crying Game&quot;, Davidson took the role after his request for $1 million in pay was accepted. &quot;Stargate&quot; was the final major film for Davidson, who subsequently retired from acting. Kairon John plays the masked Ra and Dax Biagas plays the young Ra.
* Viveca Lindfors as Dr. Catherine Langford, the civilian leader of the Stargate project who was present when the Stargate was uncovered in Giza in 1928, where her father gave her the amulet depicting the Eye of Ra. &quot;Stargate&quot; was Lindfors&#x27; penultimate film. Kelly Vint Castro portrays the young Catherine.
* Alexis Cruz as Skaara, the son of Kasuf and brother of Sha&#x27;uri. Skaara and his friends aid O&#x27;Neil and his men to fight Ra.
* Mili Avital as Sha&#x27;uri, the daughter of Kasuf. Kasuf offers Sha&#x27;uri to Daniel Jackson in marriage as a gift.
* Leon Rippy as Major General W. O. West, the commanding officer of the facility housing the Stargate device
* John Diehl as Lt. Colonel Charles Kawalsky, O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s second-in-command
* Carlos Lauchu as Anubis, the captain of Ra&#x27;s personal guard
* Djimon Hounsou as Horus, a personal guard of Ra
* Erick Avari as Kasuf, the local leader of the people living in a city near the Stargate, and the father of Sha&#x27;uri and Skaara

==Production==

===Development===
The film in its original cut and in the director&#x27;s cut plays out in chronological order. When Devlin and Emmerich edited the film in the director&#x27;s cut to tighten the narrative, they decided to add a scene at the very beginning of the film to show who the human host of Ra was before the aliens took him. Only Davidson&#x27;s upper torso was filmed. The first scene was a combination of model shots and a set in Yuma, Arizona where &quot;Rambo III&quot; had been filmed. The scene of the excavation of the Stargate was also filmed in three days in Arizona. A golden look was achieved by filming near sunset. To keep within the budget, the producers put stick figures with cloth in the distant desert to appear as humans. The original Stargate was painted black, but it looked like a giant tire so it was repainted silver at the last moment.

Daniel Jackson&#x27;s lecture on his theories was filmed in a hotel in Los Angeles. The scene was originally much longer and delved more into the theories that aliens had built the Egyptian pyramids, but it was trimmed for time concerns for the release. The scenes with O&#x27;Neil at his house were the first ones filmed with Kurt Russell; his hair was cut short afterwards. Russell requested his hair color to be brightened a little for the film. The fictional facility housing the Stargate was the largest set for the film, the former Spruce Goose Dome located in Long Beach, California. Egyptologist Stuart Tyson Smith joined the production to make all Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and spoken language as accurate as possible.

===Filming===
The mask of the pharaoh in the opening credits was made out of fiberglass and modeled in the workshop. The sequence used a motion-control camera to give better depth of field. The score of &quot;Stargate&quot; was composer David Arnold&#x27;s first work on an American feature film. When Devlin and Emmerich first flew to London to meet with Arnold, they had not yet heard the score; hearing it, they felt &quot;he had elevated the film to a whole other level&quot;. Arnold later interviewed the actors during principal photography, using the information to improve his score.

===Visual effects===
Jeff Kleiser and Kleiser-Walczak Construction Co.&#x27;s visual effects team of 40 people created the look of the Stargate. They used self-written image-creation and compositing software, as well as commercial digital packages to create the Stargate, the morphing helmets worn by Ra and the Horus guards, and the cityscape of Nagada. The morphing helmets were not true 3D but 2D elements, as Kleiser explained: &quot;You shoot the character without the headdress, you shoot the character with a headdress. And then you have to go in and, and create all these little sections that you would then wipe off to reveal—and it had to match up, the two things had to match up. I think the cameras were moving as well.&quot;

Footprints in the sand were often digitally removed. The creation of the wormhole, which was fully digital, was one of the biggest challenges in the making of the film. The ripples had to be digitally composited to appear accurate and realistic. Scanning lasers were lined up parallel to the gate to illustrate the amount of body that passed the surface of the Stargate plane. Afterwards, the parts of the body that had or had not yet gone through the gate (depending on the side of filming) were obliterated with a digital matte, a process that removes unwanted components from an individual frame or sequence of frames. The funnel of water that precedes the Stargate opening was filmed by discharging an air cannon into a water tank, as Jeff Kleiser explained: &quot;We didn&#x27;t know how much air pressure to set the cannon on but it went from 1 to 500 lb, so we said &#x27;Let&#x27;s try 100—start the camera rolling and hit the thing.&#x27; It evacuated all the water out of the tank and onto the camera and everybody. It turned out that 1 lb was about the right amount.&quot;

The use of computers generating a big 3D storyboard allowed Emmerich to try out different shooting angles before settling on one angle.

==Music==

The film&#x27;s score was composed by David Arnold, played by the Sinfonia of London and conducted by Nicholas Dodd. It was the second motion picture score that Arnold had composed and his first major one. At the time of production, Arnold had recently started to work in a local video store in London. Once hired, he spent several months in a hotel room working on the soundtrack, spending more time rewriting the music and improving it, during delays due to film companies trying to get the rights to distribution. According to Arnold, &quot;when I first read the script for Stargate, I knew what approach to take, which was to be as big and bold as possible,&quot; saying: &quot;Every time there was an amazing sight, the characters would stand back and say, &#x27;Oh my God!&#x27; But James would just smile and walk towards it. That was the basis for the Stargate score, moving forward with a sense of majesty instead of being frightened by what&#x27;s around the corner.&quot;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Stargate&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on October 28, 1994.

===Home media===
In 1995, the film was released on VHS and as a Dolby Digital-encoded laserdisc spanning two discs (three sides). The first DVD release was on June 18, 1997. The DVD format was re-released in October 1999 under the title &quot;Stargate Special Edition&quot;, and again in 2003 on VHS and a 2-disc DVD set with remastered theatrical and extended editions. The film was released on Blu-ray format on August 29, 2006.

===Lawsuit===
In January 1995, Omar Zuhdi, a high school teacher, filed a lawsuit against the makers and originators of the original movie, claiming that they stole the plot and story of his 1984 film script &quot;Egyptscape&quot;, as the basis of the film &quot;Stargate&quot; (and thus the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise). The suit was later settled out of court.

===Director&#x27;s cut===
The director&#x27;s cut had several scenes which were cut from the theatrical release. This version begins with a short scene showing the abduction of the human that is possessed by Ra. The second added scene took place immediately after the excavation of the Stargate in 1928 and showed a petrified Anubis guard underneath a broken cover stone. With this scene, the producers had tried to introduce the idea that beings had attempted to come through the Stargate after its burial but the scene was ultimately cut for time concerns.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film received a warm reception from the public, grossing $71,567,262 at the United States box office and $125 million internationally for a worldwide total of $196,567,262. At the time, the film set a record for the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film released in the month of October. It would hold this record for four years until 1998 when &quot;Antz&quot; took it.

In its first run, &quot;Stargate&quot; made more money than film industry insiders predicted, considering the lukewarm reviews. Some regard it as Emmerich&#x27;s breakthrough film. &quot;Stargate&quot; grossed over $16,651,000 in the United States during its opening week in October 1994. It was the 35th-highest-grossing film opening in the U.S. in October. From November 4–6, the film grossed around $12,368,700, declining 25%. It topped the box office for two weeks until it was dethroned by &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;. The film would continue this decline until the end of November, when the film garnered $4,777,198, or an 8.2% rise. The week before that the film garnered around $4,413,420, a 45.6% decline. In its last week playing theatrically, the film garnered around $1,170,500 in the U.S.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% based on 51 reviews, and an average rating of 5.4/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;&quot;Stargate&quot; has splashy visuals and James Spader to recommend it, but corny characterization and a clunky script makes this a portal to ho-hum.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. At Movie Review Query Engine (MRQE), which assigns a normalized rating to mainstream critics, the film holds a score of 64 out of 100 based on 95 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Most of the negativity focused on what was criticized as overuse of special effects, thinness of plot, and excessive use of clichés. Roger Ebert went so far as to say, &quot;The movie &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, about the worst director of all time, was made to prepare us for &quot;Stargate&quot;&quot;. Ebert awarded the film one out of four stars and, even over 10 years later, &quot;Stargate&quot; remained on his list of most-hated films. Mike DiBella from &quot;Allmovie&quot; said, &quot;There simply isn&#x27;t enough spectacle in &quot;Stargate&quot; to make up for its many flaws.&quot; The film peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart &quot;Top Video Rentals&quot; on April 29, 1995.

The positive reviews stated that it was an &quot;instant camp classic&quot; and praised the film for its special effects and entertainment value, with Chris Hicks of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; calling it &quot;&quot;Star Wars&quot; meets &quot;Ben Hur&quot;&quot;. Scott McKenzie from DVDactive said, &quot;It&#x27;s a shame because the world created around the &quot;Stargate&quot; is compelling and detailed. It&#x27;s almost enough to make me want to watch the TV series, but not quite.&quot;

===Accolades===

In 1995, &quot;Stargate&quot; was considered for various film awards worldwide. It won six of the ten awards it was nominated for.

==Other media==
===Video Games===
Two video games based on the film were published by Acclaim Entertainment: a 1995 side-scrolling platform game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, and a Tetris-like puzzle video game for the Game Gear and Game Boy.

===Cancelled film sequels===
Devlin and Emmerich always envisioned &quot;Stargate&quot; as the first part of a trilogy of films, but Parts 2 and 3 were never developed. At Comic-Con 2006, twelve years after the original film was released, Devlin stated that he was in early discussions with rights-holders MGM about finally bringing the final two parts to the screen.

According to Devlin, the second film is intended to be set around twelve years after the original, with Jackson making a discovery that leads him back to Earth and to the uncovering of a new Stargate. The second entry would supposedly use a different mythology from the Egyptian one which formed the background to the original film, with the third installment tying these together to reveal that &quot;all mythologies are actually tied together with a common thread that we haven&#x27;t recognized before.&quot; Devlin stated that he hoped to enlist original stars Kurt Russell (Col. Jack O&#x27;Neil) and James Spader (Dr. Daniel Jackson) for the sequels. The actors reportedly expressed an interest in participating in the project.

The film trilogy would not directly tie into the series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. According to Devlin, the relationship between the movie and the series is &quot;we would just continue the mythology of the movie and finish that out. I think the series could still live on at the end of the third sequel. So we&#x27;re going to try to not tread on their stories.&quot; Plans for sequels to the original film are unrelated to the development of straight-to-DVD films made as sequels to &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. According to Devlin, he and Emmerich had always planned to do three films with the potential for more, but MGM preferred to play out the television series first.

===Novel series===
Using some of Emmerich&#x27;s notes, Bill McCay wrote a series of five novels, continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, which involved the Earth-humans, the locals and the successors of Ra.

===Television spin-offs===

The CD-ROM programme &quot;Secrets of Stargate&quot;, released after the film, showed how the special effects were made, and included behind-the-scenes of the film and the showing of interviews with the cast and the production members. Dean Devlin eventually gave Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) the rights over the film, and author Bill McCay wrote a series of five novels based on Emmerich&#x27;s notes, continuing the story the original creators had envisioned. In 1996, MGM hired Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner to create a spin-off television series. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; premiered on the American subscription channel Showtime on July 27, 1997 and ended its ten-season run in 2007. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; itself spawned the non-canon animated television series &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot; (2002–03), and the live-action television series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; (2004–09) and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; (2009–11).

====Differences from film to television franchise====

&quot;SG-1&quot; creators and executive producers Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner altered the canon by introducing several new concepts during production of the &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; series. In the television series, characters were portrayed by different actors, and names were spelled differently. Daniel Jackson was played by James Spader in the film and by Michael Shanks in the series. Kurt Russell&#x27;s character Jonathan &quot;Jack&quot; O&#x27;Neil, a rather humorless Colonel, is played by Richard Dean Anderson as Jonathan &quot;Jack&quot; O&#x27;Neill (with two &#x27;l&#x27;s) in &quot;SG-1&quot;. French Stewart&#x27;s character was Lieutenant Louis Ferretti but in &quot;SG-1&quot;, played by Brent Stait, he is a Major. The spelling of Daniel Jackson&#x27;s wife changes from &quot;Sha&#x27;uri&quot; to &quot;Sha&#x27;re&quot;, O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s wife from Sarah to Sara. (Similarly, the name of O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s son changes from &quot;Tyler&quot; in the film to &quot;Charlie&quot;.)

The Stargate Command setting was transferred from the fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the Cheyenne Mountain military complex. The unnamed planet from the film was named Abydos in the series and the distance from Earth changed from millions of light-years away (in an entirely different galaxy, &quot;the Kalium galaxy&quot;) to becoming the closest planet to Earth with a Stargate, residing in the same galaxy as Earth. Also in &quot;SG-1&quot;, Stargate travel is limited to the Stargate network in the Milky Way galaxy (unless a tremendous amount of power is used to lengthen the subspace wormhole of a Stargate to another galaxy&#x27;s Stargate). Ra was the last of an unnamed race in the film, being of a humanoid species with large black eyes and a lack of facial features. In &quot;SG-1&quot;, Ra is one of many &quot;Goa&#x27;uld System Lords&quot;, a race of parasitic eel-like creatures.

There were also changes to the Stargate. The unique set of 39 Stargate symbols in the film was replaced with the concept of 38 symbols that are the same for each Stargate (Earth&#x27;s symbols based on Earth&#x27;s constellations), plus a single point of origin symbol that is unique to that individual gate. While the &quot;kawoosh&quot; effect in the movie was created by filming the actual swirl of water in a glass tube, and looked like a vortex on the back of the Gate, on the television series this effect was completely created in computer graphics by the Canadian visual effects company Rainmaker.

At the beginning of &quot;SG-1&quot; season 9, the original wormhole-traversal sequence used in the film, and in the series up to that point, was replaced with a new sequence similar to the one already used on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, but blue as it was in the movie and &quot;SG-1&quot;. In &quot;Atlantis&quot;, it is green, and in &quot;Universe&quot;, it is white.

===Reboot===
On September 5, 2013, during an interview with Digital Spy, Emmerich said that he and MGM are planning a new &quot;Stargate&quot; as a reboot with a trilogy. On May 29, 2014, it was announced that MGM and Warner Bros. are partnering together for a reboot as a trilogy with Emmerich directing, Devlin producing, and Nicolas Wright and James A. Woods writing. On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot and a potential new series are stalled. On April 14, 2023, it was announced that MGM were rebooting their film franchises for film and television, including &quot;Stargate&quot;.

<text>Sigismund (variants: Sigmund, Siegmund) is a German proper name, meaning &quot;protection through victory&quot;, from Old High German &quot;sigu&quot; &quot;victory&quot; + &quot;munt&quot; &quot;hand, protection&quot;. Tacitus latinises it &quot;Segimundus&quot;. There appears to be an older form of the High German word &quot;Sieg&quot; (victory): &quot;sigis&quot;, obviously Gothic and an inferred Germanic form, and there is a younger form: &quot;sigi&quot;, which is Old Saxon or Old High German &quot;sigu&quot; (both from about 9th century). A 5th century Prince of Burgundy was known both as &quot;Sigismund&quot; and &quot;Sigimund&quot; (see Ernst Förstemann, &quot;Altdeutsche Personennamen&quot;, 1906; Henning Kaufmann, &quot;Altdeutsche Personennamen&quot;, Ergänzungsband, 1968).
Its Hungarian equivalent is Zsigmond.

A Lithuanian name [[Žygimantas]], meaning &quot;wealth of (military) campaign&quot;, from Lithuanian &quot;žygis&quot; &quot;campaign, march&quot; + &quot;manta&quot; &quot;goods, wealth&quot;, has been a substitution of the name &quot;Sigismund&quot; in the Lithuanian language, from which it was adopted by the Ruthenian language as Жыгімонт (such are the cases of Sigismund Kęstutaitis, Sigismund Korybut, Sigismund I the Old, Sigismund II Augustus). The Polish spelling is [[Zygmunt]], the Czech variant is Zikmund, and the variant used in Slovak and Serbo-Croatian is Žigmund.

<doc id="28329" wikidata="Q37085" url="?curid=28329" title="Solomon">
<text>Solomon (), also called Jedidiah, was the fourth monarch of the Kingdom of Israel and Judah, according to the Hebrew Bible. The successor of his father David, he is described as having been the penultimate ruler of all Twelve Tribes of Israel under an amalgamated Israel and Judah. The hypothesized dates of Solomon&#x27;s reign are from 970 to 931 BCE. According to the biblical narrative, after Solomon&#x27;s death, his son and successor Rehoboam adopted harsh policies towards the northern Israelites, who then rejected the reign of the House of David and sought Jeroboam as their king. In the aftermath of Jeroboam&#x27;s Revolt, the Israelites were split between the Kingdom of Israel in the north (Samaria) and the Kingdom of Judah in the south (Judea); the Bible depicts Rehoboam and the rest of Solomon&#x27;s patrilineal descendants ruling over independent Judah alone.

A Jewish prophet, Solomon is portrayed as wealthy, wise, powerful, and a dedicated follower of Yahweh (God), as attested by the eponymous Solomon&#x27;s Temple, which was the first Temple in Jerusalem. He is also the subject of many later references and legends, most notably in the Testament of Solomon, part of biblical apocrypha from the 1st century CE.

The historicity of Solomon is the subject of significant debate. Current scholarly consensus allows for a historical Solomon, but regards his reign as king over Israel and Judah in the 10th century BCE as uncertain and the biblical portrayal of his apparent empire&#x27;s opulence as most probably an anachronistic exaggeration.

Solomon is also revered in Christianity and Islam. In the New Testament, he is portrayed as a teacher of wisdom, though excelled by Jesus of Nazareth, and as arrayed in glory, but excelled by &quot;the lilies of the field&quot;. In the Quran, he is considered to be a major Islamic prophet. In mostly non-biblical circles, Solomon also came to be known as a magician and an exorcist, with numerous amulets and medallion seals dating from the Hellenistic period invoking his name.

==Biblical account==
The life of Solomon is primarily described in 2Samuel, 1Kings and 2Chronicles. His two names are traditionally taken to mean &quot;peaceful&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both considered &quot;predictive of the character of his reign&quot;. A 2023 textbook described three possibilities for the etymology of Solomon’s name: “compensation or a substitute,” “the ruler of peace,” or based on the deified evening star Shalim.

===Chronology===
The conventional dates of Solomon&#x27;s reign are derived from biblical chronology and are set from about 970 to 931 BCE. Regarding the Davidic dynasty, to which King Solomon belongs, its chronology can be checked against datable Babylonian and Assyrian records at a few points, and these correspondences have allowed archaeologists to date its kings in a modern framework. According to the most widely used chronology, based on that by the Old Testament professor Edwin R. Thiele, the death of Solomon and the division of his kingdom would have occurred in the fall of 931 BCE.

===Childhood===
Solomon was born in Jerusalem, the second-born child of David and his wife Bathsheba (widow of Uriah the Hittite). The first child (unnamed in that account), a son conceived adulterously during Uriah&#x27;s lifetime, had died seven days after birth. It is suggested in Scripture that this was a judgment from God. Solomon had three named full brothers born to Bathsheba: Nathan, Shammua, and Shobab, besides six known older half-brothers born of as many mothers.

The biblical narrative shows that Solomon served as a peace offering between God and David, due to David&#x27;s adulterous relationship with Bathsheba. In an effort to hide this sin, David sent Bathsheba&#x27;s husband, Uriah the Hittite, to battle, and specifically to the front line wherein David ordered the commanding officer Joab to withdraw support for Uriah in order to have him killed in battle by the enemy. After he died, David was finally able to marry Bathsheba. As punishment, the first child, who was conceived during the adulterous relationship, died. Solomon was born after David was forgiven. It is this reason why his name, which means peace, was chosen. Some historians cited that Nathan the Prophet brought up Solomon as his father was busy governing the realm. This could also be attributed to the notion that the prophet held great influence over David because he knew of his adultery, which was considered a grievous offense under the Mosaic Law.

===Succession and administration===
According to the First Book of Kings, when David was old, &quot;he could not get warm&quot;. &quot;So they sought a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunamite, and brought her to the king. The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not.&quot;

While David was in this state, court factions were maneuvering for power. Adonijah, David&#x27;s heir apparent, acted to have himself declared king, but was outmaneuvered by Bathsheba and the biblical prophet Nathan, who convinced David to proclaim Solomon king according to his earlier promise (not recorded elsewhere in the biblical narrative), despite Solomon&#x27;s being younger than his brothers.

Solomon, as instructed by David, began his reign with an extensive purge, including his father&#x27;s chief general, Joab, among others, and further consolidated his position by appointing friends throughout the administration, including in religious positions as well as in civic and military posts. It is said that Solomon ascended to the throne when he was only about fifteen.

Solomon greatly expanded his military strength, especially the cavalry and chariot arms. He founded numerous colonies, some of which doubled as trading posts and military outposts. He also increased the bureaucracy.

Trade relationships were a focus of his administration. In particular he continued his father&#x27;s very profitable relationship with the Phoenician king Hiram I of Tyre (see &#x27;wealth&#x27; below); they sent out joint expeditions to the lands of Tarshish and Ophir to engage in the trade of luxury products, importing gold, silver, sandalwood, pearls, ivory, apes, and peacocks. Solomon is considered the most wealthy of the Israelite kings named in the Bible.

===Wisdom===

Solomon was the biblical king most famous for his wisdom. In 1Kings he sacrificed to God, and God later appeared to him in a dream, asking what Solomon wanted from God. Solomon asked for wisdom in order to better rule and guide his people. Pleased, God personally answered Solomon&#x27;s prayer, promising him great wisdom because he did not ask for self-serving rewards like long life or the death of his enemies.

Perhaps the best known story of his wisdom is the Judgement of Solomon; two women each lay claim to being the mother of the same child. Solomon easily resolved the dispute by commanding the child to be cut in half and shared between the two. One woman promptly renounced her claim, proving that she would rather give the child up than see it killed. Solomon declared the woman who showed compassion to be the true mother, entitled to the whole child.

Solomon has traditionally been considered the author of several biblical books, including Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. He is traditionally ascribed authorship of the Wisdom of Solomon which is included in the Scriptures of the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Church, but is considered apocryphal in Protestant traditions.

===Wealth===

According to the Hebrew Bible, the ancient Kingdom of Israel gained its highest splendour and wealth during Solomon&#x27;s reign of 40 years. In a single year, according to , Solomon collected tribute amounting to 666 talents (18,125 kilograms) of gold. Solomon is described as surrounding himself with all the luxuries and the grandeur of an Eastern monarch, and his government prospered. He entered into an alliance with Hiram I, king of Tyre, who in many ways greatly assisted him in his numerous undertakings.

===Construction projects===
For some years before his death, David was engaged in collecting materials for building a temple in Jerusalem as a permanent home for Yahweh and the Ark of the Covenant. Solomon is described as undertaking the construction of the temple, with the help of an architect, also named Hiram, and other materials, sent from King Hiram of Tyre.

After the completion of the temple, Solomon is described in the biblical narrative as erecting many other buildings of importance in Jerusalem. For 13 years, he was engaged in the building of a royal palace on Ophel (a hilly promontory in central Jerusalem). This complex included buildings referred to as:
:The House (or Hall) of the Forest of Lebanon
:The Hall or Porch of Pillars
:The Hall of the Throne or the Hall of Justice as well as his own residence and a residence for his wife, Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter.
Solomon&#x27;s throne is said to have been spectacularly opulent and possessed moving parts, making it one of the earliest mechanical devices in history. It is said that &quot;Nothing like it (the throne) had ever been made for any other kingdom.&quot; Solomon also constructed great water works for the city, and the Millo (Septuagint, &quot;Acra&quot;) for the defense of the city. However, excavations of Jerusalem have discovered no monumental architecture from the era, and no remains of either the Temple or Solomon&#x27;s palace have been found.

Solomon is also described as rebuilding cities elsewhere in Israel, creating the port of Ezion-Geber, and constructing Palmyra in the wilderness as a commercial depot and military outpost. Although the location of the port of Ezion-Geber is known, no remains have ever been found. More archaeological success has been achieved with the major cities Solomon is said to have strengthened or rebuilt, for example, Hazor, Megiddo and Gezer. These all have substantial ancient remains, including impressive six-chambered gates, and ashlar palaces; however it is no longer the scholarly consensus that these structures date to the time, according to the Bible, when Solomon ruled.

According to the Bible, during Solomon&#x27;s reign, Israel enjoyed great commercial prosperity, with extensive traffic being carried on by land with Tyre, Egypt, and Arabia, and by sea with Tarshish, Ophir, and South India.

===Wives and concubines===

According to the biblical account, Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines. The wives were described as foreign princesses, including Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter and women of Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon and of the Hittites. His marriage to Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter appears to have cemented a political alliance with Egypt, whereas he clung to his other wives and concubines &quot;in love&quot;. The only wife mentioned by name is Naamah the Ammonite, mother of Solomon&#x27;s successor, Rehoboam.

The biblical narrative notes with disapproval that Solomon permitted his foreign wives to import their national deities, building temples to Ashtoreth and Milcom.

In the branch of literary analysis that examines the Bible, called higher criticism, the story of Solomon falling into idolatry by the influence of Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter and his other foreign wives is &quot;customarily seen as the handiwork of the &#x27;deuteronomistic historian(s)&#x27;&quot;, who are held to have written, compiled, or edited texts to legitimize the reforms of Hezekiah&#x27;s great-grandson, King Josiah who reigned from about 641 to 609 BCE (over 280 years after Solomon&#x27;s death according to Bible scholars). Scholarly consensus in this field holds that &quot;Solomon&#x27;s wives/women were introduced in the &#x27;Josianic&#x27; (customarily Dtr) edition of Kings as a theological construct to blame the schism [between Judah and the Northern Kingdom of Israel] on his misdeeds&quot;.

===Relationship with Queen of Sheba===
In a brief, unelaborated, and enigmatic passage, the Hebrew Bible describes how the fame of Solomon&#x27;s wisdom and wealth reached even the far-off Queen of Sheba. The queen is described as visiting with gifts including gold, spices and precious stones. When Solomon gave her &quot;all her desire, whatsoever she asked&quot;, she left satisfied.

Whether the passage is simply to provide a brief foreign witness of Solomon&#x27;s wealth and wisdom, or whether the visit is meant to have more significance, is unknown; nevertheless the Queen of Sheba has become the subject of numerous stories.

Sheba is typically identified as Saba, a nation once spanning the Red Sea on the coasts of what are now Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia and Yemen, in Arabia Felix; although other sources place it in the area of what is now northern Ethiopia and Eritrea.

In a Rabbinical account (e.g. Targum Sheni, ), Solomon was accustomed to ordering animals to dance before him (a power granted by God), and upon summoning the mountain-cock or hoopoe (Aramaic name: &quot;nagar tura&quot;), the bird told him it had discovered a land in the east, rich in gold, silver, and plants, whose capital was called &quot;Kitor&quot; and whose ruler was the Queen of Sheba. Solomon then sent the bird to request the queen&#x27;s visit.

An Ethiopian account from the 14th century (&quot;Kebra Nagast&quot;) maintains that the Queen of Sheba had sexual relations with King Solomon and gave birth beside the Mai Bella stream in the province of Hamasien, Eritrea. The Ethiopian tradition has a detailed account of the affair. The child was a son who became Menelik I, King of Axum, and founded a dynasty that would reign as the Jewish, then Christian, Empire of Ethiopia which lasted 2900 years until Haile Selassie was overthrown in 1974. Menelik was said to be a practicing Jew who was given a replica of the Ark of the Covenant by King Solomon; and, moreover, that the original Ark was switched and went to Axum with him and his mother, and is still there, guarded by a single dedicated priest.

The claim of such a lineage and of possession of the Ark was an important source of legitimacy and prestige for the Ethiopian monarchy through the centuries, and had important and lasting effects on Ethiopian culture. The Ethiopian government and church deny all requests to view the alleged ark.

Some classical-era Rabbis, attacking Solomon&#x27;s moral character, have claimed instead that the child was an ancestor of Nebuchadnezzar II, who destroyed Solomon&#x27;s temple some 300 years later.

===Sins and punishment===

Jewish scribes say that Solomon&#x27;s teacher was Shimei ben Gera, and while he lived, he prevented Solomon from marrying foreign wives. The Talmud says at Ber. 8a: &quot;For as long as Shimei the son of Gera was alive Solomon did not marry the daughter of Pharaoh&quot; (see also Midrash Tehillim to Ps. 3:1). Solomon&#x27;s execution of Shimei was his first descent into sin.

According to 1 Kings 11:4, Solomon&#x27;s &quot;wives turned his heart after other gods&quot;, their own national deities, to whom Solomon built temples, thus incurring divine anger and retribution in the form of the division of the kingdom after Solomon&#x27;s death.
1 Kings 11 describes Solomon&#x27;s descent into idolatry, particularly his turning after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom, the god of the Ammonites. In Deuteronomy 17:16-17, a king is commanded not to multiply horses or wives, neither greatly multiply to himself gold or silver. Solomon sinned in all three of these areas. In addition to his wives, he collected 666 talents of gold each year, a huge amount for a small nation like Israel. He gathered multitudes of horses and chariots from as far as Egypt, and as Deuteronomy warns, took Israel back to Egypt in spirit.

According to 1 Kings 11:30–34 and 1 Kings 11:9-13, it was because of these sins that the Lord punished Solomon by removing most of the tribes of Israel from rule by Solomon&#x27;s house.
===Enemies===

Near the end of his life, Solomon was beset by several enemies, including Hadad of Edom, Rezon of Zobah, and his own official Jeroboam of the tribe of Ephraim.

===Death, succession of Rehoboam, and kingdom division===

King Solomon is a central biblical figure, who, according to the Hebrew Bible, was the builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem and the last ruler of the united Kingdom of Israel. After a reign of forty years (1 Kings 11:42), he died of natural causes, at around 55 years of age.

Upon Solomon&#x27;s death, his son, Rehoboam, succeeded him, but ten of the Tribes of Israel refused him as king, splitting the monarchy into the northern Kingdom of Israel under Jeroboam, while Rehoboam continued to reign over the smaller southern Kingdom of Judah. Henceforth the two kingdoms were never again united.

Solomon is associated with the peak &quot;golden age&quot; of the independent Kingdom of Israel and is a legendary source of judicial and religious wisdom.

According to Jewish tradition, King Solomon wrote three books of the Bible:
* &quot;Mishlei&quot; (Book of Proverbs), a collection of fables and wisdom of life. 
* &quot;Kohelet&quot; (Ecclesiastes), a book of contemplation and self-reflection.
* &quot;Shir ha-Shirim&quot; (Song of Songs), a collection of erotic verse. The verse has been interpreted both literally (describing a romantic and sexual relationship between a man and a woman) and metaphorically (describing a relationship between God and his people).

The Hebrew word appears in the title of two hymns (72 and 127) in the Psalms. This Hebrew word means &quot;to Solomon&quot;, but it can also be translated as &quot;by Solomon&quot;, thus suggesting to some that Solomon wrote the two psalms.

==Apocryphal or deuterocanonical texts==

Rabbinical tradition attributes the &quot;Book of Wisdom&quot; (included within the Septuagint) to Solomon, although this book was probably written in the 2nd century BCE. In this work, Solomon is portrayed as an astronomer. Other books of wisdom poetry such as the &quot;Odes of Solomon&quot; and the &quot;Psalms of Solomon&quot; also bear his name. The Jewish historian Eupolemus, who wrote about 157 BCE, included copies of apocryphal letters exchanged between Solomon and the kings of Egypt and Tyre.

The Gnostic &quot;Apocalypse of Adam&quot;, which may date to the 1st or 2nd century, refers to a legend in which Solomon sends out an army of demons to seek a virgin who had fled from him, perhaps the earliest surviving mention of the later common tale that Solomon controlled demons and made them his slaves. This tradition of Solomon&#x27;s control over demons appears fully elaborated in the early pseudoepigraphical work called the &quot;Testament of Solomon&quot; with its elaborate and grotesque demonology.

==Historicity==

As with most biblical personages in the middle era of Israelite society, the historicity of Solomon is hotly debated. Current consensus states that regardless of whether or not a man named Solomon truly reigned as king over the Judean hills in the tenth century BCE, the biblical description of his apparent empire&#x27;s lavishness is almost surely an anachronistic exaggeration.

As for Solomon himself, scholars on both the maximalist and minimalist sides of the spectrum of biblical archeology generally agree that he probably existed. However, a historically accurate picture of the Davidic king is difficult to construct. According to some archaeologists, Solomon could have only been the monarch or chieftain of Judah, and that the northern kingdom was a separate development. Such positions have been criticized by other archaeologists and scholars, who argue that a united monarchy did exist in the 10th century BCE, while agreeing that the biblical account contains exaggerations.

===Arguments against biblical description===
Historical evidence of King Solomon other than the biblical accounts has been so minimal that some scholars have understood the period of his reign as a &#x27;Dark Age&#x27; (Muhly 1998). The first-century Romano-Jewish scholar Josephus in &quot;Against Apion&quot;, citing Tyrian court records and Menander, gives a specific year during which King Hiram I of Tyre sent materials to Solomon for the construction of the Temple. However, no material evidence indisputably of Solomon&#x27;s reign has been found. Yigael Yadin&#x27;s excavations at Hazor, Megiddo, Beit Shean and Gezer uncovered structures that he and others have argued date from Solomon&#x27;s reign, but others, such as Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman, argue that they should be dated to the Omride period, more than a century after Solomon.

According to Finkelstein and Silberman, authors of &quot;The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology&#x27;s New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts&quot;, at the time of the kingdoms of David and Solomon, Jerusalem was populated by only a few hundred residents or less, which is insufficient for an empire stretching from the Euphrates to Eilath. According to &quot;The Bible Unearthed&quot;, archaeological evidence suggests that the kingdom of Israel at the time of Solomon was little more than a small city state, and so it is implausible that Solomon received tribute as large as 666 talents of gold per year. Although both Finkelstein and Silberman accept that David and Solomon were real inhabitants of Judah about the 10th century BCE, they claim that the earliest independent reference to the Kingdom of Israel is about 890 BCE, and for Judah about 750 BCE. They suggest that because of religious prejudice, the authors of the Bible suppressed the achievements of the Omrides (whom the Hebrew Bible describes as being polytheist), and instead pushed them back to a supposed golden age of Judaism and monotheists, and devotees of Yahweh. Some Biblical minimalists like Thomas L. Thompson go further, arguing that Jerusalem became a city and capable of being a state capital only in the mid-7th century. Likewise, Finkelstein and others consider the claimed size of Solomon&#x27;s temple implausible.

===Arguments in favour of biblical description===
André Lemaire states in &quot;Ancient Israel: From Abraham to the Roman Destruction of the Temple&quot; that the principal points of the biblical tradition of Solomon are generally trustworthy, although elsewhere he writes that he could find no substantiating archaeological evidence that supports the Queen of Sheba&#x27;s visit to king Solomon, saying that the earliest records of trans-Arabian caravan voyages from Tayma and Sheba unto the Middle-Euphrates etc. occurred in the mid-8th century BCE, placing a possible visit from the Queen of Sheba to Jerusalem around this time—some 250 years later than the timeframe traditionally given for king Solomon&#x27;s reign. Seventeen years later, traces of cinnamon were found in Phoenician clay flasks from three small sites in the Israeli coastal plain dating from the 10th century BCE. The authors suggested that trade routes with South Asia existed much earlier than previously thought.

Kenneth Kitchen argues that Solomon ruled over a comparatively wealthy &quot;mini-empire&quot;, rather than a small city-state, and considers 666 gold talents a modest amount of money. Kitchen calculates that over 30 years, such a kingdom might have accumulated up to 500 tons of gold, which is small compared to other examples, such as the 1,180 tons of gold that Alexander the Great took from Susa. Similarly, Kitchen and others consider the temple of Solomon a reasonable and typically sized structure for the region at the time. Dever states &quot;that we now have direct Bronze and Iron Age parallels for every feature of the &#x27;Solomonic temple&#x27; as described in the Hebrew Bible&quot;.

===Middle way===

Some scholars have charted a middle path between minimalist scholars like Finkelstein, Silberman, and Philip Davies (who believes that &quot;Solomon is a totally invented character&quot;) and maximalist scholars like Lemaire and Kitchen. For instance, the archaeologist Avraham Faust has argued that biblical depictions of Solomon date to later periods and do overstate his wealth, buildings, and kingdom, but that Solomon did have an acropolis and ruled over a polity larger than Jerusalem. In particular, his archaeological research in regions near Jerusalem, like Sharon, finds commerce too great not to be supported by a polity and such regions probably were ruled loosely by Jerusalem. Scholars like Lester Grabbe also believe that there must have been a ruler in Jerusalem during this period and that he likely built a temple, although the town was quite small. William G. Dever argues that Solomon only reigned over Israel and did build a temple, but that descriptions of his lavishness and the other conquests are strongly exaggerated.

===Archaeology===
====General observations====

The archaeological remains that are considered to date from the time of Solomon are notable for the fact that Canaanite material culture appears to have continued unabated; there is a distinct lack of magnificent empire, or cultural development. Indeed, comparing pottery from areas traditionally assigned to Israel with that of the Philistines points to the latter having been significantly more sophisticated. However, there is a lack of physical evidence of its existence, despite some archaeological work in the area. This is not unexpected because the area was devastated by the Babylonians, then rebuilt and destroyed several times.

In 2014, professor of anthropology Jimmy Hardin and his team discovered six official clay 
bullae seals at a site east of Gaza called Khirbet Summeily. He states that these bullae are associated with an Iron Age IIA political entity typified by elite activities dated to the 10th century BCE. The bullae appear to be the only known examples that date to this period. In his view, this lends general support to the historical veracity of David and Solomon as recorded in the Hebrew biblical texts.

====Temple Mount in Jerusalem====
Little archaeological excavation has been done around the area known as the Temple Mount, in what is thought to be the foundation of Solomon&#x27;s Temple, because attempts to do so are met with protests by Muslim authorities of the Jerusalem Waqf.

====Precious metals from Tarshish====

The biblical passages that understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon&#x27;s great wealth in metals—especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27)—were linked to archaeological evidence from silver-hoards found in Phoenicia in 2013. The metals from Tarshish were reportedly obtained by Solomon in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23) and the fleets of Tarshish and ships that sailed in their service. The silver hoards provide the first recognized material evidence that agrees with the ancient texts concerning Solomon&#x27;s kingdom and his wealth (see &#x27;Wealth&#x27; above).

Possible evidence for the described wealth of Solomon and his kingdom was discovered in ancient silver hoards, which were found in Israel and Phoenicia and recognized for their importance in 2003. The evidence from the hoards shows that the Levant was a center of wealth in precious metals during the reigns of Solomon and Hiram, and matches the texts that say the trade extended from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean.

==== Cabul ====
The distribution of fortified cities between Phoenicia and Galilee in Iron Age IIA (10th-9th century BCE) provides context on Solomon&#x27;s sale of territory to Hiram, which he derided as &quot;Cabul&quot; (i.e. &quot;good for nothing&quot;). Kyle H. Keimer argues that they reflected Solomon&#x27;s apathy to the tribe of Asher, who lived in Phoenicia, or his strategic thinking, where these cities served as defense barriers against foreign invasions. When it came to national defense, Near Eastern states did not rely on walls. Instead, they guarded resources, which they prioritized over the people. In addition, it revealed Solomon&#x27;s political upper hand over Hiram. These events were subsequently preserved in sources, which a Deuteronomistic historian relied on when writing 1 Kings 9:11-14.

===Biblical criticism: Solomon&#x27;s religiosity===

From a critical point of view, Solomon&#x27;s building of a temple for Yahweh should not be considered an act of particular devotion to Yahweh because Solomon is also described as building places of worship for a number of other deities. Some scholars and historians argue that the passages, such as his dedication prayer (), that describe Solomon&#x27;s apparent initial devotion to Yahweh were written much later, after Jerusalem had become the religious centre of the kingdom, replacing locations such as Shiloh and Bethel. Earlier historians maintain that there is evidence that these passages in Kings are derived from official court records at the time of Solomon and from other writings of that time that were incorporated into the canonical books of Kings. More recent scholars believe that passages such as these in the Books of Kings were not written by the same authors who wrote the rest of the text, instead probably by the Deuteronomist.

==Religious views==
===Judaism===

King Solomon sinned by acquiring many foreign wives and horses because he thought he knew the reason for the biblical prohibition and thought it did not apply to him. When King Solomon married Pharaoh&#x27;s daughter, a sandbank formed which eventually formed the &quot;great nation of Rome&quot;—the nation that destroyed Herod&#x27;s Temple. Solomon gradually lost more and more prestige until he became like a commoner. Some say he regained his status while others say he did not. In the end, however, he is regarded as a righteous king and is especially praised for his diligence in building the Temple.

Adin Steinsaltz reads Solomon&#x27;s wisdom as &quot;realpolitik&quot;. His geopolitical success possible only by paying lip service to idolatrous practices without actually believing in them. This, unfortunately, set a terrible example for his subjects. Solomon assumed incorrectly that ordinary people would be as wise as himself and keep idolatry at arm&#x27;s length.

King Josiah was also said to have had the Ark of the Covenant, Aaron&#x27;s rod, vial of manna and the anointing oil placed within a hidden chamber which had been built by Solomon.

The &quot;Seder Olam Rabbah&quot; holds that Solomon&#x27;s reign was not in 1000 BCE, but rather in the ninth century BCE, during which time he built the First Temple in 832 BCE. However, &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; of 1906 gives the more common date of &quot;971 to 931 BCE&quot;.

===Christianity===

Christianity has traditionally accepted the historical existence of Solomon, though some modern Christian scholars have also questioned at least his authorship of those biblical texts ascribed to him. Such disputes tend to divide Christians into traditionalist and modernist camps.

Of the two genealogies of Jesus given in the Gospels, Matthew mentions Solomon, but Luke does not. Some commentators see this as an issue that can be reconciled while others disagree. For instance, it has been suggested that Matthew is using Joseph&#x27;s genealogy and Luke is using Mary&#x27;s, but Darrell Bock states that this would be unprecedented, &quot;especially when no other single woman appears in the line&quot;. Other suggestions include the use by one of the royal and the other of the natural line, one using the legal line and the other the physical line, or that Joseph was adopted.

Jesus refers to Solomon, using him for comparison in his admonition against worrying about life. This account is recorded in Matthew 6:29 and the parallel passage in Luke 12:27.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Solomon is commemorated as a saint, with the title of &quot;Righteous Prophet and King&quot;. His feast day is celebrated on the Sunday of the Holy Forefathers (two Sundays before the Great Feast of the Nativity of the Lord).

The staunchly Catholic King Philip II of Spain sought to model himself after King Solomon. Statues of King David and Solomon stand on either side of the entrance to the basilica of El Escorial, Philip&#x27;s palace, and Solomon is also depicted in a great fresco at the center of El Escorial&#x27;s library. Philip identified the warrior-king David with his own father Charles V, and himself sought to emulate the thoughtful and logical character which he perceived in Solomon. Moreover, the structure of the Escorial was inspired by that of Solomon&#x27;s Temple.

===Islam===

In Islam, Solomon is also known as Sulaimān ibn Dāwūd, and is considered a prophet and a messenger of God, as well as a divinely appointed monarch. Solomon inherited his position from his father as the prophetic King of the Israelites. Unlike in the Bible, according to Muslim tradition Solomon never participated in idolatry.

The Quran ascribes to Solomon a great level of wisdom, knowledge and power. He knew the language of the birds ().

Solomon was also known in Islam to have other supernatural abilities bestowed upon him by God, like controlling the wind, ruling over the jinn, enslaving divs, and hearing the communication of ants:


The Quran says:

The Quran makes a reference to a &quot;puppet&quot; posing as Solomon in exegetical literature understood as a jinni or demon, who escaped captivity and took over his kingdom. Solomon&#x27;s loss of his throne to the demons has been understood in Islamic spirituality to represent a human losing its soul to demonic passion. Attar of Nishapur writes: &quot;If you bind the &quot;div&quot; (demon), you will set out for the royal pavilion with Solomon&quot; and &quot;You have no command over your self&#x27;s kingdom, for in your case the &quot;div&quot; is in the place of Solomon&quot;.

Solomon&#x27;s gifts are often used allegorically in popular literature. The demons taking over Solomon&#x27;s kingdom mirrors the Sufi concept of the mind giving in to evil urges. The ant is depicted as a wise creature, revealing to Solomon the reason behind his gift to control the wind and his name.

During the Islamization of Iran, Solomon became merged with Jamshid, a great king from Persian mythology, about who similar attributes are ascribed to.

===Baháʼí Faith===
In the Baháʼí Faith, Solomon is regarded as one of the lesser prophets along with David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, along with others. Baháʼís see Solomon as a prophet who was sent by God to address the issues of his time. Baha&#x27;ullah wrote about Solomon in the &quot;Hidden Words&quot;. He also mentions Solomon in the &quot;Tablet of Wisdom&quot;, where he is depicted as a contemporary of Pythagoras.

==Legends==
===&quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;===

A well-known story in the collection &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; describes a genie who had displeased King Solomon and was punished by being locked in a bottle and thrown into the sea. Since the bottle was sealed with Solomon&#x27;s seal, the genie was helpless to free himself, until he was freed many centuries later by a fisherman who discovered the bottle. In other stories from the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;, protagonists who had to leave their homeland and travel to the unknown places of the world saw signs which proved that Solomon had already been there. Sometimes, protagonists discovered words of Solomon that were intended to help those who were lost and had unluckily reached those forbidden and deserted places.

===Angels and magic===

According to Rabbinic literature, on account of his modest request for wisdom only, Solomon was rewarded with riches and an unprecedented glorious realm, which extended over the upper world inhabited by the angels and over the whole of the terrestrial globe with all its inhabitants, including all the beasts, fowl, and reptiles, as well as the demons and spirits. His control over the demons, spirits, and animals augmented his splendor, the demons bringing him precious stones, besides water from distant countries to irrigate his exotic plants. The beasts and fowl of their own accord entered the kitchen of Solomon&#x27;s palace, so that they might be used as food for him, and extravagant meals for him were prepared daily by each of his 700 wives and 300 concubines, with the thought that perhaps the king would feast that day in her house.

====Seal of Solomon====

The Seal of Solomon is the legendary signet ring attributed to Solomon in medieval mystical traditions, from which it developed in parallel within Jewish mysticism, Islamic mysticism and Western occultism. It is the predecessor to the Star of David, the contemporary cultural and religious symbol of the Jewish people. It was often depicted in the shape of either a pentagram or a hexagram. In religious lore, the ring is described as having given Solomon the power to command the supernatural and also the ability to speak with animals. Due to the proverbial wisdom of Solomon, it came to be seen as an amulet or talisman, or a symbol or character in medieval magic and Renaissance magic, occultism, and alchemy.

====Solomon and Asmodeus====

One legend concerning Asmodeus (see: ) goes on to state that Solomon one day asked Asmodeus what could make demons powerful over man, and Asmodeus asked to be freed and given the ring so that he could demonstrate; Solomon agreed but Asmodeus threw the ring into the sea and it was swallowed by a fish. Asmodeus then swallowed the king, stood up fully with one wing touching heaven and the other earth, and spat out Solomon to a distance of 400 miles. The Rabbis claim this was a divine punishment for Solomon&#x27;s having failed to follow three divine commands, and Solomon was forced to wander from city to city, until he eventually arrived in an Ammonite city where he was forced to work in the king&#x27;s kitchens. Solomon gained a chance to prepare a meal for the Ammonite king, which the king found so impressive that the previous cook was sacked and Solomon put in his place; the king&#x27;s daughter, Naamah, subsequently fell in love with Solomon, but the family (thinking Solomon a commoner) disapproved, so the king decided to kill them both by sending them into the desert. Solomon and the king&#x27;s daughter wandered the desert until they reached a coastal city, where they bought a fish to eat, which just happened to be the one which had swallowed the magic ring. Solomon was then able to regain his throne and expel Asmodeus. The element of a ring thrown into the sea and found back in a fish&#x27;s belly also appeared in Herodotus&#x27; account of Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos (c. 538–522 BCE).

In another familiar version of the legend of the Seal of Solomon, Asmodeus disguises himself. In some myths, he&#x27;s disguised as King Solomon himself. The concealed Asmodeus tells travelers who have ventured up to King Solomon&#x27;s grand lofty palace that the Seal of Solomon was thrown into the sea. He then convinces them to plunge in and attempt to retrieve it, for if they do they would take the throne as king.

====Artifacts====

Other magical items attributed to Solomon are his key and his Table. The latter was said to be held in Toledo in Visigothic Spain and was part of the loot taken by Tariq ibn Ziyad during the Muslim conquest of Spain according to ibn Abd al-Hakam&#x27;s &quot;History of the Conquest of Spain&quot;. The former appears in the title of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, a Christian grimoire whose framing story is Solomon capturing demons using his ring, and forcing them to explain themselves to him.

In &quot;The Book of Deadly Names&quot;, purportedly translated from Arabic manuscripts found hidden in a building in Spain, the &quot;King of the Jinn&quot; Fiqiṭush brings 72 jinn before King Solomon to confess their corruptions and places of residence. Fiqitush tells King Solomon the recipes for curing such corruptions as each evil jinn confesses.

====Angels====

Angels also helped Solomon in building the Temple, though not by choice. The edifice was, according to rabbinical legend, miraculously constructed throughout, the large heavy stones rising and settling in their respective places of themselves. The general opinion of the Rabbis is that Solomon hewed the stones by means of a &quot;shamir&quot;, a mythical worm whose mere touch cleft rocks. According to Midrash Tehillim, the shamir was brought from paradise by Solomon&#x27;s eagle; but most of the rabbis state that Solomon was informed of the worm&#x27;s haunts by Asmodeus. The shamir had been entrusted by the prince of the sea to the mountain rooster alone, and the rooster had sworn to guard it well, but Solomon&#x27;s men found the bird&#x27;s nest, and covered it with glass. When the bird returned, it used the shamir to break the glass, whereupon the men scared the bird, causing it to drop the worm, which the men could then bring to Solomon.

====In the Kabbalah====

Early adherents of the Kabbalah portray Solomon as having sailed through the air on a throne of light placed on an eagle, which brought him near the heavenly gates as well as to the dark mountains behind which the fallen angels &quot;Uzza&quot; and &quot;Azzazel&quot; were chained; the eagle would rest on the chains, and Solomon, using the magic ring, would compel the two angels to reveal every mystery he desired to know.

====The palace without entrance====

According to one legend, while traveling magically, Solomon noticed a magnificent palace to which there appeared to be no entrance. He ordered the demons to climb to the roof and see if they could discover any living being within the building but they found only an eagle, which said that it was 700 years old, but that it had never seen an entrance. An elder brother of the eagle, 900 years old, was then found, but it also did not know the entrance. The eldest brother of these two birds, which was 1,300 years old, then declared it had been informed by its father that the door was on the west side, but that it had become hidden by sand drifted by the wind. Having discovered the entrance, Solomon found an idol inside that had in its mouth a silver tablet saying in Greek (a language not thought by modern scholars to have existed 1000 years before the time of Solomon) that the statue was of &quot;Shaddad, the son of &#x27;Ad&quot;, and that it had &quot;reigned over a million cities, rode on a million horses, had under it a million vassals and slew a million warriors&quot;, yet it could not resist the angel of death.

===Throne===

Solomon&#x27;s throne is described at length in Targum Sheni, which is compiled from three different sources, and in two later Midrash. According to these, there were on the steps of the throne twelve golden lions, each facing a golden eagle. There were six steps to the throne, on which animals, all of gold, were arranged in the following order: on the first step a lion opposite an ox; on the second, a wolf opposite a sheep; on the third, a tiger opposite a camel; on the fourth, an eagle opposite a peacock, on the fifth, a cat opposite a cock; on the sixth, a sparrow-hawk opposite a dove. On the top of the throne was a dove holding a sparrow-hawk in its claws, symbolizing the dominion of Israel over the Gentiles. The first midrash claims that six steps were constructed because Solomon foresaw that six kings would sit on the throne, namely, Solomon, Rehoboam, Hezekiah, Manasseh, Amon, and Josiah. There was also on the top of the throne a golden candelabrum, on the seven branches of the one side of which were engraved the names of the seven patriarchs Adam, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Job, and on the seven of the other the names of Levi, Kohath, Amram, Moses, Aaron, Eldad, Medad, and, in addition, Hur (another version has Haggai). Above the candelabrum was a golden jar filled with olive oil and beneath it a golden basin which supplied the jar with oil and on which the names of Nadab, Abihu, and Eli and his two sons were engraved. Over the throne, twenty-four vines were fixed to cast a shadow on the king&#x27;s head.

By a mechanical contrivance the throne followed Solomon wherever he wished to go. Supposedly, due to another mechanical trick, when the king reached the first step, the ox stretched forth its leg, on which Solomon leaned, a similar action taking place in the case of the animals on each of the six steps. From the sixth step the eagles raised the king and placed him in his seat, near which a golden serpent lay coiled. When the king was seated the large eagle placed the crown on his head, the serpent uncoiled itself, and the lions and eagles moved upward to form a shade over him. The dove then descended, took the scroll of the Law from the Ark, and placed it on Solomon&#x27;s knees. When the king sat, surrounded by the Sanhedrin, to judge the people, the wheels began to turn, and the beasts and fowls began to utter their respective cries, which frightened those who had intended to bear false testimony. Moreover, while Solomon was ascending the throne, the lions scattered various fragrant spices. After Solomon&#x27;s death, Pharaoh Shishak, when taking away the treasures of the Temple (I Kings xiv. 26), carried off the throne, which remained in Egypt until Sennacherib conquered that country. After Sennacherib&#x27;s fall Hezekiah gained possession of it, but when Josiah was slain by Pharaoh Necho, the latter took it away. However, according to rabbinical accounts, Necho did not know how the mechanism worked and so accidentally struck himself with one of the lions causing him to become lame; Nebuchadnezzar, into whose possession the throne subsequently came, shared a similar fate. The throne then passed to the Persians, whose king Darius was the first to sit successfully on Solomon&#x27;s throne after his death; subsequently the throne came into the possession of the Greeks and Ahasuerus.

==Freemasonry==

Masonic rituals refer to King Solomon and the building of his Temple. Masonic Temples, where a Masonic Lodge meets, are an allegorical reference to King Solomon&#x27;s Temple.

==Places==
The Solomon Islands, a country and archipelago in Melanesia, were named for King Solomon by the Spanish navigator Álvaro de Mendaña, who became the first European to see the islands in 1568.

==In literature, art, and music==

===Literature===

* In H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885) the protagonists discover multiple settings said to have belonged to or to have been built at the request of King Solomon, such as &#x27;Solomon&#x27;s Great Road&#x27; and the mines themselves. Also, the two mountains which form the entrance to Kukuana Land (where the mines are located in the novel) are referred to as &#x27;Sheba&#x27;s Breasts&#x27; which could be an allusion to the Queen of Sheba, with whom King Solomon had a relationship, or Solomon&#x27;s mother, who was named Bathsheba. When in the mines, the characters also contemplate what must have occurred to prevent King Solomon from returning to retrieve the massive amounts of diamonds, gold and ivory tusks that were found buried in his great &#x27;Treasure Chamber&#x27;.
* In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, the spirit of Solomon appears to Dante Alighieri in the Heaven of the Sun with other exemplars of inspired wisdom.
* In Friedrich Dürrenmatt&#x27;s &quot;The Physicists&quot;, the physicist Möbius claims that Solomon appears to him and dictates the &quot;theory of all possible inventions&quot; (based on &quot;unified field theory&quot;).
* Solomon appears in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Just So Stories&quot;.
* O. Henry&#x27;s short story &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; (1905) contains the following description to convey the preciousness of character Jim Dillingham Young&#x27;s pocket watch: &quot;Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.&quot;
* In Neal Stephenson&#x27;s three-volume &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;, 17th-century alchemists like Isaac Newton believe that Solomon created a kind of &quot;heavier&quot; gold with mystical properties and that it was cached in the Solomon Islands where it was accidentally discovered by the crew of a wayward Spanish galleon. In the third volume of &quot;The Baroque Cycle, The System of the World&quot;, a mysterious member of the entourage of tsar Peter the Great, named &quot;Solomon Kohan&quot; appears in early 18th-century London. The czar, traveling incognito to purchase English-made ships for his navy, explains that he added him to his court after the Sack of Azov, where Kohan had been a guest of the Pasha. Solomon Kohan is later revealed as one of the extremely long-lived &quot;Wise,&quot; such as Enoch Root, and compares a courtyard full of inventors&#x27; workstations to &quot;an operation I used to have in Jerusalem a long time ago&quot;, denominating either facility as &quot;a temple&quot;. Stephenson&#x27;s sequel to &quot;Reamde&quot;, 2019&#x27;s &quot;Fall; or, Dodge in Hell&quot; was also a surprise sequel to the Baroque Cycle novels and &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;. In the mid- to late-21st century span of &quot;Fall&quot;, Solomon Kohan has joined the faculty of Princeton University, going by &quot;Solly Pesador,&quot; and is described by a student as &quot;one of those guys who had &quot;been around forever&quot; and played roles in tech companies going at least as far back as Hewlett-Packard&quot; and as an &quot;old-school tech geek turned neuro-hacker&quot;.
* In &quot;The Ring of Solomon&quot;, both King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba are featured prominently.
* Solomon, King of Urushalim, is a significant character in &quot;The Shadow Prince&quot;, the first novel of Philip Armstrong&#x27;s epic historical fantasy, &quot;The Chronicles of Tupiluliuma&quot;.

He uses it to summon a daemon army, thereafter called the Cohort of Free Daemons, to oppose the forces of the Chaos God, Sutekh, thus allowing the young Hittite musician, Lisarwa, to repair the Veil that separates the physical world from the dangerous wild energies of the Netherworld, using another of the relics, the Harp of Daud, once owned by his father (King David). Solomon&#x27;s son, Rehoboam also appears in a minor capacity.
* In the Japanese manga series &quot;&quot;, Solomon was a powerful magician who united all of the world under his peaceful rule. However, when this world was destroyed by a calamity, he created the world &quot;Magi&quot; is set in and saved mankind by sending them there. A special power originated from him, the &quot;Wisdom of Solomon&quot;, allows the main character Aladdin to talk directly with the soul of a person, alive or dead.
* In the manga &quot;Devils and Realist&quot;, Solomon is a friend of Lucifer and is the &quot;Elector&quot;—the one who can choose the interim ruler over Hell as its emperor rests to regain his strength and had powers over demons known as his seventy-two pillars. He&#x27;s also known as the one who can control Hell or Heaven with the power of his ring.
* Chapter 14 of the &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; ends with Huck and Jim debating over how wise Solomon really was.
* In Francis Bacon&#x27;s Essay &#x27;Of Revenge&#x27;, Solomon is paraphrased: &quot;And Solomon, I am sure, saith, It is the glory of a man, to pass by an offence.&quot;
* In DC Comics, Solomon is one of the Immortal Elders of the hero Captain Marvel.
* In a subject called in art the &quot;Idolatry of Solomon&quot;, the foreign wives are depicted as leading Solomon away from Yahweh toward idolatry because they worshiped gods other than Yahweh (). This forms part of the Power of Women topos in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, showing the dangers women posed to even the most virtuous men.
* Naamah, a princess of Ammon (now in Jordan) who arrives in Jerusalem at age fourteen to marry King Solomon and tells of their life together, is the narrator of Aryeh Lev Stollman&#x27;s novel &quot;Queen of Jerusalem&quot;, which was published in 2020 by Aryeh Nir/Modan (Tel Aviv) in Hebrew translation under the title &quot;Divrei Y&#x27;mai Naamah&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

<doc id="28330" wikidata="Q28730" url="?curid=28330" title="Saul">
<text>Saul (; , ; , ; ) was a monarch of ancient Israel and Judah and, according to the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament, the first king of the United Monarchy, a polity of uncertain historicity. His reign, traditionally placed in the late eleventh century BCE, supposedly marked the transition of the Israelites from a scattered tribal society ruled by various judges to organized statehood.

The historicity of Saul and the United Kingdom of Israel is not universally accepted, as what is known of both comes exclusively from the Hebrew Bible. According to the text, he was anointed as king of the Israelites by Samuel, and reigned from Gibeah. Saul is said to have committed suicide when he fell on his sword during a battle with the Philistines at Mount Gilboa, in which three of his sons were also killed. Saul&#x27;s son Ish-bosheth succeeded him to the throne, reigning for only two years before being murdered by his own military leaders. Saul&#x27;s son-in-law David then became king.

The biblical narrative of Saul&#x27;s rise to kingship and his death contains several textual inconsistencies and plays on words that scholars have discussed. These issues include conflicting accounts of Saul&#x27;s anointing and death, changes in the portrayal of Saul from positive to negative following David&#x27;s introduction, and etymological discrepancies in the birth-narrative of Samuel, which some scholars believe originally described Saul&#x27;s birth.

== Biblical account ==
The biblical accounts of Saul&#x27;s life are found in the Books of Samuel:

=== House of King Saul ===
According to the Hebrew text of the Bible, Saul reigned for two years, but Biblical scholars generally agree that the text is faulty and that a reign of 20 or 22 years is more probable. In the New Testament book of , the Apostle Paul indicates that Saul&#x27;s reign lasted for forty years.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Saul was the son of Kish, of the family of the Matrites, and a member of the tribe of Benjamin, one of the twelve Tribes of Israel. It appears that he came from Gibeah.
Saul married Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz, with whom he sired at least five sons (Jonathan, Abinadab, Malchishua, Ishvi and Ish-bosheth) and two daughters (Merab and Michal).

Saul also had a concubine named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah, who bore him two sons, Armoni and Mephibosheth.

Saul died at the Battle of Mount Gilboa, and was buried in Zelah, in the region of Benjamin. Three of Saul&#x27;s sons – Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua – died with him at Mount Gilboa. His surviving son Ish-bosheth became king of Israel, at the age of forty. At David&#x27;s request Abner had Michal returned to David. Ish-bosheth reigned for two years, but after the death of Abner, was killed by two of his own captains.

During a famine, God told king David that the famine happened because of how Saul treated the Gibeonites. The Gibeonites told David that only the death of seven sons of Saul would compensate them for losing their livelihood after the priests at Nob were killed under Saul&#x27;s orders. David then granted the Gibeonites the jurisdiction to individually execute Saul&#x27;s surviving two sons and five of Saul&#x27;s grandsons (the sons of Merab and Adriel). The Gibeonites killed all seven, and hung up their bodies at the sanctuary at Gibeah. For five months their bodies were hung out in the elements, and the grieving Rizpah guarded them from being eaten by the beasts and birds of prey. Finally, David had the bodies taken down and buried in the family grave at Zelah with the remains of Saul and their half-brother Jonathan. Michal was childless.

The only male descendant of Saul to survive was Mephibosheth, Jonathan&#x27;s lame son, who was five years old at the time of his father&#x27;s and grandfather&#x27;s deaths. In time, he came under the protection of David. Mephibosheth had a young son, Micah, who had four sons and descendants named until the ninth generation.

=== Anointed as king ===

The First Book of Samuel gives three accounts of Saul&#x27;s rise to the throne in three successive chapters:
*Saul is sent with a servant to look for his father&#x27;s strayed donkeys. Leaving his home at Gibeah, they eventually arrive at the district of Zuph, at which point Saul suggests abandoning their search. Saul&#x27;s servant tells him that they happen to be near the town of Ramah, where a famous &quot;seer&quot; dwells, and suggests that they should consult him first. The &quot;seer&quot; (later identified by the text as Samuel) offers hospitality to Saul and later anoints him in private.
*A popular movement having arisen to establish a centralized monarchy like other nations, Samuel assembles the people at Mizpah in Benjamin to appoint a king, fulfilling his previous promise to do so. Samuel organises the people by tribe and by clan. Using the Urim and Thummim, he selects the tribe of Benjamin, from within the tribe selecting the clan of Matri, and from them selecting Saul. After having been chosen as monarch, Saul returns to his home in Gibeah, along with a number of followers. However, some of the people are openly unhappy with the selection of Saul.
*The Ammonites, led by Nahash, lay siege to Jabesh-Gilead. Under the terms of surrender, the occupants of the city are to be forced into slavery and have their right eyes removed. Instead they send word of this to the other tribes of Israel, and the tribes west of the Jordan assemble an army under Saul. Saul leads the army to victory over the Ammonites, and the people congregate at Gilgal where they acclaim Saul as king and he is crowned. Saul&#x27;s first act is to forbid retribution against those who had previously contested his kingship.

André Lemaire finds the third account probably the most reliable tradition. The Pulpit Commentary distinguishes between a private and a public selection process.

=== Saul among the prophets ===
Having been anointed by Samuel, Saul is told of signs indicating that he has been divinely appointed. The last of these is that Saul will be met by an ecstatic group of prophets leaving a &quot;high place&quot; and playing the lyre, tambourine, and flutes. Saul encounters the ecstatic prophets and joins them. Later, Saul sends men to pursue David, but when they meet a group of ecstatic prophets playing music, they are overcome by the Spirit of God and join in giving prophetic words. Saul sends more men, but they too join the prophets. Eventually, Saul himself goes and also joins the prophets.

=== Military victories ===

After relieving the siege of Jabesh-Gilead, Saul conducts military campaigns against the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Aram Rehob and the kings of Zobah, the Philistines, and the Amalekites. A biblical summary states that &quot;wherever he turned, he was victorious&quot;.

In the second year of his reign, King Saul, his son Jonathan, and a small force of a few thousand Israelite soldiers defeated a massive Philistine force of 3,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen, and more than 30,000 infantry in the pass of Michmash. After the battle, Saul instructs his armies, by a rash oath, to fast. Methodist commentator Joseph Benson suggests that &quot;Saul&#x27;s intention in putting this oath was undoubtedly to save time, lest the Philistines should gain ground of them in their flight. But the event showed it was a false policy; for the people were so faint and weak for want of food, that they were less able to follow and slay the Philistines than if they had stopped to take a moderate refreshment&quot;. Jonathan&#x27;s party were not aware of the oath and ate honey resulting in Jonathan realizing that he had broken an oath of which he was not aware, but was nevertheless liable for its breach, until popular intervention allowed Jonathan to be saved from death on account of his victory over the Philistines.

=== Rejection ===

During Saul&#x27;s campaign against the Philistines, Samuel said that he would arrive in seven days to perform the requisite rites. When a week passed with no word of Samuel, and with the Israelites growing restless, Saul prepares for battle by offering sacrifices. Samuel arrives just as Saul is finishing sacrificing and reprimands Saul for not obeying his instructions.

Several years after Saul&#x27;s victory against the Philistines at Michmash Pass, Samuel instructs Saul to make war on the Amalekites and to &quot;utterly destroy&quot; them including all their livestock in fulfilment of a mandate set out:
:&quot;When the Lord your God has given you rest from all your enemies on every hand, in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, you shall blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; do not forget&quot;.
Having forewarned the Kenites who were living among the Amalekites to leave, Saul goes to war and defeats the Amalekites. Saul kills all the men, women, children and poor quality livestock, but leaves alive the king, Agag, and best livestock. When Samuel learns that Saul has disobeyed and plundered the livestock for self-gain, he informs Saul that God has rejected him as king. As Samuel turns to go, Saul seizes hold of his garments and tears off a piece; Samuel prophesies that the kingdom will likewise be torn from Saul. Samuel then kills Agag himself. Samuel and Saul each return home and never meet again after these events.

=== Saul and David ===

After Samuel tells Saul that God has rejected him as king, David, a son of Jesse, from the tribe of Judah, enters the story: from this point on Saul&#x27;s story is largely the account of his increasingly troubled relationship with David.
*Samuel heads to Bethlehem, ostensibly to offer sacrifice and invited Jesse and his sons. Dining together, Jesse&#x27;s sons are brought one by one to Samuel, each being rejected; at last, Jesse sends for David, the youngest, who is tending sheep. When brought to Samuel, David is anointed by him in front of his other brothers.
*In 1 Samuel 16:25-23, Saul is troubled by an evil spirit sent by God. He requests soothing music, and a servant recommends David the son of Jesse, who is renowned for his skills as a harpist and other talents:
:&quot;a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the Lord is with him&quot;
:When word of Saul&#x27;s needs reaches Jesse, he sends David, who had been looking after Jesse&#x27;s flock, with gifts as a tribute, and David is appointed as Saul&#x27;s armor bearer. With Jesse&#x27;s permission he remains at court, playing the harp as needed to calm Saul during his troubled spells.
* The Philistines return with an army to attack Israel, and the Philistine and Israelite forces gather on opposite sides of a valley. The Philistine&#x27;s champion Goliath issues a challenge for single combat, but none of the Israelite accept. David is described as a young shepherd who happens to be delivering food to his three eldest brothers in the army, and he hears Goliath&#x27;s challenge. David speaks mockingly of the Philistines to some soldiers; his speech is overheard and reported to Saul, who summons David and appoints David as his champion. David easily defeats Goliath with a single shot from a sling. At the end of the passage, Saul asks his general, Abner, who David is.

Saul offered his elder daughter Merab as a wife to the now popular David, after his victory over Goliath, but David demurred. David distinguishes himself in the Philistine wars. Upon David&#x27;s return from battle, the women praise him in song:
:&quot;Saul has slain his thousands and David his tens of thousands&quot; 
implying that David is the greater warrior. Saul fears David&#x27;s growing popularity and henceforth views him as a rival to the throne.

Saul&#x27;s son Jonathan and David become close friends. Jonathan recognizes David as the rightful king, and &quot;made a covenant with David, because he loved him as his own soul.&quot; Jonathan even gives David his military clothes, symbolizing David&#x27;s position as successor to Saul.
On two occasions, Saul threw a spear at David as he played the harp for Saul. David becomes increasingly successful and Saul becomes increasingly resentful. Now Saul actively plots against David. Saul offered his other daughter, Michal in marriage to David. David initially rejects this offer also, claiming he is too poor. Saul offers to accept a bride price of 100 Philistine foreskins, intending that David die in the attempt. Instead, David obtains 200 foreskins and is consequently married to Michal. Jonathan arranges a short-lived reconciliation between Saul and David and for a while David served Saul &quot;as in times past&quot; until &quot;the distressing spirit from the Lord&quot; re-appeared. Saul sends assassins in the night, but Michal helps him escape, tricking them by placing a household idol in his bed. David flees to Jonathan, who arranges a meeting with his father. While dining with Saul, Jonathan explains David&#x27;s absence, saying he has been called away to his brothers. But Saul sees through the ruse and reprimands Jonathan for protecting David, warning him that his love of David will cost him the kingdom, furiously throwing a spear at him. The next day, Jonathan meets with David and tells him Saul&#x27;s intent. The two friends say their goodbyes, and David flees into the countryside. Saul later marries Michal to another man.

Saul is later informed by his head shepherd, Doeg the Edomite, that high priest Ahimelech assisted David, giving him the sword of Goliath, which had been kept at the temple at Nob. Doeg kills Ahimelech and eighty-five other priests and Saul orders the death of the entire population of Nob.

David had left Nob by this point and had amassed some 300 dissatisfied men, including some outlaws. With these men David rescues the town of Keilah from a Philistine attack. Saul realises he could trap David and his men by laying the city to siege. David realizes that the citizens of Keilah will betray him to Saul. He flees to Ziph pursued by Saul. Saul hunts David in the vicinity of Ziph on two occasions:
*Some of the inhabitants of Ziph betray David&#x27;s location to Saul, but David hears about it and flees with his men to Maon. Saul follows David, but is forced to break off pursuit when the Philistines invade. After dealing with that threat Saul tracks David to the caves at Ein Gedi. As he searches the cave David manages to cut off a piece of Saul&#x27;s robe without being discovered, yet David restrains his men from harming the king. David then leaves the cave, revealing himself to Saul, and gives a speech that persuades Saul to reconcile.
*On the second occasion, Saul returns to Ziph with his men. When David hears of this, he slips into Saul&#x27;s camp by night, and again restrains his men from killing the king; instead he steals Saul&#x27;s spear and water jug, leaving his own spear thrust into the ground by Saul&#x27;s side. The next day, David reveals himself to Saul, showing the jug and spear as proof that he could have slain him. David then persuades Saul to reconcile with him; the two swear never to harm each other. After this they never see each other again.

=== Battle of Gilboa and the death of King Saul ===

The Philistines make war again, assembling at Shunem, and Saul leads his army to face them at Mount Gilboa. Before the battle he goes to consult a medium or witch at Endor. The medium, unaware of his identity, reminds him that the king has made witchcraft a capital offence, but he assures her that Saul will not harm her. She conjures a spirit which appears to be the prophet Samuel, and tells him that God has fully rejected him, will no longer hear his prayers, has given the kingdom to David and that the next day he will lose both the battle and his life. Saul collapses in fear, and the medium restores him with food in anticipation of the next day&#x27;s battle.

Saul&#x27;s death is described by the narrator (and also in 1 Chronicles 10) but a conflicting account is given by a young Amalekite. The defeated Israelites flee from the enemy and Saul asks his armour bearer to kill him, but the armour bearer refuses because he is too scared, and so Saul falls upon his own sword. But the Amalekite tells David he found Saul leaning on his spear after the battle and delivered the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; then took the Saul&#x27;s crown and armband. David has the Amalekite put to death, advancing the theme that David will never kill the Lord&#x27;s anointed king (c.f. 1 Samuel 24, 26).

The victorious Philistines recover Saul&#x27;s body as well as those of his three sons who also died in the battle, decapitate them and display them on the wall of Beth-shan. They display Saul&#x27;s armour in the temple of Ashtaroth (an Ascalonian temple of the Canaanites). But at night the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead retrieve the bodies for cremation and burial. Later on, David takes the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan and buries them in Zela, in the tomb of his father. The account in 1 Chronicles summarises by stating that:
:&quot;Saul died for his unfaithfulness which he had committed against the Lord, because he did not keep the word of the Lord, and also because he consulted a medium for guidance&quot;.

== Biblical criticism ==

There are several textual or narrative issues in the text, including the aforementioned conflicting accounts of Saul&#x27;s rise to kingship and his death, as well as plays on words, that biblical scholars have discussed.

The birth-narrative of the prophet Samuel is found at 1 Samuel 1:1–28. It describes how Samuel&#x27;s mother Hannah requests a son from Yahweh, and dedicates the child to God at the shrine of Shiloh. The passage makes extensive play with the root-elements of Saul&#x27;s name, and ends with the phrase &#x27;he is dedicated to Yahweh&#x27;. Hannah names the resulting son Samuel, giving as her explanation, &#x27;because from God I requested him&#x27;. Samuel&#x27;s name, however, can mean &#x27;name of God&#x27;, (or &#x27;Heard of God&#x27; or &#x27;Told of God&#x27;) and the etymology and multiple references to the root of the name seems to fit Saul instead. The majority explanation for the discrepancy is that the narrative originally described the birth of Saul, and was given to Samuel to enhance the position of David and Samuel at the former king&#x27;s expense.

The Bible&#x27;s tone with regard to Saul changes over the course of the narrative, especially around the passage where David appears, midway through 1 Samuel. Before, Saul is presented in positive terms, but afterward his mode of ecstatic prophecy is suddenly described as fits of madness, his errors and disobedience to Samuel&#x27;s instructions are stressed and he becomes a paranoiac. This may indicate that the David story is inserted from a source loyal to the House of David; David&#x27;s lament over Saul in 2 Samuel 1 then serves an apologetic purpose, clearing David of the blame for Saul&#x27;s death.

In the narrative of Saul&#x27;s private anointing in 1 Samuel 9:1–10:16, Saul is not referred to as a king (&quot;melech&quot;), but rather as a &quot;leader&quot; or &quot;commander&quot; (&quot;nagid&quot;) Saul is only given the title &quot;king&quot; (&quot;melech&quot;) at the public coronation ceremony at Gilgal.

Various authors have attempted to harmonize the two narratives regarding Saul&#x27;s death. Josephus writes that Saul&#x27;s attempted suicide was stalled because he was not able to run the sword through himself, and that he therefore asked the Amalekite to finish it. Later biblical criticism has posited that the story of Saul&#x27;s death was redacted from various sources, although this view in turn has been criticized because it does not explain why the contradiction was left in by the redactors. But since 2 Samuel records only the Amalekite&#x27;s report, and not the report of any other eyewitness, some scholars theorize that the Amalekite may have been lying to try to gain favor with David. In this view, 1 Samuel records what actually happened, while 2 Samuel records what the Amalekite &quot;claimed&quot; happened.

== Classical rabbinical views ==
Two opposing views of Saul are found in classical rabbinical literature. One is based on the reverse logic that punishment is a proof of guilt, and therefore seeks to rob Saul of any halo which might surround him. The passage referring to Saul as &quot;a choice young man, and goodly&quot; is in this view interpreted as meaning that Saul was not good in every respect, but &quot;goodly&quot; only with respect to his personal appearance. According to this view, Saul is only a &quot;weak branch&quot;, owing his kingship not to his own merits, but rather to his grandfather, who had been accustomed to light the streets for those who went to the beit midrash, and had received as his reward the promise that one of his grandsons should sit upon the throne.

The second view of Saul makes him appear in the most favourable light as man, as hero, and as king. In this view, it was on account of his modesty that he did not reveal the fact that he had been anointed king; and he was extraordinarily upright as well as perfectly just. Nor was there any one more pious than he; for when he ascended the throne he was as pure as a child, and had never committed sin. He was marvelously handsome; and the maidens who told him concerning Samuel talked so long with him to observe his beauty for longer. In war he was able to march 120 miles without rest. When commanded to smite Amalek, Saul said: &quot;For one found slain the Torah requires a sin offering; and here so many shall be slain. If the old have sinned, why should the young suffer; and if men have been guilty, why should the cattle be destroyed?&quot; It was this humaneness which cost him his crown. And while Saul was merciful to his enemies, he was strict with his own people; when he found out that Ahimelech, a kohen, had assisted David with finding food, Saul, in retaliation, killed the remaining 85 kohanim of Ahimelech&#x27;s family and the rest of his hometown, Nob. The fact that he was merciful even to his enemies, being indulgent to rebels themselves, and frequently waiving the homage due to him, was incredible as well as deceiving. But if his mercy toward a foe was a sin, it was his only one; it was his misfortune that it was reckoned against him, while David (who had committed many sins) was so favored that it was not remembered to his injury. In some respects Saul was superior to David, e.g., in having only one concubine (Rizpah), while David had many. Saul expended his own substance for the war, and although he knew that he and his sons would fall in battle, he nevertheless went forward, while David heeded the wish of his soldiers not to go to war in person.

According to the Rabbis, Saul followed the rules of ritual impurity prescribed for the sacrifice, and taught the people how they should slaughter cattle. As a reward for this, God himself gave Saul a sword on the day of battle, since no other sword suitable for him was found. Saul&#x27;s attitude toward David was excused by arguing that his courtiers were all tale-bearers, and slandered David to him; and in like manner he was incited by Doeg against the priests of Nob—this act was forgiven him, however, and a heavenly voice (&quot;bat kol&quot;) was heard, proclaiming: &quot;Saul is the chosen one of God&quot;. His anger at the Gibeonites was not personal hatred, but was induced by zeal for the welfare of Israel. The fact that he made his daughter remarry finds its explanation in his (Saul&#x27;s) view that her betrothal to David had been gained by false pretenses, and was therefore invalid. During the lifetime of Saul there was no idolatry in Israel. The famine in the reign of David, seemingly blamed on Saul, was in fact the people&#x27;s fault, for not according Saul the proper honours at his burial. In Sheol, Samuel reveals to Saul that in the next world, Saul would dwell with Samuel, which is a proof that all has been forgiven him by God.

== In Islam ==
In the Quran, the character Talut () is traditionally identified with king Saul.
Muslims believe that (as in the Bible) he was the commander of Israel. According to the Qur&#x27;an, Talut was chosen by the Prophet Samuel (not mentioned by name explicitly, but rather as &quot;a Prophet&quot; of the Israelites) after being asked by the people of Israel for a King to lead them into war. The Israelites criticized Samuel for appointing Talut, lacking respect for Talut because he was not wealthy. Samuel rebuked the people for this and told them that Talut was more favored than they were. Talut led the Israelites to victory over the army of Goliath, who was killed by David. Talut is considered a divinely appointed king.

=== Name ===
The name has uncertain etymology. Unlike some other Quranic figures, the Arabic name is not similar to the Hebrew name (&quot;Sha&#x27;ul&quot;). According to Muslim exegetes, the name means &#x27;tall&#x27; (from the Arabic ) and refers to the extraordinary stature of Saul, which would be consistent with the Biblical account. In explanation of the name, exegetes such as Tha&#x27;labi hold that at this time, the future King of Israel was to be recognised by his height; Samuel set up a measure, but no one in Israel reached its height except Ṭālūt (Saul).

=== Saul as the King of Israel ===
In the Qur&#x27;an, Israelites demanded a King after the time of Moses. God appointed Talut as their King. Saul was distinguished by the greatness of his knowledge and of his physique; it was a sign of his role as King that God brought back the Ark of the Covenant for Israel. Talut tested his people at a river; whoever drank from it would not follow him in battle excepting one who takes [from it] in the hollow of his hand. Many drank but only the faithful ventured on. In the battle, however, David slew Goliath and was made the subsequent King of Israel.

The Qur&#x27;anic account differs from the Biblical account (if Saul is assumed to be Talut) in that in the Bible the sacred Ark was returned to Israel before Saul&#x27;s accession, and the test by drinking water is made in the Hebrew Bible not by Saul but by Gideon.

== Historicity ==

The historicity of Saul&#x27;s kingdom is not universally accepted and there is insufficient extra-biblical evidence to verify if the biblical account reflects historical reality. While several scholars believe that the existence of the United Monarchy is corroborated by archaeological evidence, although with considerable theological exaggerations, others, like Israel Finkelstein, believe it to be a late ideological construct.

In the &quot;Jewish Study Bible&quot; (2014), Oded Lipschits states the concept of the United Monarchy should be abandoned, while Aren Maeir highlights the lack of evidence about the United Monarchy. However, in his books &quot;Beyond the Texts&quot; (2018) and &quot;Has Archeology Buried the Bible?&quot; (2020) William G. Dever has defended the historicity of the United Monarchy, maintaining that the reigns of Saul, David and Solomon are &quot;reasonably well attested&quot;. Similar arguments were advanced by Amihai Mazar in a 2013 essay, which points toward recent archaeological evidence emerging from excavation sites in Jerusalem by Eilat Mazar and in Khirbet Qeiyafa by Yosef Garfinkel. In their book, &quot;The Bible&#x27;s First Kings&quot; (2025), Avraham Faust and Zev Farber have also defended the existence of the United Monarchy, arguing that archaeological evidence and early biblical traditions attest to its emergence in the 11th-10th centuries BCE. Archeology seems to confirm that until about 1000 BCE, the end of Iron Age I, Israelite society was essentially a society of farmers and stockbreeders, without any truly centralized organization and administration.

== Psychological analyses ==
Accounts of Saul&#x27;s behavior have made him a popular subject for speculation among modern psychiatrists. George Stein views the passages depicting Saul&#x27;s ecstatic episodes as suggesting that he may have suffered from mania. Martin Huisman sees the story of Saul as illustrative of the role of stress as a factor in depression. Liubov Ben-Noun of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, believes that passages referring to King Saul&#x27;s disturbed behavior indicate he was afflicted by a mental disorder, and lists a number of possible conditions. However, Christopher C. H. Cook of the Department of Theology and Religion, Durham University, UK recommends caution in offering any diagnoses in relation to people who lived millennia ago.

<text>Samaria (), the Hellenized form of the Hebrew name Shomron (), is used as a historical and biblical name for the central region of the Land of Israel. It is bordered by Judea to the south and Galilee to the north. The region is known to the Palestinians in Arabic under two names, Samirah (, &quot;as-Sāmira&quot;), and Mount Nablus (جَبَل نَابُلُس, &quot;Jabal Nābulus&quot;).

The first-century historian Josephus set the Mediterranean Sea as its limit to the west, and the Jordan River as its limit to the east. Its territory largely corresponds to the biblical allotments of the tribe of Ephraim and the western half of Manasseh. It includes most of the region of the ancient Kingdom of Israel, which was north of the Kingdom of Judah. The border between Samaria and Judea is set at the latitude of Ramallah.

The name &quot;Samaria&quot; is derived from the ancient city of Samaria, capital of the northern Kingdom of Israel. The name Samaria likely began being used for the entire kingdom not long after the town of Samaria had become Israel&#x27;s capital, but it is first documented after its conquest by the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which incorporated the land into the province of Samerina.

Samaria was used to describe the northern midsection of the land in the UN Partition Plan for Palestine in 1947. It became the administrative term in 1967, when the West Bank was defined by Israeli officials as the Judea and Samaria Area, of which the entire area north of the Jerusalem District is termed as Samaria. In 1988, Jordan ceded its claim of the area to the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In 1994, control of Areas &#x27;A&#x27; (full civil and security control by the Palestinian Authority) and &#x27;B&#x27; (Palestinian civil control and joint Israeli–Palestinian security control) were transferred by Israel to the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority and the international community do not recognize the term &quot;Samaria&quot;; in modern times, the territory is generally known as part of the West Bank.

==Etymology==
According to the Hebrew Bible, the Hebrew name &quot;Shomron&quot; () is derived from the individual (or clan) &quot;Shemer&quot; (), from whom King Omri (ruled 880s–870s BCE) purchased the hill on which he built his new capital city of &quot;Shomron&quot;.

The fact that the mountain was called Shomeron when Omri bought it may indicate that the correct etymology of the name is to be found more directly in the Semitic root for &quot;guard&quot;, hence its initial meaning would have been &quot;watch mountain&quot;. In the earlier cuneiform inscriptions, Samaria is designated under the name of &quot;Bet Ḥumri&quot; (&quot;the house of Omri&quot;); but in those of Tiglath-Pileser III (ruled 745–727 BCE) and later it is called Samirin, after its Aramaic name, Shamerayin.

==Historical boundaries==
===Northern kingdom to Hellenistic period===
In Nelson&#x27;s Encyclopaedia (1906–1934), the Samaria region in the three centuries following the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel, i.e. during the Assyrian, Babylonian, and Persian periods, is described as a &quot;province&quot; that &quot;reached from the [Mediterranean] sea to the Jordan Valley&quot;.

===Roman-period definition===
The classical Roman-Jewish historian Josephus wrote:

During the first century, the boundary between Samaria and Judea passed eastward of Antipatris, along the deep valley which had Beth Rima (now Bani Zeid al-Gharbia) and Beth Laban (today&#x27;s al-Lubban al-Gharbi) on its southern, Judean bank; then it passed Anuath and Borceos, identified by Charles William Wilson (1836–1905) as the ruins of &#x27;Aina and Khirbet Berkit; and reached the Jordan Valley north of Acrabbim and Sartaba. Tall Asur also stands at that boundary.

==Geography==
The area known as the hills of Samaria is bounded by the Jezreel Valley(north); by the Jordan Rift Valley (east); by the Carmel Ridge (northwest); by the Sharon plain (west); and by the Jerusalem mountains (south).

The Samarian hills are not very high, seldom reaching the height of over 800 meters. Samaria&#x27;s climate is more hospitable than the climate further south.

There is no clear division between the mountains of southern Samaria and northern Judea.

==History==

Over time, the region has been controlled by numerous different civilizations, including Canaanites, Israelites, Neo-Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Seleucids, Hasmoneans, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, and Ottoman Turks.

===Israelite tribes and kingdoms===
According to the Hebrew Bible, the Israelites captured the region known as Samaria from the Canaanites and assigned it to the Tribe of Joseph. The southern part of Samaria was then known as Mount Ephraim. After the death of King Solomon (c. 931 BC), the northern tribes, including Ephraim and Menashe, separated themselves politically from the southern tribes and established the separate Kingdom of Israel. Initially its capital was Tirzah until the time of King Omri (c. 884 BC), who built the city of Samaria and made it his capital. Samaria functioned as the capital of the Kingdom of Israel (the &quot;Northern Kingdom&quot;) until its fall to the Assyrians in the 720s. Hebrew prophets condemned Samaria for its &quot;ivory houses&quot; and luxury palaces displaying pagan riches.

The archaeological record suggests that Samaria experienced significant settlement growth in Iron Age II (from 950 BC). Archaeologists estimate that there were 400 sites, up from 300 during the previous Iron Age I ( 1200 BC onwards). The people dwelt on tells, in small villages, farms, and forts, and in the cities of Shechem, Samaria and Tirzah in northern Samaria. Zertal estimated that about 52,000 people inhabited the Manasseh Hill in northern Samaria prior to the Assyrian deportations. According to botanists, the majority of Samaria&#x27;s forests were torn down during the Iron Age II, and were replaced by plantations and agricultural fields. Since then, few oak forests have grown in the region.

=== Assyrian period ===
In the 720s, the conquest of Samaria by Shalmaneser V of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which culminated in the three-year siege of the capital city of Samaria, saw the territory annexed as the Assyrian province of Samerina. The siege has been tentatively dated to 725 or 724 BC, with its resolution in 722 BC, near the end of Shalmaneser&#x27;s reign. The first documented mention of the province of Samerina is from the reign of Shalmaneser V&#x27;s successor Sargon II. This is also the first documented instance where a name derived from &quot;Samaria&quot;, the capital city, was used for the entire region, although it is thought likely that this practice was already in place.

Following the Assyrian conquest, Sargon II claimed in Assyrian records to have deported 27,280 people to various places throughout the empire, mainly to Guzana in the Assyrian heartland, as well as to the cities of the Medes in the eastern part of the empire (modern-day Iran). The deportations were part of a standard resettlement policy of the Neo-Assyrian Empire to deal with defeated enemy peoples. The resettled people were generally treated well as valued members of the empire and transported together with their families and belongings. At the same time, people from other parts of the empire were resettled in the depopulated Samerina. The resettlement is also called the Assyrian captivity in Jewish history and provides the basis for the narrative of the Ten Lost Tribes.

=== Babylonian and Persian periods ===

According to many scholars, archaeological excavations at Mount Gerizim indicate that a Samaritan temple was built there in the first half of the 5th century BCE. The date of the schism between Samaritans and Jews is unknown, but by the early 4th century BCE the communities seem to have had distinctive practices and communal separation. Much of the anti-Samaritan polemic in the Hebrew Bible and extra-biblical texts (such as Josephus) originate from this point and on.

===Hellenistic period===
During the Hellenistic period, Samaria was largely divided between a Hellenizing faction based around the town of Samaria and a pious faction in Shechem and surrounding rural areas, led by the High Priest.

Samaria was a largely autonomous province nominally dependent on the Seleucid Empire. However, the province gradually declined as the Maccabean movement and Hasmonean Judea grew stronger. The transfer of three districts of Samaria— Ephraim, Lod and Ramathaim—under the control of Judea in 145 BCE as part of an agreement between Jonathan Apphus and Demetrius II is one indication of this decline. Around 110 BCE, the decline of Hellenistic Samaria was complete, when the Jewish Hasmonean ruler John Hyrcanus destroyed the cities of Samaria and Shechem, as well as the city and temple on Mount Gerizim. Only a few stone remnants of the Samaritan temple exist today.

===Roman period===
In 6 CE, Samaria became part of the Roman province of Iudaea, following the death of King Herod the Great.

Southern Samaria reached a peak in settlement during the early Roman period (63 BCE–70 CE), partly as a result of the Hasmonean dynasty&#x27;s settlement efforts. The impact of the Jewish–Roman wars is archaeologically evident in Jewish-inhabited areas of southern Samaria, as many sites were destroyed and left abandoned for extended periods of time. After the First Jewish-Roman War, the Jewish population of the area decreased by around 50%, whereas after the Bar Kokhba revolt, it was completely wiped in many areas. According to Klein, the Roman authorities replaced the Jews with a population from the nearby provinces of Syria, Phoenicia, and Arabia. An apparent new wave of settlement growth in southern Samaria, most likely by non-Jews, can be traced back to the late Roman and Byzantine eras.

====New Testament references====

The New Testament mentions Samaria in Luke 17:11–2, in the miraculous healing of the ten lepers, which took place on the border of Samaria and Galilee. John 4:1-26 records Jesus&#x27; encounter at Jacob&#x27;s Well with the woman of Sychar, in which he declares himself to be the Messiah. In Acts 8:1, it is recorded that the early community of disciples of Jesus began to be persecuted in Jerusalem and were &#x27;scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria&#x27;. Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached and healed the sick there. In the time of Jesus, &quot;Iudaea&quot; of the Romans was divided into the toparchies of Judea, Samaria, Galilee and the Paralia. Samaria occupied the centre of &quot;Iudaea&quot;. (&quot;Iudaea&quot; was later renamed &quot;Syria Palaestina&quot; in 135, following the Bar Kokhba revolt.) In the Talmud, Samaria is called the &quot;land of the Cuthim&quot;.

===Byzantine period===
Following the bloody suppression of the Samaritan Revolts (mostly in 525 CE and 555 CE) against the Byzantine Empire, which resulted in death, displacement, and conversion to Christianity, the Samaritan population dramatically decreased. In the central parts of Samaria, the vacuum left by departing Samaritans was filled by nomads who gradually became sedentarized.

The Byzantine period is considered the peak of settlement in Samaria, as in other regions of the country. Based on historical sources and archeological data, the Manasseh Hill surveyors concluded that Samaria&#x27;s population during the Byzantine period was composed of Samaritans, Christians, and a minority of Jews. The Samaritan population was mainly concentrated in the valleys of Nablus and to the north as far as Jenin and Kfar Othenai; they did not settle south of the Nablus-Qalqiliya line. Christianity slowly made its way into Samaria, even after the Samaritan revolts. With the exception of Neapolis, Sebastia, and a small cluster of monasteries in central and northern Samaria, most of the population of the rural areas remained non-Christian. In southwestern Samaria, a significant concentration of churches and monasteries was discovered, with some of them built on top of citadels from the late Roman period. Magen raised the hypothesis that many of these were used by Christian pilgrims, and filled an empty space in the region whose Jewish population was wiped out in the Jewish–Roman wars.

=== Early Muslim, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods ===
Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant, and throughout the early Islamic period, Samaria underwent a process of Islamization as a result of waves of conversion among the remaining Samaritan population, along with the migration of Muslims into the area. Evidence implies that a large number of Samaritans converted under Abbasid and Tulunid rule, as a result of droughts, earthquakes, religious persecution, high taxes, and anarchy. By the mid-Middle Ages, the Jewish writer and explorer Benjamin of Tudela estimated that only around 1,900 Samaritans remained in Palestine and Syria.

==== Ottoman Period ====
During the Ottoman Period, the northern part of Samaria belonged to the
Turabay Emirate (1517–1683), which encompassed also the Jezreel Valley, Haifa, Jenin, Beit She&#x27;an Valley, northern Jabal Nablus, Bilad al-Ruha/Ramot Menashe, and the northern part of the Sharon plain. The areas south of Jenin, including Nablus itself and its hinterland up to the Yarkon River, formed a separate district called the District of Nablus.

===British Mandate===
During the Great War, Palestine was wrested by the armies of the British Empire from the Ottoman Empire and in the aftermath of the war it was entrusted to the United Kingdom to administer as a League of Nations mandated territory Samaria was the name of one of the administrative districts of Palestine for part of this period. The 1947 UN partition plan called for the Arab state to consist of several parts, the largest of which was described as &quot;the hill country of Samaria and Judea.&quot;

===Jordanian period===
As a result of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, most of the territory was unilaterally incorporated as Jordanian-controlled territory, and was administered as part of the West Bank (west of the Jordan river).

===Israeli administration===
The Jordanian-held West Bank was captured and has been occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War. Jordan ceded its claims in the West Bank (except for certain prerogatives in Jerusalem) to the PLO in November 1988, later confirmed by the Israel–Jordan Treaty of Peace of 1994. In the 1994 Oslo accords, the Palestinian Authority was established and given responsibility for the administration over some of the territory of West Bank (Areas &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27;).

Samaria is one of several standard statistical districts utilized by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics. &quot;The Israeli CBS also collects statistics on the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza District. It has produced various basic statistical series on the territories, dealing with population, employment, wages, external trade, national accounts, and various other topics.&quot; The Palestinian Authority however use Nablus, Jenin, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Salfit, Ramallah and Tubas governorates as administrative centers for the same region.

The Shomron Regional Council is the local municipal government that administers the smaller Israeli towns (settlements) throughout the area. The council is a member of the network of regional municipalities spread throughout Israel. Elections for the head of the council are held every five years by Israel&#x27;s ministry of interior, all residents over age 17 are eligible to vote. In special elections held in August 2015 Yossi Dagan was elected as head of the Shomron Regional Council.

Israeli settlements in the West Bank are considered by most in the international community to be illegal under international law, but others including the United States and Israeli governments dispute this. In September 2016, the Town Board of the American Town of Hempstead in the State of New York, led by Councilman Bruce Blakeman entered into a partnership agreement with the Shomron Regional Council, led by Yossi Dagan, as part of an anti-Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.

==Archaeological sites==
===Ancient city of Samaria/Sebaste===

The ancient site of Samaria-Sebaste covers the hillside overlooking the West Bank village of Sebastia on the eastern slope of the hill. Remains have been found from the Canaanite, Israelite, Hellenistic, Roman (including Herodian) and Byzantine periods.

Archaeological finds from Roman-era Sebaste, a site that was rebuilt and renamed by Herod the Great in 30 BC, include a colonnaded street, a temple-lined acropolis, and a lower city, where John the Baptist is believed to have been buried.

The Harvard excavation of Samaria, which began in 1908, was headed by Egyptologist George Andrew Reisner. The findings included Hebrew, Aramaic, cuneiform and Greek inscriptions, as well as pottery remains, coins, sculpture, figurines, scarabs and seals, faience, amulets, beads and glass. The joint British-American-Hebrew University excavation continued under John Winter Crowfoot in 1931–35, during which time some of the chronology issues were resolved. The round towers lining the acropolis were found to be Hellenistic, the street of columns was dated to the 3–4th century, and 70 inscribed potsherds were dated to the early 8th century.

In 1908–1935, remains of luxury furniture made of wood and ivory were discovered in Samaria, representing the Levant&#x27;s most important collection of ivory carvings from the early first millennium BC. Despite theories of their Phoenician origin, some of the letters serving as fitter&#x27;s marks are in Hebrew.

As of 1999 three series of coins have been found that confirm Sinuballat was a governor of Samaria. Sinuballat is best known as an adversary of Nehemiah from the Book of Nehemiah where he is said to have sided with Tobiah the Ammonite and Geshem the Arabian. All three coins feature a warship on the front, likely derived from earlier Sidonian coins. The reverse side depicts the Persian King in his kandys robe facing down a lion that is standing on its hind legs.

==Samaritans==

The Samaritans (Hebrew: Shomronim) are an ethnoreligious group named after and descended from ancient Semitic inhabitants of Samaria, since the Assyrian exile of the Israelites, according to and first-century historian Josephus. Religiously, the Samaritans are adherents of Samaritanism, an Abrahamic religion closely related to Judaism. Based on the Samaritan Torah, Samaritans claim their worship is the true religion of the ancient Israelites prior to the Babylonian exile, preserved by those who remained behind. Their temple was built at Mount Gerizim in the middle of the 5th century BCE, and was destroyed under the Hasmonean king John Hyrcanus of Judea in 110 BCE, although their descendants still worship among its ruins. The antagonism between Samaritans and Jews is important in understanding the Bible&#x27;s New Testament stories of the &quot;Samaritan woman at the well&quot; and &quot;Parable of the Good Samaritan&quot;. The modern Samaritans, however, see themselves as co-equals in inheritance to the Israelite lineage through Torah, as do the Jews, and are not antagonistic to Jews in modern times.

==Flora and fauna==
The geographical region lies on the Irano-Turanian border, and its slopes support vegetation grown in that broad region. Typical for this region are &quot;maquis&quot;, the dense scrub vegetation consisting of hardy evergreen shrubs and small trees, characteristic of coastal regions in the Mediterranean and which, in this area, are found on the cliffs&#x27; step-crevices. The kermes oak (&quot;Quercus coccifera&quot;) is common. 

In contrast to the Galilee and the Judean Mountains, there are very few remnants of natural vegetation in the Samaria Mountains. Large areas in the south and west of Samaria and in the valleys have been cultivated for many generations as agricultural land and are planted mainly with olive, fig, almond and pomegranate trees; the areas in the valleys are used for arable land or vegetable crops. Only on the edges of the fields and in places that have been regenerated and where damaging the plant-life is prohibited by law have remnants of natural vegetation been preserved.

The wildlife of Samaria, as in other regions of the country, consists of populations that invaded the general area at different times and adapted to the conditions prevailing in the area. Hunting (with the introduction of modern firearms in the 20th-century) and extensive farming have been the principal causes for a decline in the area&#x27;s natural wildlife. The animals that dominate the general area have their origins in the Mediterranean basin and in Europe, such as the badger, the wild boar, the red fox, the hedgehog, the field mouse, and the mole (among mammals).

<text>Sennacherib ( or , meaning &quot;Sîn has replaced the brothers&quot;) was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 705BC until his assassination in 681BC. The second king of the Sargonid dynasty, Sennacherib is one of the most famous Assyrian kings for the role he plays in the Hebrew Bible, which describes his campaign in the Levant. Other events of his reign include his destruction of the city of Babylon in 689BC and his renovation and expansion of the last great Assyrian capital, Nineveh.

Although Sennacherib was one of the most powerful and wide-ranging Assyrian kings, he faced considerable difficulty in controlling Babylonia, which formed the southern portion of his empire. Many of Sennacherib&#x27;s Babylonian troubles stemmed from the Chaldean tribal chief Marduk-apla-iddina II, who had been Babylon&#x27;s king until Sennacherib&#x27;s father defeated him. Shortly after Sennacherib inherited the throne in 705BC, Marduk-apla-iddina retook Babylon and allied with the Elamites. Though Sennacherib reclaimed the south in 700BC, Marduk-apla-iddina continued to trouble him, probably instigating Assyrian vassals in the Levant to rebel, leading to the Levantine War of 701 BC, and himself warring against Bel-ibni, Sennacherib&#x27;s vassal king in Babylonia.

After the Babylonians and Elamites captured and executed Sennacherib&#x27;s eldest son Aššur-nādin-šumi, whom Sennacherib had proclaimed as his new vassal king in Babylon, Sennacherib campaigned in both regions, subduing Elam. Because Babylon, well within his own territory, had been the target of most of his military campaigns and had caused the death of his son, he destroyed the city in 689BC.

In the Levantine War, the states in the southern Levant, especially the Kingdom of Judah under King Hezekiah, were not subdued as easily as those in the north. The Assyrians thus invaded Judah. Though the biblical narrative holds that divine intervention by an angel ended the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem by destroying the Assyrian army, an outright defeat is unlikely as Hezekiah submitted to Sennacherib at the end of the campaign. Contemporary records, even those written by Assyria&#x27;s enemies, do not mention the Assyrians being defeated at Jerusalem.

Sennacherib transferred the capital of Assyria to Nineveh, where he had spent most of his time as crown prince. To transform Nineveh into a capital worthy of his empire, he launched one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history. He expanded the size of the city and constructed great city walls, numerous temples and a royal garden. His most famous work in the city is the Southwest Palace, which Sennacherib named his &quot;Palace without Rival&quot;.

After the death of his eldest son and crown prince Aššur-nādin-šumi, Sennacherib originally designated his second son Arda-Mulissu heir. He later replaced him with a younger son, Esarhaddon, in 684BC, for unknown reasons. Sennacherib ignored Arda-Mulissu&#x27;s repeated appeals to be reinstated as heir, and in 681BC, Arda-Mulissu and his brother Nabu-shar-usur murdered Sennacherib, hoping to seize power for themselves. Babylonia and the Levant welcomed his death as divine punishment, while the Assyrian heartland probably reacted with resentment and horror. Arda-Mulissu&#x27;s coronation was postponed, and Esarhaddon raised an army and seized Nineveh, installing himself as king as intended by Sennacherib.

Sennacherib was the son and successor of the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II, who had reigned as king of Assyria from 722 to 705 BC and as king of Babylon from 710 to 705 BC. The identity of Sennacherib&#x27;s mother is uncertain. Historically, the most popular view has been that Sennacherib was the son of Sargon&#x27;s wife Ataliya, although this is now considered unlikely. To have been Sennacherib&#x27;s mother, Ataliya would have had to be born around the year 760 BC, at the latest, and lived to at least 692 BC, as a &quot;queen mother&quot; is attested in that year, but Ataliya&#x27;s grave at Nimrud, which was discovered in the 1980s, indicates she was 35 years old at most when she died. The Assyriologist Josette Elayi considers it more plausible Sennacherib&#x27;s mother was another of Sargon&#x27;s wives, Ra&#x27;īmâ; a stele from Assur (once the capital of Assyria), discovered in 1913, specifically refers to her as the &quot;mother of Sennacherib&quot;. Ra&#x27;īmâ&#x27;s existence is a recent discovery, based on a 2014 reading of the inscription on the stele. Sargon claimed he was himself the son of the earlier king Tiglath-Pileser III, but this is uncertain as Sargon usurped the throne from Tiglath-Pileser&#x27;s other son Shalmaneser V.

Sennacherib was probably born 745 BC in Nimrud. If Sargon was the son of Tiglath-Pileser and not a non-dynastic usurper, Sennacherib would have grown up in the royal palace at Nimrud and spent most of his youth there. Sargon continued to live in Nimrud long after he had become king, leaving the city in 710 BC to reside at Babylon, and later at his new capital, Dur-Sharrukin, in 706 BC. By the time Sargon moved to Babylon, Sennacherib, who served as the crown prince and designated heir, had already left Nimrud, living in a residence at Nineveh. Nineveh had been the designated seat of the Assyrian crown prince since the reign of Tiglath-Pileser. As crown prince, Sennacherib also owned an estate at Tarbisu. The royal educator, Hunnî, would have educated Sennacherib and his siblings. They probably received a scribal education, learning arithmetic and how to read and write in Sumerian and Akkadian.

Sennacherib had several brothers and at least one sister. In addition to the older brothers who died before his birth, Sennacherib had a number of younger brothers, some of whom are mentioned as being alive as late as 670 BC, then in the service of Sennacherib&#x27;s son and successor Esarhaddon. Sennacherib&#x27;s only known sister, Ahat-abisha, was married off to Ambaris, the king of Tabal, but probably returned to Assyria after Sargon&#x27;s first successful campaign against Tabal.

Sennacherib&#x27;s name, &quot;Sîn-aḥḥē-erība&quot;, means &quot;Sîn (the moon-god) has replaced the brothers&quot; in Akkadian. The name probably derives from Sennacherib not being Sargon&#x27;s first son, but all his older brothers being dead by the time he was born. In Hebrew, his name was rendered as &quot;Snḥryb&quot; and in Aramaic it was &quot;Šnḥ’ryb&quot;. According to a 670 BC document, it was illegal to give the name Sennacherib (then the former king) to a commoner in Assyria, as it was considered sacrilege.

=== Sennacherib as crown prince ===

As crown prince, Sennacherib exercised royal power with his father, or alone as a substitute while Sargon was away campaigning. During Sargon&#x27;s longer absences from the Assyrian heartland, Sennacherib&#x27;s residence would have served as the center of government in the Neo-Assyrian Empire, with the crown prince taking on significant administrative and political responsibilities. The vast responsibilities entrusted to Sennacherib suggests a certain degree of trust between the king and the crown prince. In reliefs depicting both Sargon and Sennacherib, they are portrayed in discussion, appearing almost as equals. As regent, Sennacherib&#x27;s primary duty was to maintain relations with Assyrian governors and generals and oversee the empire&#x27;s vast military intelligence network. Sennacherib oversaw domestic affairs and often informed Sargon of the progress being made on building projects throughout the empire. Sargon also assigned him to the reception and distribution of audience gifts and tribute. After distributing such financial resources, Sennacherib sent letters to his father to inform him of his decisions.

A letter to his father indicates that Sennacherib respected him and that they were on friendly terms. He never disobeyed his father, and his letters indicate he knew Sargon well and wanted to please him. For unknown reasons, Sargon never took him on his military campaigns. Elayi believes that Sennacherib may have resented his father for this as he missed out on the glory attached to military victories. In any event, Sennacherib never took action against Sargon or attempted to usurp the throne despite being more than old enough to become king himself.

=== Assyria and Babylonia ===

By the time Sennacherib became king, the Neo-Assyrian Empire had been the dominant power in the Near East for over thirty years, chiefly due to its well-trained and large army, superior to that of any other contemporary kingdom. Though Babylonia to the south had also once been a large kingdom, it was typically weaker than its northern neighbor during this period, due to internal divisions and the lack of a well-organized army. The population of Babylonia was divided into various ethnic groups with different priorities and ideals. Though old native Babylonians ruled most of the cities, such as Kish, Ur, Uruk, Borsippa, Nippur, and Babylon itself, Chaldean tribes led by chieftains who often squabbled with each other dominated most of the southernmost land. The Arameans lived on the fringes of settled land and were notorious for plundering surrounding territories. Because of the infighting of these three major groups, Babylonia often represented an appealing target for Assyrian campaigns. The two kingdoms had competed since the rise of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 14th century BC, and in the 8th century BC, the Assyrians consistently gained the upper hand. Babylon&#x27;s internal and external weakness led to its conquest by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 729 BC.

During the expansion of Assyria into a major empire, the Assyrians had conquered various neighboring kingdoms, either annexing them as Assyrian provinces or turning them into vassal states. Because the Assyrians venerated the long history and culture of Babylon, it was preserved as a full kingdom, either ruled by an appointed client king, or by the Assyrian king in a personal union. The relationship between Assyria and Babylonia was similar to the relationship between Greece and Rome in later centuries; much of Assyria&#x27;s culture, texts and traditions had been imported from the south. Assyria and Babylonia also shared the same language (Akkadian). The relationship between Assyria and Babylon was emotional in a sense; Neo-Assyrian inscriptions implicitly gender the two countries, calling Assyria the metaphorical &quot;husband&quot; and Babylon its &quot;wife&quot;. In the words of the Assyriologist Eckart Frahm, &quot;the Assyrians were in love with Babylon, but also wished to dominate her&quot;. Though Babylon was respected as the well-spring of civilization, it was expected to remain passive in political matters, something that Assyria&#x27;s &quot;Babylonian bride&quot; repeatedly refused to be.

== Reign ==

=== Death of Sargon II and succession ===

In 705 BC, Sargon, probably in his sixties, led the Assyrian army on a campaign against King Gurdî of Tabal in central Anatolia. The campaign was disastrous, resulting in the defeat of the Assyrian army and the death of Sargon, whose corpse the Anatolians carried off. Sargon&#x27;s death made the defeat significantly worse because the Assyrians believed the gods had punished him for some major past misdeed. In Mesopotamian mythology, the afterlife suffered by those who died in battle and were not buried was terrible, being doomed to suffer like beggars for eternity. Sennacherib was about 35 years old when he ascended to the Assyrian throne in August of 705 BC. He had a great deal of experience with how to rule the empire because of his long tenure as crown prince. His reaction to his father&#x27;s fate was to distance himself from Sargon. Frahm characterized Sennacherib&#x27;s reaction as &quot;one of almost complete denial&quot;, writing that Sennacherib &quot;apparently felt unable to acknowledge and mentally deal with what had happened to Sargon&quot;. Sennacherib immediately abandoned Sargon&#x27;s great new capital city, Dur-Sharrukin, and moved the capital to Nineveh instead. One of Sennacherib&#x27;s first actions as king was to rebuild a temple dedicated to the god Nergal, associated with death, disaster and war, at the city of Tarbisu.

Even with this public denial in mind, Sennacherib was superstitious and spent a great deal of time asking his diviners what kind of sin Sargon could have committed to suffer the fate that he had, perhaps considering the possibility that he had offended Babylon&#x27;s deities by taking control of the city. A text, though probably written after Sennacherib&#x27;s death, says he proclaimed he was investigating the nature of a &quot;sin&quot; committed by his father. A minor 704 BC campaign (unmentioned in Sennacherib&#x27;s later historical accounts), led by Sennacherib&#x27;s magnates rather than the king himself, was sent against Gurdî in Tabal to avenge Sargon. Sennacherib spent much time and effort to rid the empire of Sargon&#x27;s imagery. Raising the level of the courtyard made images that Sargon had created at the temple in Assur invisible. When Sargon&#x27;s wife Ataliya died, she was buried hastily and in the same coffin as another woman, the queen of the previous king Tiglath-Pileser. Sargon is never mentioned in Sennacherib&#x27;s inscriptions.

=== First Babylonian campaign ===

Sargon II&#x27;s death in the battle and the disappearance of his body inspired rebellions across the Assyrian Empire. Sargon had ruled Babylonia since 710 BC, when he defeated the Chaldean tribal chief Marduk-apla-iddina II, who had taken control of the south in the aftermath of the death of Sargon&#x27;s predecessor Shalmaneser V in 722 BC. Like his immediate predecessors, Sennacherib took the ruling titles of both Assyria and Babylonia when he became king, but his reign in Babylonia was less stable. Unlike Sargon and previous Babylonian rulers, who had proclaimed themselves as &quot;shakkanakku&quot; (viceroys) of Babylon, in reverence for the city&#x27;s deity Marduk (who was considered Babylon&#x27;s formal &quot;king&quot;), Sennacherib explicitly proclaimed himself as Babylon&#x27;s king. Furthermore, he did not &quot;take the hand&quot; of the Statue of Marduk, the physical representation of the deity, and thus did not honor the god by undergoing the traditional Babylonian coronation ritual.

In angry response to this disrespect, revolts a month apart in 704 or 703 BC overthrew Sennacherib&#x27;s rule in the south. First, a Babylonian by the name of Marduk-zakir-shumi II took the throne, but Marduk-apla-iddina, the same Chaldean warlord who had seized control of the city once before and had warred against Sennacherib&#x27;s father, deposed him after just two or four weeks. Marduk-apla-iddina rallied large portions of Babylonia&#x27;s people to fight for him, both the urban Babylonians and the tribal Chaldeans, and he also enlisted troops from the neighboring civilization of Elam, in modern-day south-western Iran. Though assembling all these forces took time, Sennacherib reacted slowly to these developments, which allowed Marduk-apla-iddina to station large contingents at the cities of Kutha and Kish.

Portions of the Assyrian army were away in Tabal in 704 BC. Because Sennacherib might have considered a two-front war too risky, Marduk-apla-iddina was left unchallenged for several months. In 703 BC, after the Tabal expedition had been completed, Sennacherib gathered the Assyrian army at Assur, often used as a mustering spot for campaigns against the south. The Assyrian army, led by Sennacherib&#x27;s chief commander, launched an unsuccessful attack on the coalition forces near the city of Kish, bolstering the legitimacy of the coalition. However, Sennacherib also realized that the anti-Assyrian forces were divided and led his entire army to engage and destroy the portion of the army encamped at Kutha. Thereafter, he moved to attack the contingent at Kish, winning this second battle as well. Fearing for his life, Marduk-apla-iddina had already fled the battlefield. Sennacherib&#x27;s inscriptions state that among the captives taken after the victory was a stepson of Marduk-apla-iddina and brother of an Arab queen, Yatie, who had joined the coalition.

Sennacherib then marched on Babylon. As the Assyrians appeared on the horizon, Babylon opened its gates to him, surrendering without a fight. The city was reprimanded, suffering a minor sack, though its citizens were unharmed. After a brief period of rest in Babylon, Sennacherib and the Assyrian army then moved systematically through southern Babylonia, where there was still organized resistance, pacifying both the tribal areas and the major cities. Sennacherib&#x27;s inscriptions state that over two hundred thousand prisoners were taken. Because his previous policy of reigning as king of both Assyria and Babylonia had evidently failed, Sennacherib attempted another method, appointing a native Babylonian who had grown up at the Assyrian court, Bel-ibni, as his vassal king of the south. Sennacherib described Bel-ibni as &quot;a native of Babylon who grew up in my palace like a young puppy&quot;.

=== War in the Levant ===

After the Babylonian war, Sennacherib&#x27;s second campaign was in the Zagros Mountains. There, he subdued the Yasubigallians, a people from east of the Tigris river, and the Kassites, a people who had ruled Babylonia centuries before. Sennacherib&#x27;s third campaign, directed against the kingdoms and city-states in the Levant, is very well-documented compared to many other events in the ancient Near East and is the best-documented event in the history of Israel during the First Temple period. In 705 BC, Hezekiah, the king of Judah, had stopped paying his annual tribute to the Assyrians and began pursuing a markedly aggressive foreign policy, probably inspired by the recent wave of anti-Assyrian rebellions across the empire. After conspiring with Egypt (then under Kushite rule) and Sidqia, an anti-Assyrian king of the city of Ashkelon, to garner support, Hezekiah attacked Philistine cities loyal to Assyria and captured the Assyrian vassal Padi, king of Ekron, and imprisoned him in his capital, Jerusalem. In the northern Levant, former Assyrian vassal cities rallied around Luli, the king of Tyre and Sidon. Sennacherib&#x27;s arch-enemy Marduk-apla-iddina encouraged the anti-Assyrian sentiment among some of the empire&#x27;s western vassals. He corresponded with and sent gifts to western rulers like Hezekiah, probably hoping to assemble a vast anti-Assyrian alliance.

In 701 BC, Sennacherib first moved to attack the Syro-Hittite and Phoenician cities in the north. Like many rulers of these cities had done before and would do again, Luli fled rather than face the wrath of the Assyrians, escaping by boat until he was beyond Sennacherib&#x27;s reach. In his stead, Sennacherib proclaimed a noble by the name Ethbaal as the new king of Sidon and his vassal and oversaw the submission of many of the surrounding cities to his rule. Faced with a massive Assyrian army nearby, many of the Levantine rulers, including Budu-ilu of Ammon, Kammusu-nadbi of Moab, Mitinti of Ashdod and Aya-ramu of Edom, quickly submitted to Sennacherib to avoid retribution.

The resistance in the southern Levant was not as easily suppressed, forcing Sennacherib to invade the region. The Assyrians began by taking Ashkelon and defeating Sidqia. They then besieged and took numerous cities, including Beth-Dagon, Joppa, Banai-Barqa, and Azjuru. As the Assyrians were preparing to retake Ekron, Hezekiah&#x27;s ally, Egypt, intervened in the conflict. The Assyrians defeated the Egyptian expedition in a battle near the city of Eltekeh. They took the cities of Ekron and Timnah and Judah stood alone, with Sennacherib setting his sights on Jerusalem. While a portion of Sennacherib&#x27;s troops prepared to blockade Jerusalem, Sennacherib himself marched on the important Judean city of Lachish. Both the blockade of Jerusalem and the siege of Lachish probably prevented further Egyptian aid from reaching Hezekiah, and intimidated the kings of other smaller states in the region. The siege of Lachish, which ended in the city&#x27;s destruction, was so lengthy that the defenders eventually began using arrowheads made of bone rather than metal, which had run out. To take the city, the Assyrians constructed a great siege mound, a ramp made of earth and stone, to reach the top of Lachish&#x27;s walls. After they had destroyed the city, the Assyrians deported the survivors to the Assyrian Empire, forcing some of them to work on Sennacherib&#x27;s building projects, and others to serve in the king&#x27;s personal guard.

=== Sennacherib at the gates of Jerusalem ===
Sennacherib&#x27;s account of what happened at Jerusalem begins with &quot;As for Hezekiah ... like a caged bird I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city. I barricaded him with outposts, and exit from the gate of his city I made taboo for him.&quot; Thus, Jerusalem was blockaded in some capacity, though the lack of massive military activities and appropriate equipment meant that it was probably not a full siege. According to the Biblical narrative, a senior Assyrian official with the title Rabshakeh stood in front of the city&#x27;s walls and demanded its surrender, threatening that the Judeans would &#x27;eat feces and drink urine&#x27; during the siege. Although the Assyrian account of the operation may lead one to believe that Sennacherib was present in person, this is never explicitly stated and reliefs depicting the campaign show Sennacherib seated on a throne in Lachish instead of overseeing the preparations for an assault on Jerusalem. According to the biblical account, the Assyrian envoys to Hezekiah returned to Sennacherib to find him engaged in a struggle with the city of Libnah.

The account of the blockade erected around Jerusalem is different from the sieges described in Sennacherib&#x27;s annals and the massive reliefs in Sennacherib&#x27;s palace at Nineveh, which depict the successful siege of Lachish rather than events at Jerusalem. Though the blockade of Jerusalem was not a proper siege, it is clear from all available sources that a massive Assyrian army was encamped in the city&#x27;s vicinity, probably on its northern side.
Though it is clear that the blockade of Jerusalem ended without significant fighting, how it was resolved and what stopped Sennacherib&#x27;s massive army from overwhelming the city is uncertain. The Biblical account of the end of Sennacherib&#x27;s attack on Jerusalem holds that though Hezekiah&#x27;s soldiers manned the walls of the city, ready to defend it against the Assyrians, an entity referred to as the destroying angel, sent by Yahweh, annihilated Sennacherib&#x27;s army, killing 185,000 Assyrian soldiers in front of Jerusalem&#x27;s gates. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus describes the operation as an Assyrian failure due to a &quot;multitude of field-mice&quot; descending upon the Assyrian camp, devouring crucial material such as quivers and bowstrings, leaving the Assyrians unarmed and causing them to flee. It is possible that the story of the mice infestation is an allusion to some kind of disease striking the Assyrian camp, possibly the septicemic plague. An alternative hypothesis, first advanced by journalist Henry T. Aubin in 2001, is that the blockade of Jerusalem was lifted through the intervention of a Kushite army from Egypt. The battle with the Egyptians is considered unlikely to have been an outright Assyrian defeat, especially because contemporary Babylonian chronicles, otherwise eager to mention Assyrian failures, are silent on the matter.

Despite the seemingly inconclusive end to the blockade of Jerusalem, the Levantine campaign was largely an Assyrian victory. After the Assyrians had seized many of Judah&#x27;s most important fortified cities and destroyed several towns and villages, Hezekiah realized that his anti-Assyrian activities had been disastrous military and political miscalculations and accordingly submitted to the Assyrians once more. He was forced to pay a heavier tribute than previously, probably along with a heavy penalty and the tribute that he had failed to send to Nineveh from 705 to 701 BC. He was also forced to release the imprisoned king of Ekron, Padi, and Sennacherib granted substantial portions of Judah&#x27;s land to the neighboring kingdoms of Gaza, Ashdod and Ekron.

=== Resolving the Babylonian problem ===

By 700 BC, the situation in Babylonia had once again deteriorated to such an extent that Sennacherib had to invade and reassert his control. Bel-ibni now faced the open revolts of two tribal leaders: Shuzubu (who later became Babylonian king under the name Mushezib-Marduk) and Marduk-apla-iddina, now an elderly man. One of Sennacherib&#x27;s first measures was to remove Bel-ibni from the Babylonian throne, either because of incompetence or complicity, and he was brought back to Assyria, whereafter he is not heard of again in the sources. The Assyrians searched the northern marshes of Babylonia in an attempt to find and capture Shuzubu, but they failed. Sennacherib then hunted for Marduk-apla-iddina, a hunt so intense the Chaldean escaped on boats with his people across the Persian Gulf, taking refuge in the Elamite city of Nagitu. Victorious, Sennacherib attempted yet another method to govern Babylonia and appointed his son Ashur-nadin-shumi to reign as Babylonian vassal king.

Ashur-nadin-shumi was also titled &quot;māru rēštû&quot;, a title that could be interpreted either as the &quot;pre-eminent son&quot; or the &quot;firstborn son&quot;. His appointment as king of Babylon and the new title suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was being groomed to succeed Sennacherib as the king of Assyria upon his death. If &quot;māru rēštû&quot; means &quot;pre-eminent&quot; such a title would befit only the crown prince, and if it means &quot;firstborn&quot;, this also suggests that Ashur-nadin-shumi was the heir. In most cases the Assyrians followed the principle of primogeniture, wherein the oldest son inherits. More evidence in favor of Ashur-nadin-shumi being the crown prince is Sennacherib&#x27;s construction of a palace for him at the city of Assur, something Sennacherib would also do for the later crown prince Esarhaddon. As an Assyrian king of Babylon, Ashur-nadin-shumi&#x27;s position was politically important and highly delicate and would have granted him valuable experience as the intended heir to the entire Neo-Assyrian Empire.

In the years that followed, Babylonia stayed relatively quiet, with no chronicles recording any significant activity. In the meantime, Sennacherib campaigned elsewhere. His fifth campaign in 699 BC involved a series of raids against the villages around the foot of Mount Judi, located to the northeast of Nineveh. Sennacherib&#x27;s generals led other small campaigns without the king present, including a 698 BC expedition against Kirua, an Assyrian governor revolting in Cilicia, and a 695 BC campaign against the city of Tegarama. In 694 BC, Sennacherib invaded Elam, with the explicit goal of the campaign being to root out Marduk-apla-iddina and the other Chaldean refugees.

=== The Elamite campaign and revenge ===
In preparation for his attack on Elam, Sennacherib assembled two great fleets on the Euphrates and the Tigris. The latter fleet was then used to transport the Assyrian army to the city of Opis, where the ships were then pulled ashore and transported overland to a canal that linked to the Euphrates. The two fleets then combined into one and continued down to the Persian Gulf. At the head of the Persian Gulf, a storm flooded the Assyrian camp and the Assyrian soldiers had to take refuge on their ships. They then sailed across the Persian Gulf, a journey which Sennacherib&#x27;s inscriptions indicate was difficult since repeated sacrifices were made to Ea, the god of the deep.

Successfully landing on the Elamite coast, the Assyrians then hunted and attacked the Chaldean refugees, something that both Babylonian and Assyrian sources hold went well for the Assyrians. Sennacherib&#x27;s account of the campaign describe the affair as a &quot;great victory&quot; and list several cities taken and sacked by the Assyrian army. Although Sennacherib at last got his revenge on Marduk-apla-iddina, his arch-enemy had not lived to see it, having died of natural causes before the Assyrians landed in Elam. The war then took an unexpected turn as the king of Elam, Hallutash-Inshushinak I, took advantage of the Assyrian army being so far away from home to invade Babylonia. With the aid of surviving Chaldean troops, Hallutash-Inshushinak took the city of Sippar, where he also managed to capture Ashur-nadin-shumi and take him back to Elam. Ashur-nadin-shumi was then never heard from again, probably having been executed. In Ashur-nadin-shumi&#x27;s place, a native Babylonian, Nergal-ushezib, became Babylon&#x27;s king. Babylonian records ascribe Nergal-ushezib&#x27;s rise to power to being appointed by Hallutash-Inshushinak, whereas Assyrian records state that he was chosen by the Babylonians themselves.

The Assyrian army, by now surrounded by the Elamites in southern Babylonia, managed to kill the son of Hallutash-Inshushinak in a skirmish but remained trapped for at least nine months. Wishing to consolidate his position as king, Nergal-ushezib took advantage of the situation and captured and plundered the city of Nippur. Some months later, the Assyrians attacked and captured the southern city of Uruk. Nergal-ushezib was frightened by this development and called on the Elamites for aid. Just seven days after taking Uruk, the Assyrians and Babylonians met in battle at Nippur, where the Assyrians won a decisive victory; routing the Elamite-Babylonian army and capturing Nergal-ushezib, finally free from their entrapped position in the south. Through some unknown means, Sennacherib had managed to slip by the Babylonian and Elamite forces undetected some months prior and was not present at the final battle, instead probably being on his way from Assyria with additional troops. Once he rejoined his southern army, the war with Babylonia was already won.

Soon thereafter, a revolt broke out in Elam which saw the deposition of Hallutash-Inshushinak and the rise of Kutur-Nahhunte to the throne. Determined to end the threat of Elam, Sennacherib retook the city of Der, occupied by Elam during the previous conflict, and advanced into northern Elam. Kutur-Nahhunte could not organize an efficient defense against the Assyrians and refused to fight them, instead fleeing to the mountain city of Haidalu. Shortly thereafter, the severe weather forced Sennacherib to retreat and return home.

=== Destruction of Babylon ===
Despite the defeat of Nergal-ushezib and the flight of the Elamites, Babylonia did not surrender to Sennacherib. The rebel Shuzubu, hunted by Sennacherib in his 700 BC invasion of the south, had resurfaced under the name Mushezib-Marduk and, seemingly without foreign support, acceded to the throne of Babylon. As he was king by 692 BC, but not described in Assyrian sources as &quot;revolting&quot; until 691 BC, it is possible that his rule was initially accepted by Sennacherib. There was also a change in rulership in Elam, where Kutur-Nahhunte was deposed in favor of Humban-menanu, who began assembling the anti-Assyrian coalition once more. Mushezib-Marduk ensured Humban-menanu&#x27;s support by bribing him. The Assyrian records considered Humban-menanu&#x27;s decision to support Babylonia to be unintelligent, describing him as a &quot;man without any sense or judgement&quot;.

Sennacherib met his enemies in battle near the city of Halule. Humban-menanu and his commander, Humban-undasha, led the Babylonian and Elamite forces. The outcome of the Battle of Halule is unclear since the records of both sides claim a great victory. Sennacherib claims in his annals that Humban-undasha was killed and that the enemy kings fled for their lives whereas the Babylonian chronicles claim that it was the Assyrians who retreated. If the battle was a southern victory, the setback faced by the Assyrians would have to have been minor as Babylon was under siege in the late summer of 690 BC (and had apparently been under siege for some time at that point). The Assyrians had not marched on Babylon immediately, however, as military actions are recorded elsewhere. In 1973, the Assyriologist John A. Brinkman wrote that it was likely that the southerners won the battle, though probably suffering many casualties, since both of Sennacherib&#x27;s enemies still remained on their respective thrones after the fighting. In 1982, Assyriologist Louis D. Levine wrote that the battle was probably an Assyrian victory, though not a decisive one and that though the southerners had been defeated and fled, the Assyrian advance on Babylon itself was temporarily halted. The Assyrian army&#x27;s diversion from its course could then be interpreted by the Babylonian chroniclers as an Assyrian retreat.

In 690 BC, Humban-menanu suffered a stroke and his jaw became locked in a way that prevented him from speaking. Taking advantage of the situation, Sennacherib embarked on his final campaign against Babylon. Although the Babylonians were successful initially, that was short-lived, and in the same year, the siege of Babylon was already well underway. It is likely Babylon would have been in a poor position once it fell to Sennacherib in 689 BC, having been besieged for over fifteen months. Although Sennacherib had once anxiously considered the implications of Sargon&#x27;s seizure of Babylon and the role that the city&#x27;s offended gods may have played in his father&#x27;s downfall, his attitude towards the city had shifted by 689 BC. Ultimately, Sennacherib decided to destroy Babylon. Brinkman believed that Sennacherib&#x27;s change in attitude came from a will to avenge his son and tiring of a city well within the borders of his empire repeatedly rebelling against his rule. According to Brinkman, Sennacherib might have lost the affection he once had for Babylon&#x27;s gods because they had inspired their people to attack him. Sennacherib&#x27;s own account of the destruction reads:

Although Sennacherib destroyed the city, he appears to have still been somewhat fearful of Babylon&#x27;s ancient gods. Earlier in his account of the campaign, he specifically mentions the sanctuaries of the Babylonian deities had provided financial support to his enemies. The passage describing the seizure of the property of the gods and the destruction of some of their statues is one of the few where Sennacherib uses &quot;my people&quot; rather than &quot;I&quot;. Brinkman interpreted this in 1973 as leaving the blame of the fate of the temples not personally on Sennacherib himself, but on the decisions made by the temple personnel and the actions of the Assyrian people.

During the destruction of the city, Sennacherib destroyed the temples and the images of the gods, except for that of Marduk, which he took to Assyria. This caused consternation in Assyria itself, where Babylon and its gods were held in high esteem. Sennacherib attempted justifying his actions to his own countrymen through a campaign of religious propaganda. Among the elements of this campaign, he commissioned a myth in which Marduk was put on trial before Ashur, the god of Assyria. This text is fragmentary, but it seems Marduk is found guilty of some grave offense. Sennacherib described his defeat of the Babylonian rebels in the language of the Babylonian creation myth, identifying Babylon with the evil demon-goddess Tiamat and himself with Marduk. Ashur replaced Marduk in the New Year&#x27;s festival, and in the temple of the festival he placed a symbolic pile of rubble from Babylon. In Babylonia, Sennacherib&#x27;s policy spawned a deep-seated hatred amongst much of the populace.

Sennacherib&#x27;s goal was the complete eradication of Babylonia as a political entity. Though some northern Babylonian territories became Assyrian provinces, the Assyrians made no effort to rebuild Babylon itself, and southern chronicles from the time refer to the era as the &quot;kingless&quot; period when there was no king in the land.

=== Renovation of Nineveh ===
After the final war with Babylon, Sennacherib dedicated his time to improving his new capital at Nineveh rather than embarking on large military campaigns. Nineveh had been an important city in northern Mesopotamia for millennia. The oldest traces of human settlement at its location are from the 7th millennium BC, and from the 4th millennium BC and onward it formed an important administrative center in the north. When Sennacherib made the city his new capital it experienced one of the most ambitious building projects in ancient history, being completely transformed from the somewhat neglected state it had been in before his reign. Whereas his father&#x27;s new capital, Dur-Sharrukin, was more or less an imitation of the previous capital of Nimrud, Sennacherib intended to make Nineveh into a city whose magnificence and size astonished the civilized world.

The earliest inscriptions discussing the building project at Nineveh date to 702 BC and concern the construction of the Southwest Palace, a large residence constructed in the southwestern part of the citadel. Sennacherib called this palace the &quot;ekallu ša šānina la išu&quot;, the &quot;Palace without Rival&quot;. During the construction process, a smaller palace was torn down, a stream of water which had been eroding parts of the palace mound was redirected and a terrace which the new palace was to stand on was erected and raised to the height of 160 layers of brick. Though many of these early inscriptions talk about the palace as if it were already completed, this was the standard way of writing about building projects in ancient Assyria. The Nineveh described in Sennacherib&#x27;s earliest accounts of its renovation was a city which at that point only existed in his imagination.

By 700 BC the walls of the Southwest Palace&#x27;s throne room were being constructed, followed shortly by the many reliefs to be displayed within it. The final step in the palace&#x27;s construction was the erection of colossal statues depicting bulls and lions, characteristic of Late Assyrian architecture. Though such stone statues have been excavated at Nineveh, similar colossal statues mentioned in the inscriptions as being made of precious metals remain missing. The roof of the palace was constructed with cypress and cedar recovered from the mountains in the west, and the palace was illuminated through multiple windows and decorated with silver and bronze pegs on the inside and glazed bricks on the outside. The full structure, going by the mound it was built on, measured long and wide. An inscription on a stone lion in the quarter associated with Sennacherib&#x27;s queen, Tashmetu-sharrat, contains hopes that the king and queen would both live healthily and long within the new palace. The text of the inscription, written in an unusually intimate way, reads:


Though probably conceived as a structure like the palace Sargon built at Dur-Sharrukin, Sennacherib&#x27;s palace, and especially the artwork featured within it, shows some differences. Though Sargon&#x27;s reliefs usually show the king as close to other members of the Assyrian aristocracy, Sennacherib&#x27;s art usually depicts the king towering above everyone else in his vicinity due to being mounted in a chariot. His reliefs show larger scenes, some almost from a bird&#x27;s-eye point of view. There are also examples of a more naturalistic approach in the art; where colossal statues of bulls from Sargon&#x27;s palace depict them with five legs so that four legs could be seen from either side and two from the front, Sennacherib&#x27;s bulls all have four legs. Sennacherib constructed beautiful gardens at his new palace, importing various plants and herbs from throughout his empire and beyond. Cotton plants may have been imported from as far away as India. Some suggest the famous Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, were actually these gardens in Nineveh. Eckhart Frahm considers this idea unlikely on account of the impressive royal gardens in Babylon itself.

Besides the palace, Sennacherib oversaw other building projects at Nineveh. He built a large second palace at the city&#x27;s southern mound, which served as an arsenal to store military equipment and as permanent quarters for part of the Assyrian standing army. Numerous temples were built and restored, many of them on the Kuyunjik mound (where the Southwest Palace was located), including a temple dedicated to the god Sîn (invoked in the king&#x27;s own name). Sennacherib also massively expanded the city to the south and erected enormous new city walls, surrounded by a moat, up to high and thick.

=== Conspiracy, murder and succession ===

When his eldest son and original crown prince, Ashur-nadin-shumi, disappeared, presumably executed, Sennacherib selected his eldest surviving son, Arda-Mulissu, as the new crown prince. Arda-Mulissu held the position of the heir apparent for several years until 684 BC when Sennacherib suddenly replaced him with his younger brother Esarhaddon. The reason for Arda-Mulissu&#x27;s sudden dismissal is unknown, but it is clear from contemporary inscriptions that he was very disappointed. Esarhaddon&#x27;s influential mother, Naqi&#x27;a, may have played a role in convincing Sennacherib to choose Esarhaddon as heir. Despite his dismissal, Arda-Mulissu remained a popular figure, and some vassals secretly supported him as the heir to the throne.

Sennacherib forced Arda-Mulissu to swear loyalty to Esarhaddon, but Arda-Mulissu made many appeals to his father to reinstate him as heir. Sennacherib noted the increasing popularity of Arda-Mulissu and came to fear for his designated successor, so he sent Esarhaddon to the western provinces. Esarhaddon&#x27;s exile put Arda-Mulissu in a difficult position as he had reached the height of his popularity but was powerless to do anything to his brother. To take advantage of the opportunity, Arda-Mulissu decided he needed to act quickly and take the throne by force. He concluded a &quot;treaty of rebellion&quot; with another of his younger brothers, Nabu-shar-usur, and on 20 October 681 BC, they attacked and killed their father in one of Nineveh&#x27;s temples, possibly the one dedicated to Sîn.

The murder of Sennacherib, ruler of one of the world&#x27;s strongest empires at the time, shocked his contemporaries. People throughout the Near East received the news with strong emotions and mixed feelings. The denizens of the Levant and Babylonia celebrated the news and proclaimed the act as divine punishment because of Sennacherib&#x27;s brutal campaigns against them, while in Assyria the reaction was probably resentment and horror. Many sources recorded the event, including the Bible, where Arda-Mulissu is called &quot;Adrammelech&quot;.

Despite the success of their conspiracy, Arda-Mulissu could not seize the throne. The murder of the king caused some resentment against him by his own supporters which delayed his potential coronation, and in the meantime, Esarhaddon had raised an army. The army raised by Arda-Mulissu and Nabu-shar-usur met Esarhaddon&#x27;s forces in Hanigalbat, a region in the western parts of the empire. There, most of their soldiers deserted and joined Esarhaddon, who then marched on Nineveh without opposition, becoming the new king of Assyria. Shortly after taking the throne, Esarhaddon executed all of the conspirators and political enemies within his reach, including his brothers&#x27; families. Every servant involved with the security of the royal palace at Nineveh was executed. Arda-Mulissu and Nabu-shar-usur survived this purge, escaping as exiles to the northern kingdom of Urartu.

== Family and children ==

As was traditional for Assyrian kings, Sennacherib had a harem of many women. Two of his wives are known by name—Tashmetu-sharrat (&quot;Tašmetu-šarrat&quot;) and Naqi&#x27;a (&quot;Naqiʾā&quot;). Whether both held the position of queen is uncertain, but contemporary sources suggest that though the king&#x27;s family included multiple women, only one at a time would be recognized as queen and primary consort. For most of Sennacherib&#x27;s reign, the queen was Tashmetu-sharrat, whose name literally means &quot;Tashmetum is queen&quot;. Inscriptions suggest that Sennacherib and Tashmetu-sharrat had a loving relationship, with the king referring to her as &quot;my beloved wife&quot; and publicly praising her beauty.

Whether Naqi&#x27;a ever held the title of queen is unclear. She was referred to as the &quot;queen mother&quot; during Esarhaddon&#x27;s reign, but as she was Esarhaddon&#x27;s mother, the title may have been bestowed upon her either late in Sennacherib&#x27;s reign or by Esarhaddon. Though Tashmetu-sharrat was the primary consort for longer, Naqi&#x27;a is more well-known today for her role during Esarhaddon&#x27;s reign. When she became one of Sennacherib&#x27;s wives, she took the Akkadian name &quot;Zakûtu&quot; (Naqi&#x27;a being an Aramaic name). Having two names could point to Naqi&#x27;a being born outside Assyria proper—possibly in Babylonia or in the Levant—but there is no substantial evidence for any theory regarding her origin.
Sennacherib had at least seven sons and one daughter. Except for Esarhaddon, who is known to be Naqi&#x27;a&#x27;s son, which of Sennacherib&#x27;s wives were his children&#x27;s mothers is unknown. Tashmetu-sharrat is likely to have been the mother of at least some of them. Their names were:
* Ashur-nadin-shumi (&quot;Aššur-nādin-šumi&quot;) – probably Sennacherib&#x27;s eldest son. Appointed king of Babylon and crown prince in 700 BC, he served as both until his capture and execution by the Elamites in 694 BC.
* Ashur-ili-muballissu (&quot;Aššur-ili-muballissu&quot;) – probably Sennacherib&#x27;s second eldest son (he is called &quot;māru terdennu&quot;, meaning &quot;second son&quot;). He is mentioned as being &quot;begotten at the feet of Ashur&quot;, suggesting that he held some role in the priesthood. His father gave him a house at Assur, probably at some point before 700 BC, and a precious vase later excavated at Nineveh.
* Arda-Mulissu (&quot;Arda-Mulišši&quot;) – Sennacherib&#x27;s eldest living son by the time of Ashur-nadin-shumi&#x27;s death in 694 BC, he served as his crown prince from 694 BC until 684 BC, when for unknown reasons he was replaced as heir by Esarhaddon. He orchestrated the 681 BC conspiracy which ended in Sennacherib&#x27;s death in hopes of taking the throne for himself. After his troops were defeated by Esarhaddon, he escaped to Urartu.
* Ashur-shumu-ushabshi (&quot;Aššur-šumu-ušabši&quot;) – a son whose place in Sennacherib&#x27;s sequence of children is unknown. Sennacherib gave him a house in Nineveh. Bricks bearing inscriptions discussing the construction of this house were later excavated at Nineveh, possibly indicating that Ashur-shumu-ushabshi had died before the house was completed.
* Esarhaddon (&quot;Aššur-aḫa-iddina&quot;) – a younger son who served as Sennacherib&#x27;s crown prince 684–681 BC and succeeded him as the king of Assyria, reigning from 681 to 669 BC.
* Nergal-shumu-ibni (&quot;Nergal-šumu-ibni&quot;) – the reconstructed name (the full name of the prince is missing in the inscriptions) of another son of Sennacherib. He is mentioned as having employed a large staff, including a personal horse raiser called Sama. He might be the same person as an information officer mentioned in 683 BC. His name might alternatively be reconstructed as &quot;Nergal-shumu-usur&quot;. Nergal-shumu-ibni might have served as crown prince alongside Arda-Mulissu, possibly as the intended heir to Babylonia, but the evidence is inconclusive.
* Nabu-shar-usur (&quot;Nabû-šarru-uṣur&quot;) – a younger son who joined Arda-Mulissu in his plot to murder Sennacherib and seize power. He escaped with Arda-Mulissu to Urartu.
* Shadditu (&quot;Šadditu&quot;) – The only one of Sennacherib&#x27;s daughters known by name, Shadditu appears in land sale documents and protective rituals were conducted on her behalf. She was probably a daughter of Naqi&#x27;a as she retained a place in the royal family during Esarhaddon&#x27;s reign. She or another daughter was married to an Egyptian noble named Shushanqu in 672 BC.

A small tablet excavated at Nineveh lists the names of mythological Mesopotamian heroes, such as Gilgamesh, and some personal names. As the name Ashur-ili-muballissu appears in the list of personal names, alongside fragmentary names that could possibly be reconstructed as Ashur-nadin-shumi (or Ashur-shumu-ushabshi) and Esarhaddon, it is also possible that the other personal names were names of further sons of Sennacherib. These names include &quot;Ile&quot;e-bullutu-Aššur&quot;, &quot;Aššur-mukkaniš-ilija&quot;, &quot;Ana-Aššur-taklak&quot;, &quot;Aššur-bani-beli&quot;, &quot;Samaš-andullašu&quot; (or &quot;Samaš-salamšu&quot;) and &quot;Aššur-šakin-liti&quot;.

== Character ==

The main sources that can be used to deduce Sennacherib&#x27;s personality are his royal inscriptions. These inscriptions were not written by the king, but by his royal scribes. They often served as propaganda meant to portray the king as better than all other rulers, both contemporary and ancient. Furthermore, Assyrian royal inscriptions often describe only military and construction matters and were highly formulaic, differing little from king to king. By examining the inscriptions and comparing them to those of other kings and non-royal inscriptions, it is possible to infer some aspects of Sennacherib&#x27;s character. Like the inscriptions of other Assyrian kings, his show pride and high self-esteem, for instance in the passage: &quot;Ashur, father of the gods, looked steadfastly upon me among all the rulers and he made my weapons greater than (those of) all who sit on (royal) daises.&quot; In several places, Sennacherib&#x27;s great intelligence is emphasized, for instance in the passage, &quot;the god Ninshiku gave me wide understanding equal to (that of) the sage Adapu (and) endowed me with broad knowledge&quot;. Several inscriptions call him &quot;foremost of all rulers&quot; (&quot;ašared kal malkī&quot;) and a &quot;perfect man&quot; (&quot;eṭlu gitmālu&quot;). Sennacherib&#x27;s decision to keep his birth name when he became king rather than assuming a throne name, something at least 19 of his 21 immediate predecessors had done, suggests self-confidence. Sennacherib assumed several new epithets never used by Assyrian kings, such as &quot;guardian of the right&quot; and &quot;lover of justice&quot;, suggesting a desire to leave a personal mark on a new era beginning with his reign.

When Sennacherib became king, he was already an adult and had served as Sargon&#x27;s crown prince for over 15 years and understood the empire&#x27;s administration. Unlike many preceding and later Assyrian kings (including his father), Sennacherib did not portray himself as a conqueror or express much desire to conquer the world. Instead, his inscriptions often portrayed the most important parts of his reign as his large-scale building projects. Most of Sennacherib&#x27;s campaigns were not aimed at conquest, but at suppressing revolts against his rule, restoring lost territories and securing treasure to finance his building projects. That his generals led several of the campaigns, rather than Sennacherib himself, shows he was not as interested in campaigning as his predecessors had been. The brutal retribution and punishment served to Assyria&#x27;s enemies described in Sennacherib&#x27;s accounts do not necessarily reflect the truth. They also served as intimidating tools for propaganda and psychological warfare.

Despite the apparent lack of interest in world domination, Sennacherib assumed the traditional Mesopotamian titles that designated rule of the entire world; &quot;king of the universe&quot; and &quot;king of the four corners of the world&quot;. Other titles, such as &quot;strong king&quot; and &quot;mighty king&quot;, emphasized his power and greatness, along with epithets such as &quot;virile warrior&quot; (&quot;zikaru qardu&quot;) and &quot;fierce wild bull&quot; (&quot;rīmu ekdu&quot;). Sennacherib described all of his campaigns, even the unsuccessful ones, as victories in his own accounts. This was not necessarily because of personal pride; his subjects would have viewed a failed campaign as a sign that the gods no longer favored his rule. Sennacherib was fully convinced that the gods supported him and saw all his wars as just for this reason.

Frahm believes that it is possible that Sennacherib suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder because of the catastrophic fate of his father. From the sources, it appears that bad news easily enraged Sennacherib and that he developed serious psychological problems. His son and successor Esarhaddon mentions in his inscriptions that the &quot;&quot;alû&quot; demon&quot; afflicted Sennacherib and that none of his diviners initially dared to tell the king they had observed signs pointing to the demon. What the &quot;alû&quot; demon was is not entirely understood, but the typical symptoms described in contemporary documents include the afflicted not knowing who they are, their pupils constricting, their limbs being tense, being incapable of speech and their ears roaring.

Frahm and the Assyriologist Julian E. Reade have pondered the idea that Sennacherib could be classified as a feminist. Female members of the court were more prominent and enjoyed greater privileges under Sennacherib&#x27;s reign than under the reigns of previous Assyrian kings. The reasons for his policy towards his female relatives are unknown. He might have wanted to shift power away from powerful generals and magnates to his own family, having encountered powerful Arab queens who made their own decisions and led armies. He may have been compensating for the way he treated his father&#x27;s memory. Evidence of the increased standing of the royal women includes the larger number of texts referencing Assyrian queens from Sennacherib&#x27;s reign compared to queens of earlier times, and evidence that Sennacherib&#x27;s queens had their own standing military units, just like the king. Mirroring the increased standing of the women of the royal family, during Sennacherib&#x27;s time female deities were depicted more frequently. For example, the god Ashur is portrayed frequently with a female companion, probably the goddess Mullissu.

Despite Sennacherib&#x27;s superstition in regards to the fate of his father and his conviction of divine support, Reade believes that the king to some degree was skeptical of religion. Sennacherib&#x27;s ultimate treatment of Babylon, destroying the city and its temples, was sacrilege and the king appears to have neglected the temples in Assyria until he carried out a renovation of the temple of Ashur in Assur late in his reign.

== Legacy ==
=== Sennacherib in popular memory ===
Throughout the millennia following Sennacherib&#x27;s death, the popular image of the king has been mainly negative. The first reason for this is Sennacherib&#x27;s negative portrayal in the Bible as the evil conqueror who attempted to take Jerusalem; the second is his destruction of Babylon, one of the most prominent cities in the ancient world. This negative view of Sennacherib endured until modern times. Sennacherib is presented as akin to a ruthless predator, attacking Judah as a &quot;wolf on the fold&quot; in the famous 1815 poem &quot;The Destruction of Sennacherib&quot; by Lord Byron:


Biblical archaeologist Isaac Kalimi and historian Seth Richardson described Sennacherib&#x27;s 701 BC attack against Jerusalem as a &quot;world event&quot; in 2014, noting that it drew together the fates of numerous otherwise disparate groups. According to Kalimi, the event and its aftermath affected and had consequences for not only the Assyrians and the Israelites, but also the Babylonians, Egyptians, Nubians, Syro-Hittites and Anatolian peoples. The siege is discussed not only in contemporary sources, but in later folklore and traditions, such as Aramaic folklore, in later Greco-Roman histories of the Near East and in the tales of medieval Syriac Christians and Arabs. Sennacherib&#x27;s Levantine campaign is a significant event in the Bible, being brought up and discussed in many places, notably 2 Kings 18:13–19:37, 20:6 and 2 Chronicles 32:1–23. A vast majority of the Biblical accounts of King Hezekiah&#x27;s reign in 2 Kings is dedicated to Sennacherib&#x27;s campaign, cementing it as the most important event of Hezekiah&#x27;s time. In Chronicles, Sennacherib&#x27;s failure and Hezekiah&#x27;s success is emphasized. The Assyrian campaign (described as an act of aggression rather than as a response to Hezekiah&#x27;s rebellious activities) is seen as doomed to fail from the start. According to the narrative, no enemy, not even the powerful king of Assyria, would have been able to triumph over Hezekiah as the Judean king had God on his side. The conflict is presented as something akin to a holy war: God&#x27;s war against the pagan Sennacherib.

Though Assyria had more than a hundred kings throughout its long history, Sennacherib (along with his son Esarhaddon and grandsons Ashurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin) is one of the few kings who was remembered and figured in Aramaic and Syriac folklore long after the kingdom had fallen. The ancient Aramaic story of Ahikar portrays Sennacherib as a benevolent patron of the titular character Ahikar, with Esarhaddon portrayed more negatively. Medieval Syriac tales characterize Sennacherib as an archetypical pagan king assassinated as part of a family feud, whose children convert to Christianity. The legend of the 4th-century Saints Behnam and Sarah casts Sennacherib, under the name Sinharib, as their royal father. After Behnam converts to Christianity, Sinharib orders his execution, but is later struck by a dangerous disease that is cured through being baptized by Saint Matthew in Assur. Thankful, Sinharib then converts to Christianity and founds an important monastery near Mosul, called Deir Mar Mattai.

Sennacherib also occupied various roles in later Jewish tradition. In Midrash, examinations of the Old Testament and later stories, the events of 701 BC are often explored in detail; many times featuring massive armies deployed by Sennacherib and pointing out how he repeatedly consulted astrologers on his campaign, delaying his actions. In the stories, Sennacherib&#x27;s armies are destroyed when Hezekiah recites Hallel psalms on the eve of Passover. The event is often portrayed as an apocalyptic scenario, with Hezekiah portrayed as a messianic figure and Sennacherib and his armies being personifications of Gog and Magog. Sennacherib, due to the role he plays in the Bible, remains one of the most famous Assyrian kings to this day.

Sennacherib appears in Dante’s Divine Comedy, in the Purgatorio, as an exemplar of pride: “Now was shown how his sons fell upon Sennacherib inside the temple, and how, slain, they left him there” (XII. 51-54). Hollander notes that the Vulgate associates Sennacherib’s campaigns against Hezekiah with “superbia.”&lt;Dante Alighieri, Purgatorio, tr. Robert and Jean Hollander, Doubleday, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Archaeological discoveries ===

The discovery of Sennacherib&#x27;s own inscriptions in the 19th century, in which brutal and cruel acts such as ordering the throats of his Elamite enemies to be slit, and their hands and lips cut off, amplified his already ferocious reputation. Today, many such inscriptions are known, most of them housed in the collections of the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Berlin and the British Museum in London, though many are located throughout the world in other institutions and private collections. Some large objects with Sennacherib&#x27;s inscriptions remain at Nineveh, where some have even been reburied. Sennacherib&#x27;s own accounts of his building projects and military campaigns, typically referred to as his &quot;annals&quot;, were often copied several times and spread throughout the Neo-Assyrian Empire during his reign. For the first six years of his reign, they were written on clay cylinders, but he later began using clay prisms, probably because they provided a greater surface area.

Letters associated with Sennacherib are fewer in number than those known from his father and the time of his son Esarhaddon; most of them are from Sennacherib&#x27;s tenure as crown prince. Other types of non-royal inscriptions from Sennacherib&#x27;s reign, such as administrative documents, economic documents and chronicles, are more numerous. In addition to written sources, many pieces of artwork have also survived from Sennacherib&#x27;s time, notably the king&#x27;s reliefs from his palace at Nineveh. They typically depict his conquests, sometimes with short pieces of text explaining the scene shown. First discovered and excavated from 1847 to 1851 by the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard, the discovery of reliefs depicting Sennacherib&#x27;s siege of Lachish in the Southwest Palace was the first archaeological confirmation of an event described in the Bible.

The Assyriologists Hormuzd Rassam and Henry Creswicke Rawlinson from 1852 to 1854, William Kennett Loftus from 1854 to 1855 and George Smith from 1873 to 1874 led further excavations of the Southwest Palace. Among the many inscriptions found at the site, Smith discovered a fragmentary account of a flood, which generated much excitement both among scholars and the public. Since Smith, the site has experienced several periods of intense excavation and study; Rassam returned from 1878 to 1882, the Egyptologist E. A. Wallis Budge oversaw excavations from 1889 to 1891, the Assyriologist Leonard William King from 1903 to 1904 and the Assyriologist Reginald Campbell Thompson in 1905 and from 1931 to 1932. The Iraqi Department of Antiquities under the Assyriologist Tariq Madhloom conducted the most recent expeditions from 1965 to 1968. Many of Sennacherib&#x27;s reliefs are exhibited today at the Vorderasiatisches Museum, the British Museum, the Iraq Museum in Baghdad, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Louvre in Paris.

The traditional negative assessment of Sennacherib as a ruthless conqueror has faded away in modern scholarship. Writing in 1978, Reade assessed Sennacherib as a king who stands out among Assyrian rulers as open-minded and far-sighted and that he was a man &quot;who not only coped effectively with ordinary crises but even turned them to advantage as he created, or attempted to create, a stable imperial structure immune from traditional problems&quot;. Reade believes that the collapse of the Assyrian Empire within seventy years of Sennacherib&#x27;s death can be partly attributed to later kings ignoring Sennacherib&#x27;s policies and reforms. Elayi, writing in 2018, concluded that Sennacherib was different both from the traditional negative image of him and from the perfect image the king wanted to convey himself through his inscriptions, but that elements of both were true. According to Elayi, Sennacherib was &quot;certainly intelligent, skillful, with an ability of adaptation&quot;, but &quot;his sense of piety was contradictory, as, on the one hand, he impiously destroyed the statues of gods and temples of Babylon while, on the other hand, he used to consult the gods before acting and prayed to them&quot;. Elayi believes Sennacherib&#x27;s greatest flaw was &quot;his irascible, vindictive and impatient character&quot; and that he, when emotional, could be pushed to make irrational decisions.

In 2011, a huge slope was discovered in Qasr Shemamok (Kilizu) in Erbil governorate, with a multi-step staircase of very low height, the steps are built of proud bricks, and a cuneiform text was found on one of the proud bricks with which the stairs were built bearing the name of the Assyrian king Sennacherib. During the French excavations, many cuneiform inscriptions were found, most of which bear a text mentioning one of the king&#x27;s titles, mentioning the construction of wall and a palace in the city.

<text>Saaremaa (; ) is the largest and most populous island in Estonia. Measuring , its population is 31,435 (as of January 2020). The main island of the West Estonian archipelago (Moonsund archipelago), it is located in the Baltic Sea, south of Hiiumaa island and northwest of the Gulf of Riga. The administrative centre of the island, and of the Saare &quot;maakond&quot; (county), is the town of Kuressaare.

From the 13th century until the first half of the 20th century, the island of Saaremaa was known in most of the world by variants of its other historical name Ösel.

== Etymology ==
Saaremaa was called &quot;Eysýsla&quot; in the Icelandic sagas and other early medieval Scandinavian sources (Old Norse: , meaning &quot;the island district&quot;), and named in contrast with &quot;Aðalsýsla&quot; (&quot;the great district&quot;) or the Estonian mainland. The island is called in modern Estonian and in Finnish — literally &quot;land of the isle&quot; or &quot;land of the island&quot;, i.e. the same as the ancient Scandinavian name for the island.

The old Scandinavian name is also the origin of the island&#x27;s name in Danish , German and Swedish , Gutnish &quot;Oysl&quot;, and in Latin, . In Latvian, the island is called , which possibly means &quot;the island of Saami&quot;. Saaremaa may have been the historic Ultima Thule.

== History ==


According to archaeological finds, the territory of Saaremaa has been inhabited from at least 5000 BCE. Nordic Iron Age ship burials, dated to 700–750 CE, have been found in Sõrve Peninsula. Sagas talk about numerous skirmishes between the islanders and Vikings. Saaremaa was and the home of notorious pirates, sometimes called the Eastern Vikings. The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia describes a fleet of sixteen ships and 500 Osilians ravaging the area that is now southern Sweden, then belonging to Denmark.

Probably around 1000, Gunnar Hámundarson from Iceland took part in a Viking raid at Eysýsla (Saaremaa). There he obtained his famous atgeir, by taking it from a man named Hallgrímur. &quot;Njáls saga&quot; tells the following:

The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia describes a fleet of sixteen ships and five hundred pirates from Saaremaa ravaging the area that is now southern Sweden, then belonging to Denmark. The XIVth book of Gesta Danorum, Saxo Grammaticus describes a subsequent battle on Öland in 1170 in which the Danish king Valdemar I mobilized his entire fleet to curb the incursions of pirates from &quot;Couronia&quot; (Courland) and Saaremaa.

Perhaps the most renowned raid by the inhabitants of Saaremaa occurred in 1187, with the attack on the Swedish town of Sigtuna (other candidates as raiders are Karelians and Curonians). Among the casualties of this raid was the Swedish archbishop Johannes. Archaeological excavations have not verified the traditions of destruction of the town. Normal life in Sigtuna continued until town started to slowly lose its importance during 13th century due to navigability problems caused by post-glacial rebound.

In 1227, Saaremaa was conquered by the Livonian Brothers of the Sword during the Livonian Crusade but the resistance of the local inhabitants remained strong. The crusaders founded the Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek there. When the Order was defeated by the Lithuanian army in the Battle of Saule in 1236, the Saaremaa islanders rebelled. The conflict was ended by a treaty that was signed by the Osilians and the Master of the Order. In the following year, the Sword-Brothers were absorbed into the Teutonic Order. As the crusaders&#x27; hold on Saaremaa got stronger, Christianity also became more established on the island, and to this day Saaremaa has a unique set of medieval churches in Kaarma, Karja, Kihelkonna, Muhu, Pöide, Püha and Valjala churches. The crusader&#x27;s fortress Kuressaare Castle, known in German as Schloss Arensburg, was built by the Teutonic Order for the bishops of Ösel–Wiek (Estonian: Saare-Lääne). Construction began in 1380 and it is one of the most well-preserved medieval castles in Estonia and bears testimony to the late Medieval Age.

During the 14th–16th centuries, and possibly earlier, inhabitants of Saaremaa started to resettle into areas surrounding the Baltic Sea and, for example, to establish villages on the Livonian coast.

Most of Saaremaa was ruled directly by the Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek, while some parts were enfeoffed to the Livonian Order. In 1559, the bishopric and Saaremaa were sold to Denmark, becoming part of Danish Estonia. From 1570 until 1645 the entire island was under Danish possession.

In 1645, Saaremaa was ceded from Denmark to Sweden by the Treaty of Brömsebro. In 1721, along with the rest of Livonia, Saaremaa (then known by its Swedish name of Ösel) was ceded to the Russian Empire by the Treaty of Nystad, becoming a part of the Governorate of Livonia.

In 1840, the first spa opened in Kuressaare (then known as Arensburg), and the town experienced renaissance and became a popular seaside resort.

During World War I, the West Estonian Archipelago was conquered by Imperial German Army in October 1917 (Operation Albion) and remained occupied by Germans until the end of hostilities in November 1918. Thereafter Saaremaa became part of the newly independent Republic of Estonia. Most of the local Baltic German population of the island was resettled to Germany following the August 1939 Nazi–Soviet Pact. During World War II, the island was first occupied by the Soviet Red Army in June 1940 and, along with the rest of Estonian territory, formally annexed into the Stalinist USSR in August 1940. On 8 August 1941, Soviet Naval Aviation started a on Berlin from Saaremaa. The island was then invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany later (Operation Beowulf). German troops were expelled and the island was reoccupied by the Soviet Red Army in the Moonsund Landing Operation in October and November 1944. In 1946, the Soviet military authorities declared Saaremaa a restricted zone closed to all non-local civilians, i.e., mainland Estonians and foreigners. It remained a restricted area until 1989. Estonia regained full independence in August 1991.

== Geography ==

The island forms the main barrier between the Gulf of Riga and the Baltic Sea. To the south of it is the main passage out of the gulf, the Irbe Strait, next to Sõrve Peninsula, the southernmost portion of the island. In medieval times islanders crossed the strait to form fishing villages on the Livonian coast, notably Pitrags. In those days it was easier and quicker to cross the strait towards nearby Kolka, Saunags or Mazirbe, than travel by horse large distances inland. The highest point on the island is 54 m above sea level. The Kaali crater is on the island. The island has much forested terrain. One of the symbols of the island is the juniper.

=== Nature ===
More than 10,000 years ago the first parts of Saaremaa arose from the Baltic Ice Lake. The uplift of the Earth&#x27;s crust is continuing even today at a rate of per year. The West Estonian islands are low-lying plains resting on limestone; their average elevation is roughly above sea level. Limestone has become denuded in a great number of places, resulting in cliffs, limestone pits and quarries at Mustjala, Ninase, Pulli, Üügu and Kaugatuma.

Because of its mild maritime climate and a variety of soils, Saaremaa has a rich flora, illustrated by the fact that 80% of the plant species found in Estonia are represented here. Altogether 1200 species of vascular plants can be found in Saaremaa. About 120 of the local plant species are rare ones that have received special protection status. The most famous endemic species is Rhinanthus osiliensis, a rare little flower growing mostly in spring fens. Rare and beautiful flowers are widespread; out of the 36 species found in Estonia, 35 of them are found on Saaremaa and its adjacent islands.

Over 40% of Saaremaa is covered with forests, most of which are mixed forests, but in some areas, one can find broad-leaved (deciduous) trees, which are relicts of plant communities of former milder climatic periods. Wooded meadows were common in Saaremaa before World War II, but many of these unique natural complexes have gradually become overgrown and thus converted into the ordinary forest. The same is true for alvars (limestone areas covered with thin soil and stunted vegetation). Once a typical and exclusive landscape element in Saaremaa alvars are now in decline. Nature conservation planning for Saaremaa now includes protection of the largest and most unusual alvar areas.

Saaremaa has a wide variety of rare wildlife species, ranging from insects to seals. The smallest protected wildlife species in terms of size include the clouded apollo butterflies and Roman snails.

The coastal areas of Saaremaa are well-known seal habitats; in fact, the indigenous gray seal can be found in three large permanent resting areas on the islets off the coast in the western and southern parts of Saaremaa. Nowadays, the local population of said seals is slightly increasing . Ringed seals can be encountered everywhere in the coastal waters of Saaremaa but, because of their timidity, it has not been possible to make an estimation of their number.

The islands lie in the East Atlantic Flyway, a migration path of waterfowl. This &quot;bird road&quot; connects northeastern Europe with Arctic regions. Each year hundreds of thousands of migratory birds visit Saaremaa in spring and autumn. The barnacle goose, mute swan, whooper swan, eider, shelduck and a great many other bird species have been given protection status. But on the whole, the islands are somewhat poorer in wildlife species than the mainland. Neither mole, mink, nor otter can be found here, whilst the Eurasian lynx and the brown bear are infrequent guests.

=== Kaali Meteorite ===

Kaali is a small group of nine unique meteorite craters on Saaremaa. The largest of the craters measures in diameter and contains a small lake, known as &quot;Kaali järv&quot; (&quot;Lake Kaali&quot;). The meteor cluster had an impact velocity of and a mass of . At the altitude of the meteor broke into pieces. The largest fragment produced the main crater with a depth of .

Eight smaller craters with diameters ranging from and depths varying from are all within of the main crater. The age estimates of the crater vary, with 4000 ± 1000 BCE being a commonly accepted estimate, though other estimates suggest the explosion was as recent as 660 ± 85 BCE. The energy of the impact—about 80 TJ (20 kilotons of TNT), comparable with the Hiroshima bomb—burned forests within a radius of of the impact site. There are numerous legends related to the crater; these are summarized by Lennart Meri in his book &quot;Hõbevalge&quot;.

=== Resources ===
Dolomite, limestone, curative mud, mineral water, ceramic clay, sand, and gravel are the major local resources. Of these local resources, dolomite is perhaps the most famous above all.

== Characteristics ==
The majority of the island&#x27;s population is Estonian (97%). The two most numerous ethnic minorities, Russians and Finns, together comprise less than 3% of the inhabitants. Compared to the Republic of Estonia on the whole, the population of Saare County and particularly of Kuressaare town is younger, whereas the number of the retired people is considerably smaller. Saaremaa is located in the heart of the Baltic region, which is one of the most rapidly growing markets in Europe, with 70 million consumers. The island&#x27;s &quot;Gates to the West&quot; include the reconstructed Kuressaare Airport and Roomassaare Harbour, the operation of modern ferries between Saaremaa and the Estonian mainland, and the rapid development of the telecommunications. Saaremaa is also a significant tourist destination, revisited by 35% of foreign and 95% of domestic tourists.

== Transportation ==
Saaremaa is reached by TS Laevad&#x27;s ferries from Virtsu on the Estonian mainland to Kuivastu on Muhu island, which is itself connected to Saaremaa by a causeway, the Väinatamm. Saaremaa can also be reached by ferry from Sõru on the island of Hiiumaa to Triigi. There are also passenger services from Roomassaare to the smaller island of Abruka. During many winters it is possible to drive to Saaremaa by an ice road between the mainland and Muhu or between Saaremaa and the island of Hiiumaa.

There are regular bus services from Tallinn, Pärnu and Tartu on the mainland, which use the ferry from Virtsu to Muhu.

Kuressaare Airport offers regular flights to Tallinn operated by NyxAir. There are regular services to Ruhnu and Pärnu operated by Diamond Sky.

Historically there was a Soviet air base at Aste Airfield during the Cold War. Plans to connect Saaremaa to the mainland by either bridge or tunnel are being studied.

== Sport ==
FC Kuressaare competes in the first tier of Estonian football, the Meistriliiga. Saaremaa has been competing in the biannual Island Games since 1991.

There are three main international traditional sport events in Saaremaa:

Saaremaa Rally takes place every year in October and attracts thousands of rally fans. The first rally was an amateur competition and it took place in 1974. The first professional competition took place in 1975 and from 1993 the rally has been international.

Saaremaa Velotuur is a group race of road cyclists that is oldest in the Nordic countries (held since 1957) and the only international one in the Baltic states.

Saaremaa three-day running marathon takes place on the roads around Kuressaare town and Sõrve peninsula. The main race consists of three different runs, which are held on three sequential days (10+16,195+16=42,195 km). The first marathon was held in 1974.

<text>In firearm designs, the term single-shot refers to guns that can hold only a single round of ammunition inside and thus must be reloaded manually after every shot. Compared to multi-shot repeating firearms (&quot;repeaters&quot;), single-shot designs have no moving parts other than the trigger, hammer/firing pin or frizzen, and therefore do not need a sizable receiver behind the barrel to accommodate a moving action, making them far less complex and more robust than revolvers or magazine/belt-fed firearms, but also with much slower rates of fire.

The history of firearms began with muzzleloading single-shot firearms such as the hand cannon and arquebus, then multi-barreled designs such as the derringer appeared, and eventually many centuries passed before breechloading repeating firearms became commonplace. Although largely disappeared from military usage due to insufficient firepower, single-shot firearms are still produced by many manufacturers in both muzzleloading and cartridge-firing varieties, from zip guns and ultra-concealable pocket pistols to the highest-quality hunting and match rifles.

==History==
===Pre-cartridge era===

The vast majority of firearms before the introduction of metallic cartridges from the 1860s onwards were single-shot muzzleloaders . However, multi-barrel, breechloading, revolving, and other multi-shot firearms had been experimented with for centuries. Notable pre-cartridge era single-shot firearms included matchlock, wheellock, snaplock, doglock, miquelet lock, flintlock, and percussion cap firearms. Muzzleloaders included the Brown Bess, Charleville and Springfield Model 1861 muskets, the Kentucky and Mississippi rifles, and the duelling pistol. There were also early breech-loading single-shot rifles, such as those manufactured by Hall, Ferguson, and Sharps.

===Cartridge era===
====Rifles====
Almost all of the early cartridge-fed rifles were single-shot designs, taking advantage of the strength and simplicity of single-shot actions. A good example is the &quot;trapdoor&quot; or Allin action used in early cartridge conversions of 1863 Springfield muzzleloading rifles. The conversion consisted of filing out (or later milling out) the rear of the barrel, and attaching a folding bolt, the &quot;trapdoor&quot;, that flipped up and forwards to allow the cartridge to be loaded in the breech. Once loaded, the bolt was closed and latched in place, holding the round securely in place. The bolt contained a firing pin that used the existing percussion hammer, so no changes were required to the lock. After firing, the act of opening the bolt would partially extract the fired case from the chamber, allowing it to be removed. In 1866, the United States standardized on the Springfield Model 1866 rifle and .50-70 cartridge, chambered in trapdoor conversions of rifled muskets that had been used in the American Civil War. The trapdoor mechanism continued usage in 1873 with the adoption of the Springfield Model 1873 rifle and .45-70 cartridge. The Springfield Model 1873 rifle stayed in service until 1892 when it was replaced by the Krag–Jørgensen bolt-action rifle from 1892 until 1903.

Another muzzleloader conversion similar in concept to the Allin action was the British Snider–Enfield, also introduced in 1866, which hinged to the side rather than forward. Unlike the US Army, which kept its trapdoors for decades, the British soon moved beyond the Snider to the more sophisticated dropping-block Martini action derived from the Peabody action. Martini–Henrys were the standard British rifles of the late Victorian era, and Martini–Enfield conversions continued in second-line service until the Second World War.

Single-shot rifles were the preferred tools of big-game hunters in the late 19th century. The buffalo hunters of the American West used Sharps, Remington, and Springfield single-shots; ivory and trophy hunters in Africa and Asia used Martini and break-action &quot;express rifles&quot; and &quot;elephant guns.&quot; These rifles were designed for very large black-powder cartridges, from military-issue .45-70 on up to the enormous .50-140 Sharps and .500 Express; early repeating actions were not capable of handling rounds of this power and physical size. The single-shot big-game rifle would only be displaced by bolt-action repeaters firing high-velocity smokeless-powder cartridges in the early 20th century.

After the advent of high-powered repeating rifles, single-shot rifles were primarily used for target shooting matches, with the first official match shooting event, opening at Creedmoor, Long Island in 1872. From about 1872 until the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917, target shooting with single-shot rifles was nearly as popular in America as golf is today. During that golden age of match shooting, the most popular target rifles were made by Bullard, Stevens, Remington, Maynard, Ballard, Farrow, and Winchester. Calibers used by some of these rifles during matches ranged from the .25-20 Winchester, .32-40 Winchester, .33 Winchester, .35 Winchester, .38-55 Winchester, .40-50 Winchester, .40-70 Winchester, .44-105 Winchester, etc. for over shooting at Creedmoor. But two calibers maintained consistency throughout their tenure during the single-shot era: the .32-40 and the .38-55 calibers. The minimum standard in the beginning of the sport had been firing from the standing position (off-hand position). No rifle scopes, no bench rests, no prone (lying down on the front) positions, but shooting, as famed rifle barrel maker, &quot;Harry Melville Pope&quot; (1861–1950), once stated, &quot;standing on his hind legs and shooting like a man.&quot; The .32-40 and .38-55 were able to buck the wind better at , and not wear the rifleman out by heavy recoil, all while sustaining great accuracy. In the end, though, it was the .32-40 single-shot rifle that became the dean of match shooters, as the recoil from the .38-55 took its toll after hundreds of rounds had been fired during a match.

In 1878, John Moses Browning patented arguably the greatest single-shot rifle ever produced: after Browning sold his design to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company it was brought out as the Winchester Model 1885 Rifle. Although fewer than 200,000 Model 1885 Single Shots were built, they remained in production from 1885 to 1920.

Remington, Sharps, and Browning all made single-shot rifles using different actions, such as the rolling block and falling block. These rifles were originally chambered in large black-powder cartridges, such as the .50-110 Winchester, and were used for hunting large game, often bison. Later production rifles would be in popular smokeless powder cartridges, such as the .30-40 Krag.

Single-shot rifles co-existed for some time with the lever-action rifle, but they began to fade out of manufacture with the advent of reliable bolt-action rifles.

====Pistols====
The handgun began as a single-shot weapon in China in the 14th century. In its many versions, it remained a muzzle-loaded weapon until the advent of the metallic cartridge in the first third of the 18th century. Such single-shot cartridge-firing pistols were short-lived, as revolver technology evolved rapidly, and cartridge conversions existed for the common models of cap and ball revolvers. Two forms of single-shot pistol, however, remained: single-shot derringers, and target pistols, which were essentially single-shot rifle actions cut down to pistol size. The Remington Rolling Block is perhaps the most well-known of these. As the era of single-shot rifles faded, so did these early single-shot pistols.

In 1907, J. Stevens Arms, a maker of inexpensive break-open single-shot rifles in pistol calibers, started making pistol versions of their rifles. This pistol was chambered in .22 Long Rifle and came with adjustable iron sights and grips designed for target shooting. These models were discontinued in 1939.

====Shotguns====
Single-barrel shotguns have always been popular as an inexpensive alternative to double-barreled shotguns. They are almost always break-open designs, like the double-barreled designs, but far less expensive since they do not require the precise aligning of parallel barrels. Single-barrel shotguns are also lighter, which can be an advantage if they are carried hunting, though it does mean they have more felt recoil. They are not widely used in shotgun sports, as most events require the ability to quickly fire two successive shots.

The single-barrel shotgun is often referred to as a &quot;kitchen door gun&quot; or a &quot;farm gun&quot; due to its low cost as a self-defense weapon.

==Types of single-shot cartridge actions==

===Trapdoor actions===
The earliest metallic-cartridge breechloaders designed for general military issue began as conversions of muzzle-loading rifle muskets. The upper rear portion of the barrel was filed or milled away and replaced by a hinged breechblock which opened upward to permit loading. An internal angled firing pin allowed the re-use of the rifle&#x27;s existing side-hammer. The Allin action made by Springfield Arsenal in the US hinged forward; the Snider–Enfield used by the British opened to the side. Whereas the British quickly replaced the Snider with a dropping-block Peabody-style Martini action, the US Army felt the trapdoor action to be adequate and followed its muzzleloader conversions with the new-production Springfield Model 1873, which was the principal longarm of the Indian Wars and was still in service with some units in the Spanish–American War.

Other trapdoor actions include the rare Confederate Tarpley carbine, the Austrian Wanzl, the Belgian Albini-Braendlin rifle and Terssen conversion (some of which were made from French 1777 pattern flintlocks), the M1842/59/67 Swiss Milbank-Amsler, the M1859/67 Spanish Berdan, and the Colt-manufactured Russian Berdan Type I. All of these designs save the 1863 Tarpley date from the period 1865–1869, and all but the Tarpley and the Russian Berdan were conversions from muzzle-loaders.

===Break actions===

Perhaps the most common type of single-shot action, usually found in shotguns, small pistols, and black-powder &quot;elephant&quot; guns, a break action connects the barrel assembly to the breechblock with a hinge. When a locking latch is released, the barrel assembly pivots away from the receiver, opening the breech and sometimes on higher quality firearms, partially extracting the spent cartridge.

===Rolling block actions===

In a rolling block action, the breechblock takes the form of a part-cylinder, with a pivot pin through its axis. The operator rotates or &quot;rolls&quot; the block to open and close the breech; it is a simple, rugged and reliable design. Rolling blocks are most often associated with firearms made by Remington in the later 19th century; in the Remington action the hammer serves to lock the breech closed at the moment of firing, and the block, in turn, prevents the hammer from falling with the breech open. An interesting variation of the rolling block was the Austrian M1867 Werndl–Holub, in which the pivot pin was parallel to the barrel and the block rotated sideways.

===Dropping block actions===
These are actions wherein the breechblock lowers or &quot;drops&quot; into the receiver to open the breech, usually actuated by an underlever. There are two principal types of dropping block: the tilting or pivoting block and the falling or sliding block.

====Tilting block actions====
In a tilting or pivoting block action, the breechblock is hinged at the rear (in contrast with tilting bolt, which is not hinged). When the lever is operated, the block tilts down and forward, exposing the chamber. The best-known pivoting block designs are the Peabody, the Peabody–Martini, and Ballard actions.

The original Peabody rifles, manufactured by the Providence Tool Company, used a manually cocked side-hammer. Swiss gunsmith Friedrich Martini devised an action that resembled the Peabody but incorporated a hammerless striker cocked by the operating lever with the same motion that pivoted the block. The 1871 Martini–Henry which replaced the &quot;trapdoor&quot; Snider–Enfield was the standard British Army rifle of the later Victorian era, and the Martini was also a popular action for civilian rifles.

Charles H. Ballard&#x27;s self-cocking tilting-block action was produced by the Marlin Firearms Company from 1875 and earned a superlative reputation among long-range &quot;Creedmoor&quot; target shooters. Surviving Marlin Ballards are today highly prized by collectors, especially those mounted in the elaborate Swiss-style &quot;Schützen&quot; stocks of the day.

====Falling block actions====

In a falling or sliding block action the block does not pivot but rather slides vertically in a slot milled into the receiver. Falling blocks are among the strongest small-arm actions ever produced, and are also used in heavy artillery. Well-known falling block designs include the Sharps rifles and carbines, the Browning/Winchester Single Shot, the Farquharson rifle, and the modern Ruger No. 1.

===Bolt-actions===

Although bolt-actions are usually associated with fixed or detachable box magazines, in fact, the first general-issue military breechloader was a single-shot bolt-action: the paper-cartridge Prussian needle gun of 1841. France countered in 1866 with its superior Chassepot rifle, also a paper-cartridge bolt-action. The first metallic-cartridge bolt-actions in general military service were the Berdan Type II introduced by Russia in 1870, the Mauser Model 1871, and a modified Chassepot, the Gras rifle of 1874; all these were single-shots.

Today most top-level smallbore match rifles are single-shot bolt-actions.

Single-shot bolt-actions in .22 caliber were also widely manufactured as inexpensive &quot;boys&#x27; guns&quot; in the earlier 20th century; and there have been a few single-shot bolt-action shotguns, usually in .410 bore.

===Other single-shot actions===
*The Ferguson rifle: British Major Patrick Ferguson designed his rifle, considered to be the first military breechloader, in the 1770s. A plug-shaped breechblock was screw-threaded so that rotating the handle underneath would lower and raise it for loading with ball and powder; the flintlock action still required conventional priming.
*The Hall rifle: The United States&#x27; first breechloading cavalry carbine, the Hall was introduced in 1819. The lever tipped the breechblock including the chamber upwards and back, allowing it to be loaded with powder and ball without the inconvenience of loading and ramming from the muzzle. Originally flintlocks, Halls later were made as or converted to percussion locks.
*The Kammerlader: A crank-operated Norwegian firearm produced around the time of the Prussian Needle-gun. Originally used a paper cartridge. Later many were converted to rimfire.
*The Burnside carbine: Invented by future-general Ambrose Burnside in 1857, this percussion-cap carbine became the third-most common cavalry breechloader in the Civil War after the Sharps and Spencer. Essentially a modification of the Hall concept, the Burnside featured a unique conical cartridge with a crushable hollow front rim, designed to seal the breech on closing.
*The Rising breech carbine: An unusual action produced by Bilharz, Hall and Co. for the southern Confederacy, the rising breech&#x27;s underlever caused the breechblock including the chamber to slide vertically above the line of the barrel, the reverse of a falling-block; the chamber was loaded from the front with a paper cartridge.
*The Morse Carbine: Its action is similar to the Hall rifle but the shape of its chamber is different.
*Winchester Model 55: An unconventional hybrid of a single-shot and a semi-automatic, this .22-caliber rifle ejected the fired case and recocked itself like a conventional blowback-operated self-loader, but it lacked a magazine and had to be manually reloaded for each shot.
*&quot;&#x27;Screw Barrel Actions&#x27;&quot;:
The OSS stinger pen pistol and several other clandestine pen guns, as well as homemade zip guns often made using plumbing parts, and cane guns used for both defense and poaching use a screw thread to attach the chambered barrel to a receiver with some sort of breech and firing pin. The user unscrews the barrel from the receiver to expose the chamber to load a cartridge. The RN50 .50 BMG single-shot rifle uses a similar screwthread breech cap to allow an otherwise simple break-action to contain a .50 BMG cartridge.

==Modern single-shots==

Although non-cartridge single-shot firearms are still made in hobbyist contexts (for example, replicas of antique guns), this discussion focuses on newer designs employing cartridges.

===Pistols===
The modern era of single-shot firearms is most visible in the realm of pistols. Remington introduced the single-shot bolt-action XP-100 pistol in 1963, which heralded the era of high-performance, high-velocity pistols. The .221 Fireball cartridge lived up to its name by reaching velocities of from a barrel. Essentially a shortened .222 Remington, the compact .221 Fireball delivered accuracy exceeding many rifles, out to ranges unheard of for other handguns.

Even bigger than the XP-100, the 1967 introduction of the Thompson Center Arms Contender pistol changed handgun sports forever. The Contender was a break-open design that allowed barrels to be changed by the shooter in minutes. Available in calibers from .22 Long Rifle up to .45-70, and in barrel lengths of , the Contender could, in the right hands, handle any type of game, and delivered rifle-like accuracy to match the XP-100.

Many other manufacturers make single-shot pistols, most based on the bolt-action rifle, with barrels generally ranging from . Single-shots dominate handgun metallic silhouette shooting and are the most common type used for hunting.

Single-shot pistols have sometimes found popularity among insurgents, resistance fighters, and street gangs. The mass-produced, low-cost Liberator pistol of World War II, which was manufactured and distributed by U.S. forces to Allied resistance forces and guerrilla fighters as an assassination pistol, is the most common example of a mass-produced single-shot pistol. More than a million units were produced and distributed freely, and many remain in private hands. A few varieties of zip guns could also be considered single-shot pistols. In recent years, these improvised firearms have become more common in the hands of criminals and insurgents, especially when manufactured firearms are difficult to acquire.

===Rifles===

====Ruger====

In 1966, Sturm, Ruger introduced their first true rifle, Ruger No. 1, which uses a falling-block action and is available in a wide selection of calibers from .22 Hornet to .458 Winchester Magnum. The No. 1 has always been sought after by shooters who appreciate the compact size of a single-shot rifle, and the falling block action cuts about off the length of the rifle for a given barrel length. From 1972 to 1987, Ruger also made a less expensive version of the #1, the #3. The #3, which sold for about half the price of a #1, used a simplified, non-locking lever for the falling block action, and came with an uncheckered stock.

====Browning====
In 1985, Browning re-introduced the famous Winchester Model 1885 single-shot rifles in popular calibers but under the Browning name. Although the rifle gained fame under the Winchester brand name, it was John Moses Browning that designed the rifle, selling the rights to Winchester in the early 1880s and was in production from 1885 to 1920.

====Cooper====

The majority of rifles made by Cooper are single-shot bolt-action rifles. Many of their rifles are specially crafted to suit long-range varmint hunting, where the accuracy of the single-shot action is helpful.

====Remington====
Remington has once again made their No. 1 Rolling Block rifles available through their custom shop.

====New England Firearms (H&amp;R)====
One of the most common single-action rifles would be the New England Firearms&#x27; inexpensive break-open rifles, which are built on their 12 gauge break-open shotgun actions. The rifles, however, are made on a heat-treated steel action, and the shotgun actions are not heat-treated. Any rifle frame may accept rifle or shotgun barrels. The shotgun frames, however, are only safe for shotgun barrels. These were originally built by Harrington &amp; Richardson starting in 1871. H&amp;R was later acquired by NEF, and both are now part of the Marlin Firearms family. Rifles are sold both under the NEF and the H&amp;R names. These rifles are quite accurate, and often less than half the price of a bolt-action rifle in the same caliber.

====Winchester====
In 2005, Winchester re-marketed their legendary Model 1885 Single Shot Rifle, under their &quot;Limited Series&quot; category. The modern calibers of .17 were offered in a Low-Wall design, and the .243 Winchester and .30-06 Springfield were of the High-Wall design. The most faithful of the reproductions are the &quot;Traditional Hunter Limited Series&quot; Model 1885 Single Shots, as they have the original style steel crescent butt plates, and folding steel tang rear sights, with full-length octagon barrels. The Traditional Hunters are chambered in the 19th-century calibers of .45-90 Sharps, .45-70 Government, .405 Winchester, and .38-55 Winchester. Test firing of some of these Winchesters showed that they are high quality in construction, using the latest technology and modern steel, they are stronger and safer than their 19th-century predecessors, and accuracy from their factory (non-custom) barrels were exceptionally good; especially at .

====Sharps====
Sharps rifles were a staple of the buffalo hunters in the late 19th century. Recently, they have had a resurgence in popularity for hunting large game as well as historical firearms events and black-powder cartridge (BPCR) competitions. Much of the current popularity is due to the film Quigley Down Under that featured a Sharps Model 1874 rifle. The popularity of Cowboy action shooting has also affected the availability of single-shot rifles, with many replicas of the old black-powder rifles, particularly the Sharps, now being available.

====Barrett M99====
The Barrett M99 is a single-shot, bolt-action, bullpup sniper rifle. It is chambered in .50 BMG, and .416 Barrett round that has 0.5 MOA accuracy at ranges that far exceed one mile.

====Denel NTW-20====
The Denel NTW-20 is a bolt-action, anti-materiel, or large-caliber sniper rifle. With a buffered slide in the receiver, the barrel can recoil inside the frame, allowing for large rounds to be fired with relative ease by the user. It is chambered for 20×82mm Mauser, 14.5×114mm, and 20×110mm Hispano-Suiza round. Specifically, it is only a single-shot when chambered to the 20mm Hispano-Suiza round, while the remaining chamberings fed from 3-round magazines.

====Steyr====
The original version of Steyr HS .50 is a single-shot bolt-action sniper rifle. It is chambered in .50 BMG (or .460 Steyr) and can reach ranges from .

<text>Simon the Sorcerer is a 1993 point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Adventure Soft, for Amiga and MS-DOS. The game&#x27;s story focuses on a boy named Simon who is transported into a parallel universe of magic and monsters, where he embarks on a mission to become a wizard and rescue another from an evil sorcerer. The game&#x27;s setting was inspired by the novels of the &quot;Discworld&quot; series, and incorporates parodies on fantasy novels and fairy tales, such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Jack and the Beanstalk. The lead character&#x27;s design was inspired by that of the fictional British television character Blackadder, with the character voiced by Chris Barrie in the CD re-release.

The game was well received by critics, who praised the humour, graphics and gameplay, with some minor criticism towards the plot. &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; went on to become a video game series, with a sequel in 1995, &quot;Simon the Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe&quot;. The game was later released for PC, via GOG.com, in 2008, with a 20th Anniversary Edition developed by MojoTouch and released on Google Play in 2013.

== Gameplay ==

As a point-and-click adventure game, the player controls the protagonist of the story, Simon, by using the mouse; with exception to the iOS and Android versions, which feature touchscreen controls. Gameplay involves players moving Simon around locations in the game, interacting with objects and other characters at each site. The player can make Simon perform actions via verbal commands such as &quot;Look at&quot;, &quot;Talk to&quot;, and &quot;Give&quot;, with objects that are picked up being placed into an inventory - using such items requires the right verbal command and then selecting the target for that object. The game primarily involves talking to people for information, including hints to solving puzzles or acquiring items, and using the correct items to solve puzzles during the course of the game. A menu system is provided for loading, saving and quitting the game via a postcard contained in the inventory, with a fast-travel system provided in the form of a map in the inventory that can be used up until a certain point in the game&#x27;s story.

== Synopsis ==
===Setting===
The game&#x27;s story takes in a parallel universe to the real world, in which magic and monsters exist, though with some modern items and elements being found within. The game&#x27;s world features elements that are parodies of those from popular fantasy novels and fairy tales, including Rapunzel, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Discworld&quot;, The Chronicles of Narnia, Jack and the Beanstalk, and the Three Billy Goats Gruff.

===Plot===
On his 12th birthday, a young boy named Simon is surprised when he receives a dog as a present from his parents, which he names Chippy. Unknown to Simon, his parents found the dog at their front door without warning, wrapped in paper, and possessing a book that nobody could read and which was eventually dumped in the loft. Sometime after his birthday, Simon hears Chippy playing around in the loft, to which he discovers it holding the book in its mouth. Reading it, he notes it is titled &quot;Ye Olde Spellbooke&quot;, and unwittingly reads out a spell on one of the pages. A portal suddenly appears, which Chippy enters. Simon follows after him and winds up in another world, dressed in a wizard&#x27;s robe. After Simon escapes a group of goblins with Chippy&#x27;s help, he soon finds his way to a village with the dog&#x27;s help, and brought to the home of the wizard Calypso.

Inside the house, Simon finds a letter addressed to him from Calypso, who reveals he was responsible for bringing him into his world in hopes he could help defeat the evil sorcerer Sordid. Simon learns that Calypso has since been kidnapped and that he must rescue the wizard in order to be able to go home. Per Calypso&#x27;s instructions, Simon meets with a group of wizards in the village pub and have them make him a wizard. Carrying out a task set by them and paying them a small fee, Simon is made a wizard, and works to find the items needed to breach Sordid&#x27;s mountain lair. After gaining entry to the tower with a potion that shrinks him, Simon overcomes further difficulties before returning to normal height to explore the tower. In Sordid&#x27;s bedroom, he learns that the sorcerer created a wand that can turn people into stone, which can only be destroyed in the Fiery Pits of Rondor where Sordid had travelled to. Finding the wand in the tower, Simon uses a teleporter to reach Rondor, destroys the wand, and then defeats Sordid by pushing him into the fiery pits.

Sent back to his world, Simon awakens in his bedroom, assuming it was a dream. However, another portal opens in his room, whereupon a large gloved hand appears to take him back through.

== Development and release ==
Mike Woodroffe, &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot;″s director and producer, wanted to create the game to exploit a market for comic adventure games, which he realised existed due to the success of &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. His son, Simon, penned the script. He was inspired by Terry Pratchett (Adventure Soft originally intended to make a &quot;Discworld&quot; game, but were unable to obtain a licence), and he and his father hoped that he would become involved with the game. Although he chose not to become involved, the script still contained much original humour. Many scenes are based on fairy tales, and the Wise Owl was modelled on Patrick Moore. Woodroffe said that Adventure Soft (then known as HorrorSoft) had done enough horror games and wanted to try a comedy game. The change in genre prompted the name change.

Simon Woodroffe explained that the character of Simon was a mixture of Blackadder, Rincewind, and Guybrush, and that he was originally intended to be a trainee wizard, similar to Harry Potter. He also explained that he was invented because they needed a character to compete with characters such as Rincewind, and that the game was inspired by the &quot;Discworld&quot; books and &quot;Monkey Island&quot;. Mike Woodroffe said that the game was inspired by &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;″ magic stories. Other influences, according to Simon Woodroffe, included &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, and &quot;Monty Python&quot;. The character was invented during a journey on the M5 motorway, and was not named after Woodroffe. The name &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; had that format because of the magical nature of the character, and because other names, such as &quot;Willy The Wizard&quot;, were rejected because they were disliked. &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; was developed by a team of 15 people. There was an effort to be British so as to distinguish themselves from the humour of &quot;Monkey Island&quot;. Simon Woodroffe stated that his greatest challenges were the script creation and puzzle design, and he tuned the scripts (which were written in an in-house scripting language) continuously. The world was created for the characters rather than the puzzles, and the story was wrapped around characters the team liked. Woodroffe believed that Adventure Soft were able to rival more experienced studios due to their small team, all of whom had the same goals and passion for the game. On deciding which fairy tales to include in the game, Simon Woodroffe said that he &quot;read a whole bunch of that kind of stuff&quot;, including the &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;, and that he also owned Ladybird Books when he was growing up. He said that there were some he &quot;really wanted&quot; to include, such as &quot;The Magic Porridge Pot&quot;, but could not.

Alan Brigman was the technical director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated the development of &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; and enabled the team to focus on the gameplay and story without worrying about the technical aspects. The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved in the development of the AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.

The art was developed by Paul Drummond (lead artist), Kevin Preston (who hand-drew the character art and animation), Maria Drummond, Jeff Wall, and Karen Pinchin. This team were based at a studio in Newcastle, rather than Birmingham, the central studio. Their work included character animations, developed in Autodesk Animator using its language POCO, which the graphics tools were built in. The artwork (including the sprites) was made as a selection of clips, and a final image was formed by pasting them together. The ability to use clips in multiple locations, and the colour information being stored separately and used on an as—needed basis meant that the art took much less space than was usual. The background artwork was sketched in black-and-white, and then scanned into a computer and colourised. The music is credited to Media Sorcery (Adam Gilmore and Mark McLeod).

&quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; was released on floppy disk in 1993 for the Amiga and IBM PC compatibles. It was re-released in 1994 for the Amiga CD32 and PC CD-ROM, with an enhanced soundtrack featuring Chris Barrie as the voice of Simon. Simon Woodroffe stated that he had Barrie in mind when writing the scripts (Woodroffe said he is a fan of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and Arnold Rimmer), and that it was easier for him to do so when thinking of an actor he knew speaking the lines. It cost around £3000 per day to hire Barrie. Woodroffe said that there was &quot;no hesitation&quot; in doing a talkie version, and that it was &quot;the next big thing&quot;. He also said that Barrie was &quot;very patient and professional&quot;. &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; used the visual and interface designs from LucasArts&#x27; games, and Woodroffe stated that this was because they had set a standard, and that Adventure Soft&#x27;s focus was humour and story-telling.

The PC version was later ported to Microsoft Windows. The game was published in the United States by Activision. A patch was released, fixing compatibility issues with Windows ME, 2000, and XP. &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; was released on GOG.com in December 2008. In 2009, the game was re-released for the iPhone by iPhSoft. A new version titled &#x27;20th Anniversary Edition was developed by MojoTouch and released for Android in August 2013. This version featured new animations and icons, remastered music, high-definition graphics, and new game menus. A 25th Anniversary Edition was released on the iOS App Store, Steam and GOG.com on 3 April 2018. A sequel, &quot;Simon the Sorcerer II: The Lion, the Wizard and the Wardrobe&quot;, was released in 1995.

== Reception ==
&quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; received critical acclaim: across all platforms, the humour and visuals in particular were commended, although criticisms included the controls and the game&#x27;s linear nature. The game&#x27;s global sales surpassed 600,000 units by September 1999.

The Amiga version received generally high ratings. &quot;CU Amiga&quot; praised the high quality graphics and how much fun the game was to play. &quot;Amiga Computing&quot;″s Simon Clays also praised the graphics and the locations, saying the locations&#x27; stylisation made the game resemble a fairy tale. He also enjoyed the puzzles and detail in the game. &quot;The One&quot; reviewer said the graphics are &quot;excellent&quot;, but believed the music did not take full advantage of the Amiga&#x27;s sound hardware. A reviewer of &quot;&quot; thought the Amiga version&#x27;s graphics are &quot;magnificent&quot;.

The CD32 version was noted for its speech. &quot;CU Amiga&quot;″s Dean Evans was impressed with &quot;sumptuous&quot; backgrounds and the animation, and believed the main selling point was the digitised speech, especially Chris Barrie as Simon. Jonathan Nash of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; liked the &quot;gorgeous&quot; graphics, but thought the dialogue was annoying, and he also criticised the puzzles as &quot;spread thinly over the pointlessly large playing area&quot;. The reviewer of &quot;Amiga CD32 Gamer&quot; was impressed with the soundtrack, describing it as &quot;top notch&quot;, and thought the story had plenty of wit. The main criticism was the scenes downplaying interaction, making the comedy linear. &quot;The One&quot;″s reviewer corroborated others&#x27; views on the graphics, believing them to be &quot;stunning&quot;, and also believed the atmosphere was augmented by the speech. Chris Barrie as Simon was believed by &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; to &quot;greatly enhance&quot; the game by giving the speech a new appeal. &quot;Amiga Format&quot;″s reviewer criticised the controls, believing the controller&#x27;s limitations would make players &quot;an insane hysterical gibbering wreck&quot;, but complimented the addition of speech, and echoed others&#x27; opinions on the graphics by calling them &quot;beautiful&quot;. In a later review, Andy Smith believed that Barrie&#x27;s voice acting livened the humour, and concurred with Evans&#x27; evaluation of the graphics as &quot;sumptuous&quot;, but said that it was difficult to get the game working on an Amiga 1200.

Reviewers of the DOS and Windows versions praised the humour and dialogue. The reviewers of &quot;Génération 4&quot; described the adventure as &quot;excellent&quot;, and believed &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; might be the most amusing and idiosyncratic adventure game. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that the &quot;wacky, tongue-in-cheek interactive fantasy [...] features a rich world of tasty puzzles designed to test the wits of the most astute adventurer while keeping the humor dial turned up to the max&quot;. Jeuxvideo.com described the characters&#x27; dialogue as &quot;crazy&quot; and praised the abundance of humour, but they believed the adventure is over too quickly. Their review of the Amiga version was identical. Tawny Ditmer of Gamezebo lauded the story as &quot;hilarious&quot; and the scenery and music as &quot;wonderfully colorful and cheery&quot;, criticised the lack of side-quests and pointed out that the original graphics looks outdated in 2009. The script and dialogue were praised as &quot;fantastic&quot; by Rob Franklin of Adventure Gamers, and complimented Chris Barrie&#x27;s &quot;brilliant&quot; voice acting, but criticised the plot for being vague. He recommended the game for fans of adventure games and British humour. Zoltán Ormándi of Adventure Classic Gaming thought highly or the puzzles&#x27; originality and Simon&#x27;s humour. He claimed that the game&#x27;s popularity caused a term, &quot;Simonology&quot; to be coined describing the humour of an adventure&#x27;s protagonist. GameRankings wrote the PC version has a rating of 86 per cent. The reviewer of &quot;Joystick&quot; liked the decoration, animation, and characters.

Paul Marchant of Pocket Gamer reviewed the iOS version, and said that it was the game he liked, rather than the iPhone implementation, but thought the game a &quot;classic&quot; and described the dialogue as &quot;original&quot;. Damian Chiappara of AppSpy believed the iOS version&#x27;s graphics are improved over the original, and liked the &quot;quirky&quot; humour, but thought that it can take time for players to familiarise themselves with its controls. The iPad and Android versions appeared on Pocket Gamer&#x27;s Top 10 point-and-click adventure games for their respective platforms.

In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;Simon the Sorcerer&quot; the 44th-best adventure game ever released.

<text>The South African Republic (, abbreviated ZAR; ), also known as the Transvaal Republic, was an independent Boer republic in Southern Africa which existed from 1852 to 1902, when it was annexed into the British Empire as a result of the Second Boer War.

The ZAR was established as a result of the 1852 Sand River Convention, in which the British government agreed to formally recognise independence of the Boers living north of the Vaal River. Relations between the ZAR and Britain started to deteriorate after the British Cape Colony expanded into the Southern African interior, eventually leading to the outbreak of the First Boer War between the two nations. The Boer victory confirmed the ZAR&#x27;s independence; however, Anglo-ZAR tensions soon flared up again over various diplomatic issues. In 1899, war again broke out between Britain and the ZAR, which was swiftly occupied by British forces. Many Boer combatants in the ZAR refused to surrender, leading British commander Lord Kitchener to order the adoption of several scorched-earth policies. In the treaty which ended the war, the ZAR was transformed into the Transvaal Colony, and eventually the Union of South Africa. During World War I, there was a failed attempt at resurrecting the republic in the Maritz rebellion.

The land area that was once the ZAR now comprises all or most of the provinces of Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and North West in the northeastern portion of the modern-day Republic of South Africa.

==Name and etymology==
In 1853 the Volksraad adopted a resolution briefly adopting the name of the (South African Republic). The same year, the Volksraad renamed the state to the (South African Republic to the North of the Vaal River). In 1858, the constitution permanently established the name of the country as the . The ZAR was also commonly referred to as in reference to the area beyond (or &quot;&quot;) the Vaal River, including by the British and European press. The British objected to the use of the name . After the end of the First Boer War, the ZAR came under British suzerainty and in the Pretoria Convention of 3 August 1881, the British insisted on the use of the name Transvaal State over . This convention was renegotiated in a subsequent treaty between Britain and the ZAR, the London Convention of 27 February 1884, where Britain acquiesced to the ZAR&#x27;s demands to revert to the use of the previous name.

The name of the South African Republic was of such political significance that on 1 September 1900, the British declared by special proclamation that the name of the country had been changed from to &quot;the Transvaal&quot;. This proclamation was issued during the British occupation of the region in the Second Boer War and while the ZAR was still nominally an independent country.

On 31 May 1902, the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed with the government of the South African Republic, the Orange Free State government, and the British government, ending the war, and converted the ZAR into the Transvaal Colony. Following the establishment of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the Transvaal Colony became Transvaal Province. The name Transvaal was finally changed in 1994, when the post-apartheid African National Congress-dominated South African government broke up the province into four provinces and renamed the core region Gauteng.

==History==
===Establishment===
The Boer republics emerged when the British had annexed the Cape Colony from the Dutch in 1806, in order to prevent the sea routes to the East (India etc.) from falling to Napoleon. This area was inhabited by the Boers, who, dissatisfied with British rule, decided to leave the colony and move into the hinterland of South Africa in what became the Great Trek. These Boers then settled these lands, becoming farmers.

The South African Republic came into existence on 17 January 1852, when the British signed the Sand River Convention treaty with about 40,000 Boer people, recognising their independence in the region to the north of the Vaal River, which had previously been under British annexation as the Orange Rivers Sovereignty.

The first president of the ZAR was Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, elected in 1857, son of Boer leader Andries Pretorius, who commanded the Boers to victory at the Battle of Blood River. The capital was established at Potchefstroom and later moved to Pretoria. The parliament was called the and had 24 members.

===British annexation===

By the 1870s, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Carnarvon, adopted a policy of confederating South Africa, in order to solve the problems of a restless frontier and of containing the Boers, which both threatened their colonies of Natal and the Cape of Good Hope. These colonies were absolutely vital in providing a route to India, which was Britain&#x27;s prime colony. Confederation of the South African region was thought to be very beneficial for the British, as it would &quot;cheapen the administration of affairs&quot; and reduce the need for imperial money and troops.

The first issue that prompted the annexation of Transvaal was the prospect that the Boers might gain an outlet to the sea, which the British government was trying to prevent, as shown by the annexation of Natal, which had previously been a Boer republic called Natalia. This annexation happened because the MacMahon award gave the Delagoa bay to the Portuguese, who were friendly to the Boers. The Transvaal government immediately took steps to acquire a loan to build a railway there, and even led discussions to purchase the bay outright. This railway and purchase caused the loss of the only control that the British had, since previously the British could at the very least restrict the supply of arms and ammunition that was exported and fell into the hands of the Boers and natives and thereby rein in what the British saw as the anarchy in the Transvaal. Additionally, the sea outlet that the Boers acquired which was outside the control of the British made persuading the Boers to enter a South African confederation far more difficult, as the Boers as a result achieved greater independence.

Moreover, the Foreign Office was concerned that the opening of Delagoa Bay could signal the involvement of other nations in the Transvaal, which could threaten the Cape Colony. This concern was intensified by the fact that some German merchants had already approached Bismark with the proposition that he annex the Transvaal, which proposition, although rejected, raised the possibility of the Boers requesting German protection, which in turn raised the possibility of the appearance of a foreign and unfriendly power in the Cape which could threaten Britain&#x27;s position there. These fears were further stoked by the trip that Thomas Burgers, the president of Transvaal took to Europe, during which he tried to negotiate a loan for a railway, as well as possible European alliances.

The second issue that prompted the annexation was native policy and Boer relations with local African kingdoms. The British considered these relations a problem ever since the founding of the ZAR. Only one year after the Sand Rivers Convention, the Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, Benjamin Pine, reported that the Boers had interpreted the treaty as having placed Zululand under their exclusive control. Pine stated that such a union of the Zulus and the Boers, who had wanted to create a settlement in the North-West corner of Zululand, would imperil the safety of Natal. This combination meant that control of the land around the areas of Utrecht would be in dispute between the Boers and the Zulus, raising tension in the region. The Boers had also been acting provocatively towards the Bantu peoples living in Bechuanaland: for instance, in 1852, Boer commandos raided the town of Kwena, taking many prisoners, and in 1857 a Boer commandos led another raid on Batlhaping, after claiming that the tribesmen stole their cattle. For the British, these conflicts had a high chance for escalating and presented big problems no matter how they turned out: if the Boers won in their war against the Zulus, there would be a substantial increase of Zulu refugees into the already crowded area of Natal, and the displacement of peoples had been shown to create an atmosphere conducive to war, as shown by the Xhosa wars). If the Zulus won, other independent tribes such as the Bantu, the Pondo, Swazi, Bapedi, and others, would gain confidence that they might obtain their independence from the British or at least offer the British resistance, endangering the Cape Colony. Annexation was therefore the only way of preventing either of these outcomes.

What precipitated action and confirmed the aforementioned fears was that in 1876, war broke out between the Boers and the Bapedi chief Sekhukhune. Initially, the Boers faced heavy defeats: the Republic was close to bankruptcy and its siege of Sekhukhune&#x27;s stronghold failed because commando members objected to Burgers&#x27;s theology, calling him a heretic, and abandoned the siege in droves. Sir Henry Barkley exaggerated this failure as a major and decisive defeat of the Boers, and was thereby led to anticipate an immediate application to the High Commissioner to take over the country. A.N. Pelzer wrote: &quot;Although Sekhukhune made overtures for peace, he was not defeated and this fact, together with the shaky financial position, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone the pretext he required to annex the republic [as the Transvaal, a British colony, on 12 April 1877].&quot; Barkly&#x27;s warning hastened the action of Lord Carnarvon and led to the dispatch of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, who happened to be in England, on his mission as special commissioner &quot;to carry out any negotiations which may be found necessary and practicable.&quot; Shepstone&#x27;s warrant authorised him to annex the Transvaal, provided he was satisfied that a sufficient number of the inhabitants, or the legislature, desired it. By the time Shepstone arrived, however, the Bapedi and the Boers had signed a peace treaty. However, this conflict cannot be lightly dismissed as &quot;the picturesque pretext&quot; for annexation. In spite of the Boer &quot;victory,&quot; on 16 February 1877, the Boers and Bapedi, mediated by Alexander Merensky, signed a peace treaty at Botshabelo). Nonetheless, the situation could not be described as anything but critical. The war had been expensive, leading the government of the Republic to be insolvent, and the desertion of Boer commandos gave the Zulus, the arch-enemies of the Boers, the impression that the Transvaal was weak, as they had been barely able to defeat Sekhukhune, who they considered a minor vassal. In the spring and summer of 1876–77, frontier skirmishes between the Zulus and Boers flared up once again, and Cetewayo, the Zulu king, began moving his impis towards the border between the Transvaal and Zululand.

Believing that the only answer to the instability of the region was British intervention, senior War Office official Sir Garnet Wolseley argued that Britain should &quot;use Cetewayo as a powerful lever to influence wavering spirit&quot;. It has therefore been suggested that the danger that the Zulus presented was specifically manufactured by the British to induce the Boers to accept annexation, and the impis had been massed on the border &quot;on a hint from Shepstone&quot;. This suggestion is supported by the presence of Zulu emissaries in March 1877 in Natal stating that the Zulu army had massed &quot;in readiness at the call of Somtseu (Shepstone) to go round towards the upper side of the Dutch.&quot; Moreover, Shepstone requested Sir Henry Bulwer, the British Lieutenant-Governor of Natal, to cease the importation of military materiel into the Transvaal.

However, the independence of the Zulu kingdom mustn&#x27;t be understated, and the influence that Shepstone had over Cetewayo should not be exaggerated. What kept the Zulus loyal to the British was their fear of the Boers: but once the Zulus realized that the Boers were not a threat, they realised that they did not need to acquiesce to British demands. This is shown by the response that Cetewayo made to the calls for peace from the Lieutenant-Governor of Natal: &quot;I shall not act on my own account. I shall not agree to any laws or rules from Natal.&quot; Writing on the 14th February 1877, Shepstone asserted: &quot;While I am here, Cetewayo will do nothing; but if I were to withdraw without completing my mission[annexation], I believe that not only the Zulus but every native tribe in the Transvaal and bordering on it would attack and wipe it out.&quot; The danger of a Zulu attack was therefore very real, and not invented by the British. However, the British did apply pressure on the Boers to excite apprehensions of the danger the Zulus presented by cutting off Boer access to the coast, which prevented them from profiting from customs duties on maritime imports and exports, as well as cutting off their source of arms, which contributed to their fear of a Zulu attack.

In 1877, Shepstone left Natal for Pretoria. He was warmly received by Burgers, the president of the Transvaal. Since the country was on the eve of an election which Burgers was bound to lose due to his unpopularity, Sir Theophilius therefore &quot;was convinced beyond any doubt of Burgers&#x27; support against their common enemy: Kruger&quot;, since Kruger was Burger&#x27;s primary rival in the election, against whom he could leverage the aid of the Natalian (Shepstone). Thomas Burgers hoped to use the presence of Shepstone to induce the Volksraad to accept, as an alternative to annexation, a reform to the constitution that would strengthen his executive authority and prolong his rule by two more years. Even when Shepstone informed Burgers of his determination to go through with annexing the Transvaal, Burgers assured Shepstone of his co-operation.

It is argued by some that Shepstone had annexed the area in haste, &quot;without troubling to ascertain the real drift of Dutch opinion.&quot; However, his decision was certainly not made in haste, as he remained in Pretoria for three months before making a proclamation of annexation, at which time he was in contact with the members of the community in Pretoria. Moreover, due to the economic depression, as well as the &quot;incurable insolvency&quot; of the government, the burghers were ready to support the annexation, which was expected to solve these problems, whilst providing them protection from the natives. Additionally, the state attorney, Dr Jorissen, opined that, had Shepstone summoned the Volksraad after annexation, he would have obtained a vote of confidence.

At Pretoria the annexation was received quietly enough. The republican printing press (De Volksstem) made no difficulty over the printing of Shepstone&#x27;s proclamation. Despite the official protest of the executive council, all but one of its members retained office under the new administration, and no military incidents occurred during or immediately after the annexation. Sir Garnet Wolseley, High Commissioner for Southeast Africa, declared war on Sekhukhune. With British and allied troops, including the Swazis who had supported Burgers, in 1879 Wolseley defeated Sekhukhune and imprisoned him in Pretoria. With the Bapedi threat removed, the Burghers were no longer so amenable to British rule.

On 13 December 1880, the members of the last were summoned to a meeting at Paardekraal. The meeting placed authority in the hands of a triumvirate: Paul Kruger, Piet Joubert, and Marthinus Wessel Pretorius. They declared Heidelberg their seat of government and hoisted the Vierkleur there on 16 December. The war, not officially declared to the occupying British troops, opened with an irregular attack on a British regiment on the march at Bronkhorstspruit. The British garrisons in the Transvaal were besieged, but only one fell to the republicans.

The Boers defeated the British at Laing&#x27;s Nek and Ingogo, and on 27 February 1881, at Majuba, General Sir George Pomeroy Colley fell at the head of his troops. While the British would in other circumstances have sent more troops and defeated the rebels, Prime Minister William Gladstone chose to make peace. Drawing up of the detailed peace treaty—the Pretoria Convention—was left in the hands of a royal commission comprising Sir Hercules Robinson, General Sir Evelyn Wood and Justice John de Villiers of the Cape Colony. Britain now referred to the territory as the Transvaal State, but the regarded the old South African Republic as having been restored.

===Independence===
The ZAR became fully independent on 27 February 1884, when the London Convention was signed. The country independently also entered into various agreements with other foreign countries after that date. On 3 November 1884 the country signed a postal convention with the government of the Cape Colony and later a similar convention with the Orange Free State.

In November 1859, the independent Republics of Lijdenburg and Utrecht merged with the ZAR. On 9 May 1887, burghers from the territories of Stellaland and Goosen (sometimes referred to as &quot;Goshen&quot;) were granted the ZAR franchise. On 25 July 1895, the burghers that took part in the battle at Zoutpansberg were granted citizenship of the ZAR.

===Collapse and conquest===
==Constitution and laws==
The constitution of the ZAR was legally interesting for its time. It contained provisions for the division between the political leadership and office bearers in government administration. The legal system consisted of higher and lower courts and had adopted a jury system. Laws were enforced by the South African Republic Police ( or ZARP) which were divided into Mounted Police () and Foot Police.

Also established were municipal government, the Witwatersrand District Court and the High Court of Transvaal.

===Demographics===
The State Almanac for 1897 states that the total white population was 245,397; with the total black population being 622,544.

===Religion===
Initially, the state and church were not separated in the constitution; citizens of the ZAR had to be members of the Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk, a denomination which had broken from the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1858, these clauses were altered in the constitution to allow for the to approve other Dutch Christian churches. The Dopper Church was approved by the in 1858, which had the effect of allowing Paul Kruger, a Dopper himself, to remain a citizen of the ZAR.

The Bible itself was also often used to interpret the intention of legal documents. The Bible was also used to interpret a prisoner exchange agreement, reached in terms of the Sand River Convention, between a commando of the ZAR, led by Kruger, and a Commando of the Orange Free State. President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff had issued a death sentence over two ZAR citizens, for treason. Kruger argued with President Boshoff that the Bible said punishment does not mean a death sentence and at the prisoner exchange, it was agreed that the accused would be punished if found guilty. After consulting Commandant Kruger&#x27;s Bible, Boshoff commuted the men&#x27;s sentences to lashes with a sjambok.

===Citizenship===
Citizenship of the ZAR was legislated by the constitution as well as Law No 7 of 1882, as amended on 23 June 1890. Citizenship was gained by being born in the republic or by naturalisation. The voting age was 16 years. Persons not born in the republic could become citizens by taking the prescribed oath and procuring the letters of naturalisation. The oath involved abandoning, discarding and renouncing all allegiance and subjugation towards foreign sovereignties and in particular their previous citizenship. Under a law of 1855, only white people were permitted to be citizens of the ZAR and to own land. The constitution of the ZAR stated: &quot;The &quot;volk&quot; (people) are not prepared to allow any equality of the non-white with the white inhabitants, either in the church or the state&quot;.

The Witwatersrand gold rush led to an influx of Indians and Chinese into the new city of Johannesburg that was emerging on the &quot;veld&quot;, which led the &quot;volksraad&quot; to pass Law Number 3, which was aimed at stopping Asian immigration into the Transvaal. Under Law Number 3, all Asians which were defined as &quot;Coolies, Chinese etc, Arabs, Malays, and Mohammedan subjects of the Turkish dominion&quot; were forbidden from owning fixed property, had to register with the local magistrate within 8 days of arriving, were restricted to living in certain neighborhoods and had to pay an entry fee of £25. The Indian merchants, who were classified as &quot;Arabs&quot;, objected to this law and appealed to the British government to protect their rights as British subjects. Following British diplomatic pressure, Law Number 3 was amended by the &quot;volksraad&quot; in 1887 to allow the &quot;Asiatics&quot; the right to own fixed property, though not land, and the entry fee was lowered to £3. Because the Indians in the ZAR had the British government to protect them, the anti-Asian laws in the ZAR tended to single out the Chinese, though the Hong Kong Chinese were like the Indians able to claim as British subjects certain exemptions from the anti-Chinese laws.

To be eligible for citizenship, white foreigners had to have been residing in the Republic for a period of two years, be of good character and have been accepted as member of the Dutch Reformed or Reformed Church. On 20 September 1893 the ZAR Constitution was amended so that two-thirds of the Volksraad would have to agree to changes to the citizenship law. This proclamation, No 224, also changed Law No 7 with regard to voting.

All citizens who were born in the ZAR or had obtained their franchise prior to 23 June 1890 would have the right to vote for both the first and second and in all other elections. Citizens who obtained their franchise through naturalization after 23 June 1890 would be able to vote in all elections, except those for the first . The total population of the republic in 1890 was an estimated 120,000 people.

==Military==
In common with the Orange Free State, the basis of the military of the ZAR was the &quot;kommando&quot; system under which all able-bodied &quot;burghers&quot; could be called up for military service under their own elected officers. The men of the &quot;kommandos&quot; wore no uniforms and had no medals. The basic officer was the field cornet who was elected by the local &quot;burghers&quot; and performed both military and administrative functions in his district. The field cornet was responsible for collecting taxes, performing the census, training the male &quot;burghers&quot;, collecting arms and with upholding the power of the state over the local black population. The commander of the ZAR&#x27;s military was the elected commandant-general who like the field cornets performed both military and political functions. The commandant-general was responsible for buying guns and ammunition, fixed the prices of commodities and most importantly controlled the ivory trade. The economy of the Transvaal was very much a barter economy, and ivory was one of the principal currencies used in trade and commerce. The professional military of the ZAR was the &quot;Staatsartillerie&quot; (State Artillery), who in 1899 numbered 314 men. The &quot;Staatsartillerie&quot; was armed with the modern Krupp artillery guns imported from Germany, and whose second-in-command was the Austrian officer Captain Adolf Zboril, who did his best to bring up the &quot;Staatsartillerie&quot; to the level of a European army. The closest the ZAR had to a professional infantry and cavalry was the para-military ZARP (&quot;Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek Politie&quot;-South African Republic Police). In 1899, the ZAR had about 30,000 men who were called up to serve in the &quot;kommandos&quot;.

Though in theory, any white male &quot;burgher&quot; could be elected to a military office, in practice the men who were elected came from the wealthier families, who used their wealth to build up patronage networks that put the poorer farmers into their debt in one manner or another. The South African historian Ian van der Waag described Boer society as being characterized by a quasi-feudalism as the wealthier families set themselves up as something alike to the marcher lords of medieval Europe. The field cornets often waged war against local African natives in order to seize land, ivory and people to distribute as spoils to their constituents in exchange for their electoral support, often specifically for elections to higher republic offices. There was a strong dynastic element to the election of generals who commanded the &quot;kommandos&quot; as there was a tendency for men from the same families to be elected to the office of general generation after generation. In 1899, while the average age of a general in the ZAR was 58, the majority had a very limited education. In a society that venerated age, the most respected man was the &quot;takhaar&quot;, the wealthy patriarch with the long hair and long beard that indicated wisdom, and these were accordingly the people most likely to be elected as officers. Most of the &quot;takhaars&quot; serving as officers in 1899 were in some way connected to President Paul Kruger, either by ties of blood or marriage.

==Language==
The language spoken and written by the citizens of the ZAR was a variant of Dutch, locally referred to as . On 3 October 1884, the stated that they had reason to believe that in certain schools impure Dutch (in fact an early form of Afrikaans) was being used. The issued Proclamation 207 and compelled the Superintendent of Education to apply the language law enforcing the exclusive use of Dutch. On 30 July 1888, Dutch language was declared the sole official language, in court as well as education, trade and general use. All other languages were declared &quot;foreign&quot;.

These changes to the ZAR laws made the use of all other foreign languages illegal in the ZAR. On 1 October 1895 Alfred Fernandez Harington was appointed English master at the Staats Model School in Pretoria. Use of any foreign language was subject to criminal penalty and fine of £20 (ZAR) for each offence. The British similarly had declared English to be the only language spoken in the Cape Colony some decades earlier to outlaw the Dutch language. The discovery of gold in 1885 led to a major influx of foreigners. By 1896, the language of government and citizens remained Dutch but in many market places, shops and homes the English language was spoken.

==Military history==
===War with Mapela and Makapaan, 1854===
Hendrik Potgieter was elected at the assembly of 1849 as commandant general for life and it became necessary, to avoid strife, to appoint three commandants general all possessing equal powers. Commandant General Andries Pretorius became commandant general of the Potchefstroom and Rustenburg districts. On 16 December 1852, Andries died and his son, Piet Pretorius, was appointed as commandant general of the Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg districts in his stead.

There were some disputes over cattle which Mapela was raising on behalf of Potgieter and earlier Commandant Scholtz had confiscated a large number of rifles and amounts of ammunition, rifle repair equipment and materials of war from the home of an English missionary, the Reverend Livingstone. Livingstone admitted to storing weaponry for the Secheli, a breach of the Sand River Convention, which prohibited providing arms or ammunition to the natives.

In 1853, Herman Potgieter was called to Mapela to aid in a cull of the elephant population. Upon arrival, Maphela guided the Potgieter party, which included Herman, his son, his groom and a few other burghers to the purported location where the elephants were herding. Rather instead, Mapela led the unsuspecting Boers into an ambush where hundreds of native warriors attacked the Potgieter party, killing Andries, then proceeding to drag Herman up a hill, where he was skinned alive. They stopped once they had torn the entrails from his body. At the same time of these events, the Ndebele chief Magobane (known to the Boers as Makapaan) attacked and killed an entire convoy of women and children traveling to Pretoria. The two chiefs had concluded an agreement to murder all the Europeans in their respective districts and to keep the cattle that they were raising for the Europeans.

General Piet Potgieter set out with 100 men from Zoutpansberg and Commandant General Pretorius left Pretoria with 200 men. After the commandos met up, they first attacked Magobane and the natives were driven back to their caves in the mountains where they lived before. The Boers held them at siege in their caves and eventually hundreds of women and children came out.

Orphan children of the native tribes were booked in strictly controlled by legal process, at appointed Boer families to look after them until they came of age. The administration was similar to the system of indentured workers, which was simply another form of slavery, with the exception that children so registered had to be released at age 16. The commando would return all such children to the nearest landdrost district, for registration and allocation to a Boer family.

As there were slavers and other criminals dealing in children, any burgher found in possession of an unregistered minor child was guilty of a criminal offence. These children were also often called &quot;oorlams&quot; in reference to being overly used to the Dutch culture, and in reference to a hand-raised orphan sheep, or &quot;hanslam&quot;. These children, even after their 16th birthday, and being free to come and go as they please, rarely re-connected with their own culture and own language and except for surviving and being cared for in terms of food and shelter, were basically forcefully divorced from their native tribe forever.

Among the casualties of this war was Commandant General Potgieter. The natives were armed with rifles and were good shots. The general was killed by a native sniper on the ridge of a trench and his body recovered by then commandant Paul Kruger whilst under heavy fire from the natives. What remained of the joint commando, now under command of General Pretorius focussed their attention on Mapela. By the time the commando had reached Mapela, the natives had fled. A few wagons, bloody clothes, chests and other goods were discovered at a kop near Mapela&#x27;s town. Mapela and his soldiers escaped and with their rifles and ammunition intact and Mapela was only captured much later, in 1858.

===Civil War, 1861–1864===
Commandant-General Stephanus Schoeman did not accept the proclamation of 20 September 1858, under which members of the Reformed Churches of South Africa would be entitled to citizenship of the ZAR. Consequently, Paul Kruger was not accepted as a citizen and disallowed from political intercourse. Acting President van Rensburg called a special meeting of the general council of the Dutch Reformed Church, which then voted in a special resolution to allow members of the Reformed Church access to the franchise.

===Sekhukune War, 1876===
In 1876, a war between the ZAR and the Bapedi broke out over cattle theft and land encroachment. The declared war on the Pedi leader, Sekhukune, on 16 May 1876. The war only began in July 1876. The president of the ZAR, Burgers led an army of 2000 burghers and was joined by a strong force of Swazi warriors. The Swazis joined the war to aid Mampuru, who was ousted from his position of chieftain by Sekhukune.

One of the early battles occurred at Botsabelo Mission Station on 13 July 1876, against Johannes Dinkwanyane, who was Sekhukune&#x27;s brother. The Boer forces were led by Commandant Coetzee and accompanied by Swazi warriors. The Swazi warriors launched a surprise and successful attack while the Boers held back. Seeing this, the Swazis refused to hand over to the Boers any spoils from the battle, thereafter leaving and returning to Swaziland. Dinkwanyane&#x27;s followers also surrendered after this campaign.

===First Boer War, 1880–1881===


On 12 April 1877, British officials issued the &quot;Annexation of the S. A. Republic to the British Empire.&quot; The proclamation stated that the country was &quot;unstable, ungovernable, bankrupt and facing civil war&quot;, though in reality the British wished to annex it for its strategic position, using skirmishes as a &quot;casus belli&quot;. The annexation would not suspend self-government, but nonetheless attempted to convert the ZAR into a colony of the British Empire. The ZAR unanimously decided to resist the British annexation. Instead of declaring war, the country decided to send a delegation to the United Kingdom and the United States, to protest. This did not have any effect, and the First Boer War formally broke out on 20 December 1880.

It would see the introduction of the khaki uniform among British troops, marking the beginning of the end of the famous red coat. The Battle of Laing&#x27;s Nek would be the last occasion on which a British Army regiment carried its official regimental colours into battle. The Pretoria Convention of 1881 was signed on 3 August 1881 and ratified on 25 October 1881 by the ZAR, where the is referred to by the name &quot;Transvaal Territory&quot;. The Pretoria Convention of 1881 was superseded in 1884 by the London Convention, in which the British suzerainty over the South African Republic was relinquished.

The British government, in the London Convention, accepted the name of the country as the South African Republic. The convention was signed in duplicate in London on 27 February 1884, by Hercules Robinson, Paul Kruger, Stephanus Jacobus du Toit and Nicolaas Smit, and later ratified by the South African Republic . In 1885, rich gold reefs were discovered. ZAR burghers were farmers and not miners and much of the mining fell to immigrants. The immigrants were also referred to as &quot;outlanders&quot;. By 1897, immigrants had invested over 300,000,000 British Pounds in the ZAR goldfields.

===Malaboch War, 1894===
The Malaboch War was between Chief Malaboch (Mmaleboho, Mmaleboxo) of the Bahananwa (Xananwa) people and the South African Republic (ZAR) Government led by Commandant-General Piet Joubert. Malaboch refused to pay taxes to the Transvaal after it was given back to the Boers in 1881 by the British, which resulted in a military drive against him by the South African Republic (ZAR).

===Second Boer War, 1899–1902===


The British first attacked the ZAR with the December 1895 Jameson Raid, which ended in failure. British forces started building up troops and resources at the borders, followed by a demand for voting rights for the ZAR&#x27;s 60,000 foreign nationals—of whom 50,000 were British. Kruger rejected the British demand and called for the withdrawal of British troops from the ZAR&#x27;s borders. When the British refused, Kruger declared war against Britain, Britain received assistance from its possessions Australia, and Canada, as well as Natal and the Cape Colony.

The Second Boer War was a watershed for the British Army in particular and for the British Empire as a whole. The British used concentration camps where women and children were held without adequate food or medical care. The abhorrent conditions in these camps caused the death of 4,177 women and 22,074 children under 16; death rates were between 344 and 700 per 1000 per year.

The Treaty of Vereeniging was signed on 31 May 1902. The treaty ended the existence of the ZAR and the Orange Free State as independent Boer republics and placed them within the British Empire. On 20 May 1903, an Inter Colonial Council was established to manage the colonies of the British Government. The Boers were promised eventual limited self-government and this was granted in 1906 and 1907. The Union of South Africa was established in 1910.

===Maritz Rebellion, 1914–1915===
The Maritz rebellion was an armed insurrection which occurred in South Africa in 1914 at the start of World War I. It was led by Boers who created a provisional government and sought to reestablish the South African Republic in the Transvaal. Many members of the South African government were themselves former Boers who had fought with the Maritz rebels against the British in the Second Boer War. The self-proclaimed rebel republic allied with Germany, with whom Britain and South Africa were at war. Boer commandos operated in and out of bordering German South West Africa. By 1915, the rebellion had failed, and the ringleaders received heavy fines and terms of imprisonment.

==Economy and transport==
The discovery of gold during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush in 1886 changed the economic fortunes of the formerly impoverished ZAR. The city of Johannesburg was founded as a gold mining town in the same year. Within 10 years it grew into the largest city in Southern Africa, surpassing Cape Town.

The discovery of gold allowed the construction of a railway network in the ZAR. The east–west railways in the ZAR, and notably the line from Pretoria to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa, were constructed by the Netherlands-South African Railway Company. The construction of the Pretoria-Lourenço Marques line allowed the ZAR access to harbour facilities not controlled by the British Empire, a key policy of Paul Kruger who deemed it vital to the country&#x27;s long-term survival.

==Flag==
The flag of the South African Republic featured three horizontal stripes of red, white and blue (mirroring the flag of the Netherlands) with a vertical green stripe at the hoist, and was known as the (English: &quot;Four colour&quot;). While the only legislation describing the flag required that the green panel be inscribed &quot;&quot; (&quot;Unity makes strength,&quot; the motto of the republic), this was in fact rarely seen, and instead the motto was displayed with the republic&#x27;s coat of arms. The Vierkleur was later incorporated into the flag of South Africa between 1928 and 1994.

<text>A sling is a projectile weapon typically used to hand-throw a blunt projectile such as a stone, clay, or lead &quot;sling-bullet&quot;. It is also known as the shepherd&#x27;s sling or slingshot (in British English, although elsewhere it means something else). Someone who specializes in using slings is called a slinger.
A sling has a small cradle or &quot;pouch&quot; in the middle of two retention cords, where a projectile is placed. There is a loop on the end of one side of the retention cords. Depending on the design of the sling, either the middle finger or the wrist is placed through a loop on the end of one cord, and a tab at the end of the other cord is placed between the thumb and forefinger. The sling is swung in an arc, and the tab released at a precise moment. This action releases the projectile to fly inertially and ballistically towards the target. By its double-pendulum kinetics, the sling enables stones (or spears) to be thrown much further than they could be by hand alone.

The sling is inexpensive and easy to build. Historically it has been used for hunting game and in combat. Today the sling is of interest as a wilderness survival tool and an improvised weapon.

== The sling in antiquity ==

=== Origins ===
The sling is an ancient weapon known to Neolithic peoples around the Mediterranean, but is likely to be much older. It is possible that the sling was invented during the Upper Palaeolithic at a time when new technologies such as the spear-thrower and the bow and arrow were beginning to emerge.

=== Archaeology ===

Whereas stones and clay objects thought by many archaeologists to be sling-bullets are common finds in the archaeological record, slings themselves are rare. This is both because a sling&#x27;s materials are biodegradable and because slings were lower-status weapons, rarely preserved in a wealthy person&#x27;s grave.

The oldest-known surviving slings—radiocarbon dated to —were recovered from South American archaeological sites on the coast of Peru. The oldest-known surviving North American sling—radiocarbon dated to —was recovered from Lovelock Cave, Nevada.

The oldest known extant slings from the Old World were found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, who died . A pair of finely plaited slings were found with other weapons. The sling was probably intended for the departed pharaoh to use for hunting game.

Another Egyptian sling was excavated in El-Lahun in Al Fayyum Egypt in 1914 by William Matthew Flinders Petrie, and is now in the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology—Petrie dated it to . It was found alongside an iron spearhead. The remains are broken into three sections. Although fragile, the construction is clear: it is made of bast fibre (almost certainly flax) twine; the cords are braided in a 10-strand elliptical sennit and the cradle seems to have been woven from the same lengths of twine used to form the cords.

=== Ancient representations ===
Representations of slingers can be found on artifacts from all over the ancient world, including Assyrian and Egyptian reliefs, the columns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, on coins, and on the Bayeux Tapestry.

The oldest representation of a slinger in art may be from Çatalhöyük, from , though it is the only such depiction at the site, despite numerous depictions of archers.

=== Written history ===
Many European, Middle Eastern, Asian, and African peoples were users of slings. Thucydides and others authors talk about its usage by Greeks and Romans, and Strabo also extends it to the Iberians, Lusitanians and even some Gauls (which Caesar describes further in his account of the siege of Bibrax). He also mentions Persians and Arabs among those who used them. For his part, Diodorus includes Libyans and Phoenicians. Britons were frequent users of slings too.

Livy mentions some of the most famous of ancient sling experts: the people of the Balearic Islands, who often worked as mercenaries. Of Balearic slingers Strabo writes: &quot;And their training in the use of slings used to be such, from childhood up, that they would not so much as give bread to their children unless they first hit it with the sling.&quot;

==== Classical accounts ====
The sling is mentioned as early as in the writings of Homer, where several characters kill enemies by hurling stones at them.

Balearic slingers were amongst the specialist mercenaries extensively employed by Carthage against the Romans and other enemies. These light troops used three sizes of sling, according to the distance of their opponents. The weapons were made of vegetable fibre and animal sinew, launching either stones or lead missiles with devastating impact.

Xenophon in his history of the retreat of the Ten Thousand, 401 BC, relates that the Greeks suffered severely from the slingers in the army of Artaxerxes II of Persia, while they themselves had neither cavalry nor slingers, and were unable to reach the enemy with their arrows and javelins. This deficiency was rectified when a company of 200 Rhodians, who understood the use of leaden sling-bullets, was formed. They were able, says Xenophon, to project their missiles twice as far as the Persian slingers, who used large stones.

Various Greeks enjoyed a reputation for skill with the sling. Thucydides mentions the Acarnanians and Livy refers to the inhabitants of three Greek cities on the northern coast of the Peloponnesus as expert slingers.

Greek armies would also use mounted slingers (ἀκροβολισταί).

Roman skirmishers armed with slings and javelins were established by Servius Tullius. The late Roman writer Vegetius, in his work &quot;De Re Militari&quot;, wrote:

==== Biblical accounts ====
The sling is mentioned in the Bible, which provides what is believed to be the oldest textual reference to a sling in the Book of Judges, 20:16. This text was thought to have been written , but refers to events several centuries earlier.

The Bible provides a famous slinger account, the battle between David and Goliath from the First Book of Samuel 17:34–36, probably written in the 7th or 6th century BC, describing events that might have occurred . The sling, easily produced, was the weapon of choice for shepherds fending off animals. Due to this, the sling was a commonly used weapon by the Israelite militia. Goliath was a tall, well equipped and experienced warrior. In this account, the shepherd David persuades Saul to let him fight Goliath on behalf of the Israelites. Unarmoured and equipped only with a sling, five smooth rocks, and his staff, David defeats the champion Goliath with a well-aimed shot to the head, followed by a decapitation with Goliath&#x27;s own sword.

Use of the sling is also mentioned in Second Kings 3:25, First Chronicles 12:2, and Second Chronicles 26:14 to further illustrate Israelite use.

=== Combat ===

Ancient peoples used the sling in combat—armies included both specialist slingers and regular soldiers equipped with slings. As a weapon, the sling had several advantages; a sling bullet lobbed in a high trajectory can achieve ranges in excess of . Modern authorities vary widely in their estimates of the effective range of ancient weapons. A bow and arrow could also have been used to produce a long range arcing trajectory, but ancient writers repeatedly stress the sling&#x27;s advantage of range. The sling was light to carry and cheap to produce; ammunition in the form of stones was readily available and often to be found near the site of battle. The ranges the sling could achieve with moulded lead sling-bullets was surpassed only by the strong composite bow.

Caches of sling ammunition have been found at the sites of Iron Age hill forts of Europe; some 22,000 sling stones were found at Maiden Castle, Dorset. It is proposed that Iron Age hill forts of Europe were designed to maximize the effective defence by slingers.

The hilltop location of the wooden forts would have given the defending slingers the advantage of range over the attackers, and multiple concentric ramparts, each higher than the other, would allow a large number of men to create a hailstorm of stone. Consistent with this, it has been noted that defences are generally narrow where the natural slope is steep, and wider where the slope is more gradual.

=== Construction ===
A classic sling is braided from non-elastic material. The traditional materials are flax, hemp or wool. Slings by Balearic islanders were said to be made from a rush. Flax and hemp resist rotting, but wool is softer and more comfortable. Polyester is often used for modern slings, because it does not rot or stretch and is soft and free of splinters.

Braided cords are used in preference to twisted rope, as a braid resists twisting when stretched. This improves accuracy.

The overall length of a sling can vary. A slinger may have slings of different lengths. A longer sling is used when greater range is required. A length of about is typical.

At the centre of the sling, a cradle or pouch is constructed. This may be formed by making a wide braid from the same material as the cords or by inserting a piece of a different material such as leather. The cradle is typically diamond shaped (although some take the form of a net), and will fold around the projectile in use. Some cradles have a hole or slit that allows the material to wrap around the projectile slightly, thereby holding it more securely.

At the end of one cord (called the retention cord) a finger-loop is formed. At the end of the other cord (the release cord), it is a common practice to form a knot or a tab. The release cord will be held between finger and thumb to be released at just the right moment, and may have a complex braid to add bulk to the end. This makes the knot easier to hold, and the extra weight allows the loose end of a discharged sling to be recovered with a flick of the wrist.

Braided construction resists stretching, and therefore produces an accurate sling. Modern slings are begun by plaiting the cord for the finger loop in the centre of a double-length set of cords. The cords are then folded to form the finger-loop. The retained cord is then plaited away from the loop as a single cord up to the pocket. The pocket is then plaited, most simply as another pair of cords, or with flat braids or a woven net. The remainder of the sling, the released cord, is plaited as a single cord, and then finished with a knot or plaited tab.

=== Impact ===
Ancient poets wrote that sling-bullets could penetrate armour, and that lead projectiles, heated by their passage through the air, would melt in flight. In the first instance, it seems likely that the authors were indicating that slings could cause injury through armour by a percussive effect (&quot;i.e.&quot;, the energy of a sling-bullet delivered at high velocity causing blunt trauma injury upon impact) rather than by penetration. In the latter case, it has been proposed that they were impressed by the degree of deformation suffered by lead sling-bullet after hitting a hard target.

According to description of Procopius, the sling had an effective range further than a Hun bow and arrow. In his book &quot;Wars of Justinian&quot;, he recorded the felling of a Hun warrior by a slinger:

=== Ammunition ===
The simplest projectile was a stone, preferably well-rounded. Suitable ammunition is frequently from a river or a beach. The size of the projectiles can vary dramatically, from pebbles massing no more than to fist-sized stones massing or more. The use of such stones as projectiles is well attested in the ethnographic record.

Possible projectiles were also purpose-made from clay; this allowed a very high consistency of size and shape to aid range and accuracy. Many examples have been found in the archaeological record.

The best ammunition was cast from lead. Leaden sling-bullets were widely used in the Greek and Roman world. For a given mass, lead, being very dense, offers the minimum size and therefore minimum air resistance. In addition, leaden sling-bullets are small and difficult to see in flight; their concentrated impact is also a better armour-piercer and better able to penetrate a body.

In some cases, the lead would be cast in a simple open mould made by pushing a finger or thumb into sand and pouring molten metal into the hole. However, sling-bullets were more frequently cast in two-part moulds. Such sling-bullets come in a number of shapes including an ellipsoidal form closely resembling an acorn; this could be the origin of the Latin word for a leaden sling-bullet: &quot;glandes plumbeae&quot; (literally &#x27;leaden acorns&#x27;) or simply &quot;glandes&quot; (meaning &#x27;acorns&#x27;, singular &quot;glans&quot;).

Other shapes include spherical and (by far the most common) biconical, which resembles the shape of the shell of an almond nut or a flattened American football.

The ancients do not seem to have taken advantage of the manufacturing process to produce consistent results; leaden sling-bullets vary significantly. The reason why the almond shape was favoured is not clear: it is possible that there is some aerodynamic advantage, but it seems equally likely that there is some more prosaic reason, such as the shape being easy to extract from a mould, or the fact that it will rest in a sling cradle with little danger of rolling out. It is possible as well that the almond, non-circular shape made the bullet spin in flight in a helicopter or disc like effect adding to the flight distance.

Almond-shaped leaden sling-bullets were typically long, wide, and weighs . Very often, symbols or writings were moulded into lead sling-bullets. Many examples have been found including a collection of about 80 sling-bullets from the siege of Perusia in Etruria from 41 BC, to be found in the museum of modern Perugia. Examples of symbols include a stylized lightning bolt, a snake, and a scorpion – reminders of how a sling might strike without warning. Writing might include the name of the owning military unit or commander or might be more imaginative: &quot;Take this&quot;, &quot;Ouch&quot;, &quot;get pregnant with this&quot; and even &quot;For Pompey&#x27;s backside&quot; added insult to injury, whereas &quot;dexai&quot; (&#x27;take this&#x27; or &#x27;catch!&#x27;) is merely sarcastic. In Yavne, a sling bullet with the Greek inscription &quot;Victory of Heracles and Hauronas&quot; was discovered, the two gods were the patrons of the city during the Hellenistic period.

Julius Caesar writes in &quot;De bello Gallico&quot;, book 5, about clay shot being heated before slinging, so that it might set fire to thatch.

==== &quot;Whistling&quot; bullets ====
Some bullets have been found with holes drilled in them. It was thought the holes were to contain poison. John Reid of the Trimontium Trust, finding holed Roman bullets excavated at the Burnswark hillfort, has proposed that the holes would cause the bullets to &quot;whistle&quot; in flight and the sound would intimidate opponents. The holed bullets were generally small and thus not particularly dangerous. Several could fit into a pouch and a single slinger could produce a terrorizing barrage. Experiments with modern copies demonstrate they produce a whooshing sound in flight.

== The sling in medieval period ==

=== Europe ===
The Bayeux Tapestry of the 1070s portrays the use of slings in a hunting context. Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor employed slingers during the Siege of Tortona in 1155 to suppress the garrison while his own men built siege engines. Indeed, slings seem to have been a fairly common weapon in Italy during the 11th and 12th centuries. Slings were also used by the Byzantines. On the Iberian Peninsula, the Spanish and Portuguese infantry favoured it against light and agile Moorish troops. The staff sling continued to be used in sieges and the sling was used as a part of large siege engines.

=== The Americas ===
The sling was known throughout the Americas.

In ancient Andean civilizations such as the Inca Empire, slings were made from llama wool. These slings typically have a cradle that is long and thin and features a relatively long slit. Andean slings were constructed from contrasting colours of wool; complex braids and fine workmanship can result in beautiful patterns. Ceremonial slings were also made; these were large, non-functional and generally lacked a slit. To this day, ceremonial slings are used in parts of the Andes as accessories in dances and in mock battles. They are also used by llama herders; the animals will move away from the sound of a stone landing. The stones are not slung to hit the animals, but to persuade them to move in the desired direction.

The sling was also used in the Americas for hunting and warfare. One notable use was in Incan resistance against the conquistadors. These slings were apparently very powerful; in &quot;1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus&quot;, author Charles C. Mann quoted a conquistador as saying that an Incan sling &quot;could break a sword in two pieces&quot; and &quot;kill a horse&quot;. Some 
slings spanned as much as long and weighed an impressive .

=== Guam ===
Unique amongst most Pacific Islanders, the Chamorro reached a terrific competency with a weapon as witness by 17th century Belgian missionary, Pedro Coomans:

&quot;Their offensive weapons include the sling, which they aim very skillfully at the head. Out of small ropes they weave a sort of net-bag, in which to carry stones with an oblong shape, some formed out of a marble stone, and others of clay, hardened in either the sun or fire. They whirl and shoot those so violently. Should it make an impact upon a more delicate part, like the heart, or the head, the man is flattened on the spot. Then, if envy would make them want to burn a house from a distance, they would stuff the perforated side of it with tow burning with a very ferocious fire, which, with a swift movement became a flame, and sail away to seek shelter in enemy houses.&quot;

The sling stone (in its &quot;almond&quot;/ovoid shape) is a vital cultural artifact of Chamorro culture, enough so, that it was adopted for the Guamian flag and state seal.

== Variants ==
=== Staff sling ===
The staff sling, also known as the stave sling, &quot;fustibalus&quot; (Latin), and &quot;fustibale&quot; (French), consists of a staff (a length of wood) with a short sling at one end. One cord of the sling is firmly attached to the stave and the other end has a loop that can slide off and release the projectile. Staff slings are extremely powerful because the stave can be made as long as two meters, creating a powerful lever. Ancient art shows slingers holding staff slings by one end, with the pocket behind them, and using both hands to throw the staves forward over their heads.

The staff sling has a similar or superior range to the shepherd&#x27;s sling, and can be as accurate in practiced hands. It is generally suited for heavier missiles and siege situations as staff slings can achieve very steep trajectories for slinging over obstacles such as castle walls. The staff itself can become a close combat weapon in a melee. The staff sling is able to throw heavy projectiles a much greater distance and at a higher arc than a hand sling. Staff slings were in use well into the age of gunpowder as grenade launchers, and were used in ship-to-ship combat to throw incendiaries.

====&quot;Piao Shi&quot; (whirlwind stone)====
&quot;Piao Shi&quot; (飃石, lit. &#x27;whirlwind stone&#x27;), also known as &quot;Shou Pao&quot; (手砲, lit. hand cannon) during the Song period, is the Chinese name for staff sling. It consists of a short cord tied to one end of a five chi bamboo pole, and is usually employed in siege defense alongside larger stone throwers. It is depicted and described in the &quot;Ji Xiao Xin Shu&quot; (紀效新書).

=== &quot;Kestros&quot; ===
The &quot;kestros&quot; (also known as the &quot;kestrosphendone&quot;, &quot;cestrus&quot;, or &quot;cestrosphendone&quot;) is a sling weapon mentioned by Livy and Polybius. It seems to have been a heavy dart flung from a leather sling. It was invented in 168 BC and was employed by some of the Macedonian troops of King Perseus in the Third Macedonian war.

=== Siege engines ===
The traction trebuchet was a siege engine which uses the power of men pulling on ropes or the energy stored in a raised weight to rotate what was, again, a staff sling. It was designed so that, when the throwing arm of the trebuchet had swung forward sufficiently, one end of the sling would automatically become detached and release the projectile. Some trebuchets were small and operated by a very small crew; however, unlike the onager, it was possible to build the trebuchet on a gigantic scale: such giants could hurl enormous rocks at huge ranges. Trebuchets are, in essence, mechanized slings.

==== Hand-trebuchet ====
The hand-trebuchet () was a staff sling mounted on a pole using a lever mechanism to propel projectiles.

== Today ==

Traditional slinging is still practiced as it always has been in the Balearic Islands, and competitions and leagues are common. In the rest of the world, the sling is primarily a hobby weapon, and a growing number of people make and practice with them. In recent years &#x27;slingfests&#x27; have been held in Wyoming, USA, in September 2007 and in Staffordshire, England, in June 2008.

According to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;, the current record for the greatest distance achieved in hurling an object from a sling is , using a long sling and a dart, set by David Engvall at Baldwin Lake, California, on September 13, 1992.

The principles of the sling may find use on a larger scale in the future; proposals exist for tether propulsion of spacecraft, which functionally is an oversized sling to propel a spaceship.

The sling is used today as a weapon primarily by protestors, to launch either stones or incendiary devices, such as Molotov cocktails. Classic woolen slings are still in use in the Middle East by Arab nomads and Bedouins to ward off jackals and hyenas. International Brigades used slings to throw grenades during the Spanish Civil War. Similarly, the Finns made use of sling-launched Molotov cocktails in the Winter War against Soviet tanks. Slings were used during the various Palestinian riots against modern army personnel and riot police. They were also used in the 2008 disturbances in Kenya.

<text>Stock car racing is a form of automobile racing run on oval tracks and road courses. It originally used production-model cars, hence the name &quot;stock car&quot;, but is now run using cars specifically built for racing. It originated in the southern United States and later spread to Japan; its largest governing body is NASCAR. Its NASCAR Cup Series is the premier top-level series of professional stock car racing. Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile also have forms of stock car racing in the Americas. Other countries, such as Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, have forms of stock car racing worldwide as well. Top-level races typically range between in length.

Top-level stock cars exceed at speedway tracks and on superspeedway tracks such as Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.
Contemporary NASCAR-spec top-level cars produce maximum power outputs of 860–900 hp from their naturally aspirated V8 engines. In October 2007 American race car driver Russ Wicks set a speed record for stock cars in a 2007-season Dodge Charger built to NASCAR specifications by achieving a maximum speed of at Bonneville Speedway. For the 2015 NASCAR Cup Series, power output of the competing cars ranged from 750 to 800 hp (560 to 600 kW).

==History==
===Early years===
In the 1920s, moonshine runners during the Prohibition era would often have to outrun the authorities. To do so, they had to upgrade their vehicles—while leaving them looking ordinary, so as not to attract attention. Eventually, runners started getting together with fellow runners and making runs together. They would challenge one another and eventually progressed to organized events in the early 1930s. The main problem racing faced was the lack of a unified set of rules among the different tracks. When Bill France Sr. saw this problem, he set up a meeting at the Streamline Hotel in order to form an organization that would unify the rules.

When NASCAR was first formed by France in 1948 to regulate stock car racing in the U.S., there was a requirement that any car entered be made entirely of parts available to the general public through automobile dealers. Furthermore, the car models were required to have sold over 500 units to the public. This is referred to as &quot;homologation&quot;, which other racing series has since adapted for their own rulesets. In NASCAR&#x27;s early years, the cars were so &quot;stock&quot; that it was commonplace for the drivers to drive themselves to the competitions in the car that they were going to run in the race. While automobile engine technology had remained fairly stagnant in World War II, advanced aircraft piston engine development had provided a great deal of available data, and NASCAR was formed just as some of the improved technology was about to become available in production cars. Until the advent of the Trans-Am Series in 1967, NASCAR homologation cars were the closest thing that the public could buy that was actually very similar to the cars that were winning national races.

The 1949 Oldsmobile Rocket V-8 with a displacement of is widely recognized as the first postwar modern overhead valve (OHV) engine to become available to the public. The Oldsmobile was an immediate success in 1949 and 1950, and all the automobile manufacturers could not help noticing the higher sales of the Oldsmobile 88 to the buying public. The motto of the day became &quot;win on Sunday, sell on Monday.&quot; However, in spite of the fact that several competing engines were more advanced, the aerodynamic and low-slung Hudson Hornet managed to win in 1951, 1952, and 1953 with a inline six-cylinder that used an old-style flathead engine, proving there was more to winning than just a more powerful engine.

At the time, it typically took three years for a new design of car body or engine to end up in production and be available for NASCAR racing. Most cars sold to the public did not have a wide variety of engine choices, and the majority of the buying public at the time was not interested in the large displacement special edition engine options that would soon become popular. However, the end of the Korean War in 1953 started an economic boom, and then car buyers immediately began demanding more powerful engines.

Also in 1953, NASCAR recommended that the drivers add roll bars, but did not require them.

In 1957, several notable events happened. The Automobile Manufacturers Association banned manufacturers from using race wins in their advertising and giving direct support to race teams.

===Heyday===
The desire from fans and manufacturers alike for higher performance cars within the restrictions of homologation meant that carmakers began producing limited production &quot;special edition&quot; cars based on high production base models. It also became apparent that manufacturers were willing to produce increasingly larger engines to remain competitive (Ford had developed a 483 they hoped to race). For the 1963 season NASCAR engines were restricted to using a maximum displacement of 7.0 liters (427 cu.in.) and using only two valves per cylinder.

Also, even with heavy duty special editions sold to the public for homologation purposes, the race car rules were further modified, primarily in the interest of safety. This is because race drivers and their cars during this era were subjected to forces unheard of in street use, and require a far higher level of protection than is normally afforded by truly &quot;stock&quot; automobile bodies.

In 1963 Ford sold enough of their aerodynamic &quot;sport-roof&quot; edition Galaxies to the public so it would qualify as stock, and with the heavy-duty FE block bored and stroked to the new limit of 427, the top five finishers were all Fords. Chrysler had bored their 413 to create the &quot;Max Wedge&quot; 426, but it still could not compete with the Fords. General Motors&#x27; headquarters had genuinely tried to adhere to the 1957 ban, but their Chevrolet division had also constantly tried to work around it, because the other manufacturers had openly circumvented the ban. In 1963 GM gave in and openly abandoned compliance, and Chevrolet was allowed to produce the ZO6 427, but it did not immediately enjoy success.

Then, in 1964 the new Chrysler 426 Hemi engine so dominated the series in a Plymouth Belvedere &quot;Sport Fury&quot;, the homologation rules were changed so that 1,000 of any engine and car had to be sold to the public to qualify as a stock part, instead of just 500. This made the 426 Hemi unavailable for the 1965 season.

In 1965 Ford adapted two single-overhead-cams to their FE 427 V8 to allow it to run at a higher RPM (called the Ford 427 Cammer). Ford started to sell &quot;cammers&quot; to the public to homologate it (mostly to dealer-sponsored privateer drag racers), but NASCAR changed the rules to specify that all NASCAR engines must use a single cam-in-block. But even without the cammer, the Ford FE 427 won in 1965.

In 1966 Chrysler sold enough of the 426 Hemis to make it available again, and they put it in their new Dodge Charger which had a low-drag rear window that was radically sloped. It was called a &quot;fast-back&quot;, and because of this David Pearson was the series champion that year with Richard Petty dominating 1967, winning 27 of 48 races (including 10 in a row) in the boxier Plymouth Belvedere.

The 1969 season featured the Torino Cobra or Torino &quot;Talladega&quot; which had enough aerodynamic body improvements that it gave it a higher speed than the 1968 Torino, with no other changes. The Cobra, featuring extended nose and reshaped rockers, was renamed Talladega part way through the 1969 season when the Boss 429 replaced the 427. Starting in 1963 up till this point, Ford had won six straight Manufacturer Championships, and by the end of the 1969 season Ford would make it seven in a row. Richard Petty was tired of winning races but losing the championship, so after a private viewing of Ford&#x27;s new Talladega and Boss 429 engine, he signed a lucrative deal with Ford.

Prior to its first race at the Daytona 500, David Pearson&#x27;s 427 powered Ford Torino Cobra set a new NASCAR record by being the first to exceed when he qualified at . When the race started Donnie Allison&#x27;s Torino lead the majority of the race (84 laps). Towards the end of the race the Torino of LeeRoy Yarbrough chased down the Dodge of Charlie Glotzbach, who had an 11-second lead. It was the first Daytona 500 won on a last lap pass. Things got worse for Dodge when NASCAR, a few months later, finally allowed Ford to run its hemi-headed Boss 429 engine.

With Ford winning the majority of the races, Dodge was forced to develop a better car of their own. Using the Charger 500 as a basis, they added a pointed nose. This nose was almost a carbon copy of the nose on the 1962 Ford Mustang I prototype. This radical body shape required a wing to remain stable at speeds over . They named it the Dodge Daytona after the race they hoped to win. Even though it never won a Daytona 500 race, it was still a significant improvement over its predecessor the Dodge Charger 500.

NASCAR feared that these increasing speeds significantly surpassed the abilities of the tire technology of the day, and it would undoubtedly increase the number of gruesome wrecks that were occurring. As a result, the 1970 Homologation rules were changed so that one car for every two U.S. dealers had to be built for sale to the public to qualify, hoping to delay the use of aero-bodies until tires could improve.

For the 1970 season Dodge raced the 1969 model Daytona, but Plymouth managed to build over 1,920 Plymouth Superbirds, which were similarly equipped to the Daytona. Petty came back to Plymouth in the plus Superbird, and Bobby Isaac won the season championship in a Daytona. NASCAR restricted all &quot;aero-cars&quot; including the Ford Talladega, Mercury Spoiler II, Charger 500, Dodge Daytona and Plymouth Superbird to a maximum engine displacement of for 1971. Almost all teams switched to non-aero bodystyles. NASCAR eventually adopted a restrictor plate to limit top speeds for the 7.0L engine as teams switched to small-block engines.

NASCAR edited the rules in a way that they hoped would make the cars safer and more equal, so the race series would be more a test of the drivers, rather than a test of car technology.

In addition, R.J. Reynolds (the tobacco conglomerate) took over as the major sponsor of NASCAR racing (changing the name to the &quot;Winston Cup&quot;) and they made a significantly larger financial contribution than previous sponsors. Richard Petty&#x27;s personal sponsorship with STP also set new, higher standards for financial rewards to driving teams. The sudden infusion of noticeably larger amounts of money changed the entire nature of the sport.

The 1973 oil crisis meant that large displacement special edition homologation cars of all makes were suddenly sitting unsold. Through the balance of the 1970s until 1991, the factory stock sheetmetal over a racing frame meant the cars looked very much like their street version counterparts. It can be said that 1992, with the addition of grounded type spoilers and sleeker shape, marked the beginning for non-stock sheetmetal and from that point forward, stock cars were quickly allowed to differ greatly from anything available to the public. Modern racing &quot;stock&quot; cars are stock in name only, using a body template that is vaguely modeled after currently available automobiles. The chassis, running gear, and other equipment have almost nothing to do with anything in ordinary automobiles. NASCAR and the auto manufacturers have become aware of this with the Cup Series&#x27; Gen 4 car (1992-2007) and Car of Tomorrow (2007-2012), and for 2013 each brand (Chevrolet, Dodge, Ford, and Toyota) have redesigned their racing sheetmetal to more resemble the street models of their cars.

== Types of cars ==
A stock car, in the original sense of the term, is an automobile that has not been modified from its original factory configuration. Later the term &quot;stock car&quot; came to mean any production-based automobile used in racing. This term is used to differentiate such a car from a &quot;race car&quot;, a special, custom-built car designed only for racing purposes.

The degree to which the cars conform to standard model specs has changed over the years and varies from country to country. Today most American stock cars may superficially resemble standard American family sedans but are in fact silhouette cars: purpose-built racing machines built to a strict set of regulations governing the car design ensuring that the chassis, suspension, engine, etc. are architecturally identical to those in stock production vehicles. For example, NASCAR Cup Series race vehicles now require fuel injection. In the UK and New Zealand there is a racing formula called stock cars, but the cars are markedly different from any road car. In Australia there was a formula that was quite similar to NASCAR called AUSCAR.

The Racecar-Euro Series began in 2009 and was sanctioned by NASCAR as a touring series in 2012, currently operating as the NASCAR Whelen Euro Series.

===Street stock and pure stock===

&quot;True&quot; stock car racing, which consists of only street vehicles that can be bought by the general public, is sometimes now called &quot;street stock&quot;, &quot;pure stock&quot;, &quot;hobby stock&quot;, &quot;showroom stock&quot;, or &quot;U-car&quot; racing. In 1972, SCCA started its first showroom stock racing series, with a price ceiling on the cars of $3,000. Some modern showroom stock racing allows safety modifications done on showroom stock cars.

Super stock classes are similar to street stock, but allow for more modifications to the engine. Power output is usually in the range of 500–550 horsepower (373–410 kilowatts). Tire width is usually limited to .

Some entry level classes are called &quot;street stock&quot;, and are similar to what is often called &quot;banger racing&quot; in England.

===Modifieds===

Modified stock cars resemble a hybrid of open wheel cars and stock cars. The rear wheels are covered by fenders but the front wheels and engine are left exposed. First popular in the United States after World War II, this type of racing was early-on characterized by its participants&#x27; modification of passenger cars in pursuit of higher speeds, hence the name. In many regions, particularly on the east coast, modified racing is considered the highest class of stock cars in local racing.

NASCAR officially sanctions the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour which is the oldest racing series sanctioned by NASCAR. The SMART Modified Tour, at one point was the NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour, is another prominent modified tour.

===Late models===
In many areas of the country late models are usually the highest class of stock cars in local racing. Rules for construction of a late model car vary from region to region and even race track to race track. The most common variations (on paved tracks) include super late models (SLMs), pro Late models (PLMs), late model stock cars (LMSCs), and limited late models (LLMs). A late model may be a custom built machine, or a heavily modified streetcar. Individual sanctioning bodies (like NASCAR, ACT, PASS, UARA, ASA, CARS Tour, etc.) maintain their own late model rule books, and even individual racetracks can maintain their own rule books, meaning a late model that is legal in one series or at one track may not be legal at another without modifications. The national touring series, the NASCAR Late Model Sportsman Series, originated from local late model races in the east coast of the U.S. This division was later called the &quot;Busch Series&quot;, the &quot;Nationwide Series&quot;, and currently the &quot;Xfinity Series&quot; as its title sponsor changed.

Late model racing has a very big following throughout the country. Many of the biggest late model races have very large purses, some equivalent to some NASCAR Truck and Xfinity Series races, that attract drivers from all over the country including Cup, Xfinity, and Truck drivers. Despite NASCAR officially sanctioning the NASCAR Advance Auto Parts Weekly Series as a national championship, series such as the CARS Tour, ASA, UARA, and the ACT draw the biggest attention and sanction most of the biggest races in the country.

==United States==




===NASCAR===
NASCAR is currently the largest stock car racing governing body in the world. While NASCAR sanctions multiple series, it has three national championship touring series that are commonly referred to as the &quot;top 3&quot; series. In addition to the top three series, NASCAR also sanctions many regional and local series. NASCAR also sanctions three international series that race in Canada, Mexico, and Europe.

====NASCAR Cup Series====

The most prominent championship in stock car racing is the NASCAR Cup Series. It is the most popular racing series in the United States, drawing over 6 million spectators in 1997, an average live audience of over 190,000 people for each race.

The most famous event in the series is the Daytona 500, an annual race at the Daytona International Speedway. The series&#x27; second-biggest event is arguably The Brickyard 400, an annual race held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the legendary home of the Indianapolis 500, an open-wheeled race. However, the event was excluded from the 2021 schedule in favor of a race on the track&#x27;s road course. Together the Cup Series and Xfinity Series drew 8 million spectators in 1997, compared to 4 million for both American open-wheel series (CART and IRL), which merged in 2008 under the IRL banner. In 2002, 17 of the 20 US top sporting events in terms of attendance were stock car races. Only football drew more television viewers that year.
====NASCAR Xfinity Series====

The NASCAR Xfinity Series is the second tier series in the United States. It serves as the primary feeder series to the Cup Series, similar to Formula Two for Formula One, and Indy Lights for Indy Car. Races are commonly held as a support race to Cup Series events. Many current Cup Series drivers formerly competed in the Series before moving on to competing full-time in the Cup Series.

The Xfinity series typically features multiple Cup Series competitors competing alongside full time Xfinity drivers. There was some controversy as Cup Series drivers tended to be more successful than full-time Xfinity drivers. Cup drivers are not eligible to score points in the Xfinity series, and are limited to the number of races they are allowed to race in the Series.

====NASCAR Camping World Truck Series====
Starting in 1995, the NASCAR Truck Series is the third highest ranking stock car series in the United States. The series was the brainchild of then-NASCAR West Coast executive Ken Clapp, who was inspired by off-road truck racing. Unlike the other two national touring NASCAR series, the Truck Series race pickup truck styled bodies, though it is still considered a stock car series because of its similarity. Much like the Xfinity Series, the Truck Series often features Cup Series drivers competing for parts of the season.

===ARCA===
The Automobile Racing Club of America was founded in 1953 as a Midwest regional series. In addition to the ARCA Menards Series, it formerly sanctioned the ARCA Midwest Tour, and the ARCA Lincoln Welders Truck Series from 1999 to 2016.

NASCAR purchased ARCA in early 2018. For the 2020 season, the NASCAR K&amp;N Series East and West were rebranded under the ARCA banner as the ARCA Menards Series East and ARCA Menards Series West.

===Other series===
Outside of NASCAR, there are a number of other national or regional stock-car sanctioning bodies in the United States. There are many organizations that cater to these local short tracks. The American Speed Association (ASA), Champion Racing Association (CRA), International Motor Contest Association (IMCA), United Auto Racing Association (UARA), Championship Auto Racing Series (CARS), American Canadian Tour (ACT), SMART Modified Tour, StockCar Racing League and the Pro All Star Series (PASS) are the most prominent sanctioning bodies. Many Cup, Xfinity, Truck, and ARCA Series drivers, especially recently, have raced in these series and many still do after reaching the highest level. The International Race of Champions (IROC) and Superstar Racing Experience (SRX) are usually perceived as being outside of the regular stock car racing scene because of their all-star grids.

==New Zealand==
Cars are built to an extremely rigid design and feature strong steel guards around almost the entire car. &quot;Stockcars&quot; are divided into three classes: Superstocks, Stock cars, Ministocks (Ministocks predominantly being a non-contact youth class).
Superstocks are the top class and are typically powered by V8 engines up to which can produce over . The majority of races are of an individual nature however, unique to New Zealand stock car racing is the team racing format. Typically teams racing consists of two teams of four cars each that work together to win the race. Teams normally protect their &quot;runners&quot; while attempting to eliminate the opposing team, the races can be decided by a points format or first across the finish line.

The class most resembling the North American form of stock car racing are known as Saloon cars. Super Saloons are similar to dirt late models with the main differences being the bodies closer resemble production cars, use iron engines up to with no rear offset and run much larger sprint car tyres on the rear.

==Australia==

Stock car racing in the NASCAR mould (AUSCAR) had a following in Australia during the mid-late 1980s and through the 1990s, but with the advent of the Supercars Championship, which took up the bulk of the competitors, sponsorship dollars on offer as well as major television time, the Australian Superspeedway series shut down after 2001.

The majority of the NASCAR and AUSCAR racing in Australia took place at the 1.801 km (1.119 mi), high-banked (24°) Calder Park Thunderdome in Melbourne. The Thunderdome, which was opened in 1987 and was built by multi-millionaire tyre retailer Bob Jane at a cost of A$54 million, was modeled on a scaled down version of the famous Charlotte Motor Speedway. Other tracks used included the mile (805 metre) Speedway Super Bowl at the Adelaide International Raceway (also owned by Jane, this was the only paved oval track in Australia other than the Thunderdome, though with only 7° banking in the turns it was more of a traditional flat track), as well as road courses such as the Surfers Paradise Street Circuit (where the cars ran as a support category to the Gold Coast IndyCar Grand Prix), Oran Park in Sydney, and the famous Mount Panorama Circuit.

==United Kingdom==
The term &#x27;stock cars&#x27; in the UK refers to a specialized form of racing that bears little resemblance to any road car.

Stock car racing was brought to Britain in 1954. Taking place on existing greyhound or speedway tracks, the cars were mostly &#x27;stock&#x27; cars from the 1930s with locked rear axle differentials and added armour. After the first couple of years &#x27;specials&#x27; began to appear eventually making the &#x27;stock&#x27; car name something of a misnomer. Since the early days of stock car racing in Britain the sport has developed into many different classes, from the destructive &#x27;Banger&#x27; categories to the very sophisticated National Hot Rods. However, the name &#x27;stock car&#x27; is usually reserved for that racing class which traces its roots back to these early days in the 1950s, BriSCA F1 Stock Cars, which were previously known as &quot;The Seniors&quot; or &quot;Senior Stock Cars&quot;. Despite the physical demands of this full-contact sport, many competitors have been racing for 20 and even 30 years. For the first 10 years of the sport, stock cars were either adapted from road cars, or bore the recognizable bodywork of road cars. By the 1970s, chassis and bodywork had evolved into very specialized forms.

In 2001 the ASCAR Racing Series was formed and ran until 2008, the series was a &quot;NASCAR&quot; style racing series that was predominantly run at Rockingham Motor Speedway as well as briefly on the continent. The first season was won by John Mickel. Other notable champions were Nicolas Minassian and Ben Collins who also played as The Stig on Top Gear. The field was usually populated by professional or semi-professional stock car drivers, however notable drivers who were famous from other areas of motorsport either took part in single races or for one complete season, they included Colin McRae, Jason Plato, Matt Neal, Darren Manning, Max Papis, John Cleland and former NASCAR drivers Brandon Whitt and Randy Tolsma.

The modern BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars are a highly sophisticated purpose built race car with race-tuned V-8 engines developing , quick change axles and gearboxes and biased and staggered chassis and braking set up for constant left turning. However large bumpers were mandatory with contact very much encouraged to remove opponents. The sport can be seen at venues throughout Britain and Mainland Europe. A downsized version of the BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars, the smaller BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars, previously known as &quot;The Juniors&quot; or &quot;Junior Stock Cars&quot;, are also very popular. these cars are powered by the 2 litre Ford &#x27;Pinto&#x27; engine. There are also many other formulas running on the oval tracks throughout a season that starts around March/Easter and continues to October/November.

In the 2008 World Final, held at Ipswich, Andy Smith raced to victory becoming the 2008 BriSCA F1 Stock Car World Champion for the second time in his career, taking the crown from brother Stuart Smith Jnr. 2009 also saw Andy Smith win again this time at Kings Lynns Norfolk Arena. 2010 saw Andy Smith win for a 3rd consecutive time at Coventry, the same venue as his 1st win in 2006. The 2011 World Championship took place at Northampton on September 10 with 2 Paul Harrison the winner of the Gold Roof. The 2012 World Championship held at Skegness was won by 217 Lee Fairhurst. The 2013 World Championship will be held at King&#x27;s Lynn on Saturday 21 September.

In 2008, Ian Thompson Jr. became the first driver from Northern Ireland to win the Brisca F2 Stock Car World title since 1972 when he took the honours at Bristol in 2008. However, it was in controversial circumstances after first across the line Gordon Moodie (Thomson Jr&#x27;s brother-in-law) was disqualified from the race after being found with carburetor irregularities at post race scrutineering. This irregularity has since been proven to be a manufacturing fault with the control of the driver but the governing body have refused to reinstate Gordon Moodie as the winner in the record books. In 2009 the World Championship winner was Micky Brennan and in 2010 the World Championship winner was John Fortune. The 2011 World Championship Final took place at Kings Lynns Norfolk Arena on Saturday 17 September with 871 Mark Simpson winner of the Gold Roof. In 2012, the World Championship was won again by 968 Micky Brennan this time held at Barford. The 2013 World Championship weekend will be held over 2 days of racing on 14/15 September at Smeatharpe near Honiton in Devon.

Another open wheeled stock car formula that races in the UK are Spedeworth Superstox. Licensed by Spedeworth, as opposed to BriSCA, Superstox are similar to Formula Two Stock Cars with the main visual difference being a smaller wing on the roof. These cars are also powered by the 2 litre Ford &#x27;Pinto&#x27; engine. The 2010 World Championship Final held at Ipswich was won by Colin Aylward. The 2011 World Championship Final was held at Londons Wimbledon Stadium on Sunday 23 October and won by 151 Nick Smith. The 2012 World Championship was again held at Ipswich and won by Scot 177 Stuart Gilchrist. The 2013 World Championship will be held at Lochgelly in Fife, Scotland, with the date tbc.

Another form of UK stock car racing is Saloon Stock Cars, regulated by the Saloon Stock Car Association. This formula is based on heavily armoured Ford Sierra, Ford Mondeo, Vauxhall Vectra cars purposely reconstructed for this full-contact class. The 2011 World Championship was held at Skegness in August with 677 Eddie Darby the winner of the Gold Roof for the next 12 months. The 2012 World Championship Final was held at Smeatharpe Raceway near Honiton in Devon in August 2012 and again won by 677 Eddie Darby. Other similar Stock Car classes are the 2 Litre Stock Cars licensed by Spedeworth and the 1300 Stock Cars licensed by several different promoters each to slightly differing rules although steps are currently being taken to standardise the specifications in order to make it a national class. The 2012 World Championship was won by 79 Barry Radcliffe at Ipswich. The 2013 World Championship will be held at King&#x27;s Lynn on Saturday 17 August.

==Canada==

Stock Car Racing has existed in Canada as early as the 1950s in amateur format, although official structured competitions began with the foundation of CASCAR in 1981. The league went on for a few decades until 2006, when it was purchased by NASCAR and became the NASCAR Canada Series. Vehicle models used are typically from the makes of Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford. The series runs a higher percentage of road and street courses compared to the top 4 NASCAR series in America. The competition has had a growing interest in the recent decades.

==Other regions==

Internationally, stock car racing has not enjoyed the same success as within the United States and Canada. Brazil also has a successful stock car racing series, with starting grids of 30 or more cars, and two brands competing: Chevrolet and Toyota. Brazilian Stock Car also has two developing series. Despite the name, Brazilian stock car competitions are not held on oval tracks, thus they resemble more touring car racing than stock car racing the same can be said about Argentina&#x27;s popular stock series, called Turismo Carretera.
Unsuccessful efforts have been made in Australia, Chile, South Africa, and Japan as well.

==Career paths==
NASCAR drivers take various paths to the highest stock car divisions. Some start racing on dirt surfaces but all end up racing on asphalt surfaces as they progress in their career. They frequently start in karting or in cars that are completely stock except for safety modifications. They generally advance through intermediate or advanced local-level divisions. The highest local division, asphalt late model racing, is generally considered a requirement to advance to the next step, regional and national touring series.

Dirt track drivers follow the same general path. Their highest divisions are less well-known national touring late model series such as the World of Outlaws Late Model Series and regional touring series.

===Crossover drivers===
Some drivers have entered stock car racing after starting on a very different career path. The most famous might well be Mario Andretti, who won the Indianapolis 500 (1969), NASCAR&#x27;s Daytona 500 (1967), and the Formula One World Championship (1978). Juan Pablo Montoya had wins in all three series, with two Indy 500 wins (2000 and 2015), seven Formula One wins and two Sprint Cup wins (2007 and 2010). A. J. Foyt, with four Indianapolis 500 wins, seven IndyCar championships, and a victory in the 24 Hours of Le Mans on his resume, also won the Daytona 500 in 1972. Johnny Rutherford, a three-time winner at Indy, has the rare distinction of winning his first NASCAR start, a qualifying race for the 1963 Daytona 500. Dan Gurney, a leading 1960s Formula One driver and later one of the most successful constructors of Indy cars (as well as being Foyt&#x27;s co-driver at Le Mans), excelled in NASCAR&#x27;s road-course events, winning at Riverside five times between 1963 and 1968. A notable crossover oddity is the one-race NASCAR career of the colorful Formula One and sports car driver Innes Ireland: after retiring at the end of the 1966 season, he was invited by NASCAR czar Bill France to compete at Daytona, where he was running in the top ten when his engine blew on the 126th of 200 laps.

Montoya initially surprised the auto racing community by leaving F1, but he was quickly followed by other drivers. Open wheel stars like Sam Hornish Jr., Patrick Carpentier, Dario Franchitti, Jacques Villeneuve, A. J. Allmendinger and Danica Patrick all made the move to the Monster Energy Cup series, with varying degrees of success. Two-time Australian Supercars champion Marcos Ambrose competed in the Monster Energy Cup Series from 2007 to 2014, winning two races.

Other drivers compete often in stock car racing but are well known for their success elsewhere. Ron Fellows and Boris Said are champion road racers and are often brought in by teams solely to compete in NASCAR&#x27;s road course events, a title known as road course ringers. Robby Gordon was one of NASCAR&#x27;s few remaining owner-drivers, but he is most famous for his numerous off-road championships and his three Baja 1000 wins.

==Tracks==
Stock car races take place predominantly on oval tracks of 3 or 4 turns, with all turns to the left. Oval tracks are classified as &quot;short track&quot; (less than 1 mile), &quot;intermediate&quot; or &quot;speedway&quot; (1 to 2 miles) or &quot;superspeedway&quot; (over 2 miles). &quot;Road courses&quot; are any tracks having both left and right turns. Depending on the track, typical race speeds can vary from at Martinsville to over at Talladega. In 1987 Bill Elliott&#x27;s qualifying time at Talladega brought about a change at superspeedways (Daytona and Talladega). Such high speeds and Bobby Allison&#x27;s car going airborne into the catch-fence and injuring fans forced NASCAR to implement power-reducing measures, one of which was the mandated implement of below carburetor restrictor plates. This later became known as restrictor plate racing.

===Tactics===
In contrast with most forms of racing, minor car-to-car contact is generally accepted in stock car racing. This may happen in the form of forcing another vehicle out of the way, or pushing a competing vehicle forward for mutual benefit. Stock cars are generally built to be tolerant of superficial damage to bodywork, whereas open wheel designs can experience severe reductions in performance with even slight spoiler damage. On intermediate tracks and superspeedways, drafting is used to reduce the overall effect of drag. A driver accomplishes this by positioning the vehicle close to the one ahead of so as to benefit from the other&#x27;s slipstream. Drafting was &quot;discovered&quot; by Junior Johnson during his winning performance at the 1960 Daytona 500.

<text>In the sociology of religion, secondary conversion is the religious conversion of an individual that results from a relationship with another convert, rather than from any particular aspect of the new religion. For example, someone might join a religious group primarily because their spouse or partner has done so; such a person would be a secondary convert. Secondary converts are people who join a religion only because of a relationship with the other convert.

Secondary conversion can greatly expand a movement&#x27;s influence, particularly after a conquest, such as the Muslim Moorish conquest of Spain and Catholic Spain&#x27;s conquests in Latin America.

<text>Sociology of religion is the study of the beliefs, practices and organizational forms of religion using the tools and methods of the discipline of sociology. This objective investigation may include the use both of quantitative methods (surveys, polls, demographic and census analysis) and of qualitative approaches (such as participant observation, interviewing, and analysis of archival, historical and documentary materials).

Modern sociology as an academic discipline began with the analysis of religion in Émile Durkheim&#x27;s 1897 study of suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations, a foundational work of social research which served to distinguish sociology from other disciplines, such as psychology. The works of Karl Marx (1818–1883) and Max Weber (1864–1920) emphasized the relationship between religion and the economic or social structure of society. Contemporary debates have centered on issues such as secularization, civil religion, and the cohesiveness of religion in the context of globalization and multiculturalism. Contemporary sociology of religion may also encompass the sociology of irreligion (for instance, in the analysis of secular-humanist belief systems).

The sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that it does not set out to assess the validity of religious beliefs. The process of comparing multiple conflicting dogmas may require what Peter L. Berger has described as inherent &quot;methodological atheism&quot;.
Whereas the sociology of religion broadly differs from theology in assuming indifference to the supernatural, theorists tend to acknowledge socio-cultural reification of religious practice.

==Classical sociology==
Classical, seminal sociological theorists of the late 19th and early 20th century such as Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Karl Marx were greatly interested in religion and its effects on society. Like those of Plato and Aristotle from ancient Greece, and Enlightenment philosophers from the 17th through 19th centuries, the ideas posited by these sociologists continue to be examined today.
Durkheim, Marx, and Weber had very complex and developed theories about the nature and effects of religion. Of these, Durkheim and Weber are often more difficult to understand, especially in light of the lack of context and examples in their primary texts. Religion was considered to be an extremely important social variable in the work of all three.

===Karl Marx===
According to Kevin J. Christiano, &quot;Marx was the product of the Enlightenment, embracing its call to replace faith by reason and religion by science.&quot; But he &quot;did not believe in science for science&#x27;s sake … he believed that he was also advancing a theory that would … be a useful tool … [in] effecting a revolutionary upheaval of the capitalist system in favor of socialism.&quot;

As such, the crux of his arguments was that humans are best guided by reason. Religion, Marx held, was a significant hindrance to reason, inherently masking the truth and misguiding followers. Marx viewed alienation as the heart of social inequality. The antithesis to this alienation is freedom. Thus, to propagate freedom means to present individuals with the truth and give them a choice to accept or deny it. In this, &quot;Marx never suggested that religion ought to be prohibited.&quot;

Central to Marx&#x27;s theories was the oppressive economic situation in which he dwelt. With the rise of European industrialism, Marx and his colleague Friedrich Engels witnessed and responded to the growth of what he called &quot;surplus value&quot;. Marx&#x27;s view of capitalism saw rich capitalists getting richer and their workers getting poorer (the gap, the exploitation, was the &quot;surplus value&quot;). Not only were workers getting exploited, but in the process they were being further detached from the products they helped create. By simply selling their work for wages, &quot;workers simultaneously lose connection with the object of labor and become objects themselves. Workers are devalued to the level of a commoditya thing …&quot; From this objectification comes alienation. The common worker is led to believe that he or she is a replaceable tool, and is alienated to the point of extreme discontent. Here, in Marx&#x27;s eyes, religion enters. Capitalism utilizes our tendency towards religion as a tool or ideological state apparatus to justify this alienation. Christianity teaches that those who gather up riches and power in this life will almost certainly not be rewarded in the next (&quot;it is harder for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven than it is for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle …&quot;) while those who suffer oppression and poverty in this life while cultivating their spiritual wealth will be rewarded in the Kingdom of God. Hence Marx&#x27;s famous line – &quot;religion is the opium of the people&quot;, as it soothes them and dulls their senses to the pain of oppression. Some scholars have recently noted that this is a contradictory (or dialectical) metaphor, referring to religion as both an expression of suffering and a protest against suffering.
===Émile Durkheim===
Émile Durkheim placed himself in the positivist tradition, meaning that he thought of his study of society as dispassionate and scientific. He was deeply interested in the problem of what held complex modern societies together. Religion, he argued, was an expression of social cohesion.

In the field work that led to his famous &quot;Elementary Forms of Religious Life&quot;, Durkheim, a secular Frenchman, looked at anthropological data of Indigenous Australians. His underlying interest was to understand the basic forms of religious life for all societies. In &quot;Elementary Forms&quot;, Durkheim argues that the totems the Aborigines venerate are actually expressions of their own conceptions of society itself. This is true not only for the Aborigines, he argues, but for all societies.

Religion, for Durkheim, was not &quot;imaginary&quot;, although he did deprive it of what many believers find essential. Religion is very real; it is an expression of society itself, and indeed, there is no society that does not have religion. We perceive as individuals a force greater than ourselves, which is our social life, and give that perception a supernatural face. We then express ourselves religiously in groups, which for Durkheim makes the symbolic power greater. Religion is an expression of our collective consciousness, which is the fusion of all of our individual consciousnesses, which then creates a reality of its own.

It follows, then, that less complex societies, such as the Australian Aborigines, have less complex religious systems, involving totems associated with particular clans. The more complex a particular society, the more complex the religious system is. As societies come in contact with other societies, there is a tendency for religious systems to emphasize universalism to a greater and greater extent. However, as the division of labour makes the individual seem more important (a subject that Durkheim treats extensively in his famous &quot;The Division of Labour in Society&quot;), religious systems increasingly focus on individual salvation and conscience.

Durkheim&#x27;s definition of religion, from &quot;Elementary Forms&quot;, is as follows: &quot;A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden – beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.&quot; This is a functional definition of religion, meaning that it explains what religion &quot;does&quot; in social life: essentially, it unites societies. Durkheim defined religion as a clear distinction between the sacred and the profane, in effect this can be paralleled with the distinction between God and humans.

This definition also does not stipulate what exactly may be considered sacred. Thus later sociologists of religion (notably Robert Neelly Bellah) have extended Durkheimian insights to talk about notions of civil religion, or the religion of a state. American civil religion, for example, might be said to have its own set of sacred &quot;things&quot;: the flag of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., etc. Other sociologists have taken Durkheim&#x27;s concept of what religion is in the direction of the religion of professional sports, the military, or of rock music.

===Max Weber===
Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of economic sociology and his rationalization thesis: &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot; (1905), &quot;The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism&quot; (1915), &quot;The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism&quot; (1915), and &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot; (1920).In his sociology, Weber uses the German term &quot;Verstehen&quot; to describe his method of interpretation of the intention and context of human action. Weber is not a positivist; he does not believe we can find out &quot;facts&quot; in sociology that can be causally linked. Although he believes some generalized statements about social life can be made, he is not interested in hard positivist claims, but instead in linkages and sequences, in historical narratives and particular cases.

Weber argues for making sense of religious action on its own terms. A religious group or individual is influenced by all kinds of things, he says, but if they claim to be acting in the name of religion, we should attempt to understand their perspective on religious grounds first. Weber gives religion credit for shaping a person&#x27;s image of the world, and this image of the world can affect their view of their interests, and ultimately how they decide to take action.

For Weber, religion is best understood as it responds to the human need for theodicy and soteriology. Human beings are troubled, he says, with the question of theodicy – the question of how the extraordinary power of a divine god may be reconciled with the imperfection of the world that he has created and rules over. People need to know, for example, why there is undeserved good fortune and suffering in the world. Religion offers people soteriological answers, or answers that provide opportunities for salvation – relief from suffering, and reassuring meaning. The pursuit of salvation, like the pursuit of wealth, becomes a part of human motivation.

Because religion helps to define motivation, Weber believed that religion (and specifically Calvinism) actually helped to give rise to modern capitalism, as he asserted in his most famous and controversial work, &quot;The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism&quot;.

In &quot;The Protestant Ethic&quot;, Weber argues that capitalism arose in Europe in part because of how the belief in predestination was interpreted by everyday English Puritans. Puritan theology was based on the Calvinist notion that not everyone would be saved; there was only a specific number of the elect who would avoid damnation, and this was based sheerly on God&#x27;s predetermined will and not on any action you could perform in this life. Official doctrine held that one could not ever really know whether one was among the elect.

Practically, Weber noted, this was difficult psychologically: people were (understandably) anxious to know whether they would be eternally damned or not. Thus Puritan leaders began assuring members that if they began doing well financially in their businesses, this would be one unofficial sign they had God&#x27;s approval and were among the saved – but only if they used the fruits of their labour well. This along with the rationalism implied by monotheism led to the development of rational bookkeeping and the calculated pursuit of financial success beyond what one needed simply to live – and this is the &quot;spirit of capitalism&quot;. Over time, the habits associated with the spirit of capitalism lost their religious significance, and the rational pursuit of profit became an aim in its own right.

&quot;The Protestant Ethic&quot; thesis has been much critiqued, refined, and disputed, but is still a lively source of theoretical debate in sociology of religion. Weber also did considerable work on world religions, including Hinduism and Buddhism.

In his &quot;magnum opus&quot; &quot;Economy and Society&quot; Weber distinguished three ideal types of religious attitudes:
# world-flying mysticism
# world-rejecting asceticism
# inner-worldly asceticism.

He also separated magic as pre-religious activity.

==Theoretical perspectives==

===Symbolic anthropology and phenomenology===
Symbolic anthropology and some versions of phenomenology argue that all humans require reassurance that the world is safe and ordered place – that is, they have a need for ontological security. Therefore, all societies have forms of knowledge that perform this psychological task. The inability of science to offer psychological and emotional comfort explains the presence and influence of non-scientific knowledge in human lives, even in rational world.

===Functionalism===
Unlike symbolic anthropology and phenomenology, functionalism points to the benefits for social organization which non-scientific belief systems provide and which scientific knowledge fails to deliver. Belief systems are seen as encouraging social order and social stability in ways that rationally based knowledge cannot. From this perspective, the existence of non-rational accounts of reality can be explained by the benefits they offer to society.

According to functionalists, &quot;religion serves several purposes, like providing answers to spiritual mysteries, offering emotional comfort, and creating a place for social interaction and social control. … One of the most important functions of religion, from a functionalist perspective, is the opportunities it creates for social interaction and the formation of groups. It provides social support and social networking, offering a place to meet others who hold similar values and a place to seek help (spiritual and material) in times of need.&quot;

===Rationalism===
Rationalists object to the phenomenological and functionalist approaches, arguing that these approaches fail to understand why believers in systems of non-scientific knowledge think that their ideas are right, even when science has shown them to be wrong. Rationalists say that one cannot explain forms of knowledge in terms of the beneficial psychological or societal effects that an outside observer may see them as producing and emphasize the importance of looking at the point of view of those who believe in them. People do not believe in God, practice magic, or think that witches cause misfortune because they think they are providing themselves with psychological reassurance, or to achieve greater social cohesion for their social groups.

Rationalists see the history of modern societies as the rise of scientific knowledge and the subsequent decline of non-rational belief. Some of these beliefs, such as magic and witchcraft, had disappeared, while others, such as religion, had become marginalized. This rationalist perspective has led to secularization theories of various kinds.

==Typology of religious groups==
One common among sociologists, religious groups are classified as ecclesias, denominations, sects, or cults (now more commonly referred to in scholarship as new religious movements). The church-sect typology has its origins in the work of Max Weber. There is a basic premise continuum along which religions fall, ranging from the protest-like orientation of sects to the equilibrium maintaining churches. This continuum includes several additional types. Note that sociologists give these words precise definitions which differ from how they are commonly used. In particular, sociologists use the words &#x27;cult&#x27; and &#x27;sect&#x27; without negative connotations, even though the popular use of these words is often pejorative.

Churches are the religious bodies that coexist in a relatively low state of tension with their social surrounding. They have mainstream &quot;safe&quot; beliefs and practices relative to those of the general population. This type of religious bodies are more world affirming, so they try to peacefully coexist with the secular world and are low-tension organizations.

Sects are high-tension organizations that don&#x27;t fit well within the existing social environment. They are usually most attractive to society&#x27;s least privileged- outcasts, minorities, or the poor- because they downplay worldly pleasure by stressing otherworldly promises. When church leaders become too involved in secular issues, sects start to splinter off the existing church. They may end up forming their own sect and if over time the sect picks up a significant following, it almost inevitably transforms into its own church, ultimately becoming part of the mainstream.

A cult is a religious movement that makes some new claim about the supernatural and therefore does not easily fit within the sect-church cycle. All religions began as cults, and their leaders offer new insights, claiming that they are the word of God. They are often high-tension movements that antagonize their social world and/or are antagonized by it.

Denomination lies between the church and the sect on the continuum. They come into existence when churches lose their religious monopoly in a society. When churches or sects become denominations, there are also some changes in their characteristics.

==Religiosity==
Some sociologists of religion explore the theoretical analysis of the sociological dimensions of religiosity. For example, Charles Y. Glock is best known for his five-dimensional scheme of the nature of religious commitment. His list consist of the following variables: belief, knowledge, experience, practice (sometimes subdivided into private and public ritual) and consequences. Glock&#x27;s first four dimensions have proved widely useful in research, because generally, they are simple to measure survey research. Similarly, Mervin F. Verbit&#x27;s contribution was a twenty four-dimensional religiosity measure which includes measuring religiosity through six different &quot;components&quot; of religiosity: ritual, doctrine, emotion, knowledge, ethics, community, and along four dimensions: content, frequency, intensity, centrality.

==Secularization and civil religion==
Secularism is the general movement away from religiosity and spiritual belief towards a rational, scientific, orientation, a trend observed in Muslim and Christian industrialized nations alike. In the United States of America, many politicians, court systems, schools, and businesses embrace secularism. In relation to the processes of rationalization associated with the development of modernity, it was predicted in the works of many classical sociologists that religion would decline. They claimed that there would be a separation of religion from the institutions such as the state, economy, and family. Despite the claims of many classical theorists and sociologists immediately after World War II, many contemporary theorists have critiqued secularization thesis, arguing that religion has continued to play a vital role in the lives of individuals worldwide. In the United States, in particular, church attendance has remained relatively stable in the past 40 years. In Africa, the emergence of Christianity has occurred at a high rate. While Africa could claim roughly 10 million Christians in 1900, recent estimates put that number closer to 200 million. The rise of Islam as a major world religion, especially its new-found influence in the West, is another significant development. Peter Berger, an American sociologist, considers secularization is the result of a larger sociostructural crisis in religion is caused by pluralism. Pluralism is the presence and engaged coexistence of numerous distinct groups in one society. The United States is both highly religious and pluralistic, standing out among other industrialized and wealthy nations in this regard. In short, presupposed secularization as a decline in religiosity might seem to be a myth, depending on its definition and the definition of its scope. For instance, some sociologists have argued that steady church attendance and personal religious belief may coexist with a decline in the influence of religious authorities on social or political issues. Additionally, regular attendance or affiliation do not necessarily translate into a behavior according to their doctrinal teachings.

===Religious economy===
According to Rodney Stark, David Martin was the first contemporary sociologist to reject the secularization theory outright. Martin even proposed that the concept of secularization be eliminated from social scientific discourse, on the grounds that it had only served ideological purposes and because there was no evidence of any general shift from a religious period in human affairs to a secular period.
Stark is well known for pioneering, with William Sims Bainbridge, a theory of religious economy, according to which societies that restrict supply of religion, either through an imposed state religious monopoly or through state-sponsored secularization, are the main causes of drops in religiosity. Correspondingly, the more religions a society has, the more likely the population is to be religious. This contradicts the older view of secularization which states that if a liberal religious community is tolerant of a wide array of belief, then the population is less likely to hold certain beliefs in common, so nothing can be shared and reified in a community context, leading to a reduction in religious observance. The religious economy model sparked a lively debate among sociologists of religion on whether market models fit religious practices and on the extents to which this model of religious behavior is specific to the United States.

===Peter Berger===
Peter Berger observed that while researchers supporting the secularization theory have long maintained that religion must inevitably decline in the modern world, today, much of the world is as religious as ever. This points to the falsity of the secularization theory. On the other hand, Berger also notes that secularization may be indeed have taken hold in Europe, while the United States and other regions have continued to remain religious despite the increased modernity. Dr. Berger suggested that the reason for this may have to do with the education system; in Europe, teachers are sent by the educational authorities and European parents would have to put up with secular teaching, while in the United States, schools were for much of the time under local authorities, and American parents, however unenlightened, could fire their teachers. Berger also notes that unlike Europe, America has seen the rise of Evangelical Protestantism, or &quot;born-again Christians&quot;.

===Bryan Wilson===
Bryan R. Wilson a writer on secularization, explores life in societies dominated by scientific knowledge. His work follows Max Weber&#x27;s view that modern societies prioritize rationality, focusing on technical efficiency and practical solutions over existential questions, leading to a disenchanted world. Wilson argues that non-scientific systems, especially religions, have seen an irreversible decline in influence. While some dispute the secularization thesis, claiming that traditional religions have been replaced by new sects, individual spirituality, or functional alternatives like nationalism, Wilson views the rise in diverse non-scientific belief systems as evidence of religion’s diminished central role in modern society.

===Ernest Gellner===
Unlike Wilson and Weber, Ernest Gellner (1974) acknowledges that there are drawbacks to living in a world whose main form of knowledge is confined to facts we can do nothing about and that provide us with no guidelines on how to live and how to organize ourselves. In this regard, we are worse off than pre-modern people, whose knowledge, while incorrect, at least provided them with prescriptions for living. However, Gellner insists that these disadvantages are far outweighed by the huge technological advances modern societies have experienced as a result of the application of scientific knowledge.

Gellner doesn&#x27;t claim that non-scientific knowledge is in the process of dying out. For example, he accepts that religions in various forms continue to attract adherents. He also acknowledges that other forms of belief and meaning, such as those provided by art, music, literature, popular culture (a specifically modern phenomenon), drug taking, political protest, and so on are important for many people. Nevertheless, he rejects the relativist interpretation of this situation – that in modernity, scientific knowledge is just one of many accounts of existence, all of which have equal validity. This is because, for Gellner, such alternatives to science are profoundly insignificant since they are technically impotent, as opposed to science. He sees that modern preoccupations with meaning and being as a self-indulgence that is only possible because scientific knowledge has enabled our world to advance so far. Unlike those in pre-modern times, whose overriding priority is to get hold of scientific knowledge in order to begin to develop, we can afford to sit back in the luxury of our well-appointed world and ponder upon such questions because we can take for granted the kind of world science has constructed for us.

===Michel Foucault===
Michel Foucault was a post-structuralist who saw human existence as being dependent on forms of knowledge – discourses – that work like languages. Languages/discourses define reality for us. In order to think at all, we are obliged to use these definitions. The knowledge we have about the world is provided for us by the languages and discourses we encounter in the times and places in which we live our lives. Thus, who we are, what we know to be true, and what we think are discursively constructed.

Foucault defined history as the rise and fall of discourses. Social change is about changes in prevailing forms of knowledge. The job of the historian is to chart these changes and identify the reasons for them. Unlike rationalists, however, Foucault saw no element of progress in this process. To Foucault, what is distinctive about modernity is the emergence of discourses concerned with the control and regulation of the body. According to Foucault, the rise of body-centered discourses necessarily involved a process of secularization. Pre-modern discourses were dominated by religion, where things were defined as good and evil, and social life was centered around these concepts. With the emergence of modern urban societies, scientific discourses took over, and medical science was a crucial element of this new knowledge. Modern life became increasingly subject to medical control – the medical gaze, as Foucault called it.

The rise to power of science, and of medicine in particular, coincided with a progressive reduction of the power of religious forms of knowledge. For example, normality and deviance became more of a matter of health and illness than of good and evil, and the physician took over from the priest the role of defining, promoting, and healing deviance.

===Other perspectives===

BBC News reported on a study by physicists and mathematicians that attempted to use mathematical modelling (nonlinear dynamics) to predict future religious orientations of populations. The study suggests that religion is headed towards &quot;extinction&quot; in various nations where it has been on the decline: Australia, Austria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland. The model considers not only the changing number of people with certain beliefs, but also attempts to assign utility values of a belief in each nation.

Thomas Luckmann maintains that the sociology of religion should cease preoccupations with the traditional and institutionalized forms of religion. Luckmann points instead to the &quot;religious problem&quot; which is the &quot;problem of individual existence.&quot; This is the case as with the advent of modernity, religious meaning making has shifted more into the individual domain.

==Globalization==

The sociology of religion continues to grow throughout the world, attempting to understand the relationship between religion and globalization. Two older approaches to globalization include modernization theory, a functionalist derivative, and world-systems theory, a Marxist approach. One of the differences between these theories is whether they view capitalism as positive or problematic. However, both assumed that modernization and capitalism would diminish the hold of religion.

To the contrary, as globalization intensified many different cultures started to look into different religions and incorporate different beliefs into society. New interpretations emerged that recognize the tensions. For example, according to Paul James and Peter Mandaville:
Religion and globalization have been intertwined with each other since the early empires attempted to extend their reach across what they perceived to be world-space. Processes of globalization carried religious cosmologies – including traditional conceptions of universalism – to the corners of the world, while these cosmologies legitimated processes of globalization. This dynamic of inter-relation has continued to the present, but with changing and sometimes new and intensifying contradictions.
== Latin American Sociology of Religion ==
Olga Odgers notes that in recent decades, there have been important developments in Latin American writing within the subspecialty of the sociology of religion, as the field itself has also shifted from “sociology about Latin American religion” to a “Latin American sociology of religion”, taking contemporary Latin American forms of religiosity as an empirical referent, then goes even further to propose interpretive frameworks and new methodologies that contribute to the understanding of religious phenomena at a global level.

Roberto Blancarte, according to Odgers, identifies three main periods in the development of a Latin American sociology of religion:

# First Period (From the birth of the sociology of religion until World War II): Religion, especially Catholicism, was viewed as a traditional cultural aspect that would eventually fade away. Scholars considered it a subject better suited for historians or anthropologists rather than sociologists. The primary focus was on Catholicism due to its formal dominance and special relationship with the state across Latin America.
# Second Period (1970s to Early 21st Century): This period saw a significant shift due to the increasing religious diversity in the region, termed the &quot;explosion of pluralism.&quot; Scholars began moving away from classical paradigms, such as the secularization thesis, and sought new frameworks that could more accurately capture the complex religious landscape of Latin America.
# Third Period (Early 21st Century Onwards): Marked by a surge of interest from a new generation of sociologists, this period involved innovative approaches and research methods that moved beyond past theories. Scholars began producing original data, interpretations, and theoretical perspectives that not only advanced the study of religion in Latin America but also contributed to understanding global religious transformations.

Due to its complex nature, several studies demonstrated growing interest in understanding the religious context in relation to the multiple global processes playing out across the subcontinent, such as marginalization, ethnicity, migration, aging, and education.

Not only does religion shape large-scale social institutions such as government and social movements, it plays a part in families, race, gender, class, and age – things involved in everyday lives.

=== Families ===
One of the biggest indicators of religiosity in adulthood is the religious atmosphere within families and upbringing, given that religious beliefs and practices are passed on from generation to generation. Depending on the type of religion in the family, it can involve a different familial structure. For example, practising Catholics tend to have larger families
since the Catholic church is opposed to both contraception and abortion.

Children receive a religious legacy from their parents and from the society immediately surrounding them, through instruction and (intentionally or unintentionally) through the power of example that is shaped by values, personality, and interests. Their religious legacy may include induction into organizations and into civic or secular religions.

Their religious legacy is among the factors that condition people throughout their lives, although people as individuals have diverse reactions to their legacies. To outsiders who know them, people are identified in part by their religious legacy. For example, people born and raised in Hindu, Jewish, or American families have identities as Hindus, Jews, or Americans, independently of their beliefs or actions. People who do not embrace their religious legacy retain it nonetheless, and are characterized by terms such as lapsed, not observant, or unpatriotic. People who actually separate themselves from their religious legacy are termed apostates or traitors and may be subject to punishment.

=== Religion and Gender ===
Research reports presented that women are universally more religious across all religions and cultures based largely on the fact that researchers are studying Western religions and cultures. In United States, Women are 60% likely to claim that &quot; religion is very important in their lives &quot;, while men are reported only 47%. Women attend religious services at least once a week are 12% higher than men in United States.

This phenomenon is explained by the Nature argument, Nurture argument and Role identity. According to the Nature arguments, rational choice theorists argue that higher level of religiosity among women derives from risk-aversion. Rational choice theory argues that people naturally minimise costs and maximise benefits for themselves. Women are &quot; typically risk-averse&quot;, therefore they will be more inclined towards practicing religion. According to the Nurture argument, Marta Trzebiatowska and Steve Bruce claimed that &quot; nothing in the biological make-up of men and women explains the gendered difference in religiosity&quot;, the difference are better explained by a range of socialisation process. Example used are women&#x27;s major role in family, childbirth, and death. These events keeps them &quot;closer to religion than man&quot;.

Marta Trzebiatowska and Steve Bruce argued there has been a time lag in how secularisation has affected men and women. As more and more women enter the work force, the religious gender gap is expected to disappear. Persuasive evidence across countries suggests that the gender gap can be explained in part by male and female identified role inside and outside of family and work. Women who work are more likely to feel they need to conform to the dominant secular ethos. Women who are at home focus on raising children and caring for sick and elderly family members which encourages stronger religious commitment.

Some religions are gendered social institution. Traditionalist evangelicals present that wifely submission- wives should defer their husbands in family decision-making. Evangelical women, rather, claimed the weakness in men proves that both wife and husband should hold mutual submission.Both spouses follow Christ&#x27;s model of self-sacrifice and an orientation to the other person in family decision-making.

<text>Samuel is a figure who, in the narratives of the Hebrew Bible, plays a key role in the transition from the biblical judges to the United Kingdom of Israel under Saul, and again in the monarchy&#x27;s transition from Saul to David. He is venerated as a prophet in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In addition to his role in the Bible, Samuel is mentioned in Jewish rabbinical literature, in the Christian New Testament, and in the second chapter of the Quran (although the text does not mention him by name). He is also treated in the fifth through seventh books of &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, written by the Jewish scholar Josephus in the first century. He is first called &quot;the Seer&quot; in 1 Samuel 9:9.

==Biblical account==
===Family===
Samuel&#x27;s mother was Hannah and his father was Elkanah. Elkanah lived at Ramathaim in the district of Zuph. His genealogy is also found in a pedigree of the Kohathites (1 Chronicles 6:3–15) and in that of Heman the Ezrahite, apparently his grandson (1 Chronicles 6:18–33).

According to the genealogical tables in Chronicles, Elkanah was a Levite—a fact not mentioned in the books of Samuel. The fact that Elkanah, a Levite, was denominated an Ephraimite is analogous to the designation of a Levite belonging to Judah (Judges 17:7, for example).

According to 1 Samuel 1:1–28, Elkanah had two wives, Peninnah and Hannah. Peninnah had children; Hannah did not. Nonetheless, Elkanah favored Hannah. Jealous, Peninnah reproached Hannah for her lack of children, causing Hannah much heartache. Elkanah was a devout man and would periodically take his family on pilgrimage to the holy site of Shiloh.

On one occasion, Hannah went to the sanctuary and prayed for a child. In tears, she vowed that if she were granted a child, she would dedicate him to God as a nazirite. Eli, who was sitting at the foot of the doorpost in the sanctuary at Shiloh, saw her apparently mumbling to herself and thought she was drunk, but was soon assured of both her motivation and sobriety. Eli was the priest of Shiloh, and one of the last Israelite Judges before the rule of kings in ancient Israel. He had assumed the leadership after Samson&#x27;s death. Eli blessed her and she returned home. Subsequently, Hannah became pregnant, later giving birth to Samuel, and praised God for his mercy and faithfulness.

After the child was weaned, she left him in Eli&#x27;s care, and from time to time she would come to visit her son.

===Name===
According to 1 Samuel 1:20, Hannah named Samuel to commemorate her prayer to God for a child. &quot;... [She] called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the Lord&quot; (KJV). From its appearance, the name Samuel (Hebrew: שְׁמוּאֵל &quot;Šəmūʾēl&quot;, Tiberian: &quot;Šămūʾēl&quot;) appears to be constructed from the Hebrew Śāmū (שָׂמוּ) + ʾĒl, meaning &quot;God has set&quot; or &quot;God has placed&quot;. This meaning relating to the idea of God setting/placing a child in the womb, alongside Hannah dedicating Samuel as a Nazirite to God. The Hebrew śāmū is also related to the Akkadian šâmū (𒊮𒈬), which shares the same meaning. From the explanation given in 1 Samuel 1:20, however, it would seem to come from a contraction of the Hebrew שְׁאִלְתִּיו מֵאֵל (Modern: &quot;Šəʾīltīv mēʾĒl,&quot; Tiberian: &quot;Šĭʾīltīw mēʾĒl&quot;), meaning &quot;I have asked/borrowed him from God&quot;. Further shortened to שָׁאוּל מֵאֵל (&quot;Šāʾūl mēʾĒl, &quot;asked/borrowed from God&quot;&quot;), then finally contracted to שְׁמוּאֵל (&quot;Šəmūʾēl/Šămūʾēl&quot;). This meaning also relating to Hannah dedicating Samuel as a Nazirite to God as well.

===Calling===
Samuel worked under Eli in the service of the shrine at Shiloh. One night, Samuel heard a voice calling his name. According to the first-century Jewish historian Josephus, Samuel was 12 years old. Samuel initially assumed it was coming from Eli and went to Eli to ask what he wanted. Eli, however, sent Samuel back to sleep. After this happened three times, Eli realised that the voice was the Lord&#x27;s, and instructed Samuel on how to answer:

If He calls you, then you must say, &quot;Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears&quot;.

Once Samuel responded, the Lord told him that the wickedness of the sons of Eli had resulted in their dynasty being condemned to destruction. In the morning, Samuel was hesitant about reporting the message to Eli, but Eli asked him to honestly recount to him what he had been told by the Lord. Upon receiving the communication, Eli merely said that the Lord should do what seems right unto him.

Samuel grew up and &quot;all Israel from Dan to Beersheba&quot; came to know that Samuel was a trustworthy prophet of the Lord. Anglican theologian Donald Spence Jones comments that &quot;the minds of all the people were thus gradually prepared when the right moment came to acknowledge Samuel as a God-sent chieftain&quot;.

===Leader===
During Samuel&#x27;s youth at Shiloh, the Philistines inflicted a decisive defeat against the Israelites at Eben-Ezer, placed the land under Philistine control, and took the sanctuary&#x27;s Ark for themselves. Upon hearing the news of the capture of the Ark of the Covenant, and the death of his sons, Eli collapsed and died. When the Philistines had been in possession of the Ark for seven months and had been visited with calamities and misfortunes, they decided to return the Ark to the Israelites.

According to Bruce C. Birch, Samuel was a key figure in keeping the Israelites&#x27; religious heritage and identity alive during Israel&#x27;s defeat and occupation by the Philistines. &quot;[I]t may have been possible and necessary for Samuel to exercise authority in roles that would normally not converge in a single individual (priest, prophet, judge).&quot;

After 20 years of oppression, Samuel, who had gained national prominence as a prophet (1 Samuel 3:20), summoned the people to the hill of Mizpah, and led them against the Philistines. The Philistines, having marched to Mizpah to attack the newly amassed Israelite army, were soundly defeated and fled in terror. The retreating Philistines were slaughtered by the Israelites. The text then states that Samuel erected a large stone at the battle site as a memorial, and there ensued a long period of peace thereafter.

===King-Maker===
Samuel initially appointed his two sons Joel and Abijah as his successors; however, just like Eli&#x27;s sons, Samuel&#x27;s proved unworthy for they accepted bribes and perverted judgement. The Israelites rejected them. Because of the external threat from other tribes, such as the Philistines, the tribal leaders decided that there was a need for a more unified, central government, and demanded Samuel appoint a king so that they could be like other nations. Samuel interpreted this as a personal rejection, and at first was reluctant to oblige, until reassured by a divine revelation. He warned the people of the potential negative consequences of such a decision. When Saul and his servant were searching for his father&#x27;s lost donkeys, the servant suggested consulting the nearby Samuel. Samuel recognized Saul as the future king.

Just before his retirement, Samuel gathered the people to an assembly at Gilgal, and delivered a farewell speech or coronation speech in which he emphasised how prophets and judges were more important than kings, that kings should be held to account, and that the people should not fall into idol worship, or worship of Asherah or of Baal. Samuel promised that God would subject the people to foreign invaders should they disobey. 1 Kings 11:5, 33, and 2 Kings 23:13 note that the Israelites fell into Asherah worship later on.

===Critic of Saul===

When Saul was preparing to fight the Philistines, Samuel denounced him for proceeding with the pre-battle sacrifice without waiting for the overdue Samuel to arrive. He prophesied that Saul&#x27;s rule would see no dynastic succession.

Samuel also directed Saul to &quot;utterly destroy&quot; the Amalekites in fulfilment of the commandment in Deuteronomy 25:17–19:
:&quot;When the Lord your God has given you rest from your enemies all around, in the land which the Lord your God is giving you to possess as an inheritance, ... you will blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven&quot;.

During the campaign against the Amalekites, King Saul spared Agag, the king of the Amalekites, and the best of their livestock. Saul told Samuel that he had spared the choicest of the Amalekites&#x27; sheep and oxen, intending to sacrifice the livestock to the Lord. This was in violation of the Lord&#x27;s command, as pronounced by Samuel, to &quot;... utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass&quot; (1 Samuel 15:3, KJV). Samuel confronted Saul for his disobedience and told him that God made him king, and God can unmake him king. Samuel then proceeded to execute Agag. Saul never saw Samuel alive again after this.

Samuel then proceeded to Bethlehem and secretly anointed David as king. He would later provide sanctuary for David, when the jealous Saul first tried to have him killed.

===Death===

Samuel is described in the biblical narrative as being buried in Ramah. According to tradition, this burial place has been identified with Samuel&#x27;s tomb in the West Bank village of Nabi Samwil.

Some time after his death, Saul had the Witch of Endor conjure Samuel&#x27;s spirit from Sheol in order to predict the result of an upcoming battle (1 Samuel 28:3–24). Samuel was angered by his recalling, and told Saul that the Lord had left him.

===Rabbinical literature===
While the Witch of Endor remains anonymous in the Biblical account, the rabbinical Midrash maintains that she was Zephaniah, the mother of Abner (Yalḳ, Sam. 140, from Pirḳe R. El.). That a supernatural appearance is here described is inferred from the repeated emphasis laid on the statement that Samuel had died and had been buried (I Sam. xxv. 1, xxviii. 3), by which the assumption that Samuel was still living when summoned, is discredited (Tosef., Soṭah, xi. 5). Still he was invoked during the first twelve months after his death, when, according to the Rabbis, the spirit still hovers near the body (Shab. 152b). In connection with the incidents of the story the Rabbis have developed the theory that the necromancer sees the spirit but is unable to hear his speech, while the person at whose instance the spirit is called hears the voice but fails to see; bystanders neither hear nor see (Yalḳ., l.c.; Redaḳ and RaLBaG&#x27;s commentaries). The outcry of the woman at the sight of Samuel was due to his rising in an unusual way—upright, not, as she expected, in a horizontal position (comp. LXX. ὄρθιον in verse 14).

==Documentary hypothesis==
===Birth narrative===
The birth-narrative of the prophet Samuel is found at 1 Samuel 1:1-28. It describes how Samuel&#x27;s mother Hannah requests a son from Yahweh, and dedicates the child to God at the shrine of Shiloh. The passage appears to make extensive play with the root-elements of Saul&#x27;s name, and ends with the phrase &quot;hu sa&#x27;ul le-Yahweh&quot;, &quot;he is dedicated to Yahweh.&quot; Hannah names the resulting son Samuel, giving as her explanation, &quot;because from God I requested him.&quot; Samuel&#x27;s name, however, can mean &quot;name of God,&quot; (or &quot;Heard of God&quot; or &quot;Told of God&quot;) and the etymology and multiple references to the root of the name would seem to fit Saul instead. Thus, several scholars argue that the narrative originally described the birth of Saul, and was given to Samuel to enhance the position of David and Samuel at the former king&#x27;s expense. Alternatively, Nadav Na&#x27;aman argues that the verbal root &quot;sh-&#x27;-l&quot; is actually related to the name &quot;Shiloh&quot;, the place where Samuel was born.

===National prophet, local seer===
Some authors see the biblical Samuel as combining descriptions of two distinct roles:
*A &quot;&quot;, based at Ramah, and seemingly known scarcely beyond the immediate neighbourhood of Ramah (Saul, for example, not having heard of him, with his servant informing him of his existence instead). In this role, Samuel is associated with the bands of musical ecstatic roaming prophets (&quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot;) at Gibeah, Bethel, and Gilgal, and some traditional scholars have argued that Samuel was the founder of these groups. At Ramah, Samuel secretly anointed Saul, after having met him for the first time, while Saul was looking for his father&#x27;s lost donkeys, and treated him to a meal.
*A &quot;prophet&quot;, based at Shiloh, who went throughout the land, from place to place, with unwearied zeal, reproving, rebuking, and exhorting the people to repentance. In this role, Samuel acted as a (biblical) judge, publicly advising the nation, and also giving private advice to individuals. Eventually Samuel delegated this role to his sons, based at Beersheba, but they behaved corruptly and so the people, facing invasion from the Ammonites, persuaded Samuel to appoint a king. Samuel reluctantly did so, and anointed Saul in front of the entire nation, who had gathered to see him.

Source-critical scholarship suggests that these two roles come from different sources, which later were spliced together to form the Book(s) of Samuel. The oldest is considered to be that marking Samuel as the local seer of Ramah, who willingly anointed Saul as king in secret, while the latter presents Samuel as a national figure, begrudgingly anointing Saul as king in front of a national assembly. This later source is generally known as the Republican source, since it denigrates the monarchy (particularly the actions of Saul) and favours religious figures, in contrast to the other main source—the Monarchial source—which treats it favourably. The Monarchial source would have Saul appointed king by public acclamation, due to his military victories, and not by Samuel&#x27;s cleromancy. Another difference between the sources is that the Republican source treats the ecstatic prophets as somewhat independent from Samuel (1 Samuel 9:1ff) rather than having been led by him.

The passage in which Samuel is described as having exercised the functions of a (biblical) judge, during an annual circuit from Ramah to Bethel to Gilgal (the &quot;Gilgal&quot; between Ebal and Gerizim) to Mizpah and back to Ramah (1 Samuel 7:15-17), is foreshadowed by Deborah, who used to render judgments from a place beneath a palm between Ramah and Bethel. Source-critical scholarship often considers it to be a redaction aimed at harmonizing the two portrayals of Samuel.

The Book(s) of Samuel variously describe Samuel as having carried out sacrifices at sanctuaries, and having constructed and sanctified altars. According to the Priestly Code/Deuteronomic Code only Aaronic priests/Levites (depending on the underlying tradition) were permitted to perform these actions, and simply being a nazarite or prophet was insufficient. The books of Samuel and Kings offer numerous examples where this rule is not followed by kings and prophets, but some critical scholars look elsewhere seeking a harmonization of the issues. In the Book of Chronicles, Samuel is described as a Levite, rectifying this situation; however critical scholarship widely sees the Book of Chronicles as an attempt to redact the Book(s) of Samuel and of Kings to conform to later religious sensibilities. Since many of the Biblical law codes themselves are thought to postdate the Book(s) of Samuel (according to the Documentary Hypothesis), this would suggest Chronicles is making its claim based on religious motivations. According to most modern scholarship, the Levitical genealogy of 1 Chronicles 4 is not historical.

===Deuteronomistic Samuel===
According to the documentary hypothesis of Biblical source criticism, which postulates that &quot;Deuteronomistic historians&quot; redacted the Former Prophets (Joshua, Judges, 1 and 2 Samuel, and 1 and 2 Kings), the Deuteronomists idealized Samuel as a figure larger than life, like Joshua. For example, Samuel&#x27;s father Elkanah is described as having originated from Zuph, specifically Ramathaim-Zophim, which was part of the tribal lands of Ephraim, while 1 Chronicles states that he was a Levite. Samuel is portrayed as a judge who leads the military, as the judges in the Book of Judges, and also who exercises judicial functions. In 1 Sam 12:6–17, a speech of Samuel that portrays him as the judge sent by God to save Israel may have been composed by the Deuteronomists. In 1 Samuel 9:6–20, Samuel is seen as a local &quot;seer&quot;. According to documentary scholarship, the Deuteronomistic historians preserved this view of Samuel while contributing him as &quot;the first of prophets to articulate the failure of Israel to live up to its covenant with God.&quot; For the Deuteronomistic historians, Samuel would have been an extension of Moses and continuing Moses&#x27; function as a prophet, judge, and priest, which makes the nature of the historical Samuel uncertain.

==Perspectives on Samuel==
=== Judaism ===

According to the Book of Jeremiah and one of the Psalms, Samuel had a high devotion to God. Classical Rabbinical literature adds that he was more than an equal to Moses, God speaking directly to Samuel, rather than Samuel having to attend the tabernacle to hear God. Samuel is also described by the Rabbis as having been extremely intelligent; he argued that it was legitimate for laymen to slaughter sacrifices, since the Halakha only insisted that the priests &quot;bring the blood&quot;, Eli, who was viewed negatively by many Classical Rabbis, is said to have reacted to this logic of Samuel by arguing that it was technically true, but Samuel should be put to death for making legal statements while Eli (his mentor) was present.

Samuel is also treated by the Classical Rabbis as a much more sympathetic character than he appears at face value in the Bible; his annual circuit is explained as being due to his wish to spare people the task of having to journey to him; Samuel is said to have been very rich, taking his entire household with him on the circuit so that he didn&#x27;t need to impose himself on anyone&#x27;s hospitality; when Saul fell out of God&#x27;s favour, Samuel is described as having grieved copiously and having prematurely aged.

His yahrzeit is observed on the 28th day of Iyar.

=== Christianity ===
For Christians, Samuel is considered to be a prophet, judge, and wise leader of Israel, and treated as an example of fulfilled commitments to God. On the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Lutheran calendars, his feast day is August 20. He is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 30. In the Coptic Orthodox Church, the commemoration of the departure of Samuel the Prophet is celebrated on 9 Paoni.

Herbert Lockyer, minister and author, and others have seen in Samuel&#x27;s combined offices of prophet, priest, and ruler a foreshadowing of Christ.

===Islam===
Samuel () is seen as a prophet and seer in the Islamic faith. The narrative of Samuel in Islam focuses specifically on his birth and the anointing of Talut. Other elements from his narrative are in accordance with the narratives of other Prophets of Israel, as exegesis recounts Samuel&#x27;s preaching against idolatry. He is not mentioned by name in the Qur&#x27;an, but may be alluded to in .

In the Islamic narrative, the Israelites after Moses wanted a king to rule over their country. Thus, God sent a prophet, Samuel, to anoint Talut as the first king for the Israelites. However, the Israelites mocked and reviled the newly appointed king, as he was not wealthy from birth (Q). But, assuming Talut to be Saul, in sharp contrast to the Hebrew Bible, the Qur&#x27;an praises Saul greatly, and mentions that he was gifted with great spiritual and physical strength. In the Qur&#x27;anic account, Samuel prophesies that the sign of Talut&#x27;s kingship will be that the Ark of the Covenant will come back to the Israelites.

=== Bahá&#x27;í ===
`Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, a central figure in the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, mentions Samuel as an example of a genuine Prophet of the House of Israel, alongside Ezekiel.

==Portrayals==
Actors who have portrayed Samuel include Leonard Nimoy in the 1997 television film &quot;David&quot;, Eamonn Walker in the 2009 television series &quot;Kings&quot;, and Mohammad Bakri in the 2016 television series &quot;Of Kings and Prophets&quot;.

<doc id="28355" wikidata="Q739552" url="?curid=28355" title="Square (video game company)">
<text>also known under its international brand name SquareSoft, was a Japanese video game developer and publisher. It was founded in 1986 by Masafumi Miyamoto, who spun off part of his father&#x27;s electronics company Den-Yu-Sha. Among its early employees were designers Hironobu Sakaguchi, Hiromichi Tanaka, Akitoshi Kawazu, Koichi Ishii, artist Kazuko Shibuya, programmer Nasir Gebelli, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. Initially focusing on action games, the team saw popular success with the role-playing video game &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; in 1987, which would lead to the franchise of the same name being one of its flagship franchises. Later notable staff included directors Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita, designer and writer Yasumi Matsuno, artists Tetsuya Nomura and Yusuke Naora, and composers Yoko Shimomura and Masashi Hamauzu.

Initially developing for PCs, then exclusively for Nintendo systems, Square cut ties with Nintendo in the 1990s to develop for Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s upcoming console PlayStation. Their first major project for the console, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, was a worldwide critical and commercial success and was credited with boosting the popularity of role-playing video games and the PlayStation outside Japan. Alongside the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, the company developed and published several other notable series, including &quot;SaGa&quot;, &quot;Mana&quot;, &quot;Front Mission&quot;, &quot;Chrono&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Over the years, many staff left to found studios such as Monolith Soft, Sacnoth, Mistwalker, and AlphaDream.

In 2001, the company saw financial troubles due to the commercial failure of the feature film &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, which ultimately led Sakaguchi to leave the company in 2003. The film&#x27;s failure disrupted merger discussions with Enix, publisher of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series. Following the success of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, negotiations resumed and the merger went ahead on April 1, 2003, forming Square Enix.

==History==
===Origins===
Square was initially established in September 1983 as a software subsidiary of Den-Yu-Sha, an electric power conglomerate led by Kuniichi Miyamoto. His son Masafumi Miyamoto, then a part-time employee of the Science and Technology Department at Keio University, had little interest in following his father into the electricity business. Miyamoto instead became a software developer at the Yokohama branch of Den-Yu-Sha in Hiyoshi, with a focus on the emerging video game market. Their original offices were based in a former hairdresser&#x27;s salon. The company&#x27;s name referred to a golfing term, and represented its aim to face challenges head-on. It also referenced a town square, emphasizing a production environment based on cooperation.

At the time, video games in Japan were usually created by a single programmer. Miyamoto, on the other hand, believed that graphic designers, programmers, and professional story writers would be needed to keep up with advances in computing and video game development. During these early years, the group was compared to a family business; one of the early hires, Shinichiro Kajitani, joined because he was a friend of Miyamoto, and later compared the company at that time to a &quot;college club&quot;. To recruit for this new organizational structure, Miyamoto organized a salon in Yokohama and offered jobs to those who demonstrated exceptional programming skills. This led to the part-time hiring of university students Hironobu Sakaguchi and Hiromichi Tanaka, as well as Hisashi Suzuki, who would go on to become Square&#x27;s CEO. Miyamoto&#x27;s initial plan was to recruit from Keio University, but this never materialized.

===1985–1987: First games, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;===

Square&#x27;s first attempt at a game was an adaptation of the television game show &quot;Torin-ingen&quot;. As Miyamoto had not secured the license to adapt it, the show&#x27;s producers forced Square to cancel the game, prompting its team to be reshuffled. Square&#x27;s first completed game was &quot;The Death Trap&quot; (1984) for NEC PC-8801, a text adventure set in a war-torn African nation. &quot;The Death Trap&quot; was the first game published under the Square brand. Its sequel, &quot;Will: The Death Trap II&quot;, was released the following year to commercial success. Many of Square&#x27;s early titles were produced for PC devices, and focused on the action genre.

In 1985, the company negotiated a licensing agreement with Nintendo to develop titles for the Famicom (Nintendo Entertainment System). The company shifted to developing for the Famicom to benefit from its stable hardware, compared to the constantly changing components of PCs. Square&#x27;s first Famicom release was a port of the run and gun game &quot;Thexder&quot; (1985), and its first original game was the scrolling shooter &quot;King&#x27;s Knight&quot; (1986). During this period, the team also hired new developers Akitoshi Kawazu and Koichi Ishii, artist Kazuko Shibuya, Iranian-American programmer Nasir Gebelli, and composer Nobuo Uematsu. Yusuke Hirata joined that year as sales manager, and later became the company&#x27;s publicity manager.

In April 1986, Square moved into new offices based in Ginza, noted as one of the most expensive areas for companies to operate; Sakaguchi later speculated Miyamoto was hoping to attract business by appearing affluent. Square was re-established as an independent developer in September of that year with capital of ¥10 million, buying the original Square gaming division from Den-Yu-Sha in December. Sakaguchi was appointed as a Director of Planning and Development, and Hisashi Suzuki became one of the company&#x27;s directors. Due to the high cost of Ginza rents, the company was forced to move into smaller offices in Okachimachi, Taitō. Square began struggling financially following multiple commercial failures for Nintendo&#x27;s Famicom Disk System peripheral. Miyamoto asked the company&#x27;s four directors for game proposals, with plans to have their staff vote on the best idea. Sakaguchi proposed making a role-playing video game (RPG), believing it to be a viable project after the success of Enix&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; (1986).

While skeptical, Miyamoto allowed production of the RPG on the condition it only had a five-person team. Sakaguchi led development, bringing in Gebelli, Kawazu, Ishii, and Uematsu. Production of the game, eventually called &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, proceeded in &quot;fits and starts&quot;. Sakaguchi eventually received help from the other team at Square led by Tanaka, which included Shibuya and newcomer debugger Hiroyuki Ito. Production on the game lasted roughly ten months. While shipments of 200,000 units were planned, Sakaguchi persuaded Square to double that number. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was released in 1987 to commercial success, selling over 400,000 copies in Japan. It saw greater sales success in North American when it was released in 1989, selling 700,000 copies. Two other Japanese successes from 1987 were &quot;Rad Racer&quot; and &quot;The 3-D Battles of WorldRunner&quot;.

===1987–1995: Expansion and notable staff===
The success of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; prompted development of &quot;Final Fantasy II&quot; (1988), which established many of the series recurring elements. This and four more &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles would appear on the Famicom and Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Famicom), culminating in &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; (1994). These were among a string of projects that Square produced exclusively for Nintendo consoles, including the portable Game Boy. In 1990, Square moved its offices to the Akasaka district, and then to Ebisu, Shibuya in 1992. In April 1991, Square merged with an identically-named dormant company in order to change its share prices. As a result of the merger, Square&#x27;s foundation was backdated to the other company&#x27;s July 1966 founding date.

At that time, Square drew some of its development funding from loans from Shikoku Bank. Due to increasing development costs, the bank sent Tomoyuki Takechi on secondment to be their office manager in 1990. Takechi&#x27;s secondment lasted until 1994, by which time Square had annual sales worth ¥16 million per year. In August of that year, Square registered with the Japan Securities Dealers Association to offer shares for public purchase. Sakaguchi was by now a prominent figure within the company, and was promoted to Executive President in 1991. His increasing corporate involvement lessened his creative input, prompting him to give greater influence to other staff. Gebelli left Square in 1993, retiring on royalties from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series. Miyamoto stepped down as Square&#x27;s President in 1991 while remaining a major shareholder, and was replaced by Tetsuo Mizuno. In 1991, Suzuki became Vice President.

As &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; became a featured property for the company, Square produced additional projects that became successful series of their own. The Japan-exclusive real-time strategy series &quot;Hanjuku Hero&quot;, which began in 1988, parodied conventions of the RPG genre. Kawazu helmed an RPG project for the Game Boy. Released in 1989, &quot;Makai Toushi SaGa&quot; (&quot;The Final Fantasy Legend&quot;) spawned the &quot;SaGa&quot; series, which Kawazu would continue to be involved over the years. After the release of &quot;Final Fantasy III&quot; (1990), Ishii was offered the chance to create his own game, leading to the production of &quot;Seiken Densetsu: Final Fantasy Gaiden&quot; (&quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;) for the Game Boy in 1991. Ishii went on to develop additional &quot;Seiken Densetsu&quot; titles, released outside of Japan as the &quot;Mana&quot; series. A famous game from the period was &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, born from a collaboration between Sakaguchi, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; creator Yuji Horii, and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; artist Akira Toriyama. Among other standalone titles were the Western-exclusive &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;, and the &quot;Mario&quot;-themed &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; co-produced with Nintendo. Reflecting on this period, Sakaguchi noted that &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was the company&#x27;s most recognized property, while celebrating the fact that the company would still be profitable on the merits of their other successful game series.

Additional staff joined Square by the early 1990s, inspired by the successful &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, with several first working on &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot; (1991), Yoshinori Kitase acted as a writer and later director, artist Tetsuya Nomura began as a graphic designer, and Tetsuya Takahashi and Kaori Tanaka were both artists and writers. Takashi Tokita became a full-time employee at the company, and Hiroyuki Ito began his work as a game designer. Chihiro Fujioka worked on several projects including co-directing &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;. Kenichi Nishi worked in minor roles on &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; and &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot;. Masato Kato, who joined in 1993, became scenario writer for &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;. Artist Yusuke Naora first worked on &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;. Kazushige Nojima, known for his work on the &quot;Glory of Heracles&quot; series, joined as a scenario writer. Future director Motomu Toriyama, who had no experience with game development, began as a scenario writer.

Square also hired additional music staff. Kenji Ito contributed to both the &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Mana&quot; series. Hiroki Kikuta worked on the &quot;Mana&quot; series and standalone projects. Yasunori Mitsuda started as a sound designer and was lauded for his work on the &quot;Chrono&quot; series. Yoko Shimomura, formerly a Capcom composer, did her first work on &quot;Live A Live&quot; (1994). In 1995, Square moved its headquarters to the Shimomeguro district in Meguro. 

===1995–1999: Move to PlayStation===

Following the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; and &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, Square staff began planning the next entry in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, and entered the emerging 3D gaming market. With the production of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, Square decided to shift their projects to Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s new PlayStation console, prompted by the affordability of CD-ROM distribution, compared to Nintendo&#x27;s continued use of expensive cartridges. This shift caused a long-standing rift between Square and Nintendo; one Square employee recalled Nintendo telling the company to &quot;never come back&quot;. In 1996, Square&#x27;s final project with Nintendo was Sting Entertainment″s &quot;Treasure Hunter G&quot; for the Super Famicom, while the company debuted DreamFactory&#x27;s &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot; for the PlayStation that same year. Soon after, the company signed a licensing agreement with Sony, who gained the exclusive right to publish Square&#x27;s next six games in the West.

Square continued work on &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, with Kitase as director, Naora as art director, Nomura as lead artist, and Nojima as scenario writer. Released worldwide in 1997, &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was a worldwide commercial and critical success, bringing Square international fame. Also in 1997, at Square&#x27;s invitation, Takechi returned and took Mizuno&#x27;s place as President. Three new hires during the period were Shinji Hashimoto, Yasumi Matsuno, and Masashi Hamauzu. Hashimoto joined in 1995 as promotions producer for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. Matsuno, along with a number of other developers, had left Quest Corporation following the release of &quot;Tactics Ogre&quot; (1995), and worked with Sakaguchi on &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; (1997). Hamauzu joined in 1996, and worked on &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-off titles and the &quot;SaGa&quot; series. Sakaguchi, working on other projects, took on the role of executive producer for the series beginning with &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, and Hashimoto stepped in as producer. Hirata went from an administrative position to lead producer, focusing on diversifying Square&#x27;s library into new game genres.

Several properties were introduced during this period. These included &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, based on a novel of the same name by Hideaki Sena; &quot;Front Mission&quot;, which began on the Super Famicom but was transferred to the PlayStation beginning with its second entry; and the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-off series &quot;Chocobo&quot;, starring an incarnation of the titular mascot character. As Square was estranged from Nintendo at the time, the company supported other platforms including the WonderSwan and Windows. Late in the PlayStation&#x27;s lifecycle, Square continued to support the console with multiple releases, such as &quot;Threads of Fate&quot; (1999) and &quot;Vagrant Story&quot; (2000). The company also began work on PlayOnline, a digital storefront and a platform for online game services and web content.

During the late 1990s, Square launched an initiative to give teams of younger staff members a chance to create experimental titles on smaller budgets. Among such titles were &quot;Xenogears&quot;, &quot;Soukaigi&quot;, and &quot;Another Mind&quot;. Around this time, several staff members departed Square due to creative differences or a desire to work on their own projects. These included Takahashi and Tanaka, Fujioka, Nishi, Kikuta, Mitsuda, and &quot;Mana&quot; artist Shinichi Kameoka. In April 2000, Suzuki was appointed Square&#x27;s new President, while Takechi became a company chairman. Also at this time, two outside directors were appointed, Kenichi Ohmae of Ohmae &amp; Associates and Makoto Naruke of Microsoft. The corporate reshuffle was intended to strengthen Square&#x27;s overseas connections and bring in technical and administrative support for future digital and online content. Alongside this, Yoichi Wada joined the company as a company director and eventually COO. In August 2000, Square was listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange&#x27;s first section, which includes the largest companies on the exchange.

===2000–2003: &quot;The Spirits Within&quot;, final years===
In addition to leading production on &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; (2000), Sakaguchi also worked at the 1997-established Square Pictures studio on a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; feature film. Titled &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, it was planned as Sakaguchi&#x27;s first push towards cross-media storytelling; however, the project ran over budget and ended up costing Square and co-producer Columbia Pictures US$137 million. Upon its release in 2001, &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; was met with mixed critical reception, and grossed only $85 million. Labeled as a box-office bomb, the film damaged Square&#x27;s finances, and led to the closure of Square Pictures.

Following both the failure of &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; and a delay of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; (2001) for the PlayStation 2, Square suffered a financial loss for the first time, prompting Sakaguchi, Takechi, and director Masatsugu Hiramatsu to resign from their positions. Sakaguchi was kept on as executive producer for &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, while Takechi and Hiramatsu were retained as external consultants. This period left Sakaguchi in a state of low morale. In late 2001, Suzuki stepped down as President, and was replaced by Wada. Yosuke Matsuda became Senior Vice President. Kenji Ito also left during this period to work as a freelance composer. Prior to the film&#x27;s release, rival company Enix was proposing merging with another game company to alleviate development costs, opening serious discussions with Square in 2000. Square&#x27;s financial losses with &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; prompted Enix to halt discussions.

Under Wada, the company underwent restructuring with the intent of streamlining production and resources, and cutting development costs to increase profits. After evaluation of its financial position, and with changes to the console war due to Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox, Square opened talks with Nintendo for the first time since their breakup in the 1990s. The talks were successful, with &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles&quot; beginning development for the GameCube in late 2001. Square also began production on &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;, the first direct sequel to a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game. &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; was Sakaguchi&#x27;s last credited project at Square, and he left the company in 2003. Around this time, Square also began development on &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (2002), with Nomura making his directorial debut. The game was a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company, blending Disney characters with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; elements in an original story. &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was Shimomura&#x27;s last project as an in-house composer before going freelance in 2002. Also released in 2002 was the Japanese version of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, the company&#x27;s first MMORPG. Conceived by Sakaguchi, it was developed by the &quot;Chrono&quot; team and led by Ishii. &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and its first expansion was Kato&#x27;s last work for Square before leaving in 2002 to go freelance.

Following the commercial success of &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Square and Enix resumed talks and agreed to merge their two companies. Wada described it as a merger of two companies &quot;at their height&quot;. Despite this, the merger had its skeptics, particularly Miyamoto who did not want to see his controlling stake diluted in a merged company. Miyamoto&#x27;s issue was resolved by altering the exchange ratio to one Square share for 0.81 Enix shares, and the merger was greenlit. Square Enix was formed on April 1, 2003, with Enix as the surviving corporate entity and Square dissolving its departments and subsidiaries into the new company. Around 80% of Square&#x27;s staff transitioned into Square Enix. Square&#x27;s final release was the Japanese version of &quot;X-2&quot;.

==Structure==
===Development structure===
During reports on the merger with Enix, Takashi Oya of Deutsche Securities contrasted Enix&#x27;s tradition of outsourcing development versus Square&#x27;s approach to developing &quot;everything by itself&quot;. When Square was founded in the early 1980s, there was no set development structure, with the ten-person staff freely shifting between roles and projects. This eventually evolved into two loosely-defined production groups, led by Sakaguchi and Tanaka, respectively. Following the release of &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, Sakaguchi divided the production team, assigning different staff members to the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Mana&quot; series. A secondary studio was founded in Osaka in 1990, with &quot;Final Fantasy Legend III&quot; (1991) as their first project.

By 1997, the company was divided into eight development divisions, with two based in Osaka. In 1998, the old development divisions were restructured into Production Departments, and the Osaka branch was closed down. The system was reshuffled again in 2002 to promote &quot;greater understanding&quot;, and allow for reassignment between divisions. Among the heads of divisions at this time were Kitase, Kawazu, Tanaka, Matsuno and Hirata. Following the merger with Enix, the eight divisions were incorporated into the new company, with two additional divisions brought in from Enix.

===Publishing and localization===

Square self-published the majority of its games in Japan, and sporadically acted as a publisher for third-party developers. By contrast, their Western presence during the 80s and early 90s was small. RPGs were not popular in the North American market at that time, and Square&#x27;s presence in Europe was limited. The original &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was published in North America in 1990 by Nintendo of America close to the launch of the Super Nintendo, resulting in its two sequels being passed over for localization at that time. After opening their North American offices, Square began publishing selected titles under the &quot;SquareSoft&quot; brand. One of their third-party North American releases was the original &quot;Breath of Fire&quot; by Capcom, who were busy enough to outsource publishing and localization to Square. The Redmond office later closed, with some localization staff choosing not to relocate to California.

Square initially did not have an internal localization department, instead outsourcing to a number of translators. Following the release of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which saw criticism for its localization, Square created a new internal department to encourage higher quality. Initially having only two employees, it grew steadily over the years. Individual games still ran into difficulties due to their large text sizes, difficulties translating some culture-specific elements, potential censorship, and the introduction of voice acting with games including &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;. Notable localization staff included Kaoru Moriyama, Ted Woolsey, Michael Basket, Richard Honeywood, and Alexander O. Smith.

Many Square titles remained exclusive to Japan, for reasons including design complexities, low graphical quality, and technical difficulties. In the 1990s, Square&#x27;s first six PlayStation releases were published by Sony as part of a contract between the two companies. Eidos Interactive notably handled the Windows ports of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. In Europe, Square&#x27;s local branch self-published a number of games including mainline &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; titles. It also partnered with third-party companies including Eidos, Crave Entertainment, and Infogrames for either publishing or distribution of different titles.

===Subsidiaries===

In 1989, Square established SquareSoft in Redmond, Washington, to provide development and publishing support in the West. As Square moved its projects to PlayStation in 1994, SquareSoft moved to Marina del Rey, California, while changing its name twice in one year, to Square LA followed by Square USA. Square USA would notably develop &quot;Secret of Evermore&quot;. In 1997, a second Square USA branch was opened in Honolulu, Hawaii to focus on new interactive entertainment research, going on to help with CGI development on &quot;Parasite Eve&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot;. Square Europe was founded in 1998 in London, England, focusing on publishing in Europe.

A publishing brand called Aques was established by Square in 1996. The name was an anagram of Square&#x27;s name, as well as an acronym for &quot;Advanced QUality Entertainment and Sports&quot;, representing the company&#x27;s diversification outside of role-playing games. That same year, Square established a distribution company called DigiCube, with convenience stores as their main strategy. The subdidiary expanded into book publishing, stocked games from other companies, and at one point published games under its own brand. DigiCube survived the Square Enix merger, though it declared bankruptcy in 2004 after years of declining sales.

In 1999, Square created a number of subsidiaries with dedicated roles: Square Visual Works to focus on producing CGI animation, Square Sounds for music and sound effects, Squartz for quality control and user support, and Square Next to support smaller game projects. Following the success of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in 1997, Sakaguchi founded a dedicated CGI film studio called Square Pictures in Hawaii; his aim was to both develop &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; and help with further development of Square&#x27;s CGI technology. By the end of 2001, Square Pictures was dissolved and merged into Visual Works. Square USA&#x27;s Hawaiian branch developed the CGI short &quot;Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; that later formed part of the 2003 anthology film &quot;The Animatrix&quot;. The branch was shut down in 2002 following a failed attempt to find a film studio partner.

In 2002, Square Next was rebranded as The Game Designer Studio, with ownership between Square&#x27;s Product Development Division 2 and Kawazu. The aim was to allow for development of games for Nintendo consoles without impacting production on Sony platform games. The Game Designers Studio was absorbed back into Square Enix after the completion of &quot;Crystal Chronicles&quot;, first renamed to SQEX Corporation and eventually dissolved entirely in 2010. Square Sounds was dissolved into the main company in March 2002 as an internal division, a move attributed to cost cutting. All the other subsidiaries were folded into Square Enix during the merger, with Visual Works becoming its own dedicated department.

On May 1, 1998, Square formed a joint-venture partnership with Electronic Arts; Square Electronic Arts published Square titles in North America, while Electronic Arts Square published Electronic Arts titles in Japan. The partnership emerged the year following Electronic Arts winding down a similar partnership with Victor in December 1997. Shares were distributed between the two on a 70/30 basis relating to their role; Square Electronic Arts had Square owning 70%, while Electronic Arts owned 30%. Electronic Arts Square would also develop the PlayStation 2 launch title &quot;X-Squad&quot;. In March 31, 2003, coinciding with the Square Enix merger, both ventures were dissolved, with each partner buying the other&#x27;s shares. In its February press release, Square described the joint-venture as a success. The Square side of the venture was rebranded under the Square Enix name.

===Affiliates and acquisitions===
Between 1986 and 1988, Square led a collective of game developers dedicated to the production of games for the Famicom Disk System. The Square-owned label, called Disk Original Group (DOG), included Square, HummingBirdSoft, System Sacom, Microcabin, Carry Lab, Thinking Rabbit, and Xtalsoft. This coalition was able to pool financial resources, allowing them to overcome the prohibitive costs of acting individually. The Famicom Disk System was rendered defunct by 1988 due to increased storage capacity in standard Famicom ROM cartridges. In January 1994, Square acquired developer Cobra Team, turning it into a subsidiary called Solid and focusing their work on cooperating with external developers. In 1995, Square established DreamFactory as an affiliate studio, which developed fighting-based titles for the PlayStation and PS2. DreamFactory became an independent company in 2001 after Square transferred their shares. Square later founded subsidiary Escape in March 1998 with DreamFactory staff. It only produced &quot;Driving Emotion Type-S&quot; (2000) before being liquidated in 2003.

The company held a stake in &quot;Bushido Blade&quot; developer Lightweight, founded in 1995. It sold that stake to software company Forside in 1999. &quot;Front Mission&quot; developers G-Craft were initially independent, developing the original &quot;Front Mission&quot; with Square collaborating through their Solid subsidiary and acting as publisher. Square bought out G-Craft and incorporated it in 1997 during production of &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;. Other affiliates associated with Square between the early 1990s to 2000 were font company Kusanagi, and developers Positron and Luciola. In 2002, &quot;Ogre Battle&quot; developer Quest Corporation withdrew from game development and was bought by Square. Absorbed and repurposed into a production division, their first project was &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics Advance&quot; (2003).

==Related studios==
Many Square employees went on to found notable development studios and other ventures. Nishi founded Love-de-Lic in 1995, producing three games including &quot;&quot;. Love-de-Lic staff went on to found other small studios including Skip Ltd. (&quot;Chibi-Robo!&quot;), and Punchline (&quot;Rule of Rose&quot;). Frustrated with Square&#x27;s rigid hierarchy, Kikuta founded Sacnoth in 1997, which would become known for the &quot;Shadow Hearts&quot; series; he left Sacnoth in 1999 following the release of his project &quot;Koudelka&quot; and founded the music label Nostrilia. Several &quot;Xenogears&quot; developers, including Takahashi and Tanaka, founded Monolith Soft in 1999 in order to pursue projects outside the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, developing more games using the &quot;Xeno&quot; prefix.

Kameoka and other developers who worked on &quot;Legend of Mana&quot; (1999) founded Brownie Brown in 2000. Brownie Brown later worked with Square Enix on &quot;Sword of Mana&quot; (2003), a remake of &quot;Final Fantasy Adventure&quot;. Also in 2000, Mizuno founded AlphaDream, engaging Fujioka and going on to develop the &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi&quot; series. Staff members from Square Pictures, including &quot;The Spirits Within&quot; co-director Motonori Sakakibara, established Sprite Animation Studios in 2002. After his resignation from Square, Takechi founded music label Dreamusic in 2001 with Kazunaga Nitta. Mitsuda founded the music studio Procyon in 2001 so he could work while maintaining his health. After stepping down as president in 2001, Sakaguchi experienced a period of low morale before returning to game development, founding Mistwalker in 2004. The studio became known for the &quot;Blue Dragon&quot; and &quot;Terra Wars&quot; series, as well as multiple stand-alone projects.

<doc id="28356" wikidata="Q1064500" url="?curid=28356" title="Symplectic manifold">
<text>In differential geometry, a subject of mathematics, a symplectic manifold is a smooth manifold, formula_1, equipped with a closed nondegenerate differential 2-form formula_2, called the symplectic form. The study of symplectic manifolds is called symplectic geometry or symplectic topology. Symplectic manifolds arise naturally in abstract formulations of classical mechanics and analytical mechanics as the cotangent bundles of manifolds. For example, in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics, which provides one of the major motivations for the field, the set of all possible configurations of a system is modeled as a manifold, and this manifold&#x27;s cotangent bundle describes the phase space of the system.

== Motivation ==
Symplectic manifolds arise from classical mechanics; in particular, they are a generalization of the phase space of a closed system. In the same way the Hamilton equations allow one to derive the time evolution of a system from a set of differential equations, the symplectic form should allow one to obtain a vector field describing the flow of the system from the differential formula_3 of a Hamiltonian function formula_4. So we require a linear map formula_5 from the tangent manifold formula_6 to the cotangent manifold formula_7, or equivalently, an element of formula_8. Letting formula_9 denote a section of formula_10, the requirement that formula_9 be non-degenerate ensures that for every differential formula_3 there is a unique corresponding vector field formula_13 such that formula_14. Since one desires the Hamiltonian to be constant along flow lines, one should have formula_15, which implies that formula_9 is alternating and hence a 2-form. Finally, one makes the requirement that formula_9 should not change under flow lines, i.e. that the Lie derivative of formula_9 along formula_13 vanishes. Applying Cartan&#x27;s formula, this amounts to (here formula_20 is the interior product): 

:formula_21

so that, on repeating this argument for different smooth functions formula_4 such that the corresponding formula_13 span the tangent space at each point the argument is applied at, we see that the requirement for the vanishing Lie derivative along flows of formula_13 corresponding to arbitrary smooth formula_4 is equivalent to the requirement that &quot;ω&quot; should be closed.

== Definition ==
A symplectic form on a smooth manifold formula_1 is a closed non-degenerate differential 2-form formula_2. Here, non-degenerate means that for every point formula_28, the skew-symmetric pairing on the tangent space formula_29 defined by formula_2 is non-degenerate. That is to say, if there exists an formula_31 such that formula_32 for all formula_33, then formula_34. Since in odd dimensions, skew-symmetric matrices are always singular, the requirement that formula_2 be nondegenerate implies that formula_1 has an even dimension. The closed condition means that the exterior derivative of formula_2 vanishes. A symplectic manifold is a pair formula_38 where formula_1 is a smooth manifold and formula_2 is a symplectic form. Assigning a symplectic form to formula_1 is referred to as giving formula_1 a symplectic structure.

== Examples ==
=== Symplectic vector spaces ===
Let formula_43 be a basis for formula_44 We define our symplectic form formula_9 on this basis as follows:

:formula_46

In this case the symplectic form reduces to a simple quadratic form. If formula_47 denotes the formula_48 identity matrix then the matrix, formula_49, of this quadratic form is given by the formula_50 block matrix:

:formula_51

=== Cotangent bundles ===
Let formula_52 be a smooth manifold of dimension formula_53. Then the total space of the cotangent bundle formula_54 has a natural symplectic form, called the Poincaré two-form or the canonical symplectic form

:formula_55

Here formula_56 are any local coordinates on formula_52 and formula_58 are fibrewise coordinates with respect to the cotangent vectors formula_59. Cotangent bundles are the natural phase spaces of classical mechanics. The point of distinguishing upper and lower indexes is driven by the case of the manifold having a metric tensor, as is the case for Riemannian manifolds. Upper and lower indexes transform contra and covariantly under a change of coordinate frames. The phrase &quot;fibrewise coordinates with respect to the cotangent vectors&quot; is meant to convey that the momenta formula_60 are &quot;soldered&quot; to the velocities formula_61. The soldering is an expression of the idea that velocity and momentum are colinear, in that both move in the same direction, and differ by a scale factor.

=== Kähler manifolds ===
A Kähler manifold is a symplectic manifold equipped with a compatible integrable complex structure. They form a particular class of complex manifolds. A large class of examples come from complex algebraic geometry. Any smooth complex projective variety formula_62 has a symplectic form which is the restriction of the Fubini—Study form on the projective space formula_63.

=== Almost-complex manifolds ===
Riemannian manifolds with an formula_9-compatible almost complex structure are termed almost-complex manifolds. They generalize Kähler manifolds, in that they need not be integrable. That is, they do not necessarily arise from a complex structure on the manifold.

== Lagrangian and other submanifolds ==
There are several natural geometric notions of submanifold of a symplectic manifold formula_38:

* Symplectic submanifolds of formula_1 (potentially of any even dimension) are submanifolds formula_67 such that formula_68 is a symplectic form on formula_69.
* Isotropic submanifolds are submanifolds where the symplectic form restricts to zero, i.e. each tangent space is an isotropic subspace of the ambient manifold&#x27;s tangent space. Similarly, if each tangent subspace to a submanifold is co-isotropic (the dual of an isotropic subspace), the submanifold is called co-isotropic.
* Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold formula_70 are submanifolds where the restriction of the symplectic form formula_9 to formula_72 is vanishing, i.e. formula_73 and formula_74. Lagrangian submanifolds are the maximal isotropic submanifolds. 

One major example is that the graph of a symplectomorphism in the product symplectic manifold is Lagrangian. Their intersections display rigidity properties not possessed by smooth manifolds; the Arnold conjecture gives the sum of the submanifold&#x27;s Betti numbers as a lower bound for the number of self intersections of a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, rather than the Euler characteristic in the smooth case.

=== Examples ===
Let formula_75 have global coordinates labelled formula_76. Then, we can equip formula_77 with the canonical symplectic form 

:formula_78 

There is a standard Lagrangian submanifold given by formula_79. The form formula_9 vanishes on formula_81 because given any pair of tangent vectors formula_82 we have that formula_83 To elucidate, consider the case formula_84. Then, formula_85 and formula_86. Notice that when we expand this out

:formula_87

both terms we have a formula_88 factor, which is 0, by definition.

====Example: Cotangent bundle====
The cotangent bundle of a manifold is locally modeled on a space similar to the first example. It can be shown that we can glue these affine symplectic forms hence this bundle forms a symplectic manifold. A less trivial example of a Lagrangian submanifold is the zero section of the cotangent bundle of a manifold. For example, let 

:formula_89

Then, we can present formula_90 as

:formula_91

where we are treating the symbols formula_92 as coordinates of formula_93. We can consider the subset where the coordinates formula_94 and formula_95, giving us the zero section. This example can be repeated for any manifold defined by the vanishing locus of smooth functions formula_96 and their differentials formula_97.

====Example: Parametric submanifold ====
Consider the canonical space formula_98 with coordinates formula_99. A parametric submanifold formula_100 of formula_98 is one that is parameterized by coordinates formula_102 such that 
:formula_103

This manifold is a Lagrangian submanifold if the Lagrange bracket formula_104 vanishes for all formula_105. That is, it is Lagrangian if 

:formula_106 

for all formula_105. This can be seen by expanding
:formula_108
in the condition for a Lagrangian submanifold formula_100. This is that the symplectic form must vanish on the tangent manifold formula_110; that is, it must vanish for all tangent vectors:
:formula_111
for all formula_105. Simplify the result by making use of the canonical symplectic form on formula_98:

:formula_114
and all others vanishing.

As local charts on a symplectic manifold take on the canonical form, this example suggests that Lagrangian submanifolds are relatively unconstrained. The classification of symplectic manifolds is done via Floer homology—this is an application of Morse theory to the action functional for maps between Lagrangian submanifolds. In physics, the action describes the time evolution of a physical system; here, it can be taken as the description of the dynamics of branes.

====Example: Morse theory====
Another useful class of Lagrangian submanifolds occur in Morse theory. Given a Morse function formula_115 and for a small enough formula_116 one can construct a Lagrangian submanifold given by the vanishing locus formula_117. For a generic Morse function we have a Lagrangian intersection given by formula_118.

=== Special Lagrangian submanifolds ===
In the case of Kähler manifolds (or Calabi–Yau manifolds) we can make a choice formula_119 on formula_120 as a holomorphic n-form, where formula_121 is the real part and formula_122 imaginary. A Lagrangian submanifold formula_100 is called special if in addition to the above Lagrangian condition the restriction formula_122 to formula_100 is vanishing. In other words, the real part formula_121 restricted on formula_100 leads the volume form on formula_100. The following examples are known as special Lagrangian submanifolds,
# complex Lagrangian submanifolds of hyperkähler manifolds,
# fixed points of a real structure of Calabi–Yau manifolds.
The SYZ conjecture deals with the study of special Lagrangian submanifolds in mirror symmetry; see . 

The Thomas–Yau conjecture predicts that the existence of a special Lagrangian submanifolds on Calabi–Yau manifolds in Hamiltonian isotopy classes of Lagrangians is equivalent to stability with respect to a stability condition on the Fukaya category of the manifold.

== Lagrangian fibration ==
A Lagrangian fibration of a symplectic manifold &quot;M&quot; is a fibration where all of the fibres are Lagrangian submanifolds. Since &quot;M&quot; is even-dimensional we can take local coordinates and by Darboux&#x27;s theorem the symplectic form &quot;ω&quot; can be, at least locally, written as , where d denotes the exterior derivative and ∧ denotes the exterior product. This form is called the Poincaré two-form or the canonical two-form. Using this set-up we can locally think of &quot;M&quot; as being the cotangent bundle formula_129 and the Lagrangian fibration as the trivial fibration formula_130 This is the canonical picture.

== Lagrangian mapping ==

Let &quot;L&quot; be a Lagrangian submanifold of a symplectic manifold (&quot;K&quot;,ω) given by an immersion (&quot;i&quot; is called a Lagrangian immersion). Let give a Lagrangian fibration of &quot;K&quot;. The composite is a Lagrangian mapping. The critical value set of &quot;π&quot; ∘ &quot;i&quot; is called a caustic.

Two Lagrangian maps and are called Lagrangian equivalent if there exist diffeomorphisms &quot;σ&quot;, &quot;τ&quot; and &quot;ν&quot; such that both sides of the diagram given on the right commute, and &quot;τ&quot; preserves the symplectic form. Symbolically:
: formula_131
where &quot;τ&quot;∗&quot;ω&quot;2 denotes the pull back of &quot;ω&quot;2 by &quot;τ&quot;.

== Special cases and generalizations ==
* A symplectic manifold formula_132 is exact if the symplectic form formula_9 is exact. For example, the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold is an exact symplectic manifold if we use the canonical symplectic form. The area 2-form on the 2-sphere is a symplectic form that is not exact.
* A symplectic manifold endowed with a metric that is compatible with the symplectic form is an almost Kähler manifold in the sense that the tangent bundle has an almost complex structure, but this need not be integrable.
* Symplectic manifolds are special cases of a Poisson manifold.
* A multisymplectic manifold of degree &quot;k&quot; is a manifold equipped with a closed nondegenerate &quot;k&quot;-form.
* A polysymplectic manifold is a Legendre bundle provided with a polysymplectic tangent-valued formula_134-form; it is utilized in Hamiltonian field theory.

<text>Sidney James (born Solomon Joel Cohen; 8 May 1913 – 26 April 1976) was a South African–British actor and comedian whose career encompassed radio, television, stage and screen. Noted for his distinctive dirty laugh, he was best known for numerous roles in the &quot;Carry On&quot; film series.

Born to a middle-class Jewish family in South Africa, James started his career in his native country before finding his greatest success in the UK. Beginning his screen career playing bit parts in films from 1947, he was cast in numerous small and supporting roles into the 1950s. He appeared in the film &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; in 1951, starring Alec Guinness.

His profile was raised as Tony Hancock&#x27;s co-star in &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, firstly in the radio series and later when it was adapted for television and ran from 1954 to 1960. After this he became known as a regular performer in the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, appearing in 19 films of the series, top-billed in all but two.

His leading roles in television sitcoms continued. He starred in the 1970s sitcom &quot;Bless This House&quot; until his death in 1976.

==Early life==
James was born Solomon Joel Cohen on 8 May 1913, to Jewish parents in South Africa (at that time a British dominion), later changing his name to Sidney Joel Cohen, and then Sidney James. His family lived on Hancock Street in Hillbrow, Johannesburg. He claimed various previous occupations, including diamond cutter, dance tutor and boxer, but in reality had trained and worked as a hairdresser.

It was at a hairdressing salon in Kroonstad, Orange Free State, that he met his first wife. He married Berthe Sadie Delmont, known as Toots, on 12 August 1936 and they had a daughter, Elizabeth, born in 1937. His father-in-law, Joseph Delmont, a Johannesburg businessman, bought a hairdressing salon for him, but within a year James announced that he wanted to become an actor, and joined the Johannesburg Repertory Players. Through this group he gained work with the South African Broadcasting Corporation. Toots divorced him in 1940.

During World War II he served as a lieutenant in the Union Defence Force Entertainment Unit in South Africa&#x27;s army, and subsequently took up acting as a career. He moved to the United Kingdom in December 1946, financed by his service gratuity. Initially he worked in repertory, before being spotted for the nascent British post-war film industry.

==Career==

===From 1947 to 1968===
James made his first credited film appearances in &quot;Night Beat&quot; and &quot;Black Memory&quot; in 1947, both crime dramas. He played the alcoholic hero&#x27;s barman in Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; in 1949. &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; in 1951 was his first comedy film, ranked 17th out of the 100 best British films by the British Film Institute: with Alfie Bass, he made up the bullion robbery gang headed by Alec Guinness and Stanley Holloway. He also appeared in &quot;Lady Godiva Rides Again&quot; and &quot;The Galloping Major&quot;, both films were released in 1951, and as Harry Hawkins in &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953), and also had a lead role in &quot;The Wedding of Lilli Marlene&quot;. He featured in another Alec Guinness film, &quot;Father Brown&quot; (US: &quot;The Detective&quot;, 1954) and in &quot;Trapeze&quot; (1956) as Harry the snake charmer, a circus film which was one of the most successful films of its year, and he played Master Henry in &quot;Outlaw Money&quot; (also 1956), an episode of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.

James had a supporting part as a TV advertisement producer in Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;A King in New York&quot;, a non-comic supporting role as a journalist in the science-fiction film &quot;Quatermass 2&quot;, and he performed in &quot;Hell Drivers&quot; (all 1957), a film with Stanley Baker. The next year, James starred with Miriam Karlin in &quot;East End, West End&quot; by Wolf Mankowitz, a half-hour comedy series for the ITV company Associated Rediffusion. Set within the Jewish community of London&#x27;s East End, the series of six episodes was transmitted in February and March 1958, but plans for further episodes were abandoned after a disappointing response. For a while though, it had looked as if his commitment elsewhere might end his work with Tony Hancock, one of the most popular television comedians of the time.

He had begun working with Tony Hancock in 1954, in his BBC Radio series &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;. Having seen him in &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot;, it was the idea of Hancock&#x27;s writers, Galton and Simpson, to cast James. He played a character with his own name (but having the invented middle name Balmoral) who was a petty criminal and would usually manage to con Hancock in some way, although the character eventually ceased to be Hancock&#x27;s adversary. With the exception of James, the other regular cast members of the radio series were dropped when the series made the transition to television. His part in the show now greatly increased, and many viewers came to think of Hancock and James as a double act.

Feeling the format had become exhausted, Hancock decided to end his professional relationship with James at the end of the sixth television series in 1960. Although the two men remained friends, James was upset at his colleague&#x27;s decision. The experience led to a shift away from the kind of roles for which he had become best known. He remained the lovable rogue but was keen to steer clear of criminal characters; in 1960 he turned down the part of Fagin in the original West End staging of &quot;Oliver!&quot; for that very reason. Galton and Simpson continued to write for both James and Hancock for a while, and the Sidney Balmoral James character resurfaced in the &quot;Citizen James&quot; (1960–1962) series. Sid James was now consistently taking the lead role in his television work. &quot;Taxi!&quot; (1963–64) was his next series. A comedy-drama rather than a sitcom, it was created by Ted Willis, but although it ran to two series, the programme was not particularly successful.

In 1964, he made his first of two appearances on &quot;The Eamonn Andrews Show&quot;. The first few moments of the opening credits of one of them can be heard and seen in the television show &quot;Undermind&quot;, Episode 6, &quot;Intent to Destroy&quot;, broadcast on 12 June 1965. His name is heard announced, and the show is seen on a television camera seconds later.

In 1968, James, Val Doonican and Arthur Askey were filmed playing golf in the village of Cockington near Torquay (British Pathé archives, film reference 457.1), for their production &quot;Viva Torbay: Travelling to the British Seaside&quot;.

===&quot;Carry On&quot; films===
James became a leading member of the &quot;Carry On&quot; films team, originally to replace Ted Ray, who had appeared in &quot;Carry On Teacher&quot; (1959). It had been intended that Ray would become a recurring presence in the &quot;Carry On&quot; series, but he was dropped after just one film because of contractual problems. James ultimately made 19 &quot;Carry On&quot; films, receiving top billing in 17, making him one of the most featured performers of the regular cast.

The characters he portrayed in the films were usually very similar to the wise-cracking, sly, lecherous Cockney he was famed for playing on television, and in most cases they bore the name Sid or Sidney, for example, Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond in &quot;Carry On Up the Khyber&quot; and Sid Boggle in &quot;Carry On Camping&quot;. His trademark &quot;dirty laugh&quot; was often used and became, along with a world-weary &quot;Cor, blimey!&quot;, his catchphrase. His laugh can be heard here .

There were &quot;Carry On&quot; films in which James played characters who were not called Sid or Sidney: &quot;Carry On Constable&quot; (1960), in which he played Sergeant Frank Wilkins; &quot;Carry On Henry&quot; (1971), a parody of the TV series &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot;; &quot;Carry On Abroad&quot; (1972), in which James&#x27;s character was named Vic Flange; and &quot;Carry On Dick&quot; (1974), a parody version of the legend of the highwayman Dick Turpin. In &quot;Henry&quot; and &quot;Dick&quot;, James played the title roles, while in &quot;Carry On Cleo&quot; he played Mark Antony. In &quot;Carry On Cowboy&quot; (1965), he adopted an American accent for his part as &quot;The Rumpo Kid&quot;. (James had previously played an American (with an American accent) in the films &quot;Give Us This Day&quot; (1949), &quot;Orders Are Orders&quot; (1954), &quot;A Yank in Ermine&quot; (1955), &quot;Wicked as They Come&quot; (1956), Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;A King in New York&quot; (1957) and &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot; (1958).)

===Later career===
In 1967, James was intending to play Sergeant Nocker in &quot;Follow That Camel&quot;, but was already committed to recording the TV series &quot;George and the Dragon&quot; (1966–1968) for ATV, then one of the ITV contractors. James was replaced in &quot;Follow That Camel&quot; by the American comic actor Phil Silvers. On 13 May 1967, two weeks after the filming began of what eventually became an entry in the &quot;Carry On&quot; series, James suffered a severe heart attack. In the same year in &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot;, James was shown mainly lying in a hospital bed, owing to his real-life health problems. After his heart attack, James gave up his heavy cigarette habit and instead smoked a pipe or an occasional cigar; he lost weight, ate only one main meal a day, and limited himself to two or three alcoholic drinks per evening.

His success in TV situation comedy continued with the programmes &quot;Two in Clover&quot; (1969–70) and &quot;Bless This House&quot; (1971–1976); the latter led to a film version in 1972.

==Personal life==
James married three times. He and his first wife, Berthe Sadie Delmont, were married in 1936 and a daughter, Elizabeth, was born in 1937; they were divorced in 1940, mainly as a result of his many relationships with other women.

In 1943, he married a dancer, Meg Sergei (1913–1977); in 1947, they had a daughter Reina. They were divorced on 17 August 1952.

On 21 August 1952, James married Valerie Elizabeth Patsy Assan (1928–2022), an actress who used Ashton as her stage name. They had a son, Steve James, born in 1954, who became a music producer, and a daughter, Sue, who became a television producer. During the latter part of their marriage they lived in a house partly designed by James himself, Delaford Park, in Iver, Buckinghamshire, a location close enough to Pinewood Studios to allow him to return home for lunch while filming. During his marriage to Valerie he had a well-publicised affair with &quot;Carry On&quot; co-star Barbara Windsor that lasted three years. The affair was dramatised in the 1998 stage play &quot;Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick&quot; and its 2000 television adaptation &quot;Cor, Blimey!&quot;. 

James&#x27;s obsession with Windsor was such that it was rumoured that her then husband, Ronnie Knight, had all of James&#x27;s furniture rearranged at home as a subtle threat and, on another occasion, put an axe in James&#x27;s floor, but close friends of the time, including Vince Powell and William G. Stewart, dismissed the suggestions. According to his biographer Cliff Goodwin, James struck his pregnant girlfriend, and he also struck his first wife when she was pregnant.

James was an inveterate and largely unsuccessful gambler, losing tens of thousands of pounds over his lifetime. His gambling addiction was such that he had an agreement with his agent, Michael Sullivan, under which his wife was not told how much he was being paid, so that a portion could be set aside for gambling.

==Death==
On 26 April 1976, four days after the end of the sixth series of &quot;Bless This House&quot;, James was on tour in a revival of a comedy, &quot;The Mating Season&quot;, when he suffered a heart attack on stage at the Sunderland Empire Theatre. Actresses Olga Lowe and Audrey Jeans thought that he was playing a practical joke at first when he failed to reply to their dialogue. When they ad-libbed to him and he still failed to respond, they moved towards the wings to seek help. The technical manager, Melvyn James (no relation), called for the curtain to close and requested a doctor, while the audience – who were unaware of what was happening – laughed, believing the events to be part of the show. An ambulance was called, and he was pronounced dead on arrival at Sunderland General Hospital. He was 62.

At the time of his death, negotiations were being held for a seventh and eighth series of &quot;Bless This House&quot;, as well as another film adaptation, to be produced along with an hour-long television variety special featuring James, but those plans were scrapped due to his death. Bruce Forsyth ultimately replaced him in the leading role of the 1976 TV version of &quot;The Mating Season&quot; that went out on ITV in December of the same year. James was cremated and his ashes were scattered at Golders Green Crematorium.

==Legacy==
James has been the subject of at least five tribute shows: Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;With Out Walls, Seriously Seeking Sid&quot; in the late 1980s; a 1996 one-off tribute, &quot;The Very Best of Sid James&quot;; a 2000 episode of the series &quot;The Unforgettable&quot;; a 2002 episode of &quot;Heroes of Comedy&quot;; and in 2013, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Many Faces Of Sid James&quot;.

James was played by Geoffrey Hutchings in Terry Johnson&#x27;s play &quot;Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick&quot;, which premiered at the National Theatre in 1998. Hutchings reprised the role in the subsequent film adaptation, &quot;Cor, Blimey!&quot;.

In the 2006 BBC television film &quot;Kenneth Williams: Fantabulosa!&quot;, James was played by Ged McKenna.

In August 2018, it was announced that a radio interview which James had recorded for BBC Radio Solent on 22 March 1976 had been re-discovered during research for a forthcoming BBC radio documentary celebrating the &quot;Carry On&quot; film series. The recording had been kept by BBC presenter Jeff Link, who had carried out the original interview. In the interview, James discusses his attempts to keep fit by skipping, his preference for working in films, his genuine affection for the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, and other topics. The interview is notable for its relaxed, humorous style. The producer of the forthcoming BBC &quot;Carry On&quot; documentary, Richard Latto, contacted James&#x27;s surviving daughters after confirming the recording&#x27;s authenticity. Reina James commented: &quot;To hear him talking just before he&#x27;s about to die.. there&#x27;s something hugely moving about that&quot;. Sue James called the interview &quot;lovely and sympathetic&quot;.

A Heritage Foundation commemorative blue plaque to James was installed at the former Teddington Studios on Broom Road, Teddington, Greater London, until 30 June 2015 – at which time it was stolen, just before the building was demolished to make way for housing. A further blue plaque, placed by the British Comedy Society, commemorates his time living at 35 Gunnersbury Avenue (A406), from 1956 to 1963. The first plaque here was also stolen; the second &quot;was placed much higher up the wall.&quot;

<doc id="28362" wikidata="Q651658" url="?curid=28362" title="Freight transport">
<text>Freight transport, also referred to as freight forwarding, is the physical process of transporting commodities and merchandise goods and cargo. The term shipping originally referred to transport by sea but in American English, it has been extended to refer to transport by land or air (International English: &quot;carriage&quot;) as well. &quot;Logistics&quot;, a term borrowed from the military environment, is also used in the same sense.

==Modes of shipment==
In 2015, 108 trillion tonne-kilometers were transported worldwide (anticipated to grow by 3.4% per year until 2050 (128 Trillion in 2020)): 70% by sea, 18% by road, 9% by rail, 2% by inland waterways and less than 0.25% by air.

===Grounds===
Land or &quot;ground&quot; shipping can be made by train or by truck (British English: lorry). Ground transport is typically more affordable than air, but more expensive than sea, especially in developing countries, where inland infrastructure may not be efficient. In air and sea shipments, ground transport is required to take the cargo from its place of origin to the airport or seaport and then to its destination because it is not always possible to establish a production facility near ports due to the limited coastlines of countries.

Much freight transport is done by cargo ships. An individual nation&#x27;s fleet and the people that crew it are referred to as its merchant navy or merchant marine. According to a 2018 report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), merchant shipping (or seaborne trade) carries 80-90% of international trade and 60-70% by value. On rivers and canals, barges are often used to carry bulk cargo.

===Air===
Cargo is transported by air in specialized cargo aircraft and in the luggage compartments of passenger aircraft. Air freight is typically the fastest mode for long-distance freight transport, but it is also the most expensive.

===Space===
===Multimodal===
Cargo is exchanged between different modes of transportation via transport hubs, also known as transport interchanges or Nodes (e.g. train stations, airports, etc.). Cargo is shipped under a single contract but performed using at least two different modes of transport (e.g. ground and air). Cargo may not be containerized.

===Intermodal===
Multimodal transport featuring containerized cargo (or intermodal container) that is easily transferred between ship, rail, plane and truck.

For example, a shipper works together with both ground and air transportation to ship an item overseas. Intermodal freight transport is used to plan the route and carry out the shipping service from the manufacturer to the door of the recipient.

== Terms of shipment ==

The Incoterms (or International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) are accepted by governments, legal authorities, and practitioners worldwide for the interpretation of the most commonly used terms in international trade. Common terms include:

* Free on Board (FOB)
* Cost and Freight (CFR, C&amp;F, CNF)
* Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)

The term &quot;best way&quot; generally implies that the shipper will choose the carrier that offers the lowest rate (to the shipper) for the shipment. In some cases, however, other factors, such as better insurance or faster transit time, will cause the shipper to choose an option other than the lowest bidder.

==Door-to-door shipping==
Door-to-door (DTD or D2D) shipping refers to the domestic or international shipment of cargo from the point of origin (POI) to the destination while generally remaining on the same piece of equipment and avoiding multiple transactions, trans-loading, and cross-docking without interim storage.

International DTD is a service provided by many international shipping companies and may feature intermodal freight transport using containerized cargo. The quoted price of this service includes all shipping, handling, import and customs duties, making it a hassle-free option for customers to import goods from one jurisdiction to another. This is compared to standard shipping, the price of which typically includes only the expenses incurred by the shipping company in transferring the object from one place to another. Customs fees, import taxes and other tariffs may contribute substantially to this base price before the item ever arrives.

<text>Sidon ( ) or better known as Saida ( ; ) is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located on the Mediterranean coast in the South Governorate, of which it is the capital. Tyre, to the south, and the Lebanese capital of Beirut, to the north, are both about away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within the city limits, while its metropolitan area has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.

==Etymology==

The Phoenician name (, ) probably meant &quot;fishery&quot; or &quot;fishing town&quot;. It is mentioned in Papyrus Anastasi I as &quot;ḏjdwnꜣ&quot;. It appears in Biblical Hebrew as () and in Syriac as (). This was Hellenised as (), which was Latinised as and entered English in this form. The name appears in Classical Arabic as () and in Modern Arabic as ().

As a Roman colony, it was notionally refounded and given the formal name to honour its imperial sponsor.

During the crusades, Sidon was known in Latin as and in Old French as , or .

In the Book of Genesis, Sidon was the first-born son of Canaan, who was a son of Ham, thereby making Sidon a great-grandson of Noah.

==History==
In antiquity, Sidon held prominence as a significant Phoenician city. Nestled on a mainland promontory and boasting two harbors. Throughout ancient history, Sidon had many conquerors: Assyrians, Babylonians, Egyptians, Persians, Greeks, and finally Romans. Under Persian rule, it eclipsed Tyre to become the paramount city in Phoenicia. In the New Testament era, Herod the Great visited Sidon. Both Jesus and Saint Paul are said to have visited it, too (see &quot;Biblical Sidon&quot; below). The city was eventually conquered by the Arabs and then by the Ottoman Turks.

===Prehistory===
Sidon has been inhabited since very early in prehistory. The archaeological site of Sidon II shows a lithic assemblage dating to the Acheulean, whilst finds at Sidon III include a Heavy Neolithic assemblage suggested to date just prior to the invention of pottery.

===Late Bronze===
Around 1350 BC, Sidon was part of the Egyptian Empire and ruled by Zimredda of Sidon. During the Amarna Period, Egypt went into decline, leading to uprising and turmoil in the Levant. There was rivalry between Lebanese coastal city-states fighting for dominance, with Abimilku of Tyre in the south, and Rib-Hadda of Byblos in the north. Byblos became significantly weakened as the dominant city on the Lebanese coast. Further north, the Akkar Plain rebelled and became the kingdom of Amurru with Hittite support. The Mitanni Empire, an ally of the Egyptians, had dominated Syria but now fell apart due to the military campaigns of Suppiluliuma I of Hatti. Tutankhamun and his general Horemheb scrambled to keep Egyptian control over southern Levant, as the Hittites became overlords in the north.

The oldest testimony documenting words in the Phoenician language of Sidon, is also from this period. The Book of Deuteronomy (3, 9) reads: &quot;the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion&quot;. In other words: Mount Hermon was called &quot;Sirion&quot;, in (the Phoenician language of) Sidon.

===Iron Age===
Sidon was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women&#x27;s skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis (&#x27;Mother City&#x27;) of Phoenicia.

During the Phoenician era, Sidon thrived on two pivotal industries: glass manufacturing and purple dye production. The city&#x27;s glass production operated on an extensive scale, while the manufacturing of purple dye held nearly equal importance. The magnitude of Sidon&#x27;s purple dye production was evident through a considerable mound of discarded &quot;Murex trunculus&quot; shells discovered near the southern harbor. These shells were broken to extract the precious pigment, so rare that it became synonymous with royalty.

In AD 1855, the sarcophagus of King Eshmun’azar II was discovered. From a Phoenician inscription on its lid, it appears that he was a &quot;king of the Sidonians,&quot; probably in the 5th century BC, and that his mother was a priestess of ‘Ashtart, &quot;the goddess of the Sidonians.&quot; In this inscription the gods Eshmun and Ba‘al Sidon &#x27;Lord of Sidon&#x27; (who may or may not be the same) are mentioned as chief gods of the Sidonians. ‘Ashtart is entitled &quot;‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al,&quot; &#x27;‘Ashtart the name of the Lord&#x27;, a title also found in an Ugaritic text.

Nebuchadnezzar II subjugated the city to be part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Sidon&#x27;s navy played a significant role in the Battle of Salamis in 480 BC, aligning with the Persian fleet against the Greeks. From the mid-fifth century BC onward, warships became a prominent feature on the city&#x27;s coinage. At the end of the Persian era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by Artaxerxes III.

===Persian and Hellenistic periods===

Like other Phoenician city-states, Sidon suffered from a succession of conquerors, first by the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC, ending with its occupation by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, and the start of the Hellenistic period of Sidon&#x27;s history. The Persian influence seems to have been profound, as is observed in the change of the architectural style of the city. 
In exchange for supporting his conquest of Egypt, King Cambyses II of Persia awarded Sidon with the territories of Dor, Joppa, and the Plain of Sharon.

Under the Diadochi or successors of Alexander, it enjoyed relative autonomy and organised games and competitions in which the greatest athletes of the region participated. In the Hellenistic period necropolis of Sidon, important finds such as the Alexander Sarcophagus (likely the tomb of King Abdalonymus rather than Alexander), the Lycian tomb and the Sarcophagus of the Crying Women were discovered, which are now on display at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.

===Roman period===
When Sidon fell under Roman domination, it continued to mint its own silver coins. The city was embellished by Herod, king of Judaea, who built there a theatre. By the First Jewish–Roman War, Sidon sheltered enough Jews that local pagans hesitated to attack them during the broader massacre of Jews in Greco-Syrian towns in 66 CE, as documented by Josephus.

The Romans built a theater and other major monuments in the city, and an underground Mithraeum was discovered. In the reign of Elagabalus, a Roman colony was established there. During the Byzantine Empire, when the great earthquake of AD 551 destroyed most of the cities of Phoenice, the law school of Berytus took refuge in Sidon. The town continued quietly for the next century, until the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 636.

===Crusader-Ayyubid period===

On 4 December 1110, Sidon was captured after the siege of Sidon, a decade after the First Crusade, by King Baldwin I of Jerusalem and King Sigurd I of Norway. It then became the center of the Lordship of Sidon, an important vassal-state of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Saladin captured it from the Crusaders in 1187, but German Crusaders restored it to Christian control in the Crusade of 1197. It remained an important Crusader stronghold until it was destroyed by the Ayyubids in 1249. In 1260, it was again destroyed by the Mongols led by Kitbuqa. The remains of the original walls are still visible.

During the 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela noted the presence of approximately twenty Jews, possibly families, in Sidon, which he described as a &quot;large city.&quot;

===Ottoman period===
After Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance. In 1521, Moses Basola encountered twenty families of Musta&#x27;rabi Jews during his visit to Sidon.

During the 18th century, the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.

During the Egyptian–Ottoman War, Sidon, like much of Ottoman Syria, was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with a column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named .

The 19th century brought significant changes to the Jewish community of Sidon. By 1830, the community, comprising around twenty-five families of primarily Arabic-speaking merchants, had customs akin to those of Judean Jews. Starting in 1850, the community witnessed growth as Maghrebi Jews, initially settled in the Chouf Mountains above Beirut, migrated to Sidon and Beirut amidst escalating Druze-Maronite tensions and the ensuing 1860 war. With roots in mountain traditions, they introduced citrus cultivation on the outskirts of Sidon, leading to the construction of a new synagogue in 1860 to meet the needs of the expanding community.

From 1887 the Royal necropolis of Sidon was extensively excavated by the Ottomans, and its treasures transferred to Istanbul (like the Alexander sarcophagus). Sidon was a small fishing town of 10,000 inhabitants in 1900.

===After World War I===

After World War I it became part of the French Mandate of Lebanon. During World War II the city, together with the rest of Lebanon, was captured by British forces fighting against the Vichy French, and following the war it became a major city of independent Lebanon. Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, Palestinian refugees arrived in Sidon, as in other Lebanese cities, and were settled at the large refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh. At first these consisted of enormous rows of tents, but gradually houses were constructed. The refugee camps constituted de facto neighborhoods of Sidon, but had a separate legal and political status which made them into a kind of enclaves. At the same time, the remaining Jews of the city fled, and the Jewish cemetery fell into disrepair, threatened by coastal erosion.

On Easter Sunday, 19 April 1981, at least sixteen people were killed in Sidon after the (South Lebanon Army) SLA&#x27;s long-range artillery indiscriminately shelled the city centre. It was reported that it was in response to a request from Bashir Gemayel in connection with ongoing Syrian attacks on Phalangist positions around Zahle. Israel denied involvement. After the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon Sidon was occupied by the Israeli army for almost two and a half years.

On 18 August 1997, following a roadside bomb near Jezzine which killed two teenage members of a SLA leader&#x27;s family, SLA artillery shelled Sidon killing seven civilians and wounding thirty-five. Hizbollah responded the following day by firing 60–80 rockets into the security zone and northern Israel. According to UNIFIL observers the missiles appeared to be targeted at uninhabited areas. The attack on Sidon is credited with leading to a truce between Hizbollah and Amal and increased cooperation between the two groups and the Lebanese Army. This was evident in the Ansariya ambush the following month.

On 8 June 1999 two gunmen entered the Palais de Justice, Sidon&#x27;s main courthouse, and shot dead three magistrates and a chief prosecutor. The attackers escaped. No group claimed responsibility but suspicion focused on Osbat al-Ansar whose leader had been sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; for the murder of the head of the Sufi Al-Ahbash movement and the attempted assassination of the mufti of Tripoli. He was believed to be in hiding in the Ain al-Hilwa refugee camp.

Studies in 2000 showed a population of 65,000 in the city, and around 200,000 in the metropolitan area. The little level land around the city is used for cultivation of wheat, vegetables, and fruits, especially citrus and bananas. The fishing in the city remains active with a newly opened fishery that sells fresh fish by bidding every morning. The ancient basin was transformed into a fishing port, while a small quay was constructed to receive small commercial vessels (see &quot;Old City&quot; and the &quot;Architecture and landscape&quot; sections below).

Saida Municipal Stadium was inaugurated in 2000 for the Asian Football Confederation&#x27;s Cup 2000.

==Politics==
This sectarian and demographic division rose to the surface during the Lebanese Civil War, when armed clashes erupted between Sunni Muslims and Christians. The clashes ended with the surrender of the Christian front, and Christians were forced to move to east Beirut. After the war ended in 1990, some Christians gradually returned to their hometowns but in 2000 many fled to Israel. The local politics of Sidon in the 20th century was mainly dominated up till the 1980s by allegiances around two main families, the El-Bizri and Saad. The El-Bizri politicians were known for their business connections, close ties with eminent Lebanese and Levantine leaders, and their bent on serving the Lebanese state as government ministers, officials and mayors. The Saad politicians tended to be populist and became engaged in violent protests in the 1940s, 1950s and then during the Lebanese civil war as Nasserites (populist followers of Nasser in Lebanon).

The local political conflict between these two families was always resolved through amicable means and ties of kinship. Their hold over the political aspects of the city was similar to that of Mediterranean families in Sicily or to being also influenced by the ties of Arab families, clans, and tribes in traditionalist forms. The most notable figures of the El-Bizri family in the first half of the 20th century were: Ahmad El-Bizri (born 1899), Salah El-Bizri, Eizeddine El-Bizri (commonly known as Eizzo) and Anwar El-Bizri (born 1910). These four brothers were businessmen and politicians who dominated the political life of the city up till the late 1940s, using traditional inherited forms of governance since Ottoman times. With intelligence and strength they maintained their power for over 50 years. It is from their ranks that Maarouf Saad started his public life, and their close cousins, Nazih El-Bizri, Amin El-Bizri, and Fouad El-Bizri became the next generation of politicians and statesmen in Lebanon; holding positions as ministers and members of parliament.

The El-Bizri and the Saad political practices were bent on social justice and on local service in public affairs. The El-Bizri were since the Ottoman rule bent on serving the state, and this continued with their loyalty and support to the successive governments of Lebanon since the times of independence. They also helped eminent politicians and statesmen from Sidonian descent such as the Prime Ministers Riad Solh, Takieddine el-Solh and Rashid Solh, they also gave their support to former Prime Minister Saeb Salam, father of Tamam Salam, Prime Minister 2014–2016. The presence of the El-Bizris was at times intimidating on the local scene, but they were also known for their goodwill and dignified public service.

The Saad family developed their links with Nasserism in the 1950s and engaged in the uprising and armed protest of 1958 against the government of the Lebanese President Chamoun. They also became involved in the civil war as part of the left wing politics of the Lebanon (Al-Haraka al-Wataniyya) with PLO connections, and they actively contributed to resisting the Israeli occupation after 1982. The Saads remained populist in their politics and focused on the grassroots, while the El-Bizri were generally appealing to the middle and upper classes. In the middle 1980s, the Hariri family began to rise to prominence and became the most influential in Sidon in political and financial terms, even though the presence of the Saad and the El-Bizri in local politics remained significant at the level of visibility and activism. The Saad family developed its original politics from within the sphere of influence of the El-Bizri family and then became a power to reckon with on its own after 1948, and most powerfully in 1958, then in the civil war and until the present today.

Maarouf Saad, the leader of his family, and a local influential politician, was assassinated at the eve of the Lebanese civil war in 1975. The Saads retained their populism and grassroots appeal, and attracted a core of loyal adherents since the middle of the 20th century. While the El-Bizri were Levantine in their Arabism (namely focused mainly on Bilad al-Shaam in regional politics), and the Solh being also similar to them in this, the Saad were leaning more towards a broader pan-Arabism (Nasserite, Libyan, and then Syrian). The Hariri family started to rise to political and economic prominence in the 1980s and became perhaps the most influential family in Lebanon by the mid-1990s, following modern forms of political practice through a large party (Future Movement) that cuts across various economic classes.

==Impact on Sidon of regional underdevelopment==
According to a 2013 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report &quot;data also point to an increase in urban poverty especially in Lebanon&#x27;s largest cities suburbs such as Beirut, Tripoli and Saida, as illustrated by poverty-driven symptoms (child labour, over-crowding and deteriorated environment conditions).&quot; In another UNDP report, the author discusses the development predominance of Beirut over the rest of the regions of Lebanon (North, South and Beqaa) is a well-known imbalance that can be dated to the early 19th century. With the expansion of Beirut in the 1870s, urban growth in the future capital outpaced Tripoli and Saida. Transportation routes, missionary schools, universities and hospitals as well as the Beirut port development and the commerce of silk participated to the fortification of Beirut as a major trade center for Mediterranean exchange (ARNAUD 1993; LABAKI 1999: 23). However, the establishment of Great Lebanon in 1920, under the French mandate, added the poorer areas of the North (Akkar), Beqaa (Baalbak-Hermel) and the South (Jabal Aamel) to the relatively affluent cities of Mount Lebanon. This addition made of Lebanon a country composed of unequally developed regions. This legacy remains a heavy load to bear socially, culturally, economically and politically. Even though the public policies elaborated by the young Lebanese State were attempting to have regional perspectives, the early urban planning schemes reveal a development approach exclusively axed on Beirut and its suburbs.

The post war development policy of the State, promoted by Hariri government (1992–1998), was centered around balanced development and is widely inspired by the 1943 Pact and the 1989 Taef agreement (LABAKI1993: 104). However the application of this policy aims mainly at the rehabilitation and construction of roads and infrastructures (electricity, telephone, sewage). Another of its components is the rehabilitation of government buildings (airport, port, schools, universities and hospitals). Transportation projects (mainly concentrated on the coastal line) constitute 25% of the budget of 10-year economic plan developed by the CDR (BAALBAKI 1994: 90). However, all these projects are predominantly concentrated around Beirut, ignoring the regions.

===The former &quot;Makab&quot; (waste dump) and the treatment plant ===
Near the southern entrance to the city used to be a &#x27;rubbish mountain&#x27; called at the time by the locals the &quot;Makab&quot;; namely, a 600,000 cubic metre heap that reached the height of a four-story building. It was originally created to dispose of the remains of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes during the 1982 invasion, but it then became the main dump for the city. Growing out of the sea, it became an environmental hazard, with medical waste and plastic bags polluting nearby fishing grounds.

Sidon politicians, including the Hariri family, failed for decades to resolve the &quot;Makab&quot; crisis—which has endangered residents&#x27; health (especially during episodic burning). In 2004, Engineer Hamzi Moghrabi, a Sidon native, conceived the idea to establish a treatment plant for the city&#x27;s decades-old chronic waste problem. He established the privately funded IBC Enviro and the treatment plant became operational in 2013.

The Ministry of Environment came up with a $50,000+ plan to clean the whole area and transform the dump into a green space, along with other heaps in the country. Qamla beach in Sidon, a coast in close proximity to the Sea Castle, witnessed a large municipal cleanup in May 2011, as it was an easy target of rubbish being washed up by the Makab. These plans aim to revive the former glory of the city&#x27;s coasts and attract tourists who avoided swimming in Sidon&#x27;s sea before. The project of cleaning the region where the waste dump has already started, and currently a waves-barrier is being built, and the vast bulk of the waste dump being cleared.

==Local government==
The city of Sidon is administered by the Municipality of Sidon. The municipality is constituted of a council of 21 members including the City Mayor and his Deputy. It has administrative and financial independence but remains under the control and supervision of the central government, specifically the Ministry of Interior. The municipality&#x27;s jurisdiction is limited to a region of 786 hectares in area and 5 meters in elevation, while each of the city&#x27;s suburbs is administered by its own independent municipal council. Sidon is the center of the Governorate of South Lebanon, and hosts the seat of the Governor of Southern Lebanon. The city is also the center of the Sidon District and the Union of Sidon and Zahrani Municipalities (founded in 1978 and contains 15 municipalities). Sidon hosts the southern regional headquarters of a series of governmental facilities like the Central Bank of Lebanon, Électricité du Liban, Central Telecommunications Station and others. It is also the home of the Justice Palace of South Lebanon in its new headquarters on East Boulevard (the old headquarters were an old Ottoman Saray that is currently occupied by the LSF and is planned to be transformed into a cultural center by the municipality).

In the 2000 and 2005 parliamentary elections, the Sidon District along with the Tyre and Bint Jbeil districts formed the first electoral district of South Lebanon. However, in the 2009 elections – and due to the reactivation of the 1960 electoral law – the city of Sidon was separated from its district to form a separate electoral district.

==Demographics==
In 2014, Muslims made up 92.99% and Christians made up 6.49% of registered voters in Sidon. 82.16% of the voters were Sunni Muslims and 10.83% were Shiite Muslims.

The overwhelming majority of Sidon&#x27;s population belong to the Sunni sect of Islam, with a small number of Shiites and Christians. Sidon is the seat of the Greek Melkite Catholic Archbishop of Sidon and Deir el Qamar, and has housed a significant Catholic population throughout its history. Sidon also hosts the seat of the Shiite Ayatollah of South Lebanon.

In the 1930s, when Lebanon was still under the French mandate, Sidon had the largest Jewish population in Lebanon, estimated at 3,588, compared to 3,060 in Beirut, however by the end of 1990s most of the Jewish population had emigrated leaving their cemitery and other sites in a state of abandonment.

==Main sights==
* Sidon Sea Castle, a fortress built by the Crusaders in the early 13th century. It is located near the Port of Sidon.
* Sidon Soap Museum. It traces the history of the soap making in the region and its different manufacturing steps.
* Khan al-Franj (&quot;Caravanserai of the French&quot;), a complex built in the 16th century, though erroneously credited to Emir Fakhreddine II in the 17th century. It gained its name for accommodating French merchants and goods in order to develop trade with Europe. This is a typical khan with a large rectangular courtyard and a central fountain surrounded by covered galleries.
* Debbane Palace, a historical residence built in 1721, an example of Arab-Ottoman architecture. This villa was earlier occupied by the Hammoud family in the 18th century and also by members of the famous Ottoman aristocrats of the Abaza clan in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The vaults at the ground level being originally stables for the villa residents and then turned into shops as part of the old souks, and known until recent time by association to the Abazas.
* The Castle of St. Louis (&quot;Qalaat Al Muizz&quot;). It was built by the Crusaders in the 13th century on top of the remains of a fortress built by the Fatimid caliph Al Muizz. It is located to the south of the Old Souks near Murex Hill.
* Eshmun Temple, dedicated to the Phoenician god of healing. Built in the 7th century BC, it is located in the north of Sidon near the Awali River.
* The British War Cemetery in Sidon. Opened in 1943 by units of His Majesty&#x27;s (King George VI) British Forces occupying the Lebanon after the 1941 campaign against the Vichy French troops. It was originally used for the burial of men who died while serving with the occupation force, but subsequently the graves of a number of the casualties of the 1941 campaign were moved into the cemetery from other burial grounds or from isolated positions in the vicinity. The cemetery now contains 176 Commonwealth burials of the Second World War and nine war graves of other nationalities. It was designed by G. Vey. It is perhaps the only garden in modern Sidon that is elegantly kept and cared for. It is not a public garden, but can be visited when the wardens have its gateways opened.

==Education==
Sidon is home to numerous educational facilities ranging from public elementary schools to private universities. According to a 2006 study, the city is home to 29 schools that serve a total of 18,731 students: 37% are in public schools, 63% are in private schools. Sidon also contains 10 universities, 5 of which are private universities.

==Archaeology==
The following archaeological sites in the area indicate settlements from the earliest prehistorical times.

Sidon I, II and III are prehistoric sites, while Sidon I is the tell of ancient Sidon starting from the Early Bronze Age.

Sidon I is an archaeological site located to the east of the city, south of the road to Jezzine. An assemblage of flint tools was found by P. E. Gigues suggested to date between 3800 and 3200 BC. The collection included narrow axes or chisels that were polished on one side and flaked on the other, similar to ones found at Ain Cheikh, Nahr Zahrani and Gelal en Namous. The collection appears to have gone missing from the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut.

Sidon II is said to be &quot;near the church&quot; at approximately fifty meters above sea level. P. E. Gigues suggested that the industry found on the surface of this site dated to the Acheulean.

Sidon III was found by in the 1920s, who made a collection of material that is now in the National Museum of Beirut marked &quot;Camp de l&#x27;Aviation&quot;. It includes large flint and chert bifacials that may be of Heavy Neolithic origin.

Sidon IV is the tell mound of ancient Sidon with Early Bronze Age () deposits, now located underneath the ruined Saint Louis Castle and what are also thought to be the ruins of a Roman theater.

===Bronze Age city and kingdom===
====City of Sidon (Sidon IV site)====
In the area of this ruined Crusader castle, recent excavations uncovered a late Early Bronze Age I (EB I) settlement on bedrock. Here, an uninterrupted sequence from EB I to EB III was found. A modest third-millennium BC settlement consisting of domestic installations and tombs was also uncovered. Yet the following history of Sidon was not clarified. Very little has been known about the location, extent, and significance of Middle Bronze Age (MBA) Sidon until recently.

====Tell el-Burak MBA settlement====
Since the early 21st century, Tell el-Burak excavations have helped significantly in this area, because it was an active settlement during MBA, and quite well preserved. Tell el-Burak is located along the coast 9 km south from Sidon. Previously, there was a big gap in the history of this whole coastal area from the end of the Early Bronze Age until the middle of the 2nd millennium BC, when Sidon is first mentioned in the historical texts.

====MBA kingdom of Sidon====
Archaeologists determined that Sidon was clearly the big power centre during MBA, controlling significant territory. So there appears to have been the &quot;Kingdom of Sidon&quot; that controlled el-Burak, and many other surrounding areas.

=== Excavation history ===
The area around Sidon contains a number of important necropoli (below in order of age, and noting their principal excavators):
* Dakerman (Roger Saidah, 1968–1969)
* Tambourit (Saidah, 1977)
* Magharet Abloun (Aimé Péretié, 1855; Ernest Renan, 1864; Georges Contenau, 1920)
* Ayaa (William King Eddy, 1887; Osman Hamdi Bey, 1892; Contenau, 1920)
* Ain al-Hilweh (Charles Cutler Torrey, 1919–1920)
* El-Merah (Contenau, 1920)
* Qrayé (Contenau, 1920)
* Almoun, (Conenau, 1924)
* El-Harah (Theodore Makridi, 1904; Contenau, 1924)
* Magharet Abloun, Greco-Roman part (Renan, 1864; Contenau, 1914–1924)
* Helalié/Baramié/Mar Elias (William John Bankes, 1816; Renan 1864; Contenau, 1914; M. Meurdrac &amp; L. Albanèse, 1938–1939)

In indication of the high-profile of the old city of Sidon in archaeological expeditions, and mainly in the 19th century, in October 1860 the famous French scholar Ernest Renan was entrusted with an archaeological mission to Lebanon, which included the search for the antique parts of Sidon. The Phoenician inscriptions that he discovered, and his field data, were eventually published in his notebook the: &quot;Mission de Phénicie&quot; (1864–1874; &quot;Phoenician Expedition&quot;).

The St. Louis castle grounds were excavated in 1914–1920 by a French team. Then eastwards a new site was also excavated by another generation of French expeditions in the 1960s. This same site received renewed attention in 1998 when the Directorate General of Antiquities in Lebanon authorized the British Museum to begin excavations on this area of land that was specifically demarcated for archaeological research. This has resulted in published papers, with a special focus on studying ceramics.

The archaeological fieldwork was not fully undertaken since the independence of the Lebanon. The main finds are displayed in the National Museum in Beirut. The fieldwork was also interrupted during the long civil war period, and it is now resumed but at a timid and slow scale, and not involving major international expeditions or expertise. Perhaps this is also indicative of the general lack in cultural interests among the authorities of this city, and almost of the non-existence of notable intellectual activities in its modern life. There are signs that the locals are beginning to recognize the value of the medieval quarters, but this remains linked to minor individual initiatives and not a coordinated collective effort to rehabilitate it like it has been the case with Byblos, even though the old district of Sidon contains a great wealth in old and ancient architecture.

During the 2024 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, UNESCO gave enhanced protection to 34 cultural sites in Lebanon including the archaeological sites at Sidon to safeguard them from damage.

==In the Bible==
===Hebrew Bible/Old Testament===
The Hebrew Bible describes Sidon () in several passages:
* It received its name from the &quot;first-born&quot; of Canaan, the grandson of Noah.
* The Tribe of Zebulun has a frontier on Sidon
* It was the first home of the Phoenicians on the coast of Canaan, and from its extensive commercial relations became a &quot;great&quot; city.
* It was the mother city of Tyre. It lay within the lot of the tribe of Asher, but was never subdued.
* The Sidonians long oppressed Israel.
* From the time of David its glory began to wane, and Tyre, its &quot;virgin daughter&quot;, rose to its place of pre-eminence.
* Solomon entered into a matrimonial alliance with the Sidonians, and thus their form of idolatrous worship found a place in the land of Israel.
* Jezebel was the daughter of King Ithobaal I of Sidon.
* It was famous for its manufactures and arts, as well as for its commerce.
* It is frequently referred to by the prophets.
* Elijah sojourned in Sidon, performing miracles.

===New Testament===
* Jesus visited the region or &quot;coasts&quot; (King James Version) of Tyre and Sidon and from this region many came forth to hear him preaching, leading to the stark contrast in Matthew 11:21-23 to Korazin and Bethsaida. See the exorcism of the Syrophoenician woman&#x27;s daughter, which takes place on the coast, in the region of Sidon and Tyre. Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went by way of Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis
* From Sidon, at which his ship put in after leaving Caesarea, Paul finally sailed for Rome.

==In ancient mythology==
* The account ascribed to the Phoenician historian Sanchuniathon makes Sidon a daughter of Pontus, son of Nereus. She is said there to have first invented musical song from the sweetness of her voice.

<text>Spam (stylized in all-caps) is a brand of lunch meat (processed canned pork and ham) made by Hormel Foods Corporation, an American multinational food processing company. It was introduced in the United States in 1937 and gained popularity worldwide after its use during World War II. , Spam was sold in 41 countries, and trademarked in more than 100, on six continents.

Spam&#x27;s main ingredients are pork shoulder and ham, with salt, water, modified potato starch (as a binder), sugar, and sodium nitrite (as a preservative). Natural gelatin is formed during cooking in its cans on the production line. It is available in different flavors, some using different meats, as well as in &quot;lite&quot; and lower-sodium versions. Spam is precooked, making it safe to consume straight from the can, but it is often cooked further for taste.

Concerns about Spam&#x27;s nutritional attributes have been raised because it contains twice as much of the daily dietary recommendation of fat as it does of protein, and about the health effects of salt and preservatives.

Spam has become part of popular culture, including a Monty Python sketch, which repeated the name many times, leading to its name being borrowed to describe unsolicited electronic messages, especially email. It is occasionally celebrated at festivals such as Spamarama in Austin, Texas.

== History ==

Hormel introduced Spam on July 5, 1937. &quot;The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America&quot; states that the product was intended to increase the sale of pork shoulder, a cut which did not sell well.

Ken Daigneau, the brother of a company executive, won a $100 prize that year in a competition to name the new item. Hormel states that the meaning of the name &quot;is known by only a small circle of former Hormel Foods executives,&quot; but a popular belief is that the name is a contraction of &quot;spiced ham&quot;. It has also been speculated to be an acronym for &quot;shoulder of pork and ham&quot;.

The difficulty of delivering fresh meat to the front during World War II saw Spam become a ubiquitous part of the U.S. soldier&#x27;s diet. It became variously referred to as &quot;ham that didn&#x27;t pass its physical&quot;, &quot;meatloaf without basic training&quot;, and &quot;Special Army Meat&quot;. Over of Spam were purchased by the military before the war&#x27;s end. However, several troops grew tired of the product. They expressed their frustrations in written letters to Mr. Hormel about the presence of Spam at every meal. Despite this disparagement, throughout the war, countries ravaged by the conflict and faced with strict food rations came to appreciate Spam.

During World War II and the occupations that followed, Spam was introduced into Guam, Hawaii, Okinawa, the Philippines, and other islands in the Pacific. Immediately absorbed into native diets, it has become a unique part of the history and effects of U.S. influence in the Pacific islands. As a consequence of World War II rationing and the Lend-Lease Act, Spam was sold in the United Kingdom. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher later referred to it as a &quot;wartime delicacy&quot;. In addition to increasing production for the U.K., Hormel expanded Spam output as part of Allied aid to the Soviet Union. In his memoir &quot;Khrushchev Remembers&quot;, Nikita Khrushchev declared: &quot;Without Spam, we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to feed our army.&quot;

The billionth can of Spam was sold in 1959, and the eight billionth can was sold in 2012.

== International usage ==
=== United States and territories ===

Domestically, Spam&#x27;s chief advantages were affordability, accessibility, and extended shelf life. Statistics from the 1990s say that 3.8 cans of Spam were consumed every second in the United States, totaling nearly 122 million cans annually. It became part of the diet of almost 30% of American households, perceived differently in various regions of the country. It is also sometimes associated with economic hardship because of its relatively low cost.

After World War II, Spam changed roles in the U.S. from being the main protein source to being a side dish or ingredient used in items like sandwiches and eggs.

Spam that is sold in North America, South America, and Australia is produced in Austin, Minnesota (also known as &quot;Spam Town USA&quot;), and in Dubuque, Iowa. Austin, Minnesota also had a restaurant with a menu devoted exclusively to Spam called &quot;Johnny&#x27;s SPAMarama Menu&quot;.

==== Hawaii ====

Residents of the state of Hawaii have the highest per capita consumption in the United States, bringing in sales of 7 million cans of Spam per year. Its perception there is very different from that on the mainland. Hawaiians sometimes call it &quot;Portagee Steak&quot;.

A local dish in Hawaii is Spam musubi, in which cooked Spam is placed on top of rice and wrapped in a band of nori, a form of &quot;onigiri&quot; or riceball. Varieties of Spam are found in Hawaii and Saipan that are unavailable in other markets, including Honey Spam, and Hot and Spicy Spam.

Hawaiian Burger King restaurants began serving Spam in 2007 to compete with the local McDonald&#x27;s chains (which also serve Spam). In Hawaii, Spam is so popular that it is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Hawaiian Steak&quot;. There is even an annual Spam-themed festival on the island of Oahu each spring, known as the &quot;Waikiki Spam Jam&quot;. Local chefs and restaurants compete to create new Spam-themed dishes, which are then sold in a massive street fair on Kalakaua Avenue in Waikiki.

In 2017, Hawaii was plagued by a rash of thefts of Spam. Spam had long been a target of thieves in Hawaii, but the magnitude of the thefts ramped up, with incidents in which multiple cases of Spam were stolen at once. Local retailers believe organized crime was involved. This came alongside increases in thefts of some other retail goods, such as corned beef and liquor. The president of the retail merchants of Hawaii attributed the rise in retail thefts to a recent change in criminal law, which raised the threshold at which a theft would lead to felony charges by approximately $400.

==== Guam and the Northern Marianas ====
In Guam, the average per capita consumption is 16 tins (cans) per year. It is also found on McDonald&#x27;s menus there. The &quot;Spam Games&quot; also occur in Guam, where locals sample and honor the best original, homemade Spam recipes.

In the Northern Mariana Islands, lawyers from Hormel have threatened to sue the local press for publishing articles alleging ill effects of high Spam consumption on the health of the local population.

==== Puerto Rico ====
Sandwich de Mezcla is a party staple in Puerto Rico containing Spam, Velveeta, and pimientos (made into a spread) between two slices of sandwich bread.

=== Europe ===
==== United Kingdom ====
After World War II, Newforge Foods, part of the Fitch Lovell group, was awarded the license to produce the product in the U.K. at its Belle Vale factory, Liverpool, where it stayed until production switched to the Danish Crown Group (owners of the Tulip Food Company) in 1998.

The United Kingdom has adopted Spam into various recipes. For example, sliced, battered and deep-fried into Spam fritters.

=== Middle East ===
==== Israel ====
&quot;Loof&quot;, a canned corned beef product often featured in Israeli Defense Forces rations, was popularly known as &quot;kosher Spam&quot;, because it contains no pork.

===Asia===
==== Philippines ====
In the Philippines, Spam (currently distributed by the Purefoods-Hormel Company Inc.) is a popular food item seen as a cultural symbol. Spam reached the islands similarly as it did other former US colonies such as Hawaii and Guam: as a result of World War II rationing. Spam is commonly eaten with rice (usually garlic fried rice) and a sunny-side-up egg for breakfast. It is prepared and used in a variety of ways, including being fried, caramelized, served with condiments, or in sandwiches. It has also been featured in numerous Filipino fusion cuisine dishes, including Spam burgers, Spam spaghetti, and Spam nuggets.

The popularity of Spam in the Philippines transcends economic class, and the canned product is even given during holidays. There are at least ten different varieties of Spam currently available in the country, and an estimated 1.25 million kilos of the meat is sold every year in the Philippines. Its popularity among Filipinos has led to the creation of a version with sugar and annatto—Tocino-flavor Spam, made for the overseas Filipino market in the US and Canada. During the rescue efforts after Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) in 2009, Hormel Foods donated over 30,000 pounds of Spam to the Philippine National Red Cross.

==== China ====
In mainland China, Hormel decided to adopt a different strategy to market Spam (), promoting it as a foreign, premium food product and changing the Spam formula to be meatier to accommodate local Chinese tastes. Spam-like canned pork products are also produced by other food companies in China as &quot;luncheon meat&quot; ().

==== South Korea ====
Spam was exported to post-World War II Korea, whose population was on the brink of starvation. Spam returned to South Korea and was widely consumed during the Korean War. US soldiers deployed to South Korea used Spam as a means of trading for items, services, or information around their bases. Spam and other meats were smuggled out of US military installations for the local population. Its popularity led to the creation of the Spam &quot;kimbap&quot; (rice and vegetable filled seaweed roll) in Korean cuisine. Because of a scarcity of fish and other traditional kimbap products such as kimchi or fermented cabbage, Spam was added to a rice roll with kimchi and cucumber and wrapped in seaweed. Spam is also an original ingredient in &quot;budae jjigae&quot; (; ), a spicy stew with different types of preserved meat or kimchi.

In South Korea, Spam (, licensed from Hormel by CJ CheilJedang) is popular with a majority of the population. , South Korea produced and consumed more Spam than any other country except the United States. It is considered something of a luxury dish and is a common gift for Korean New Year combined with cooking oil and seasoning.

==== Hong Kong ====
After World War II, meat was scarce and expensive in Hong Kong, so Spam was an accessible, affordable alternative. The luncheon meat has been incorporated into dishes such as macaroni with fried egg and Spam in chicken soup, egg and Spam sandwiches, and instant ramen. Nowadays, Spam remains a staple in Hong Kong’s low to middle-income families. The can of meat can be regularly seen in cafes and small restaurants.

==== Japan ====
In Okinawa, Japan, the product is added into &quot;onigiri&quot; alongside eggs and used as a staple ingredient in the traditional Okinawan dish &quot;chanpurū&quot;, and a Spam burger is sold by local fast food chain Jef. For the 70th anniversary of Spam in 2007, cans with special designs were sold in Japan due to its popularity, primarily in Okinawa.
Following the March 2011 earthquake, Spam sales in Japan declined, and Hormel shifted its focus to China, although Hormel did pledge to donate $100,000 along with cans of Spam for relief efforts.

In early 2014, Burger King introduced the Spam and Cheese burger as a breakfast menu item.

== In popular culture ==

From July 1940 to March 1941, Spam sponsored George Burns and Gracie Allen on their radio program.

During World War II, Spam was not only eaten but was also incorporated into many other aspects of the war (grease for guns, cans for scrap metal, etc.); it was so prominent that Uncle Sam was nicknamed &quot;Uncle Spam&quot;. Other terms influenced by the product&#x27;s name include the European invasion fleet or the &quot;Spam Fleet&quot;. Furthermore, the United Service Organizations (USO) toured the &quot;Spam Circuit&quot;. In 1943, comedian Suzette Tarri appeared as the harassed waitress character &quot;Mrs Spam&quot; in the British film &quot;Somewhere in Civvies&quot;.

In the United States in the aftermath of World War II, a troupe of former servicewomen was assembled by Hormel Foods to promote Spam from coast to coast. The group was known as the Hormel Girls and associated the food with patriotism. In 1948, two years after its formation, the troupe had grown to 60 women, with 16 forming an orchestra. The show became a radio program where the main selling point was Spam. The Hormel Girls were disbanded in 1953.

Spam has long had a somewhat dubious reputation in the United States and (to a lesser degree) in the United Kingdom as a poverty food. The image of Spam as a low-cost meat product gave rise to the Scottish colloquial term &quot;Spam valley&quot; to describe certain affluent housing areas where residents have an outward appearance of wealth but, in private, may be living at poverty levels.

===Monty Python sketch and email spam===
Spam was featured in an iconic 1970 Monty Python sketch titled &quot;Spam&quot;, the concluding sketch of episode 12 of series 2 of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. Set in a greasy-spoon café, every dish on the menu contains Spam, such as &quot;egg and Spam&quot;, &quot;egg bacon and Spam&quot;, and &quot;Spam egg sausage and Spam&quot;, but many dishes contain mostly Spam, such as &quot;Spam egg Spam Spam bacon and Spam&quot;. A modified audio version of the sketch appeared on Monty Python&#x27;s 1972 LP &quot;Another Monty Python Record&quot;, and was also released as a 7&quot; single.

The sketch concluded with a chorus of Vikings boisterously singing a song – &quot;Lovely Spam, Wonderful Spam&quot;, which, by the 1990s, led to &quot;Spam&quot; being adopted as a term for unsolicited electronic messages, especially spam email, because in the song, the repeated singing of the word &quot;Spam&quot; drowns out all other communication.

Because Spam was mentioned in a song in &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, &quot;We dine well here in Camelot/We eat ham and jam and Spam a lot&quot;, the title of the musical version of the film became &quot;Spamalot&quot;.

===Continued cultural presence===
Spam is the subject of the &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic song &quot;Spam&quot;, which is a parody of the R.E.M. song &quot;Stand&quot;. Other offshoots of Spam in popular culture include a book of haikus about Spam titled &quot;Spam-Ku: Tranquil Reflections on Luncheon Loaf&quot;. There is also a mock Church of Spam and a Spam Cam, which is a webcam trained on a can of decaying Spam.

In 2017 the SPAM® brand team launched the boy band ALL4SPAM in the Philippines as part of a new advertisement campaign in the region.

Spam is referred to in &quot;Island of the Sequined Love Nun&quot; by Christopher Moore, where SPAM is explained as &quot;Shaped Pork Approximating Man&quot;, which was used to explain its popularity amongst Pacific Island Cannibals. In &quot;Top Gear: Polar Special&quot;, James May took a can of Spam to the magnetic North Pole and Jeremy Clarkson destroyed it with a shotgun.

Introduced in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and seen in later entries to the franchise, a common foodstuff item called &quot;Cram&quot;, a can of processed meat that serves as a parody of Spam, is used as a health regenerative item. The Pumpkin Spice Spam, introduced in September 2019, has gained the attention of the media and the public.

=== Spam celebrations ===


Spam is celebrated in Austin, Minnesota, home to the Spam Museum. The museum tells the history of the Hormel company, the origin of Spam, and its place in world culture.

Austin is also the location of the final judging in the national Spam recipe competition. Competing recipes are collected from winning submissions at the top 40 state fairs in the nation. The Spamettes are a quartet from Austin that only sing about Spam in parodies of popular songs. They first performed at the first Spam Jam in 1990 and continue to perform at various events.

Hawaii holds an annual Spam Jam in Waikiki during the last week of April. The small town of Shady Cove, Oregon, is home to the annual Spam Parade and Festival, with the city allocating US$1,500 for it.

Spamarama was a yearly festival from 1978 to 2007 in Austin, Texas, which had a peak attendance of 14,000. The themed events included a Spam cook-off (to contrast with Texas chili cook-offs) and the Spamalymplics, including a &quot;Spam toss&quot; and a Spamburger (a 12-ounce portion on a bun) eating contest. The event returned in 2019.

On August 8, 2021, L&amp;L Hawaiian Barbecue established &quot;National SPAM Musubi Day&quot; to celebrate the iconic snack from Hawaii. The celebration also happened on August 8, 2022, and has since become an annual celebration.

== Nutritional data ==
The ingredients of Spam vary according to variety and market; those of variety &quot;Spam Classic&quot; are pork with ham, salt, water, modified potato starch, sugar, and sodium nitrite. Sodium nitrite is a common preservative used in highly processed meat products. Excessive consumption has been linked to many health issues. 

== Varieties ==
The official Spam website lists numerous different flavors of Spam products. In addition to the variety of flavors, Spam is sold in tins smaller than the standard twelve-ounce (340 g) size. Spam Singles are also available, which are single sandwich-sized slices of Spam Classic or Lite, sealed in retort pouches.

<text>Spamming is the use of messaging systems to send multiple unsolicited messages (spam) to large numbers of recipients for the purpose of commercial advertising, non-commercial proselytizing, or any prohibited purpose (especially phishing), or simply repeatedly sending the same message to the same user. While the most widely recognized form of spam is email spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media: instant messaging spam, Usenet newsgroup spam, Web search engine spam, spam in blogs, wiki spam, online classified ads spam, mobile phone messaging spam, Internet forum spam, junk fax transmissions, social spam, spam mobile apps, television advertising and file sharing spam. It is named after Spam, a luncheon meat, by way of a Monty Python sketch about a restaurant that has Spam in almost every dish in which Vikings annoyingly sing &quot;Spam&quot; repeatedly.

Spamming remains economically viable because advertisers have no operating costs beyond the management of their mailing lists, servers, infrastructures, IP ranges, and domain names, and it is difficult to hold senders accountable for their mass mailings. The costs, such as lost productivity and fraud, are borne by the public and by Internet service providers, which have added extra capacity to cope with the volume. Spamming has been the subject of legislation in many jurisdictions.

A person who creates spam is called a &quot;spammer&quot;.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;spam&quot; is derived from the 1970 &quot;Spam&quot; sketch of the BBC sketch comedy television series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;. The sketch, set in a cafe, has a waitress reading out a menu where every item but one includes the Spam canned luncheon meat. As the waitress recites the Spam-filled menu, a chorus of Viking patrons drown out all conversations with a song, repeating &quot;Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam… Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!&quot;.

In the 1980s the term was adopted to describe certain abusive users who frequented BBSs and MUDs, who would repeat &quot;Spam&quot; a huge number of times to scroll other users&#x27; text off the screen. In early chat-room services like PeopleLink and the early days of Online America (later known as America Online or AOL), they actually flooded the screen with quotes from the Monty Python sketch. This was used as a tactic by insiders of a group that wanted to drive newcomers out of the room so the usual conversation could continue. It was also used to prevent members of rival groups from chatting—for instance, &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans often invaded &quot;Star Trek&quot; chat rooms, filling the space with blocks of text until the &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans left.

It later came to be used on Usenet to mean excessive multiple posting—the repeated posting of the same message. The unwanted message would appear in many, if not all newsgroups, just as Spam appeared in all the menu items in the Monty Python sketch. One of the earliest people to use &quot;spam&quot; in this sense was Joel Furr. This use had also become established—to &quot;spam&quot; Usenet was to flood newsgroups with junk messages. The word was also attributed to the flood of &quot;Make Money Fast&quot; messages that clogged many newsgroups during the 1990s. In 1998, the New Oxford Dictionary of English, which had previously only defined &quot;spam&quot; in relation to the trademarked food product, added a second definition to its entry for &quot;spam&quot;: &quot;Irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent on the Internet to a large number of newsgroups or users.&quot;

There was also an effort to differentiate between types of newsgroup spam. Messages that were crossposted to too many newsgroups at once, as opposed to those that were posted too frequently, were called &quot;velveeta&quot; (after a cheese product), but this term did not persist.

==History==

===Pre-Internet===
In the late 19th century, Western Union allowed telegraphic messages on its network to be sent to multiple destinations. The first recorded instance of a mass unsolicited commercial telegram is from May 1864, when some British politicians received an unsolicited telegram advertising a dentist.

===History===
The earliest documented spam (although the term had not yet been coined) was a message advertising the availability of a new model of Digital Equipment Corporation computers sent by Gary Thuerk to 393 recipients on ARPANET on May 3, 1978. Rather than send a separate message to each person, which was the standard practice at the time, he had an assistant, Carl Gartley, write a single mass email. Reaction from the net community was fiercely negative, but the spam did generate some sales.

Spamming had been practiced as a prank by participants in multi-user dungeon games, to fill their rivals&#x27; accounts with unwanted electronic junk.

The first major commercial spam incident started on March 5, 1994, when a husband and wife team of lawyers, Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel, began using bulk Usenet posting to advertise immigration law services. The incident was commonly termed the &quot;Green Card spam&quot;, after the subject line of the postings. Defiant in the face of widespread condemnation, the attorneys claimed their detractors were hypocrites or &quot;zealots&quot;, claimed they had a free speech right to send unwanted commercial messages, and labeled their opponents &quot;anti-commerce radicals&quot;. The couple wrote a controversial book entitled &quot;How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway&quot;.

An early example of nonprofit fundraising bulk posting via Usenet also occurred in 1994 on behalf of CitiHope, an NGO attempting to raise funds to rescue children at risk during the Bosnian War. However, as it was a violation of their terms of service, the ISP Panix deleted all of the bulk posts from Usenet, only missing three copies.

Within a few years, the focus of spamming (and anti-spam efforts) moved chiefly to email, where it remains today. By 1999, Khan C. Smith, a well known hacker at the time, had begun to commercialize the bulk email industry and rallied thousands into the business by building more friendly bulk email software and providing internet access illegally hacked from major ISPs such as Earthlink and Botnets.

By 2009 the majority of spam sent around the World was in the English language; spammers began using automatic translation services to send spam in other languages.

==In different media==

===Email===

Email spam, also known as unsolicited bulk email (UBE), or junk mail, is the practice of sending unwanted email messages, frequently with commercial content, in large quantities. Spam in email started to become a problem when the Internet was opened for commercial use in the mid-1990s. It grew exponentially over the following years, and by 2007 it constituted about 80% to 85% of all e-mail, by a conservative estimate. Pressure to make email spam illegal has resulted in legislation in some jurisdictions, but less so in others. The efforts taken by governing bodies, security systems and email service providers seem to be helping to reduce the volume of email spam. According to &quot;2014 Internet Security Threat Report, Volume 19&quot; published by Symantec Corporation, spam volume dropped to 66% of all email traffic.

An industry of email address harvesting is dedicated to collecting email addresses and selling compiled databases. Some of these address-harvesting approaches rely on users not reading the fine print of agreements, resulting in their agreeing to send messages indiscriminately to their contacts. This is a common approach in social networking spam such as that generated by the social networking site Quechup.

===Instant messaging===
Instant messaging spam makes use of instant messaging systems. Although less prevalent than its e-mail counterpart, according to a report from Ferris Research, 500 million spam IMs were sent in 2003, twice the level of 2002.

===Newsgroup and forum===
Newsgroup spam is a type of spam where the targets are Usenet newsgroups. Spamming of Usenet newsgroups actually pre-dates e-mail spam. Usenet convention defines spamming as excessive multiple posting, that is, the repeated posting of a message (or substantially similar messages). The prevalence of Usenet spam led to the development of the Breidbart Index as an objective measure of a message&#x27;s &quot;spamminess&quot;.

Forum spam is the creation of advertising messages on Internet forums. It is generally done by automated spambots. Most forum spam consists of links to external sites, with the dual goals of increasing search engine visibility in highly competitive areas such as weight loss, pharmaceuticals, gambling, pornography, real estate or loans, and generating more traffic for these commercial websites. Some of these links contain code to track the spambot&#x27;s identity; if a sale goes through, the spammer behind the spambot earns a commission.

===Mobile phone===
Mobile phone spam is directed at the text messaging service of a mobile phone. This can be especially irritating to customers not only for the inconvenience, but also because of the fee they may be charged per text message received in some markets.
To comply with CAN-SPAM regulations in the US, SMS messages now must provide options of HELP and STOP, the latter to end communication with the advertiser via SMS altogether.

Despite the high number of phone users, there has not been so much phone spam, because there is a charge for sending SMS. Recently, there are also observations of mobile phone spam delivered via browser push notifications. These can be a result of allowing websites which are malicious or delivering malicious ads to send a user notifications.

===Social networking spam===

Facebook and Twitter are not immune to messages containing spam links. Spammers hack into accounts and send false links under the guise of a user&#x27;s trusted contacts such as friends and family. As for Twitter, spammers gain credibility by following verified accounts such as that of Lady Gaga; when that account owner follows the spammer back, it legitimizes the spammer.
Twitter has studied what interest structures allow their users to receive interesting tweets and avoid spam, despite the site using the broadcast model, in which all tweets from a user are broadcast to all followers of the user. Spammers, out of malicious intent, post either unwanted (or irrelevant) information or spread misinformation on social media platforms.

===Social spam===
Spreading beyond the centrally managed social networking platforms, user-generated content increasingly appears on business, government, and nonprofit websites worldwide. Fake accounts and comments planted by computers programmed to issue social spam can infiltrate these websites.

===Blog, wiki, and guestbook===

Blog spam is spamming on weblogs. In 2003, this type of spam took advantage of the open nature of comments in the blogging software Movable Type by repeatedly placing comments to various blog posts that provided nothing more than a link to the spammer&#x27;s commercial web site.
Similar attacks are often performed against wikis and guestbooks, both of which accept user contributions.
Another possible form of spam in blogs is the spamming of a certain tag on websites such as Tumblr.

===Spam targeting video sharing sites===
In actual video spam, the uploaded video is given a name and description with a popular figure or event that is likely to draw attention, or within the video a certain image is timed to come up as the video&#x27;s thumbnail image to mislead the viewer, such as a still image from a feature film, purporting to be a part-by-part piece of a movie being pirated, e.g. &quot;Big Buck Bunny Full Movie Online - Part 1/10 HD&quot;, a link to a supposed keygen, trainer, ISO file for a video game, or something similar. The actual content of the video ends up being totally unrelated, a Rickroll, offensive, or simply on-screen text of a link to the site being promoted. In some cases, the link in question may lead to an online survey site, a password-protected archive file with instructions leading to the aforementioned survey (though the survey, and the archive file itself, is worthless and does not contain the file in question at all), or in extreme cases, malware. Others may upload videos presented in an infomercial-like format selling their product which feature actors and paid testimonials, though the promoted product or service is of dubious quality and would likely not pass the scrutiny of a standards and practices department at a television station or cable network.

===VoIP Spam===

VoIP spam is VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) spam, usually using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). This is nearly identical to telemarketing calls over traditional phone lines. When the user chooses to receive the spam call, a pre-recorded spam message or advertisement is usually played back. This is generally easier for the spammer as VoIP services are cheap and easy to anonymize over the Internet, and there are many options for sending mass number of calls from a single location. Accounts or IP addresses being used for VoIP spam can usually be identified by a large number of outgoing calls, low call completion and short call length.

===Academic search===
Academic search engines enable researchers to find academic literature and are used to obtain citation data for calculating author-level metrics. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and OvGU demonstrated that most (web-based) academic search engines, especially Google Scholar are not capable of identifying spam attacks. The researchers manipulated the citation counts of articles, and managed to make Google Scholar index complete fake articles, some containing advertising.

===Mobile apps===
Spamming in mobile app stores include (i) apps that were automatically generated and as a result do not have any specific functionality or a meaningful description; (ii) multiple instances of the same app being published to obtain increased visibility in the app market; and (iii) apps that make excessive use of unrelated keywords to attract users through unintended searches.

=== Bluetooth ===
Bluespam, or the action of sending spam to Bluetooth-enabled devices, is another form of spam that has developed in recent years.

==Noncommercial forms==
E-mail and other forms of spamming have been used for purposes other than advertisements. Many early Usenet spams were religious or political. Serdar Argic, for instance, spammed Usenet with historical revisionist screeds. A number of evangelists have spammed Usenet and e-mail media with preaching messages. A growing number of criminals are also using spam to perpetrate various sorts of fraud.

==Geographical origins==
In 2011 the origins of spam were analyzed by Cisco Systems. They provided a report that shows spam volume originating from countries worldwide.

==Trademark issues==
Hormel Foods Corporation, the maker of SPAM luncheon meat, does not object to the Internet use of the term &quot;spamming&quot;. However, they did ask that the capitalized word &quot;Spam&quot; be reserved to refer to their product and trademark.

==Cost–benefit analyses==
The European Union&#x27;s Internal Market Commission estimated in 2001 that &quot;junk email&quot; cost Internet users €10 billion per year worldwide. The California legislature found that spam cost United States organizations alone more than $13 billion in 2007, including lost productivity and the additional equipment, software, and manpower needed to combat the problem. Spam&#x27;s direct effects include the consumption of computer and network resources, and the cost in human time and attention of dismissing unwanted messages. Large companies who are frequent spam targets utilize numerous techniques to detect and prevent spam.

The cost to providers of search engines is significant: &quot;The secondary consequence of spamming is that search engine indexes are inundated with useless pages, increasing the cost of each processed query&quot;. The costs of spam also include the collateral costs of the struggle between spammers and the administrators and users of the media threatened by spamming.

Email spam exemplifies a tragedy of the commons: spammers use resources (both physical and human), without bearing the entire cost of those resources. In fact, spammers commonly do not bear the cost at all. This raises the costs for everyone. In some ways spam is even a potential threat to the entire email system, as operated in the past. Since email is so cheap to send, a tiny number of spammers can saturate the Internet with junk mail. Although only a tiny percentage of their targets are motivated to purchase their products (or fall victim to their scams), the low cost may provide a sufficient conversion rate to keep the spamming alive. Furthermore, even though spam appears not to be economically viable as a way for a reputable company to do business, it suffices for professional spammers to convince a tiny proportion of gullible advertisers that it is viable for those spammers to stay in business. Finally, new spammers go into business every day, and the low costs allow a single spammer to do a lot of harm before finally realizing that the business is not profitable.

Some companies and groups &quot;rank&quot; spammers; spammers who make the news are sometimes referred to by these rankings.

===General costs===
In all cases listed above, including both commercial and non-commercial, &quot;spam happens&quot; because of a positive cost–benefit analysis result; if the cost to recipients is excluded as an externality the spammer can avoid paying.

Cost is the combination of:
* Overhead: The costs and overhead of electronic spamming include bandwidth, developing or acquiring an email/wiki/blog spam tool, taking over or acquiring a host/zombie, etc.
* Transaction cost: The incremental cost of contacting each additional recipient once a method of spamming is constructed, multiplied by the number of recipients (see CAPTCHA as a method of increasing transaction costs).
* Risks: Chance and severity of legal and/or public reactions, including damages and punitive damages.
* Damage: Impact on the community and/or communication channels being spammed (see Newsgroup spam).

Benefit is the total expected profit from spam, which may include any combination of the commercial and non-commercial reasons listed above. It is normally linear, based on the incremental benefit of reaching each additional spam recipient, combined with the conversion rate. The conversion rate for botnet-generated spam has recently been measured to be around one in 12,000,000 for pharmaceutical spam and one in 200,000 for infection sites as used by the Storm botnet. The authors of the study calculating those conversion rates noted, &quot;After 26 days, and almost 350 million e-mail messages, only 28 sales resulted.&quot;

==In crime==
Spam can be used to spread computer viruses, trojan horses, or other malicious software. The objective may be identity theft, or worse (e.g., advance fee fraud). Some spam attempts to capitalize on human greed, while some attempts to take advantage of the victims&#x27; inexperience with computer technology to trick them (e.g., phishing).

One of the world&#x27;s most prolific spammers, Robert Alan Soloway, was arrested by US authorities on May 31, 2007. Described as one of the top ten spammers in the world, Soloway was charged with 35 criminal counts, including mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, and money laundering. Prosecutors allege that Soloway used millions of &quot;zombie&quot; computers to distribute spam during 2003. This is the first case in which US prosecutors used identity theft laws to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else&#x27;s Internet domain name.

In an attempt to assess potential legal and technical strategies for stopping illegal spam, a study cataloged three months of online spam data and researched website naming and hosting infrastructures. The study concluded that: 1) half of all spam programs have their domains and servers distributed over just eight percent or fewer of the total available hosting registrars and autonomous systems, with 80 percent of spam programs overall being distributed over just 20 percent of all registrars and autonomous systems; 2) of the 76 purchases for which the researchers received transaction information, there were only 13 distinct banks acting as credit card acquirers and only three banks provided the payment servicing for 95 percent of the spam-advertised goods in the study; and, 3) a &quot;financial blacklist&quot; of banking entities that do business with spammers would dramatically reduce monetization of unwanted e-mails. Moreover, this blacklist could be updated far more rapidly than spammers could acquire new banking resources, an asymmetry favoring anti-spam efforts.

==Political issues==
An ongoing concern expressed by parties such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union has to do with so-called &quot;stealth blocking&quot;, a term for ISPs employing aggressive spam blocking without their users&#x27; knowledge. These groups&#x27; concern is that ISPs or technicians seeking to reduce spam-related costs may select tools that (either through error or design) also block non-spam e-mail from sites seen as &quot;spam-friendly&quot;. Few object to the existence of these tools; it is their use in filtering the mail of users who are not informed of their use that draws fire.

Even though it is possible in some jurisdictions to treat some spam as unlawful merely by applying existing laws against trespass and conversion, some laws specifically targeting spam have been proposed. In 2004, United States passed the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 that provided ISPs with tools to combat spam. This act allowed Yahoo! to successfully sue Eric Head who settled the lawsuit for several thousand U.S. dollars in June 2004. But the law is criticized by many for not being effective enough. Indeed, the law was supported by some spammers and organizations that support spamming, and opposed by many in the anti-spam community.

==Court cases==
===United States===
Earthlink won a $25 million judgment against one of the most notorious and active &quot;spammers&quot; Khan C. Smith in 2001 for his role in founding the modern spam industry which dealt billions in economic damage and established thousands of spammers into the industry. His email efforts were said to make up more than a third of all Internet email being sent from 1999 until 2002.

Sanford Wallace and Cyber Promotions were the target of a string of lawsuits, many of which were settled out of court, up through a 1998 Earthlink settlement that put Cyber Promotions out of business. Attorney Laurence Canter was disbarred by the Tennessee Supreme Court in 1997 for sending prodigious amounts of spam advertising his immigration law practice. In 2005, Jason Smathers, a former America Online employee, pleaded guilty to charges of violating the CAN-SPAM Act. In 2003, he sold a list of approximately 93 million AOL subscriber e-mail addresses to Sean Dunaway who sold the list to spammers.

In 2007, Robert Soloway lost a case in a federal court against the operator of a small Oklahoma-based Internet service provider who accused him of spamming. U.S. Judge Ralph G. Thompson granted a motion by plaintiff Robert Braver for a default judgment and permanent injunction against him. The judgment includes a statutory damages award of about $10 million under Oklahoma law.

In June 2007, two men were convicted of eight counts stemming from sending millions of e-mail spam messages that included hardcore pornographic images. Jeffrey A. Kilbride, 41, of Venice, California was sentenced to six years in prison, and James R. Schaffer, 41, of Paradise Valley, Arizona, was sentenced to 63 months. In addition, the two were fined $100,000, ordered to pay $77,500 in restitution to AOL, and ordered to forfeit more than $1.1 million, the amount of illegal proceeds from their spamming operation. The charges included conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, and transportation of obscene materials. The trial, which began on June 5, was the first to include charges under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, according to a release from the Department of Justice. The specific law that prosecutors used under the CAN-Spam Act was designed to crack down on the transmission of pornography in spam.

In 2005, Scott J. Filary and Donald E. Townsend of Tampa, Florida were sued by Florida Attorney General Charlie Crist for violating the Florida Electronic Mail Communications Act. The two spammers were required to pay $50,000 USD to cover the costs of investigation by the state of Florida, and a $1.1 million penalty if spamming were to continue, the $50,000 was not paid, or the financial statements provided were found to be inaccurate. The spamming operation was successfully shut down.

Edna Fiedler of Olympia, Washington, on June 25, 2008, pleaded guilty in a Tacoma court and was sentenced to two years imprisonment and five years of supervised release or probation in an Internet $1 million &quot;Nigerian check scam.&quot; She conspired to commit bank, wire and mail fraud, against US citizens, specifically using Internet by having had an accomplice who shipped counterfeit checks and money orders to her from Lagos, Nigeria, the previous November. Fiedler shipped out $609,000 fake check and money orders when arrested and prepared to send additional $1.1 million counterfeit materials. Also, the U.S. Postal Service recently intercepted counterfeit checks, lottery tickets and eBay overpayment schemes with a value of $2.1 billion.

In a 2009 opinion, &quot;Gordon v. Virtumundo, Inc.&quot;, 575 F.3d 1040, the Ninth Circuit assessed the standing requirements necessary for a private plaintiff to bring a civil cause of action against spam senders under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as well as the scope of the CAN-SPAM Act&#x27;s federal preemption clause.

===United Kingdom===
In the first successful case of its kind, Nigel Roberts from the Channel Islands won £270 against Media Logistics UK who sent junk e-mails to his personal account.

In January 2007, a Sheriff Court in Scotland awarded Mr. Gordon Dick £750 (the then maximum sum that could be awarded in a Small Claim action) plus expenses of £618.66, a total of £1368.66 against Transcom Internet Services Ltd. for breaching anti-spam laws. Transcom had been legally represented at earlier hearings, but were not represented at the proof, so Gordon Dick got his decree by default. It is the largest amount awarded in compensation in the United Kingdom since Roberts v Media Logistics case in 2005.

Despite the statutory tort that is created by the Regulations implementing the EC Directive, few other people have followed their example. As the Courts engage in active case management, such cases would probably now be expected to be settled by mediation and payment of nominal damages.

===New Zealand===
In October 2008, an international internet spam operation run from New Zealand was cited by American authorities as one of the world&#x27;s largest, and for a time responsible for up to a third of all unwanted e-mails. In a statement the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) named Christchurch&#x27;s Lance Atkinson as one of the principals of the operation. New Zealand&#x27;s Internal Affairs announced it had lodged a $200,000 claim in the High Court against Atkinson and his brother Shane Atkinson and courier Roland Smits, after raids in Christchurch. This marked the first prosecution since the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act (UEMA) was passed in September 2007.
The FTC said it had received more than three million complaints about spam messages connected to this operation, and estimated that it may be responsible for sending billions of illegal spam messages. The US District Court froze the defendants&#x27; assets to preserve them for consumer redress pending trial.
U.S. co-defendant Jody Smith forfeited more than $800,000 and faces up to five years in prison for charges to which he pleaded guilty.

===Bulgaria===

Bulgaria allows spam messages as long as the message is clearly marked as spam according to the Bulgarian E-Commerce act. Spam messages can&#x27;t be sent if the user opts out of them. When a user opts out of a message, their e-mail gets stored in a public registry. Companies sending spam messages to users registered in the registry have to pay a fine. Under the ECA, spam messages can&#x27;t be sent if the address of the spam message is invalid or the user identity is unknown. 

This made lawsuits against Bulgarian ISP&#x27;s and public e-mail providers with antispam policy possible, as they are obstructing legal commerce activity and thus violate Bulgarian antitrust acts. While there are no such lawsuits until now, several cases of spam obstruction are currently awaiting decision in the Bulgarian Antitrust Commission (Комисия за защита на конкуренцията) and can end with serious fines for the ISPs in question.

The law contains other dubious provisions — for example, the creation of a nationwide public electronic register of e-mail addresses that do not want to receive spam. It is usually abused as the perfect source for e-mail address harvesting, because publishing invalid or incorrect information in such a register is a criminal offense in Bulgaria.
