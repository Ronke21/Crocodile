<text>Pope Honorius II (9 February 1060 – 13 February 1130), born Lamberto Scannabecchi, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 21 December 1124 to his death in 1130.

Although from a humble background, his obvious intellect and outstanding abilities saw him promoted up through the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Attached to the Frangipani family of Rome, his election as pope was contested by a rival candidate, Celestine II, and force was used to guarantee his election.

Honorius&#x27;s pontificate was concerned with ensuring that the privileges the Roman Catholic Church had obtained through the Concordat of Worms were preserved and, if possible, extended. He was the first pope to confirm the election of the Holy Roman emperor. Distrustful of the traditional Benedictine order, he favoured new monastic orders, such as the Augustinians and the Cistercians, and sought to exercise more control over the larger monastic centres of Monte Cassino and Cluny Abbey. He also approved the new military order of the Knights Templar in 1128.

Honorius II failed to prevent Roger II of Sicily from extending his power in southern Italy and was unable to stop Louis VI of France from interfering in the affairs of the French church. Like his predecessors, he managed the wide-ranging affairs of the church through Papal Legates. With his death in 1130, the Church was again thrown into confusion with the election of two rival popes, Innocent II and the antipope Anacletus II.

==Early life==

Lamberto was of simple rural origins, hailing from Fiagnano in the Casalfiumanese commune, near Imola in present-day Italy. Entering into an ecclesiastical career, he soon became archdeacon of Bologna, where his abilities eventually saw him attract the attention of Pope Urban II, who presumably appointed him cardinal priest of an unknown church, in c. 1099, though S. Prassede has been discussed. His successor, Pope Paschal II, made Lamberto a Canon of the Lateran before elevating him to the position of cardinal bishop of Ostia in 1117. Lamberto was one of the cardinals who accompanied Pope Gelasius II into exile in 1118–19 and was at his bedside when Gelasius died.

With Gelasius&#x27;s death at Cluny on 28 January 1119, Cardinal Lamberto and Cardinal Cono (Bishop of Palestrina) conducted the election of a new pope according to the canons. Cardinal Lamberto carried out the coronation of Guy de Bourgogne at Vienne on 9 February 1119, and became a close advisor of Pope Callixtus II. Accompanying Callixtus throughout France, he assisted Callixtus in his initial dealings with Holy Roman Emperor Henry V. As a well-known opponent of the emperor&#x27;s right to select bishops in his territories (the Investiture Controversy), Lamberto was a natural choice for papal legate. He was sent in 1119 to deal with Henry V and delegated with powers to come to an understanding concerning the right of investiture.

Forceful and determined, he summoned the bishops of the Holy Roman Empire to attend an assembly at Mainz on 8 September 1122. He expected absolute obedience, so much so that it took the mediation of Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz to prevent the suspension of Saint Otto of Bamberg for non-attendance. The struggle came to a conclusion with the Concordat of Worms in 1122 and the &quot;Pactum Calixtinum&quot; that was almost entirely due to Lamberto&#x27;s efforts was effected on 23 September 1123.

==Pontificate==

===Conclave of 1124===
Pressures building within the Curia, together with ongoing conflicts among the Roman nobility, would erupt after the death of Callixtus II in 1124. The pontificates of Urban II and Paschal II saw an expansion in the College of Cardinals of Italian clerics that strengthened the local Roman influence. These cardinals were reluctant to meet with the batch of cardinals recently promoted by Callixtus II, who were mainly French or Burgundian. As far as the older cardinals were concerned, these newer cardinals were dangerous innovators, and they were determined to resist their increasing influence. The northern cardinals, led by Cardinal Aymeric de Bourgogne (the Papal Chancellor), were equally determined to ensure that the elected pope would be one of their candidates. Both groups looked towards the great Roman families for support.
By 1124, there were two great factions dominating local politics in Rome: the Frangipani family, which controlled the region around the fortified Colosseum and supported the northern cardinals, and the Pierleoni family, which controlled the Tiber Island and the fortress of the Theatre of Marcellus and supported the Italian cardinals. With Callixtus II&#x27;s death on 13 December 1124, both families agreed that the election of the next pope should be in three days time, in accordance with the church canons. The Frangipani, led by Leo Frangipani, pushed for the delay in order that they could promote their preferred candidate, Lamberto, but the people were eager to see Saxo de Anagni, the Cardinal-Priest of San Stefano in Celiomonte elected as the next pope. Leo, eager to ensure a valid election, approached key members of every Cardinal&#x27;s entourage, promising each one that he would support their master when the voting for the election was underway.

On 16 December, all the Cardinals, including Lamberto, assembled in the chapel of the monastery of St. Pancratius attached to the south of the Lateran basilica. There, at the suggestion of Jonathas, the cardinal-deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano, who was a partisan of the Pierleoni family, the Cardinals unanimously elected as Pope the Cardinal-Priest of Sant&#x27;Anastasia, Theobaldo Boccapecci, who took the name Celestine II. He had only just put on the red mantle and the &quot;Te Deum&quot; was being sung when an armed party of Frangipani supporters (in a move pre-arranged with Cardinal Aymeric) burst in, attacked the newly enthroned Celestine, who was wounded, and acclaimed Lamberto as Pope. Since Celestine had not been formally consecrated pope, the wounded candidate declared himself willing to resign, but the Pierleoni family and their supporters refused to accept Lamberto, who in the confusion had been proclaimed Pope under the name Honorius II.

Rome descended into factional infighting, while Cardinal Aymeric and Leo Frangipani attempted to win over the resistance of Urban, the City Prefect, and the Pierleoni family with bribes and extravagant promises. Eventually, Celestine&#x27;s supporters abandoned him, leaving Honorius the only contender for the papal throne. Honorius, unwilling to accept the throne in such a manner, resigned his position before all of the assembled Cardinals, but was immediately and unanimously re-elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124.

==Papacy==

===Relations with the Holy Roman Empire===

Honorius immediately came into conflict with Emperor Henry V over imperial claims in Italy. In 1116, Henry had crossed the Alps to lay claim to the Italian territories of Matilda of Tuscany, which she had supposedly left to the papacy on her death. Henry had immediately begun appointing imperial vicars throughout the newly acquired province over the objections of both the Tuscan cities and the papacy. To maintain papal claims to Tuscany, Honorius appointed Albert, a papal marquis, to rule in the pope&#x27;s name in opposition to the imperial Margrave of Tuscany, Conrad von Scheiern. In addition, Henry V made very little effort to implement the terms of the Concordant of Worms, to Honorius II&#x27;s irritation. Local churches were forced to appeal to Rome to obtain restitution from the imperial bishops who had taken advantage of the Investiture Controversy to obtain property for their own benefit, as the Emperor turned a blind eye.
The death of Emperor Henry V on 23 May 1125 put an end to these squabbles, but soon Honorius was involved in a new power struggle in the Holy Roman Empire. Henry died childless and had nominated his nephew Frederick Hohenstaufen, Duke of Swabia, to succeed him as King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperor. Of the German princes, the ecclesiastical faction was against any expansion of Hohenstaufen power, and they were determined to ensure that Frederick would not succeed Henry. Led by Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz, the archchancellor of the empire, and under the watchful gaze of two papal legates, Cardinals Gherardo and Romano, the clerical and lay nobles of the empire elected Lothair of Supplinburg, Duke of Saxony. At Lothair&#x27;s request, Cardinal Gherardo and two bishops then sent word to Rome to obtain Honorius&#x27;s confirmation of the election, which he granted. This was a coup for Honorius, as such a confirmation had never occurred before, and around July 1126 Honorius invited Lothair to Rome to obtain the imperial title. Lothair was keen to keep Honorius on his side, keeping to the terms of the Concordat of Worms by not attending episcopal elections, agreeing that the investiture should only occur after the bishop&#x27;s consecration, and that the oath of homage be replaced with an oath of fidelity.

Lothair was unable to visit Rome immediately as Germany was rocked by the rebellion of the Hohenstaufen brothers, with Conrad Hohenstaufen elected anti-king in December 1127, followed by his descent into Italy and his crowning as King of Italy at Monza on 29 July 1128. The German bishops, again led by Adalbert of Mainz, excommunicated Conrad, an act that was confirmed by Honorius in a synod held in Rome at Easter (22 April 1128). Honorius also sent Cardinal John of Crema to Pisa to hold another synod that excommunicated Archbishop Anselm of Milan, who had crowned Conrad king. Conrad found little help in Italy and with Honorius&#x27;s support, Lothair was able to keep his throne.

One of the key ecclesiastical advisors of Lothair III was Saint Norbert of Xanten, who travelled to Rome in early 1126 to seek the formal sanction from Honorius to establish a new monastic order, the Premonstratensian Order (also known as the Norbertines), which Honorius agreed to do.

===Concerns in Campania===
One of Honorius&#x27;s first tasks in southern Italy was to deal with the barons in the Campania who were molesting farmers and travellers at will with their armed bands. In 1125, papal force brought to heel the lords of Ceccano. Papal armies took possession of various towns, including Maenza, Roccasecca and Trevi nel Lazio. In 1128, Honorius&#x27;s forces successfully captured the town of Segni, which was also held by a local baron who died during its capture. Honorius, however, was most concerned about the former papal stronghold at Fumone, which the nobles, who held it in the pope&#x27;s name, had decided to keep possession of. The town fell in July 1125 after a siege of ten weeks. When Honorius took possession of Fumone, he returned it, after taking safeguards, to its rebellious custodians and ordered that the Antipope Gregory VIII be transferred there from his previous lodgings at Monte Cassino. With that, Honorius turned his attention to the powerful and independent-minded abbot of Monte Cassino, Oderisio di Sangro.

Honorius had a long-standing dislike of Oderisio going back to the time when Honorius was cardinal-bishop of Ostia. Honorius had asked for permission from the abbot to allow him and his entourage permission to stay in the church of Santa Maria in Pallara, which was a traditional privilege belonging to the bishops of Ostia. Oderisio refused, and Honorius never forgot the insult. These bad feelings were compounded in 1125, when Oderisio refused a request from Pope Honorius for some financial assistance after he had been enthroned. Oderisio also mocked Honorius&#x27;s peasant background behind his back.

Using reports that the abbot had been lining his own pockets rather than spending it on his monastery, Honorius publicly denounced Oderisio, calling him a soldier and a thief, not a monk. When Atenulf, count of Aquino, brought accusations that Oderisio was aiming for the papacy, Honorius summoned Oderisio to Rome to answer the charges. Three times Oderisio refused to answer the summons and so during Lent of 1126, Honorius deposed the abbot. Oderisio refused to accept the deposition and continued to act as abbot, forcing Honorius to excommunicate him. Oderisio fortified the monastery, as the people of the town of Cassino forcibly entered the monastery, and after an armed struggle forced the monks to declare Oderisio deposed and to elect another abbot in his place. The monks elected Niccolo, the dean of the monastery.

Determined to bring the Benedictines to heel, Honorius insisted that the election of Niccolo was uncanonical, and demanded that Seniorectus, the provost of the monastery at Capua, be elected as abbot, to the fury of the Monte Cassino monks. In the meantime, open warfare was being waged between the supporters of Oderisio and Niccolo. Eventually, however, Honorius was able to secure not only the resignation of Oderisio, but he also excommunicated Niccolo for good measure. He reassured the monks of his intentions, and in September 1127, he personally installed Seniorectus as abbot. Honorius also insisted that the monks take an oath of fidelity to the papacy, but they strenuously objected.

===Conflict with Roger II of Sicily===

Matters to the south of Monte Cassino soon occupied Honorius&#x27;s attention. In July 1127, William II, Duke of Apulia, died childless, and almost immediately his cousin King Roger II of Sicily sailed to the mainland to occupy the duchies of Apulia and Calabria. Roger claimed that William had nominated him his heir, while Honorius stated that William had left his territory to the Holy See. Honorius had just suffered a defeat at the hands of a local baron at Arpino in 1127 when Honorius received word that Roger had landed in Italy. He rushed to Benevento to prevent the local Normans from reaching an agreement with Roger. Roger in the meantime had rapidly overrun the duchy of Apulia and had sent Honorius lavish gifts, asking the Pope to recognise him as the new duke and promising to hand over Troia and Montefusco in exchange. Honorius, fearing the expansion of Norman power to the south under one dominating ruler, threatened to excommunicate Roger if he persisted. In the meantime, many of the local Norman nobles, fearful of Roger&#x27;s power, allied themselves with Honorius, as Honorius formally excommunicated Roger in November 1127. Roger left his armies threatening Benevento, while he returned to Sicily for reinforcements. Honorius in the meantime entered into an alliance with the new Prince of Capua, Robert II. On 30 December 1127, Honorius preached a crusade against Roger II after having anointed Robert as Prince of Capua.

Roger returned in May 1128 and continued to harass papal strongholds while avoiding any direct confrontation with Honorius&#x27;s forces. In July 1128, the two armies came in contact with each other on the banks of the Bradano, but Roger refused to engage, believing that the papal armies would soon fall apart, and soon enough some of the Pope&#x27;s allies began deserting to Roger. Trying to salvage something of the situation, Honorius sent his trusted advisor Cardinal Aymeric together with Cencio II Frangipane to negotiate with Roger secretly. Honorius agreed to invest Roger with the duchy of Apulia in exchange for an oath of faith and homage by Roger.

Honorius travelled to Benevento, and after safeguarding the interests of Robert of Capua, he met Roger on the Pons Major, the bridge which crosses the Sabbato river near Benevento, on 22 August 1128. There, he formally invested Roger with the duchy of Apulia and both agreed to a peace between the Kingdom of Sicily and the Papal States. Unfortunately, Honorius had just returned to Rome when he was informed that the nobles of Benevento had overthrown and killed the rector (or papal governor) of the city and established a Commune. Furious, he declared he would wreak a terrible vengeance on the city, whereupon the residents asked Honorius for forgiveness and to send another governor. Honorius sent Cardinal Gherardo as the new rector, and in 1129 visited the city again, asking that the city allow the return of those they had banished during the formation of the Commune. They refused, and Honorius asked Roger II of Sicily to punish the city in May 1130, but Honorius died before action was taken.

===Intervention in France===
Aside from the Benedictines at Monte Cassino, Honorius was also determined to deal with the monks at Cluny Abbey under their ambitious and worldly abbot, Pons of Melgueil. He had just returned from the Levant after being forced out by his monks in 1122. In 1125, accompanied by an armed following, Pons took possession of Cluny Abbey, melted down the treasures stored in the monastery, and paid his followers, who continued to terrorise the monks and the villages dependent upon the abbey.

Honorius, on hearing news of the disorders at Cluny, sent a legate to investigate with orders to excommunicate and denounce Pons and order him to present himself before Honorius. Pons eventually obeyed the summons, and was deposed by Honorius in 1126 before being imprisoned in the Septizodium, where he soon died. Honorius personally reinvested Peter the Venerable as Abbot of Cluny.

Honorius soon became involved in the quarrel between King Louis VI of France and the French bishops. Stephen of Senlis, the Bishop of Paris, had been heavily influenced by the reforming zeal of Bernard of Clairvaux, and actively sought to remove royal influence in the French church. Louis confiscated Stephen&#x27;s wealth and began harassing him so that he would cease his reforming activities. At the same time, Louis also had in his sights Henri Sanglier, the Archbishop of Sens, who had also joined the reformers. Charging Henri with simony, Louis attempted to remove another threat from within the French church. Bernard of Clairvaux wrote to Honorius asking him to intervene on behalf of both men and support church independence over the claims of royal jurisdiction and interference.

Royal pressure was also brought to bear on Hildebert of Lavardin, whom Honorius had transferred from the see of Le Mans to become the Archbishop of Tours in 1125. In 1126, Louis insisted on filling episcopal vacancies in the See of Tours with his own candidates over Hildebert&#x27;s objections. Hildebert also complained to Honorius about the constant appeals to Rome whenever he made a ruling.

In response to the king&#x27;s actions, the French bishops laid an interdict on the diocese of Paris, causing Louis to write to Honorius, who suspended the interdict in 1129. Although this incurred the wrath of Bernard of Clairvaux, who wrote to Honorius expressing his disgust, Honorius pressured Stephen of Senlis to become reconciled with King Louis in 1130. Henri Sanglier, on the other hand, continued in his role of archbishop without further interference from the king. By the end of his pontificate, Honorius had ended the conflict between Louis and his bishops.

In 1127, Honorius confirmed the acts of the Synod of Nantes, presided over by Archbishop Hildebert of Lavardin, which eradicated certain local abuses in Brittany. That same year, Honorius helped Conan III, Duke of Brittany, bring one of his rebellious vassals to heel. He also intervened on behalf of the monks of the Lérins Islands who were constantly harassed by Arab pirates, encouraging a crusade to help defend the monks.

Honorius was also called to intervene in the affairs of Normandy, as Fulk of Anjou and King Henry I of England battled for domination. Henry objected to the marriage of Fulk&#x27;s daughter Sibylla of Anjou to William Clito, the son of the duke of Normandy, on the grounds that they were too closely related by blood, being sixth cousins. They refused to divorce, and Honorius was forced to excommunicate Fulk and his son-in-law and to impose an interdict upon their territories.

===Relations with England and Spain===
In England, the ongoing dispute between the Sees of Canterbury and York over primacy continued unabated. On 5 April 1125, Honorius wrote to Thurstan, Archbishop of York, advising him that Honorius planned to settle the issue personally. He sent a legate, Cardinal John of Crema, to deal with the question of primacy, as well as other jurisdictional issues between Canterbury and Wales, and between York, Scotland and Norway. Honorius wrote to the clergy and nobles of England, directing them to treat his legate as if he were Honorius himself.

In Honorius&#x27;s name, John of Crema convened the Synod of Roxburgh in 1125. In a letter written to King David I of Scotland, the king was asked to send the bishops of Scotland to the council, which discussed the claims of the Archbishop of York to have jurisdiction over the church in Scotland. Upholding the claims of York, Honorius was unsuccessful in forcing the Scottish bishops to obey Archbishop Thurstan.

Next, John convened the Synod of Westminster in September 1125, which was attended by both the archbishops of Canterbury and York, together with twenty bishops and forty abbots. Although the synod issued rulings on the forbidding of simony and of holding multiple sees at the same time, it did not touch on the vexed question of primacy between Canterbury and York. Instead, John summoned the two prelates to travel with him to Rome to discuss the matter in person before Honorius. They arrived in late 1125 and were greeted warmly by Honorius, and they remained in Rome until early 1126. While there, Honorius ruled that the Bishop of St Andrews was to be subject to the Archbishop of York and in the more contentious issue, he attempted to circumvent his way around the problem by declaring that Thurstan was subject to William de Corbeil, not in his role as Archbishop of Canterbury, but as papal legate for England and Scotland. To emphasise this, Honorius decreed that the Archbishop of Canterbury could not ask for any oath of obedience from the Archbishop of York, and in the matter of honorary distinction, it was the Archbishop of Canterbury in his role as Legate that was the most elevated ecclesiastic in the kingdom.

Urban of Llandaff also travelled to Rome on numerous occasions to meet with Honorius throughout 1128 and 1129, to plead his case that his diocese should not be subject to the see of Canterbury. Although he obtained numerous privileges for his see and Honorius always spoke encouragingly to him, Honorius avoided having to make a decision that might alienate the powerful archbishops of Canterbury.

In Spain, Honorius was deeply suspicious of the ambitions of Diego Gelmírez, the Archbishop of Compostela. Although Pope Callixtus II had made him Papal Legate of a number of Spanish provinces, Honorius informed Diego that he had been made aware of Diego&#x27;s ambitions and subtly advised him to keep his ambition in check. Still hoping to be promoted to the office of Legate of Spain, Diego sent envoys to Rome, carrying with them 300 gold Almoravid coins, two hundred and twenty for Honorius and another eighty for the Curia. Honorius repeated that his hands were tied, as he had just appointed a cardinal for that post.

Nevertheless, Honorius was not prepared to completely alienate Diego, and when the Archbishop of Braga nominated a successor to the vacant See of Coimbra, Honorius reprimanded the archbishop for usurping the rights of Diego, who should have been the one to nominate a successor. Honorius also demanded that the Archbishop of Braga present himself before Honorius on the second Sunday after Easter in 1129 to answer for his actions. Honorius also ensured that Diego should play a leading role in the Synod of Carrión (February 1130), having his legate approach Diego and ask for his assistance during the synod.

Honorius also wished to promote the ongoing struggle against the Moors in Spain, and to that end he bestowed the city of Tarragona, which had been recently captured from the Moors, to Robert d&#x27;Aguiló. Robert travelled to Rome to receive the gift from Honorius in 1128.

===Establishment of the Templars and affairs in the East===

In 1119, a new religious order had been established by some French noblemen. Called the Knights Templar, they were to protect Christian pilgrims entering the Holy Land and to defend the conquests of the Crusades. However, by the pontificate of Honorius II, they had not yet received any official sanction from the papacy. To rectify this situation, some members of the order appeared before the Council of Troyes in 1129, where the Council expressed its approval of the order and commissioned Bernard of Clairvaux to draw up the order&#x27;s rules, which now included vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The order and the rules were subsequently approved by Honorius.

Honorius, as suzerain of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, re-confirmed the election of King Baldwin II of Jerusalem and established him as the royal patron of the Templars. Honorius tried to manage as best he could the rivalries of the different princes and high-ranking ecclesiastics that were destabilising the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem. Long-standing arguments over areas of jurisdiction between the Latin Patriarchs of Antioch and Jerusalem were a constant source of irritation to Honorius. Honorius supported the claims of William of Malines, the new Archbishop of Tyre who claimed jurisdiction over some of the sees that had traditionally belonged to Bernard of Valence, the Patriarch of Antioch. Bernard refused to give up his claims to the sees, and William travelled to Rome and presented his case before Honorius. The pope sent a legate back to Palestine with instructions that Bernard was to acquiesce and that the various bishops were to submit to William of Malines within forty days. Bernard managed to resist implementing Honorius&#x27;s instructions, and soon Honorius was too ill to do anything about it.

===Death of Honorius II===
After almost a year of suffering a painful illness, Honorius fell seriously ill in early 1130. Cardinal Aymeric and the Frangipani family began planning their next moves, and Honorius was taken to the San Gregorio Magno al Celio monastery, which was located in the territory controlled by the Frangipani. Supporters of the Pierleoni family, already preparing to back Pietro Pierleoni on a rumor that Honorius had died, stormed the monastery of the dying Honorius, hoping to force the election of Pietro. Only the sight of the still living Honorius in full pontifical robes forced them to disperse.

Nevertheless, Cardinal Aymeric&#x27;s plans had not yet reached fruition when Honorius died on the evening of 13 February 1130. The cardinals supporting the Frangipani immediately closed the monastery gates and refused to allow anyone inside. The next day, and contrary to the usual customs, Honorius was quickly buried without any pomp or ceremony in the monastery, as the hand-picked cardinals got around to electing Gregorio Papareschi, who took the name Pope Innocent II. At the same time, the excluded cardinals, most of whom were supporters of the Pierleoni family, elected Pietro Pierleoni, who took the name Anacletus II, throwing the church once again into schism. Honorius eventually transferred from the monastery to the Lateran for reburial once Innocent II had been elected. He was buried in the south transept next to the body of Callixtus II.

==Legacy==
The way in which Honorius was elected meant that he became a creature, not only of Cardinal Aymeric, but also of the Frangipani family. Aymeric expanded his powerbase further, with Honorius elevating mostly non-Roman candidates to the college of cardinals, while papal legates were now chosen solely within the papal circle. Honorius favoured the newer monastic orders, such as the Augustinians, a departure from the policies of the older Gregorian popes who favoured traditional orders such as the Benedictines.

At the same time, he found himself drawn into the continued chaos of local Roman politics, as the Frangipani enjoyed their influence at the papal court, while the Pierleoni family continually fought against them and against Honorius. Their ceaseless infighting, repressed during the pontificate of Calixtus II, broke out again, and Honorius found he did not have the resources to suppress the Pierleoni, nor the authority to rein in the Frangipani. Honorius was required to engage in a number of petty wars in Rome, which wasted his time and were in the long haul unsuccessful in restoring order in the streets. The continued chaos would be instrumental in the events that saw the resurrection of Republican sentiment in the city and the eventual establishment of the Commune of Rome in the following decade.

<text>Pope Honorius III (c. 1150 – 18 March 1227), born Cencio Savelli, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 18 July 1216 to his death. A canon at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, he came to hold a number of important administrative positions, including that of Camerlengo. In 1197, he became tutor to the young Frederick II. As pope, he worked to promote the Fifth Crusade, which had been planned under his predecessor, Innocent III. Honorius repeatedly exhorted King Andrew II of Hungary and Emperor Frederick II to fulfill their vows to participate. He also gave approval to the recently formed Dominican and Franciscan religious orders.

==Early work==
He was born in Rome as a son of Aimerico, a member of the Roman Savelli family.

For a time canon at the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, he later became Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church on December 5, 1189 and Cardinal Deacon of Santa Lucia in Silice on 20 February 1193. Under Pope Clement III and Pope Celestine III he was treasurer of the Roman Church, compiling the &quot;Liber Censuum&quot;, and served as acting Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church from 1194 until 1198.

In 1197 he became the tutor to the Sicilian king Frederick, future emperor, who had been given as ward to Pope Innocent III by his mother, Constance.

Innocent III raised him to the rank of a cardinal priest in 1200, by which he obtained the &quot;Titulus&quot; of &quot;Ss. Ioannis et Pauli&quot;. He was dismissed as Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church in 1198, but about the same time he assumed the post of Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, post which he held until 1216.

==Papacy==
===Election===

Innocent III died on 16 July 1216. Two days later, seventeen cardinals present at his death assembled to elect a new pope. The troubled state of affairs in Italy, the threatening attitude of the Tatars, and the fear of a schism induced the cardinals to agree to an election by compromise. Cardinals Ugolino of Ostia (afterwards Pope Gregory IX) and Guido Papareschi were empowered to appoint the new pope. Their choice fell upon Cencio Savelli, who accepted the tiara with reluctance and took the name of Honorius III. He was consecrated at Perugia on 24 July 1216 and was crowned at Rome on 31 August 1216. He took possession of the Lateran on 3 September 1216. The Roman people were greatly elated at the election, for Honorius III was himself a Roman and by his extreme kindness had endeared himself to the hearts of all.

===Fifth Crusade===

The Fifth Crusade was endorsed by the Lateran Council of 1215, and Honorius started preparations for the crusade to begin in 1217. To procure the means necessary for this colossal undertaking, the Pope, and the cardinals were to contribute the tenth part of their income for three years. All other ecclesiastics were to contribute the twentieth part. Though the money thus collected was considerable, it was by no means sufficient for a general crusade as planned by Honorius III.

Far-reaching prospects seemed to open before him when Honorius crowned Peter II of Courtenay as Latin Emperor of Constantinople in April 1217, but the new Emperor was captured on his eastward journey by the despot of Epirus, Theodore Komnenos Doukas, and died in confinement.

In July 1216, Honorius once again called upon Andrew II of Hungary to fulfill his father&#x27;s vow to lead a crusade. (Béla III willed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a crusade to the Holy Land.) Like many other rulers, his former pupil, the Emperor Frederick II of Germany, had taken an oath to embark for the Holy Land in 1217. But Frederick II hung back, and Honorius III repeatedly put off the date for the beginning of the expedition. In spite of the insistence of Honorius III, Frederick II still delayed, and the Egyptian campaign failed miserably with the loss of Damietta on 8 September 1221.

Most rulers of Europe were engaged in wars of their own and could not leave their countries for any length of time. King Andrew II of Hungary and, somewhat later, a fleet of crusaders from the region along the Lower Rhine finally departed for the Holy Land. They took Damietta and a few other places in Egypt, but a lack of unity among the Christians and rivalry between their leaders and the papal legate Pelagius resulted in failure.

24 June 1225 was finally fixed as the date for the departure of Frederick II, and Honorius III brought about his marriage to Queen Isabella II of Jerusalem with a view to binding him closer to the plan. But the Treaty of San Germano in July 1225 permitted a further delay of two years.

Frederick II now made serious preparations for the crusade. In the midst of it, however, Pope Honorius III died in Rome on 18 March 1227 without seeing the achievement of his hopes. It was left to his successor, Pope Gregory IX, to insist upon their accomplishment.

Besides the liberation of the Holy Land, Honorius III felt bound to forward the repression of Cathar heresy in the south of France, the war for the faith in the Spanish peninsula, the planting of Christianity in the lands along the Baltic Sea, and the maintenance of the unsustainable Latin empire in Constantinople.

Of these projects, the rooting out of heresy lay nearest to Honorius III&#x27;s heart. In the south of France, he carried on Innocent III&#x27;s work, confirming Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester in the possession of the lands of Raymond VI of Toulouse and succeeding, as Innocent III had not, in drawing the royal house of France into the conflict.

The most widely important event of this period was the siege and capture of Avignon in 1226. Both Honorius III and King Louis VIII of France turned a deaf ear to Frederick II&#x27;s assertion of the claims of the Empire to that town.

===Approval of religious orders and other works===
Pope Honorius III approved the Dominican Order in 1216, the Franciscan Order in 1223, and the Carmelite Order&#x27;s Rule of St. Albert of Jerusalem in 1226.

In 1219 Honorius III invited Saint Dominic and his companions to take up residence at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of San Sisto Vecchio, which Honorius had given to St. Dominic c. 1218, intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns in Rome under Dominic&#x27;s guidance. The &quot;studium conventuale&quot; at Santa Sabina was the forerunner of the Dominican &quot;studium generale&quot; at Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

In 1217 Honorius III gave the title of King of Serbia to Stefan the First-Crowned.

During his pontificate, many of the tertiary orders came into existence. He approved the Franciscan Brothers and Sisters of Penance Rule in 1221 with the bull &quot;Memoriale propositi&quot;. He also approved the religious congregation &quot;Val des Écoliers&quot; (valley of scholars), which had been founded by four pious professors of theology at the University of Paris, France.

Being a man of learning, Honorius insisted that the clergy receive a thorough education, especially in theology. In the case of a certain Hugh whom the chapter of Chartres had elected bishop, he withheld his approbation because the bishop-elect did not possess sufficient knowledge, &quot;quum pateretur in litteratura defectum&quot;, as the Pope stated in a letter dated 8 January 1219. He even deprived another bishop of his office on account of illiteracy. Honorius bestowed various privileges upon the University of Paris and University of Bologna, the two greatest seats of learning during those times. In order to facilitate the study of theology in dioceses that were distant from the great centers of learning, he ordered in the bull &quot;Super specula Domini&quot; that some talented young men should be sent to a recognized theological school to study theology with the purpose of teaching it afterwards in their dioceses.

==Writings==
Honorius III acquired some fame as an author. The most important of his writings is the &quot;Liber censuum Romanae ecclesiae&quot;, which is the most valuable source for the medieval position of the Church in regard to property and also serves in part as a continuation of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;. It comprises a list of the revenues of the Apostolic See, a record of donations received, privileges granted, and contracts made with cities and rulers. It was begun under Pope Clement III and completed in 1192 under Pope Celestine III. The original manuscript of the &quot;Liber Censuum&quot; is still in existence (&quot;Vaticanus latinus&quot; 8486).

Honorius III also wrote a biography of Celestine III; a biography of Gregory VII; an &quot;Ordo Romanus&quot;, which is a sort of ceremonial containing the rites of the Church for various occasions; and thirty-four sermons.

Honorius is also purported to be the author of a &quot;The Grimoire of Pope Honorius&quot;. The text was likely forged near the end of the sixteenth century, roughly four hundred years after the death of its supposed author. According to A. E. Waite, &quot;...[I]t is a malicious and somewhat clever imposture, which was undeniably calculated to deceive ignorant persons of its period who may have been magically inclined, more especially ignorant priests, since it pretends to convey the express sanction of the Apostolical Seat for the operations of Infernal Magic and Necromancy.&quot;

<text>Pope Honorius IV (born Giacomo Savelli; — 3 April 1287) served as the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 2 April 1285, until his death on 3 April 1287. His election followed the death of Pope Martin IV and was notable for its speed; he was chosen unanimously on the first ballot. Honorius IV&#x27;s papacy occurred during a tumultuous period marked by political strife and conflict in Sicily, where he sought to navigate complex relationships with various rulers while maintaining papal authority. During his pontificate he continued to pursue the pro-French political policy of his predecessor.

==Early life and education==
Giacomo Savelli was born in Rome into the rich and influential family of the Savelli. His father, Luca Savelli, was a Senator of Rome who died in 1266. His mother Joanna belonged to the Aldobrandeschi family.

He studied at the University of Paris, and held a prebend and a canonry at the cathedral of Châlons-sur-Marne. Later he obtained the benefice of rector at the church of Berton in the Diocese of Norwich in England, a nation he never visited.

== Career ==
In 1261, he was created Cardinal Deacon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin by Pope Urban IV, who also appointed him papal prefect in Tuscany and captain of the papal army. Cardinal Savelli pursued a diplomatic career. Pope Clement IV sent him and three other cardinals to invest Charles of Anjou as King of Sicily at Rome on 28 July 1265. After the long deadlocked vacancy in the papal see after the death of Clement IV, when the see of Rome was vacant for three years, he was one of the six cardinals who finally elected Pope Gregory X &quot;by compromise&quot; (a technical procedure) on 1 September 1271 in a conclave held at Viterbo because conditions in Rome were too turbulent.

In 1274 he accompanied Gregory X to the Council of Lyon, where it was established that only four mendicant orders were to be tolerated: Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. In July 1276, he was one of the three cardinals whom Pope Adrian V sent to Viterbo with instructions to treat with the German King, Rudolf I of Habsburg, concerning his imperial coronation at Rome and his future relations towards Charles of Anjou, whom papal policy supported. The death of Adrian V in the following month rendered the negotiations with Rudolf fruitless.

Savelli became Protodeacon of the Sacred College in November 1277 and as such, he crowned Popes Nicholas III on 26 December 1277 and Martin IV on 23 March 1281.

According to John Julius Norwich, he was the last pope to be married before ordination.

==Election as pope==

When Martin IV died on 28 March 1285, at Perugia, Cardinal Savelli was unanimously elected Pope on 2 April, on the first ballot, and took the name of Honorius IV. He remained at Perugia throughout April, but, once negotiations were completed, he travelled to Rome and took up residence in the family palace next to Santa Sabina on the Aventine Hill. He was ordained a priest by Cardinal Latino Malabranca Orsini on 19 May, and was consecrated a bishop and crowned pope on Trinity Sunday, 20 May in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Honorius IV was already advanced in age and so severely affected with gout (or arthritis) that he could neither stand nor walk. When saying Mass he was obliged to sit in a specially constructed chair, and at the elevation of the host his hands had to be raised by a mechanical contrivance.

== Papacy ==

=== Sicilian Conflict ===

Sicilian affairs required immediate attention from the new pope. Previously, under Martin IV, the Sicilians had rejected the rule of Charles of Anjou, taking Peter III of Aragon as their king without the consent and approval of the Pope.

The massacre of 31 March 1282 known as the Sicilian Vespers had precluded any reconciliation. Martin IV put Sicily and Peter III under an interdict, deprived Peter III of the Crown of Aragon, and gave it to Charles of Valois, the younger of the sons of King Philip III of France, whom he assisted in his attempts to recover Sicily by force of arms. The Sicilians not only repulsed the attacks of the combined French and Papal forces, but also captured the Angevin heir, Charles of Salerno. On 6 January 1285, Charles of Anjou died, leaving his captive son Charles as his natural successor. Honorius IV, more peaceably inclined than Martin IV, did not renounce the Church&#x27;s support of the House of Anjou, nor did he set aside the severe ecclesiastical punishments imposed upon Sicily.

Honorius did not approve of the tyrannical government the Sicilians had been subject to under Charles of Anjou. This is evident from legislation embodied in his constitution of 17 September 1285 (&quot;Constitutio super ordinatione regni Siciliae&quot;), in which he stated that no government can prosper that is not founded on justice and peace. He passed forty-five ordinances intended chiefly to protect the people of Sicily against their king and his officials.

The death of Peter III on 11 November 1285 changed the Sicilian situation in that his kingdoms were divided between his two oldest sons: Alfonso III of Aragon, who received the crown of Aragon, and James II of Aragon, who succeeded as King of Sicily. Honorius IV acknowledged neither the one nor the other: on 11 April 1286, he solemnly excommunicated King James II of Sicily and the bishops who had taken part in his coronation at Palermo on 2 February. Neither the king nor the bishops concerned themselves about the excommunication. The king even sent a hostile fleet to the Roman coast and destroyed the city of Astura by fire.

Charles of Salerno, the Angevin pretender, who was still held captive by the Sicilians, finally grew tired of his long captivity and signed a contract on 27 February 1287 in which he renounced his claims to the kingdom of Sicily in favour of James II of Aragon and his heirs. Honorius IV, however, declared the contract invalid and forbade all similar agreements for the future.

While Honorius IV was inexorable in the stand he had taken towards Sicily, his relations towards Alfonso III of Aragon became less hostile. Through the efforts of King Edward I of England, negotiations for peace were begun by Honorius IV and King Alfonso III. The Pope, however, did not live long enough to complete these negotiations, which finally resulted in a peaceful settlement of the Aragonese as well as the Sicilian question in 1302 under Pope Boniface VIII.

=== Rome ===
Rome and the Papal States enjoyed a period of tranquillity during the reign of Honorius IV, the like of which they had not enjoyed for many years. He had the satisfaction of reducing the most powerful and obstinate enemy of papal authority, Count Guy of Montefeltro, who for many years had successfully resisted the papal troops. The authority of the pope was now recognized throughout the Papal States, which then comprised the Ravenna, the March of Ancona, the Duchy of Spoleto, the County of Bertinoro, the Mathildian lands, and the Pentapolis, i.e., the cities of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia, and Ancona. Honorius IV was the first pope to employ the great family banking houses of central and northern Italy for the collection of papal dues.

The Romans were greatly elated at the election of Honorius IV, for he was a citizen of Rome and a brother of Pandulf, a senator of Rome. The continuous disturbances in Rome during the pontificate of Martin IV had not allowed that pope to live in Rome, but now the Romans cordially invited Honorius IV to make Rome his permanent residence. During the first few months of his pontificate he lived in the Vatican, but in the autumn of 1285 he removed to the magnificent palace he had just erected on the Aventine.

=== Relations with the Holy Roman Empire ===
In his relations with the Holy Roman Empire, where no more danger was to be apprehended since the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, Martin followed the moderate course taken by Gregory X. Rudolf I of Germany sent Bishop Henry of Basel to Rome to request coronation. Honorius IV appointed the envoy Archbishop of Mainz, fixed a date for the coronation, and sent Cardinal John of Tusculum to Germany to assist Rudolf I&#x27;s cause. But general opposition showed itself to the papal interference; a council at Würzburg (16–18 March 1287) protested energetically, and Rudolf I had to protect the legate from personal violence, so that both his plans and the Pope&#x27;s failed.

=== Other acts ===

Honorius IV inherited plans for another crusade, but confined himself to collecting the tithes imposed by the Council of Lyon, arranging with the great banking houses of Florence, Siena, and Pistoia to act as his agents.

The two largest religious orders received many new privileges from Honorius IV, documented in his &quot;Regesta&quot;. He often appointed them to special missions and to bishoprics, and gave them exclusive charge of the Inquisition.

He also approved the privileges of the Carmelites and the Augustinian hermits and permitted the former to exchange their striped habit for a white one. He was especially devoted to the order founded by William X of Aquitaine and added numerous privileges to those they had already received from Alexander IV and Urban IV. Besides turning over to them some deserted Benedictine monasteries, he presented them with the monastery of St. Paul at Albano, which he himself had founded and richly endowed when he was still cardinal.

Salimbene, the chronicler of Parma, asserted that Honorius IV was a foe to the religious orders. This may reflect the fact that he opposed the Apostolic Brethren, an order embracing evangelical poverty that had been started by Gerard Segarelli at Parma in 1260. On 11 March 1286 he issued a bull condemning them as heretics.

At the University of Paris he advocated the establishment of chairs for Eastern languages to teach these languages to those who would labour for the conversion of the Muslims and the reunion of the schismatic churches in the East.

He raised only one man to be cardinal, his cousin Giovanni Boccamazza, archbishop of Monreale, on 22 December 1285.

The tomb of Pope Honorius IV is in the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli in Rome.

=== Contacts with the Mongols ===

The Mongol ruler Arghun sent an embassy and a letter to Pope Honorius IV in 1285, a Latin translation of which is preserved in the Vatican. It mentions the links to Christianity of Arghun&#x27;s family, and proposes a combined military conquest of Muslim lands:
Honorius IV was hardly capable of acting on this invasion and could not muster the military support necessary to achieve this plan.

<text>Paulinus of Nola (; ; also anglicized as Pauline of Nola; – 22 June 431) born Pontius Meropius Anicius Paulinus, was a Roman poet, writer, and senator who attained the ranks of suffect consul () and governor of Campania () but—following the assassination of the emperor Gratian and under the influence of his Hispanic wife Therasia of Nola—abandoned his career, was baptized as a Christian, and probably after Therasia&#x27;s death became bishop of Nola in Campania. While there, he wrote poems in honor of his predecessor Saint Felix and corresponded with other Christian leaders throughout the empire. He is credited with the introduction of bells to Christian worship and helped resolve the disputed election of Pope Boniface I.

His renunciation of his wealth and station in favor of an ascetic and philanthropic life was held up as an example by many of his contemporaries—including Augustine, Jerome, Martin, and Ambrose—and he was subsequently venerated as a saint. His relics became a focus of pilgrimage, but were removed from Nola sometime between the 11th and 20th centuries. His feast day is observed on 22 June in both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. In Nola, the entire week around his feast day is celebrated as the Festival of the Lilies.

==Life==
Pontius Meropius Paulinus was born at Bordeaux, in southwestern France. He was from a notable senatorial family with estates in the Aquitaine province of France, northern Iberia, and southern Italy. Paulinus was a kinsman of Melania the Elder. He was educated in Bordeaux, where his teacher, the poet Ausonius, also became his friend and lover. The love poems and letters between him and his teacher were part of a compilation by british scholar Rictor Norton. 

At some time during his boyhood he made a visit to the shrine of St Felix at Nola near Naples.

His normal career as a young member of the senatorial class did not last long. In 375, the Emperor Gratian succeeded his father Valentinian. Gratian made Paulinus suffect consul at Rome , and appointed him governor of the southern Italian province of Campania . Paulinus noted the Campanians&#x27; devotion to Saint Felix of Nola and built a road for pilgrims, as well as a hospice for the poor near the local shrine.

In 383 Gratian was assassinated at Lyon, France, and Paulinus went to Milan to attend the school of Ambrose. Around 384 he returned to Bordeaux. There he married Therasia, a Christian noblewoman from Barcelona. Paulinus was threatened with the charge of having murdered his brother. It is possible that an attempt was made to accuse him in order to confiscate his property. He was baptized by Bishop Delphinus of Bordeaux. He and his wife traveled to Iberia about 390. When they lost their only child eight days after birth they decided to withdraw from the world, and live a secluded religious life. Paulinus was close to both Pelagius and to the Pelagian writer Julian of Eclanum.

In 393 or 394, after some resistance from Paulinus, he was ordained a presbyter on Christmas Day by Lampius, Bishop of Barcelona. (This was similar to what had happened with Augustine of Hippo, who had been ordained against his protestations in the year 391 at the behest of a crowd cooperating with Bishop Valerius in the north African city of Hippo Regius.) However, there is some debate as to whether the ordination was canonical, since Paulinus received ordination &quot;at a leap&quot; (&quot;per saltum&quot;), without receiving minor orders first.

Paulinus refused to remain in Barcelona, and in late spring of 395 he and his wife moved from Iberia to Nola in Campania where he remained until his death. Paulinus credited his conversion to Saint Felix, who was buried in Nola, and each year would write a poem in honor of him.

The great building works undertaken by Paulinus in 402–403 were the crowning glory and ornament of the renovated Nola. He restored and improved the ancient basilica erected in the martyr&#x27;s honour. He and Therasia also rebuilt a church commemorating Saint Felix, of great size and richly decorated, a monument of Christian art, with magnificent porticoes and fountains, for which a copious supply of water was brought from nearby Avella. Great crowds of pilgrims flocked to the martyr&#x27;s tomb.

In January 406 following the peace after the defeat of Radagaisus, Paulinus invited a circle of guests including 
Melania the Younger and her husband and mother (Albina) and many other christians such as the Bishop of Beneventum, and where Melania wished to stay with all her household, though she left before 408.

During these years Paulinus engaged in considerable epistolary dialogue with Jerome among others about monastic topics. &quot;Paulinus decided to invest his money for the poor and the church rather than rejecting it completely, which stands in contrast to other more severe contemporary views such as Jerome&#x27;s&quot;.

Therasia died some time between 408 and 410, and shortly afterwards Paulinus received episcopal ordination. Around 410, Paulinus was chosen Bishop of Nola, where he served for twenty years. Like a growing number of aristocrats in the late 4th and early 5th centuries who were entering the clergy rather than taking up the more usual administrative careers in the imperial service, Paulinus spent a great deal of his money on his chosen church, city and ritual.

Paulinus died at Nola on 22 June 431. The following year the presbyter Uranus wrote his &quot;On the Death of Paulinus&quot; (&quot;), an account of the death and character of Paulinus.

==Influence==

As bishop of Nola, Paulinus is traditionally credited with the introduction of the use of bells in church services. One form of medieval handbell was known as the &quot; and medieval steeple bells were known as &quot;s&quot; from this supposed origin. However, Dr. Adolf Buse, professor at the Seminary of Cologne, showed that the use of bells in churches, an invention credited to Paulinus by tradition, is not due to him, nor even to the town of Nola.

Already during his governorship Paulinus had developed a fondness for the 3rd-century martyr, Felix of Nola. Felix was a minor saint of local importance and patronage whose tomb had been built within the local necropolis at Cimitile, just outside the town of Nola. As governor, Paulinus had widened the road to Cimitile and built a residence for travelers; it was at this site that Paulinus and Therasia took up residence. Nearby were a number of small chapels and at least one old basilica. Paulinus rebuilt the complex, constructing a brand new basilica to Felix and gathering to him a small monastic community. Paulinus wrote an annual hymn (&quot;natalicium&quot;) in honor of Saint Felix for the feast day when processions of pilgrims were at their peak. In these hymns we can understand the personal relationship Paulinus felt between himself and Felix, his advocate in heaven. His poetry shares with much of the work of the early 5th century an ornateness of style that classicists of the 18th and 19th centuries found cloying and dismissed as decadent, though Paulinus&#x27; poems were highly regarded at the time and used as educational models.

Many of Paulinus&#x27;s letters to his contemporaries, including Ausonius and Sulpicius Severus in southern Gaul, Victricius of Rouen in northern Gaul, and Augustine in Africa, are preserved. Four letters from Paulinus to Augustine survive, and eight from Augustine to Paulinus. In one, Augustine invites Paulinus to visit Africa. As a publishing technique at that time, Augustine often sent copies of his works to Paulinus, to be copied and circulated in Italy.
Paulinus may have been indirectly responsible for Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;: Paulinus wrote to Alypius, Bishop of Thagaste and a close friend of Augustine, asking about his conversion and taking up of the ascetic life. Alypius&#x27;s autobiographical response does not survive; Augustine&#x27;s ostensible answer to that query is the &quot;Confessions&quot;. Paulinus also wrote five letters to Delphinus and six to Amandus of Bordeaux.

&quot;Paulinus&#x27; surviving letters and poems, many devoted to the feast day of Felix, reveal his attitudes and values, illuminate his social and spiritual relationships, preserve vivid traces of the literary and aesthetic evolution of Latin literature under the influence of Christian ideas, and document the emergence of the late antique cult of the saints.&quot;

We know about his buildings in honor of Saint Felix from literary and archaeological evidence, especially from his long letter to Sulpicius Severus describing the arrangement of the building and its decoration. He includes a detailed description of the apse mosaic over the main altar and gives the text for a long inscription he had written to be put on the wall under the image. By explaining how he intended the visitors to understand the image over the altar, Paulinus provided rare insight into the intentions of a patron of art in the later Empire. He explained his project in a Poem dedicated to another great catechist, St Nicetas of Remesiana, as he accompanied him on a visit to his basilicas: &quot;I now want you to contemplate the paintings that unfold in a long series on the walls of the painted porticos. ... It seemed to us useful to portray sacred themes in painting throughout the house of Felix, in the hope that when the peasants see the painted figure, these images will awaken interest in their astonished minds.&quot;

In later life Paulinus, by then a highly respected church authority, participated in multiple church synods investigating various ecclesiastical controversies of the time, including Pelagianism.

==Legend==
Gregory the Great recounts a popular story that alleges that when the Vandals raided Campania, a poor widow came to Paulinus for help when her only son had been carried off by the son-in-law of the Vandal king. Having exhausted his resources in ransoming other captives, Paulinus said, &quot;Such as I have I give thee&quot;, and went to Africa to exchange places with the widow&#x27;s son. There Paulinus was accepted in place of the widow&#x27;s son, and employed as gardener. After a time the king found out that his son-in-law&#x27;s slave was the great Bishop of Nola. He at once set him free, granting him also the freedom of all the captive townsmen of Nola. According to Pope Benedict XVI, &quot;the historical truth of this episode is disputed, but the figure of a Bishop with a great heart who knew how to make himself close to his people in the sorrowful trials of the barbarian invasions lives on.&quot;

==Relics==
In about 800 Prince Grimoald III of Benevento removed Paulinus&#x27;s bones as relics.

From the 11th century they rested at the church of Saint Adalbert, now Saint Bartholomew, on the island in the Tiber in Rome. In 1908 Pope Pius X permitted them to be translated to the new cathedral at Nola, where they were reinterred on 15 May 1909.

The bones are now found in the small Sicilian city of Sutera, where they dedicate a feast day, and conduct a procession for the saint at Easter each year.

==Modern devotion to Saint Paulinus==
The people of modern-day Nola and the surrounding regions remain devoted to Saint Paulinus. His feast day is celebrated annually in Nola during &quot;La Festa dei Gigli&quot; (the Feast of the Lilies), in which Gigli and several large statues in honor of the saint, placed on towers, are carried upon the shoulders of the faithful around the city. In the United States the descendants of Italian immigrants from Nola and Brusciano continue the tradition in Brooklyn. This proud tradition is also kept alive in East Harlem, held on Giglio Way by the Giglio Society of East Harlem and on Long Island in West Hempstead with the Sons of San Paulino di Nola.

Paulinus is also venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church, where his feast day commemorated on 23 January.

<text>Plymouth Argyle Football Club, is a professional association football club based in the city of Plymouth, Devon, England. The team competes in the EFL Championship, the second level of the English football league system. The club has played at Home Park since 1901.

The club takes its nickname, &quot;The Pilgrims&quot;, from the Pilgrim Fathers, an English religious group, that left Plymouth for the New World in 1620. The club crest features the &quot;Mayflower&quot;, the ship that carried the pilgrims to Massachusetts. The club has predominantly played in green and white throughout its history, with a few exceptions in the late 1960s and early 1970s when white was the colour of choice. A darker shade of green, described (by some) as &quot;Argyle green&quot;, was adopted in the 2001–02 season, and has been used ever since. The club has yet to compete in the Premier League or the Football League First Division that preceded it, the city of Plymouth being the largest in England to have never hosted a top-flight men&#x27;s football team. Plymouth Argyle is the most southerly and westerly League club in England and the nation&#x27;s only professional club named Argyle.

Originally founded simply as Argyle in 1886, the club turned professional and entered both the Southern League and Western League as Plymouth Argyle in 1903. The team won the Western League title in 1904–05 and the Southern League title in 1912–13, before winning election into the Football League Third Division in 1920. Finishing as runners-up on six consecutive occasions, Argyle eventually won promotion as Third Division South champions under the long-serving management of Bob Jack in 1929–30. A 20-year stay in the Second Division ended in 1950, though the club returned again as Third Division South champions in 1951–52. After another relegation in 1956 Argyle again proved too strong for the third tier, winning the Third Division title not long after in 1958–59.

Argyle were relegated from the Second Division in 1968, 1977 and 1992, having won promotion out of the Third Division as runners-up in 1974–75 and 1985–86. The club was relegated to the fourth tier for the first time in 1995, and though it would win immediate promotion in 1995–96, was relegated again in 1998. Promoted as champions under Paul Sturrock with 102 points in 2001–02, Argyle secured a record fourth third-tier league title in 2003–04, and would remain in the Championship for six seasons until administration and two successive relegations left the club in League Two by 2011. In 2016–17, Argyle won promotion to League One, and again in 2019–20 following relegation the previous season. In the 2022–23 season, Argyle returned to the Championship as champions, winning the third-tier league title for a record fifth time.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1886–1937)===
The club was founded in 1886 as Argyle Football Club, the first match taking place on 16 October 1886 against Caxton, a team from Cornwall and in which the Pilgrims lost 2–0. Later that week Argyle won for the first time, beating Dunheved College (now Launceston College) in Launceston (where many of the club&#x27;s first members had been educated) 2–1. The club played several friendlies against Plymouth United, but poor performances on the pitch led to it going out of existence in 1894 before being resurrected in 1897 as one part of a general sports club, the Argyle Athletic Club. In 1898, Argyle F.C. produced its first rulebook. The club&#x27;s ground was given as Marsh Mills, an area on the edge of the city of Plymouth.

Much speculation surrounds the origin of the name &quot;Argyle&quot;. One explanation is that the club was named after the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, an army regiment with a strong football side of its own. Another theory is given by the local geography–suggesting the name comes either from the nearby public house, &quot;The Argyle Tavern&quot;, where the founder members may have met, or from a local street &quot;Argyle Terrace&quot;. The club adopted its current name when it became fully professional in 1903, joining the Southern League, under the management of Bob Jack. Argyle&#x27;s first professional game was on 1 September 1903 against West Ham United resulting in a 2–0 win for Argyle. The first home game as a fully professional club was on 5 September 1903 when Argyle beat Northampton Town 2–0 in front of a crowd of 4,438. Argyle won the Southern League in 1913, then in 1920 entered the Football League Third Division as a founder member, finishing 11th in its first season.

In the summer of 1924, a Plymouth Argyle team visited South America to play some exhibition football in Argentina and Uruguay. Argyle thrashed Uruguay 4–0 in the first game (the team which went on to win the first ever World Cup just six years later), before pulling off another shock by beating Argentina 1–0. Argyle then held Argentine giants Boca Juniors to a creditable 1–1 draw. Moses Russell captained the side and played in all nine matches. Russell&#x27;s style of play caught the attention of the Argentine press; at the end of the tour &#x27;The Standard of Buenos Aires&#x27; commented: &quot;The visit of Plymouth Argyle will be best remembered by the outstanding personality and genius of Moses Russell. His effective style, precise judgement, accurate and timely clearances, powerful kicking and no less useful work with his head...one of the most wonderful backs and one of the brainiest players ever seen on the football field.&quot;

In the match against Boca Juniors on 9 July 1924, the Boca Juniors supporters invaded the pitch after their team had scored the opening goal and carried all eleven home players shoulder high around the stadium. After a half-hour delay, the referee restarted the match, but a further invasion was sparked when the referee awarded a penalty against the home side. When the match was again restarted, the Argyle players had agreed that Patsy Corcoran would take the spot-kick and miss, to prevent another pitch invasion. However, the ultra-competitive Russell was not prepared to accept this, and just before Corcoran was about to take the penalty he was pushed aside by Russell, who took it himself and scored. This prompted a further pitch invasion by the Boca fans and this time the match was abandoned.

Back in England, uniquely, between 1921–22 and 1926–27, Argyle finished second in the Third Division South six seasons in a row, thereby missing promotion. Argyle eventually won promotion to Football League Division Two in 1929–30, when the club topped the Third Division South, with attendances that season regularly reaching 20,000. Manager Bob Jack resigned in 1937, having spent 27 years in charge of the Pilgrims. Eleven years earlier in 1928, David Jack, who began his career with Argyle in 1919 but left in 1920, joined Arsenal F.C. from Bolton Wanderers for a fee of £10,890 – which made him the most expensive player in the world at the time. He was also the first player to score at Wembley Stadium.

===1937–1986===
After the Second World War Argyle&#x27;s 20-year stay in Division Two came to an end in 1950–despite the efforts of inspirational captain Jack Chisholm. However, the club was back in Division Two before long, after winning the Third Division South in 1952. The closest the club has ever come to playing in the Football League First Division (top tier) was in 1952–53, when reaching fourth place in the Football League Second Division, the highest finish to date. In the 1954–1955 season floodlights arrived at Home Park, but in 1956 Argyle went down again. The Pilgrims&#x27; reputation as a &#x27;yo-yo club&#x27; continued after winning Division Three–by now a national league–in 1959.

The 1960s started with one of the most bizarre events in Argyle&#x27;s history. It came in the spring of 1963, when the club went on a mini-tour of Poland—the Pilgrims were invited to play a game as a warm-up to an international cycle race. Amazingly, 100,000 saw Argyle that day—the biggest crowd ever to attend a Plymouth match. In 1965 Argyle reached the Football League Cup semi-final, as a 2nd division team, for the first time in its history, but lost to Leicester City. But the decade ended disappointingly as Argyle returned to Division Three after relegation in 1968.

In March 1973 a memorable moment in Argyle&#x27;s history was witnessed by 37,639 people at Home Park. Argyle played a friendly match against Brazilian giants Santos FC, who at the time were one of the best teams in the world. That day Santos also had arguably the best footballer of all time in their starting line-up –Pelé. However, Argyle, then a Third Division side, shocked the world with a 3–2 win. The Greens were actually 3–0 up at one stage (thanks to goals from Mike Dowling, Derek Rickard and Jimmy Hinch) but a penalty scored at the Barn Park End by Pelé helped a Santos fightback. However, in the end Santos came up short and were defeated. There was a huge pitch invasion at the final whistle after a win for The Pilgrims.

In 1974 – with future England striker and Argyle manager Paul Mariner now playing for the team – Argyle again reached the League Cup semi-final, this time as a Third Division side. Argyle drew the first leg at home against Manchester City 1–1, but lost the Maine Road encounter 2–0. After spending six years in Division Three, Argyle finally returned to Division Two in 1974–75, under the management of Tony Waiters. This was mainly thanks to strike partners Paul Mariner and Billy Rafferty, who scored a very impressive 46 goals between them. However, the club was back down again in 1977. Although the decade did end on a high note–in 1978–79 Kevin Hodges made his Argyle debut, and he went on to play 620 games for the club–more than any other player.

In 1984 Plymouth reached the FA Cup semi-final despite being in the Third Division. After a successful cup run in which Argyle beat West Bromwich Albion away, a top division team at the time (1–0 courtesy of a Tommy Tynan goal after 58 minutes), and Derby County (the first game at Home Park ended 0–0, but Argyle won the replay 0–1 at the Baseball Ground), they lost 1–0 to Watford in the semi-final at Villa Park courtesy of a George Reilly goal. However, manager John Hore was sacked during the following campaign and was replaced by Dave Smith. In 1985–86, Smith&#x27;s first full season in charge, Argyle finished as runners-up in Division Three, resulting in promotion. The following season, despite being a newly promoted team, Argyle finished a respectable 7th place in Division Two, thereby narrowly missing the division&#x27;s new play-off zone and the chance to move to the First Division (now the Premier League). In 1988 Smith surprisingly left to take charge of Dundee, making way for Ken Brown to become manager.

===Success and into the Championship (1986–2008)===
In the 1990s a new face took over the club: Businessman Dan McCauley became chairman, and his first major decision was to sack Dave Kemp and appoint England&#x27;s record cap holder Peter Shilton as player-manager in the 1991–92 season. But Shilton was unable to prevent relegation as Argyle finished 22nd in Division Two. Ahead of the 1992–93 season, English football had a revamp. The First Division (top tier) became the Premiership, Division Two (second tier) became Division One, Division Three (third tier) was now Division Two and so on. As a result, Argyle was still in Division Two, but it was now the third tier instead of the second.

In 1992–93 Argyle finished in mid-table in the third tier, but Peter Shilton&#x27;s side finished third the following campaign (as a result of playing some excellent football), thereby qualifying for the play-offs. But Argyle lost in the semi-final against Burnley, which saw the start of a fierce rivalry between the two clubs. The Pilgrims suffered even more disappointment in 1994–95 as Shilton parted company with the club, which was eventually relegated to Division Three (fourth tier) for the first time in its history. Player Steve McCall became the club&#x27;s manager on a short-term deal after Shilton&#x27;s departure, but at the end of the season his contract was not renewed and Neil Warnock stepped in as his successor.
At the end of the 1995–96 season, Warnock took Plymouth to Division Three play-off glory in his first campaign as manager. The semi-final was a memorable affair. Argyle played Colchester United and although 1–0 down from the 1st leg, won 3–1 at Home Park in the 2nd, meaning that the Pilgrims were going to Wembley for the first time in their history. Argyle beat Darlington 1–0 in the play-off final to gain third-tier football once more.

But Warnock was sacked within a year as the club narrowly avoided being relegated back to the fourth tier. Mick Jones became his successor, and, that season, in February 1997 Argyle participated in &#x27;The Battle of Saltergate&#x27; – in a 1–2 win at Chesterfield. The following season Argyle went down under Jones, and his successor Kevin Hodges (the club&#x27;s record appearance holder) lasted three years before a failure to attain promotion (or even a play-off place) cost him his job. At this point Argyle was in danger of insolvency, and it was the lowest point in its history.

The appointment of Paul Sturrock as manager in November 2000 marked a turning point in Argyle&#x27;s history. He saved the club from relegation out of the Football League (the club was fourth from bottom of the league when he became manager), and finished 12th in his first season. The following campaign proved to be the most successful in the club&#x27;s history. Argyle defeated Cheltenham Town 2–0 in the final game of the season to achieve a club and league record of 102 points and clinch the Division Three title.

Argyle was one of the favourites to win the Division Two title going into the 2003–04 season, and proved everyone right as the club earned its second promotion in three years. In March 2004 Bobby Williamson was appointed manager. Argyle&#x27;s first game in the newly re-branded &#x27;Championship&#x27; (second tier) saw them draw 0–0 at home to Millwall, who were FA Cup finalists the season before. Argyle&#x27;s strong start continued, and the club briefly reached the top of the table – its highest ever position – after a 0–1 win at Cardiff City, before plummeting down the table and finishing 17th. The 2005–06 season included some memorable results for the Green Army including the 2–0 win against high-flying Wolverhampton Wanderers and a 0–0 draw at Leeds United, who went on to reach the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium before losing 3–0 to Watford. The Pilgrims finished 14th that season, in the end well clear of the relegation zone.

In summer 2006, in one of Ian Holloway&#x27;s first games in charge of the club, Argyle played a pre-season friendly against Real Madrid in Austria, as both clubs were training in the country at the time. Holloway&#x27;s first competitive game in charge was a 1–1 draw at home to Wolves. The team made significantly better progress than in recent seasons in the FA Cup, reaching the quarter-finals. They beat League Two Peterborough United. They beat Championship league leaders Derby County 2–0 in the next, but in the quarter finals, faced Premier League strugglers Watford at home and lost. Argyle finished the 2006–07 in 11th place, the highest league finish for 20 years.

Before the start of the 2007–08 season, manager Ian Holloway said that Plymouth was capable of earning promotion to the Premier League for the first time in its history, and the team made a good start to the new season with a 2–3 win at Hull City. The club&#x27;s good start continued as they stayed near the play-off places for the first few months. However, on 21 November 2007 Ian Holloway controversially resigned to take charge of Leicester City.

===Decline and financial issues (2008–2018)===
The club finished 2008 in 15th place–now 8 points adrift of the play-offs. On 3 January 2009, Argyle travelled to the recently built Emirates Stadium to play against Premier League giants Arsenal in the FA Cup third round. Striker Robin Van Persie scored his second of the game five minutes from time to give Arsenal a 3–1 win. The club finished 21st in the league table, five points and one place clear of the relegation places–Argyle&#x27;s first season which didn&#x27;t improve its league position for eight years.

Paul Sturrock&#x27;s second stint in charge came to an end on 10 December 2009, when a press conference confirmed he was relieved of his managerial duties due to two years of poor results and fan unrest. However, Mariner lost his first two games–his first fixture resulted in a 2–0 loss at Preston North End and then Argyle was defeated 1–0 at home to Coventry, leaving the Pilgrims bottom of the table and six points adrift of safety. Argyle ended the season as the second lowest-scoring team in the division. The club&#x27;s six-year stay in the second tier of the Football League was over. On 20 November, following a 1–2 home defeat to Brentford, newly relegated Argyle was 20th in League One, just one place and three points above the relegation zone.

On 23 November, Argyle came from 0–1 down to beat fellow strugglers Dagenham &amp; Redbridge 2–1 at Home Park, lifting them up to 15th. However, just 4,960 were present at the game. That was Argyle&#x27;s lowest league attendance since playing in the bottom tier. Not long after, the Pilgrims were presented with a winding-up order by HMRC and appeared in court on 8 December, only to earn a 63-day adjournment so they could pay the taxes they owed. Relegation was later confirmed on 2 May, following a 3–1 home defeat against Southampton.

James Brent&#x27;s Akkeron Group agreed to a deal with the Administrators to buy the club with Peter Ridsdale also confirming that he would leave the club when the deal had been completed. Further problems occurred with the Administrators threatening to quit the club. Argyle agreed to a deal to sell Home Park back to Plymouth council on 14 October for £1.6m and had to pay £135,000 a year in rent. The team&#x27;s form greatly improved after the takeover, and while the eventual League finish of 21st was the lowest in the club&#x27;s history, the club still secured survival with three games to spare, which was quite an achievement considering it had been well adrift at the bottom for the first half of the campaign. In the following season, the club was again narrowly saved from relegation, and finished 21st for a consecutive season. Sheridan then agreed a three-year contract to continue as Argyle manager, and in his first full season in charge, the club finished 10th. Argyle had a far stronger start to its fourth consecutive season in League 2, winning 4 games consecutively for the first time since 2008.

The team had the chance to go up as champions. But the title was handed to Portsmouth via goal difference. The Pilgrims got off to an appalling start to their League One campaign, gaining only 5 points in their first 11 games and sitting rock bottom, already 4 points from safety after only 11 games. And a 2–1 defeat at home to Fleetwood added to Argyle&#x27;s woes, extending the winless run to 10 games and earning just 2 points from a possible 30 in that time. Some fans disputed the board sacking Derek Adams even after taking them up in the previous season, due to poor tactics and game management. From December 2017, through 2018 saw Argyle record 16 wins, 6 draws and only 5 losses to escape relegation and finish 7th, only missing out on a play-off spot by 3 points.

===Hallett takes over (2018–present)===
In August 2018, Hallett became the majority shareholder of the club, with James Brent reducing his stake, as well as stepping down as chairman. Hallett had originally appointed David Felwick CBE as Argyle&#x27;s chairman-elect, but he cited &quot;personal reasons&quot; for being unable to takeover, so Hallett took over as chairman on 1 November 2018. At the end of the 2018–19 season, Argyle was relegated to League Two.

Ahead of the 2019–20 season, Hallett appointed Ryan Lowe as Derek Adams&#x27;s successor, signing the then 40-year-old Liverpudlian and his assistant manager Steven Schumacher from Bury. The change in management was a success as that season, Argyle finished in third place, gaining promotion back to League One. Albeit, the next season the team struggled to find their footing in the third tier, and finished 18th on 53 points. The following season was an improvement, and in December 2021 Ryan Lowe was replaced by his assistant, Steven Schumacher leading the club into 7th place for the 2021–22 season.

Argyle enjoyed its best season since 2008 in 2022–23, with the new Mayflower stand fully built, the capacity of Home Park rose to 17,900, and the club regularly saw 16,000 fans turning up to support the team. The club won the EFL League One title, clinching it in an away win at Port Vale, and finishing the season on 101 points. In their first season back in the second tier in thirteen years, Plymouth finished in 21st position, avoiding relegation on the final day of the season.

In the 2024–25 season, Plymouth defeated Premier League leaders Liverpool 1–0 at Home Park in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

==Sponsorship==

The club&#x27;s current sportswear manufacturer is Puma. The club&#x27;s main sponsor is currently Classic Builders. Shirt sponsorship was first introduced by the club in 1983. Beacon Electrical was the first company to have its name on the shirt of Plymouth Argyle, but it lasted just one season. Ivor Jones Insurance was the next sponsor and their agreement with the club lasted for two seasons. National &amp; Provincial (now merged with Abbey National) were sponsors for the 1986–87 season before the club signed an agreement with the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; which would last for five seasons. Rotolok Holdings plc became the club&#x27;s major sponsor in 1992, which was owned by then Pilgrims chairman Dan McCauley. This lasted for six seasons before the club linked up with local newspaper the &quot;Evening Herald&quot;. Between 2002 and 2011 the club was sponsored by Cornish pasty-makers Ginsters.

In 2011 with the club still in administration, local timber merchant WH Bond Timber sponsored Argyle&#x27;s kits at first for the 2011–12 season and until the end of the 2013–14 season. Local construction access company LTC Group87 then sponsored Argyle from the start of the 2014–15 season, having their LTC Powered Access branch&#x27;s logo on the shirts. Cornwall-based company Ginsters then came back for a second spell as main sponsor in the 2016–17 season.

==Stadium==

The original ground of the professional club at Home Park was destroyed by German bombers during the Blitz on Plymouth in World War II. Having been rebuilt after the war, Home Park was largely demolished as part of an extensive process of renovation, and the first phase of a new stadium built by Barrs plc was completed in May 2002. The new Devonport End was opened for the 2001 Boxing Day fixture with Torquay United. The other end, the Barn Park End, opened on the same day. The Lyndhurst stand reopened on 26 January 2002 for the game against Oxford United. Plans are currently under discussion regarding the completion of the refurbishment of the ground with the replacement of the Mayflower stand. The ground is situated in Central Park, very near to the residential area of Peverell. Towards the end of the 2005–06 Championship season, the club decided to buy the stadium for £2.7 million from Plymouth City Council, releasing the ground from a 125-year lease. This purchase was concluded in December 2006.

In the summer of 2007, the club, having failed to persuade the UK authorities of the case for retaining a standing terrace, decided to add 3,500 temporary seats to the Mayflower enclosure, dropping the capacity to 19,888 from 20,922. In December 2009 it was announced that the stadium was to be one of 12 chosen to host matches during the World Cup 2018, should England&#x27;s bid be successful. The then Argyle chairman Paul Stapleton stated that work on a new South Stand at Home Park would start in 2010. However, England failed to be chosen for the 2018 tournament, and Plymouth Argyle entered administration in March 2011. After selling the stadium back to the council on 14 October 2011 for £1.6 million, this project was in serious doubt.

The club was then taken over by local business owner James Brent, who submitted fresh plans to build a new Mayflower Grandstand with a 5,000 seating capacity, and an associated leisure complex. The plans include an ice rink with 1,500 spectator seats, a 10 screen cinema complex with an iMax screen, a 120 bedroom hotel and 4,200m sq retail units. Planning permission for the project was granted on 15 August 2013. The development was due to commence in September 2013, with the demolition of the old stand planned for late October 2013 after the Portsmouth home match. As of June 2015, the plans have been withdrawn, though planning permission still remains.

The family section of the stadium was moved from block 1 of the Devonport End to the &#x27;Zoo corner&#x27; between the Lyndhurst Stand and the Barn Park End, with a kids activities zone in the concourse. In January 2017, director Simon Hallett invested £5,000,000 into the club, along with all other directors exchanging previous loans into equity, with the intention on using the money for renovating the Mayflower Grandstand. No immediate timeframe was put on the renovations, but chairman James Brent indicated work is planned to start in 2018, finishing in 2020 ahead of the Plymouth 2020 Mayflower celebrations.

Later that month, temporary seating was once again put in place on the Grandstand, this time as a one-off for an FA Cup 3rd round replay vs Liverpool. The seating was kept in place for the next home match, a League 2 game vs Devon rivals Exeter City, but tickets were not on sale to the general public. Shortly after this game, the seating was removed. In 2021 the redevelopment of the Mayflower stand was completed, expanding the ground&#x27;s capacity to 17,900 and making it an all seater stadium.

==Support==

Plymouth Argyle fans are known collectively as the Green Army. The No.12 shirt has been reserved for the Green Army as the 12th man for many seasons.

Argyle fans are often referred to as &quot;Janners&quot;, the unofficial nickname used to describe residents of Plymouth. The 1940s saw the club attract the highest average attendances, with the largest ever being recorded in the 1946–47 season, when an average of 23,290 fans watched each game. Attendances remained fairly strong until the start of the 1980s, when, in the 1984–85, an average of just 537 attended each game, the lowest in the club&#x27;s entire history. Albeit, the decline in attendances was notable throughout the entirety of English football during this period as they were some of the foremost decades of Football hooliganism.

During this period, a hooligan firm named The Central Element emerged as a gang in the mid-1980s. It was set up by a group of 16-to-18-year-old friends from Plymouth who used to frequent pubs in Stonehouse and the city centre. The name was decided by founding members and makes reference to Central Park, where many encounters with rival firms took place. At the time, there was already an established hooligan element attached to Argyle, older men who later became known as the A38s. TCE had an all-male membership, aged 15 to 45, who followed Argyle home and away. Many held season tickets, but their interests were more about what happened off the pitch than on it. The group attempted to gain a reputation amongst larger firms whose teams were much, much higher up the football violence league, including Millwall&#x27;s Bushwackers, Cardiff&#x27;s Soul Crew and West Ham United&#x27;s Inter City Firm.

Today, the club&#x27;s main base of supporters are those from the city of Plymouth but also from Cornwall to the west, and Devon (of which Plymouth is a historical part). The &quot;Devonport End&quot; is where the most vocal supporters watch the game.

Since the 2021–22 season, The Janner Song has been played before every home game. A survey conducted by Football Fans Census in 2003 confirmed that Plymouth Argyle supporters consider their main rival to be Exeter City. The two clubs first met in a competitive fixture in 1908 when in the Southern League The club&#x27;s traditional rivals are fellow Devon sides Exeter City and Torquay United; other less intense rivalries exist with Swindon Town, Portsmouth, Millwall, Bristol City and Bristol Rovers.

====Reserve team history====
Through the 1960s and 70s, Argyle&#x27;s Reserve team played in the Plymouth &amp; Devon Combination League, with their home games at Cottage Field, next to Home Park. Argyle later entered into The Football Combination, before withdrawing from the Combination in mid-season in 1981–82, for financial reasons. In 1982 the side entered the Western Football League, leaving at the end of the 1992–93 season.

The club had also entered a team in the South Western League, but withdrew from that competition after one season in 2007. The club&#x27;s reserve team, up to the end of the 2010–11 season, played in The Football Combination, and confirmed their withdrawal from it on 27 June 2011, alongside 18 other Football League clubs.

The reserves&#x27; honours include the Southern League Championship in 1922, 1926, 1929, 1934 and its League Cup in 1933, 1934 and 1936; 1934 was the first Southern League Double.

For the 2015–16 season, Argyle entered a team into the South West Peninsula League Division One West, with home matches originally planned to be played at Bickleigh Barracks, before a change of plan saw them played at Seale-Hayne, dubbed &#x27;Hodges Park&#x27; after club legend Kevin Hodges, outside Newton Abbot. After applying for promotion and finishing 2nd behind Mousehole, the reserves side were promoted to the Premier Division for the 2016–17 season. The team again moved grounds, playing their games at the home of the Devon FA, Coach Road, in Newton Abbot and finished 6th in 2016–17.

In April 2019 it was announced that Argyle Reserves were pulling out of the South West Peninsula League at the end of the season. A new development team, run by the Argyle Community Trust would enter the new Devon Football League for the 2019–20 season.

<text>Mutley Plain is a street in Plymouth, Devon, England. Although Mutley Plain is the main street of the dense suburb called Mutley, the term is often applied to the whole area. The road is now a busy dual-carriageway, the B3250, with eight sets of traffic lights/pelican crossings. It was built as a smart tree-lined avenue in late Victorian times and improved over the next half century as a local shopping place for its neighbourhood and the affluent area to the north.

==History==
Mutley Plain lies on the route of an ancient road linking Bilburgh, a Bronze Age settlement on the coast at Sutton Pool which later formed the nucleus of the city of Plymouth, to the north. Mutley was originally the name of two parishes to the west of this road in the valley of the Houndiscombe Brook, the land to the east being part of the parish of Lipson.

Before the Norman invasion in 1066, the parish of Higher Mutley was owned by a man named Alwin of Tamerton, and Lower Mutley by another man called Goodwin, but at the time of the Domesday Book (1086) both were owned by Odo, whose feudal overlord was Juhel of Totnes. In the Domesday Book the two parishes were said to be worth five shillings each. Lower Mutley had two farms while Higher Mutley consisted of ten sheep, one farm and two smallholdings.

===Railway===
A tunnel was driven beneath Mutley Plain by the South Devon Railway Company and was opened to traffic on 2 April 1849. Formerly this was the site of Mutley Station, opened 1 August 1871 and known as the &#x27;Station of the Gentry&#x27;. It was closed 2 March 1939. The Plymouth-bound platform can still be just made out to the south of Apsley Road. The cutting to the east of the station has been covered over by a car park. Plymouth Railway Station is on the boundary between Mutley Plain and Plymouth City Centre.

==Present day==
Owing to its proximity to the expanding Plymouth University and the city centre, large numbers of students now live in the area. There are many pubs, bars, restaurants, takeaways and cafes as well as three small supermarkets. There are also more than a dozen barbers and beauty salons along with a good few estate agents. There are secondary schools very close by at Ford Park and at the brow of North Hill.

Mutley Baptist Church is a notable architectural feature. The area is mostly built up except for a small park on Moor View Terrace however Central Park and Ford Park Cemetery are nearby.

<text>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a &quot;batteries included&quot; language due to its comprehensive standard library.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.

Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.

==History==
Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his &quot;permanent vacation&quot; from his responsibilities as Python&#x27;s &quot;benevolent dictator for life&quot; (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project&#x27;s chief decision-maker (he has since come out of retirement and is self-titled &quot;BDFL-emeritus&quot;). In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.

The name Python is said to come from the British comedy series Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus.

Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 2.7&#x27;s end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other improvements will be released for it. While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e. &quot;2.7.18+&quot; (plus 3.10), with the plus meaning (at least some) &quot;backported security updates&quot;.

Python 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, with some new semantics and changed syntax. At least every Python release since (now unsupported) 3.5 has added some syntax to the language, and a few later releases have dropped outdated modules, or changed semantics, at least in a minor way.

, Python 3.13 is the latest stable release, and it and, for few more months, 3.12 are the only releases with active support including for bug fixes (as opposed to just for security) and Python 3.9, is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the &#x27;security support&#x27; phase), due to Python 3.8 reaching end-of-life. Starting with 3.13, it and later versions have 2 years of full support (up from one and a half), followed by 3 years of security support (for same total support as before).

Security updates were expedited in 2021 (and again twice in 2022, and more fixed in 2023 and in September 2024 for Python 3.12.6 down to 3.8.20), since all Python versions were insecure (including 2.7) because of security issues leading to possible remote code execution and web-cache poisoning. 

Python 3.10 added the codice_1 union type operator and the codice_2 and codice_3 keywords (for structural pattern matching statements). 3.11 expanded exception handling functionality. Python 3.12 added the new keyword codice_4. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting. Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages (again improved in 3.14), and many other changes.

Python 3.13 introduces more syntax for types, a new and improved interactive interpreter (REPL), featuring multi-line editing and color support; an incremental garbage collector (producing shorter pauses for collection in programs with a lot of objects, and addition to the improved speed in 3.11 and 3.12), and an &quot;experimental&quot; just-in-time (JIT) compiler (such features, can/needs to be enabled specifically for the increase in speed), and an &quot;experimental&quot; free-threaded build mode, which disables the global interpreter lock (GIL), allowing threads to run more concurrently, that latter feature enabled with codice_5 or codice_6.

Python 3.13 introduces some change in behavior, i.e. new &quot;well-defined semantics&quot;, fixing bugs (plus many removals of deprecated classes, functions and methods, and removed some of the C API and outdated modules): &quot;The [old] implementation of codice_7 and codice_8 is slow, inconsistent and buggy [and it] has many corner cases and oddities. Code that works around those may need to be changed. Code that uses codice_7 for simple templating, or print debugging, will continue to work correctly.&quot;

Some (more) standard library modules and many deprecated classes, functions and methods, will be removed in Python 3.15 or 3.16.

Python 3.11 adds Sigstore digital verification signatures for all CPython artifacts (in addition to PGP). Since use of PGP has been criticized by security practitioners, Python is moving to Sigstore exclusively and dropping PGP from 3.14.

Python 3.14 is now in alpha 3; regarding possible change to annotations: &quot;In Python 3.14, codice_10 annotations will continue to work as it did before, converting annotations into strings.&quot;
PEP 711 proposes PyBI: a standard format for distributing Python Binaries.

Python 3.15 will &quot;Make UTF-8 mode default&quot;, the mode exists in all current Python versions, but currently needs to be opted into. UTF-8 is already used, by default, on Windows (and elsewhere), for most things, but e.g. to codice_11 files it&#x27;s not and enabling also makes code fully cross-platform, i.e. use UTF-8 for everything on all platforms.

==Design philosophy and features==
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract and logic programming. Python is often referred to as a &quot;&#x27;glue language&quot;&#x27; because it can seamlessly integrate components written in other languages.

Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions. The standard library has two modules ( and ) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.

Its core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20), which includes aphorisms such as:

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Readability counts.

However, Python features regularly violate these principles and have received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat. Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule. The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.

Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum&#x27;s vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which espoused the opposite approach.

Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to Perl&#x27;s &quot;there is more than one way to do it&quot; motto, Python embraces a &quot;there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.&quot; philosophy. In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use. Alex Martelli, a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author, wrote: &quot;To describe something as &#x27;clever&#x27; is &quot;not&quot; considered a compliment in the Python culture.&quot;

Python&#x27;s developers usually strive to avoid premature optimization and reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity. Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. It is also possible to cross-compile to other languages, but it either doesn&#x27;t provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.

Python&#x27;s developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms &quot;spam&quot; and &quot;eggs&quot; (a reference to a Monty Python sketch) in examples, instead of the often-used &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;. A common neologism in the Python community is &quot;pythonic&quot;, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style. &quot;Pythonic&quot; code may use Python idioms well, be natural or show fluency in the language, or conform with Python&#x27;s minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability. Code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called &quot;unpythonic&quot;.

==Syntax and semantics==


Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.

===Indentation===
Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Thus, the program&#x27;s visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure. This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.

===Statements and control flow===
Python&#x27;s statements include:
* The assignment statement, using a single equals sign codice_12
* The codice_13 statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with codice_14 and codice_15 (a contraction of codice_16)
* The codice_17 statement, which iterates over an &quot;iterable&quot; object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block
* The codice_18 statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true
* The codice_19 statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by codice_20 clauses (or new syntax codice_21 in Python 3.11 for exception groups); it also ensures that clean-up code in a codice_22 block is always run regardless of how the block exits
* The codice_23 statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception
* The codice_24 statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming
* The codice_25 statement, which defines a function or method
* The codice_26 statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a file), allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom
* The codice_27 statement, which exits a loop
* The codice_28 statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next
* The codice_29 statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined
* The codice_30 statement, serving as a NOP, syntactically needed to create an empty code block
* The codice_31 statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply
* The codice_32 statement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines
* The codice_33 statement, used to return a value from a function
* The codice_34 and codice_35 statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program
* The codice_2 and codice_3 statements, an analog of the switch statement construct, that compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-of-flow measure.

The assignment statement (codice_12) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to &quot;some&quot; object with a type. This is called dynamic typing—in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.

Python does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations, and, according to Van Rossum, it never will. However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python&#x27;s generators. Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.

===Expressions===
Python&#x27;s expressions include:
* The codice_39, codice_40, and codice_41 operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) codice_42 and floating-point codice_43 division. Python uses the codice_44 operator for exponentiation.
* Python uses the codice_39 operator for string concatenation. Python uses the codice_41 operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.
* The codice_47 infix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.
* The syntax codice_48, called the &quot;walrus operator&quot;, was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.
* In Python, codice_49 compares by value. Python&#x27;s codice_50 operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, .
* Python uses codice_51, codice_52, and codice_53 as Boolean operators.
* Python has a type of expression named a &quot;list comprehension&quot;, and a more general expression named a &quot;generator expression&quot;.
* Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.
* Conditional expressions are written as (different in order of operands from the codice_54 operator common to many other languages).
* Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as , are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as , are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple&#x27;s elements are immutable. The codice_39 operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus, given the variable codice_56 initially equal to , executing first evaluates , which yields , which is then assigned back to codice_56—thereby effectively &quot;modifying the contents&quot; of codice_56 while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.
* Python features &quot;sequence unpacking&quot; where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned (to a variable, writable property, etc.) are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals—and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an &quot;iterable&quot; object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.
* Python has a &quot;string format&quot; operator codice_59 that functions analogously to codice_60 format strings in C—e.g. evaluates to codice_61. In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this was supplemented by the codice_62 method of the codice_63 class, e.g. . Python 3.6 added &quot;f-strings&quot;: .
* Strings in Python can be concatenated by &quot;adding&quot; them (with the same operator as for adding integers and floats), e.g. returns codice_64. If strings contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. returns codice_65.
* Python has various string literals:
** Delimited by single or double quotes; unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages, single and double quotes work the same. Both use the backslash (codice_66) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as &quot;formatted string literals&quot;.
** Triple-quoted (beginning and ending with three single or double quotes), which may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.
** Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with codice_67. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare &quot;codice_47-quoting&quot; in C#.)
* Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, denoted as codice_69, or . Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the &quot;start&quot; index up to, but not including, the &quot;stop&quot; index. The third slice parameter, called &quot;step&quot; or &quot;stride&quot;, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.

In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:
* List comprehensions vs. codice_70-loops
* Conditional expressions vs. codice_71 blocks
* The codice_72 vs. codice_73 built-in functions (in Python 2, codice_74 is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements

Statements cannot be a part of an expression—so list and other comprehensions or lambda expressions, all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.

===Methods===
Methods on objects are functions attached to the object&#x27;s class; the syntax is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for . Python methods have an explicit codice_75 parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self (or codice_76) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Objective-C, Ruby). Python also provides methods, often called &quot;dunder methods&quot; (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in arithmetic operations and type conversion.

===Typing===

Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.

Python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often used for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, or ), and the classes are instances of the metaclass codice_4 (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and reflection.

Before version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax): &quot;old-style&quot; and &quot;new-style&quot;; current Python versions only support the semantics of the new style.

Python supports optional type annotations. These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Mypy also supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.

===Arithmetic operations===
Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (codice_39, codice_40, codice_41, codice_43), the floor division operator codice_42 and the modulo operation codice_59 (where the remainder can be negative, e.g. codice_84). It also has codice_44 for exponentiation, e.g. codice_86 and codice_87, and a matrix‑multiplication operator codice_47 . These operators work like in traditional math; with the same precedence rules, the operators infix (codice_39 and codice_40 can also be unary to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).

The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:
* Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed codice_43 to always be floating-point division, e.g. .
* The floor division codice_42 operator was introduced. So codice_93, codice_94, codice_95 and codice_96. Adding causes a module used in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.0 rules for division (see above).

In Python terms, codice_43 is &quot;true division&quot; (or simply &quot;division&quot;), and codice_42 is &quot;floor division.&quot; codice_43 before version 3.0 is &quot;classic division&quot;.

Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation is always true. It also means that the equation is valid for both positive and negative values of codice_100. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of codice_101 is, as expected, in the half-open interval [0, &quot;b&quot;), where codice_102 is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (&quot;b&quot;, 0] when codice_102 is negative.

Python provides a codice_104 function for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses round to even: codice_105 and codice_106 both produce codice_107. Versions before 3 used round-away-from-zero: codice_108 is codice_109, codice_110 is codice_111.

Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression codice_112 tests whether codice_100 is less than codice_102 and codice_102 is less than codice_116. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate codice_117, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with codice_116.

Python uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The codice_119 type/class in the codice_120 module provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes. The codice_121 class in the codice_122 module provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.

Due to Python&#x27;s extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library NumPy that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.

=== Function syntax ===
Functions are created in Python using the codice_25 keyword. In Python, you define the function as if you were calling it, by typing the function name and then the attributes required. Here is an example of a function that will print whatever is given:
def printer(input1, input2=&quot;already there&quot;):
 print(input1)
 print(input2)
printer(&quot;hello&quot;)
# Example output:
# hello
# already there
If you want the attribute to have a set value if no value is given, use the variable-defining syntax inside the function definition.

==Programming examples==
&quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:

print(&#x27;Hello, world!&#x27;)
Program to calculate the factorial of a positive integer:

n = int(input(&#x27;Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: &#x27;))

if n &lt; 0:
 raise ValueError(&#x27;You must enter a non-negative integer&#x27;)

factorial = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
 factorial *= i

print(factorial)

==Libraries==
Python&#x27;s large standard library provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. It includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.

Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation codice_124 follows PEP 333—but most are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.

 the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 610,902 packages with a wide range of functionality, including:

==Development environments==
Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a read–eval–print loop (REPL), permitting them to function as a command line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.

Python also comes with an Integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE, which is more beginner-oriented.

Other shells, including IDLE and IPython, add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention, and syntax highlighting.

As well as standard desktop integrated development environments including PyCharm, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code etc, there are web browser-based IDEs, including SageMath, for developing science- and math-related programs; PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE emphasizing scientific computing.

==Implementations==
===Reference implementation===
CPython is the reference implementation of Python. It is written in C, meeting the C89 standard (Python 3.11 uses C11) with several select C99 features. CPython includes its own C extensions, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions—e.g. they can be implemented with C11 or C++. CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode which is then executed by its virtual machine. CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and native Python, and is available for many platforms, including Windows (starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer deliberately fails to install on Windows 7 and 8; Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5) and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, with experimental installer), with unofficial support for VMS. Platform portability was one of its earliest priorities. (During Python 1 and 2 development, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported, but support has since been dropped for many platforms.)

All current Python versions (i.e. since 3.7) only support operating systems with multi-threading support.

===Other implementations===
All alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics (e.g. may have unordered dictionaries, unlike all current Python versions), e.g. with the larger Python ecosystem, such as with supporting the C Python API of with PyPy:

* PyPy is a fast, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.10. Its just-in-time compiler often brings a significant speed improvement over CPython, but some libraries written in C cannot be used with it. It has e.g. RISC-V support.
* Codon is a language with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, that (AOT) compiles a statically-typed Python-like language with &quot;syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python&#x27;s, there are some notable differences&quot; e.g. it uses 64-bit machine integers, for speed, not arbitrary like Python, and it claims speedups over CPython are usually on the order of 10–100x. It compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading. Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python.
* Stackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads; it does not use the call stack in the same way, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also has a stackless version.
* MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants optimized for microcontrollers, including Lego Mindstorms EV3.
* Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up the execution of Python programs.
* Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that contains a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.
* Snek Embedded Computing Language (compatible with e.g. 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger ones compatible with MicroPython) &quot;is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.&quot; It is an imperative language not including OOP / classes, unlike Python, and simplifying to one number type with 32-bit single-precision (similar to JavaScript, except smaller). 

===No longer supported implementations===
Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:
* Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter five-fold by using the LLVM, and of improving its multithreading ability to scale to thousands of cores, while ordinary implementations suffer from the global interpreter lock.
* Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later.
* PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones released by Nokia in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python with GTK widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.

===Cross-compilers to other languages===
There are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:
* Brython, Transcrypt and Pyjs (latest release in 2012) compile Python to JavaScript.
* Cython compiles (a superset of) Python to C. The resulting code is also usable with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.
* PyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to &quot;human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code&quot;. Despite claiming high performance, no tool can claim to do that for &quot;arbitrary&quot; Python code; i.e. it&#x27;s known not possible to compile to a faster language or machine code. Unless semantics of Python are changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python, or compiled to machine code, and based that way.
* Nuitka compiles Python into C. It works with Python 3.4 to 3.12 (and 2.6 and 2.7), for Python&#x27;s main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. It claims complete support for Python 3.10, some support for 3.11 and 3.12 and experimental support for Python 3.13. It supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based. It&#x27;s a free compiler, though it also has commercial add-ons (e.g. for hiding source code).
* Numba is used from Python, as a tool (enabled by adding a decorator to relevant Python code), a JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.
* Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++11).
* RPython can be compiled to C, and is used to build the PyPy interpreter of Python.
* The Python → 11l → C++ transpiler compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++17).

Specialized:
* MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL), that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code.

Older projects (or not to be used with Python 3.x and latest syntax):
* Google&#x27;s Grumpy (latest release in 2017) transpiles Python 2 to Go.
* IronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs (and an alpha, released in 2021, is also available for &quot;Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included&quot;) on the .NET Common Language Runtime.
* Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of the Java libraries from a Python program.
* Pyrex (latest release in 2010) and Shed Skin (latest release in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.

===Performance===
Performance comparison of various Python implementations on a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload was presented at EuroSciPy &#x27;13. Python&#x27;s performance compared to other programming languages is also benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.

==Development==
Python&#x27;s development is conducted largely through the &quot;Python Enhancement Proposal&quot; (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions. Python coding style is covered in PEP 8. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.

Enhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language&#x27;s development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted at by the foundation. In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub. Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.

CPython&#x27;s public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:
* Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 is very unlikely to ever happen.
* Major or &quot;feature&quot; releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to happen annually. Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.
* Bug fix releases, which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.

Many alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python&#x27;s development team monitors the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development.

The major academic conference on Python is PyCon. There are also special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.

Python 3.12 removed codice_125 meaning Python extensions need to be modified, and 3.10 added pattern matching to the language.

Python 3.12 dropped some outdated modules, and more will be dropped in the future, deprecated as of 3.13; already deprecated array &#x27;u&#x27; format code will emit codice_126 since 3.13 and will be removed in Python 3.16. The &#x27;w&#x27; format code should be used instead. Part of ctypes is also deprecated and codice_127 will emit a DeprecationWarning, and will be removed in 3.15. Using that code already has a high potential for both security and functionality bugs. Parts of the typing module are deprecated, e.g. creating a codice_128 class using keyword arguments to denote the fields and such (and more) will be disallowed in Python 3.15.

==API documentation generators==
Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include pydoc (available as part of the standard library), Sphinx, Pdoc and its forks, Doxygen and Graphviz, among others.

==Naming==
Python&#x27;s name is derived from the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture; for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are &quot;spam&quot; and &quot;eggs&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;. The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines. Users of Python are sometimes referred to as &quot;Pythonistas&quot;.

The prefix &quot;Py-&quot; is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include Pygame, a binding of Simple DirectMedia Layer to Python (commonly used to create games); PyQt and PyGTK, which bind Qt and GTK to Python respectively; and PyPy, a Python implementation originally written in Python.

==Popularity==
Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index where it was the most popular language (ahead of C, C++, and Java). It was selected as Programming Language of the Year (for &quot;the highest rise in ratings in a year&quot;) in 2007, 2010, 2018, and 2020 (the only language to have done so four times ).

Large organizations that use Python include Wikipedia, Google, Yahoo!, CERN, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify, and some smaller entities like Industrial Light &amp; Magic and ITA. The social news networking site Reddit was written mostly in Python. Organizations that partially use Python include Discord and Baidu.

==Uses==

Python can serve as a scripting language for web applications, e.g. via for the Apache webserver. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has evolved to facilitate these applications. Web frameworks like Django, Pylons, Pyramid, TurboGears, web2py, Tornado, Flask, Bottle, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Pyjs and IronPython can be used to develop the client-side of Ajax-based applications. SQLAlchemy can be used as a data mapper to a relational database. Twisted is a framework to program communications between computers, and is used (for example) by Dropbox.

Libraries such as NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib allow the effective use of Python in scientific computing, with specialized libraries such as Biopython and Astropy providing domain-specific functionality. SageMath is a computer algebra system with a notebook interface programmable in Python: its library covers many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. OpenCV has Python bindings with a rich set of features for computer vision and image processing.

Python is commonly used in artificial intelligence projects and machine learning projects with the help of libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, scikit-learn and the Logic language ProbLog. As a scripting language with a modular architecture, simple syntax, and rich text processing tools, Python is often used for natural language processing.

The combination of Python and Prolog has proved to be particularly useful for AI applications, with Prolog providing knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities. The Janus system, in particular, exploits the similarities between these two languages,
in part because of their use of dynamic typing, and the simple recursive nature of their
data structures. Typical applications of this combination include natural language processing, visual query
answering, geospatial reasoning, and handling of semantic web data.
The Natlog system, implemented in Python, uses Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs) as prompt generators for text-to-text generators like GPT3 and text-to-image generators like DALL-E or Stable Diffusion.

Python can also be used for graphical user interface (GUI) by using libraries like Tkinter.

Python has been successfully embedded in many software products as a scripting language, including in finite element method software such as Abaqus, 3D parametric modelers like FreeCAD, 3D animation packages such as 3ds Max, Blender, Cinema 4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, modo, MotionBuilder, Softimage, the visual effects compositor Nuke, 2D imaging programs like GIMP, Inkscape, Scribus and Paint Shop Pro, and musical notation programs like scorewriter and capella. GNU Debugger uses Python as a pretty printer to show complex structures such as C++ containers. Esri promotes Python as the best choice for writing scripts in ArcGIS. It has also been used in several video games, and has been adopted as first of the three available programming languages in Google App Engine, the other two being Java and Go.

Many operating systems include Python as a standard component. It ships with most Linux distributions, AmigaOS 4 (using Python 2.7), FreeBSD (as a package), NetBSD, and OpenBSD (as a package) and can be used from the command line (terminal). Many Linux distributions use installers written in Python: Ubuntu uses the Ubiquity installer, while Red Hat Linux and Fedora Linux use the Anaconda installer. Gentoo Linux uses Python in its package management system, Portage.

Python is used extensively in the information security industry, including in exploit development.

Most of the Sugar software for the One Laptop per Child XO, developed at Sugar Labs , is written in Python. The Raspberry Pi single-board computer project has adopted Python as its main user-programming language.

LibreOffice includes Python and intends to replace Java with Python. Its Python Scripting Provider is a core feature since Version 4.0 from 7 February 2013.

==Languages influenced by Python==
Python&#x27;s design and philosophy have influenced many other programming languages:
* Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model.
* Cobra uses indentation and a similar syntax, and its &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; document lists Python first among languages that influenced it.
* CoffeeScript, a programming language that cross-compiles to JavaScript, has Python-inspired syntax.
* ECMAScript–JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.
* GDScript, a scripting language very similar to Python, built-in to the Godot game engine.
* Go is designed for the &quot;speed of working in a dynamic language like Python&quot; and shares the same syntax for slicing arrays.
* Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java.
* Julia was designed to be &quot;as usable for general programming as Python&quot;.
* Mojo is a non-strict superset of Python (e.g. still missing classes, and adding e.g. struct).
* Nim uses indentation and similar syntax.
* Ruby&#x27;s creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto, has said: &quot;I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That&#x27;s why I decided to design my own language.&quot;
* Swift, a programming language developed by Apple, has some Python-inspired syntax.
* Kotlin blends Python and Java features, minimizing boilerplate code for enhanced developer efficiency.

Python&#x27;s development practices have also been emulated by other languages. For example, the practice of requiring a document describing the rationale for, and issues surrounding, a change to the language (in Python, a PEP) is also used in Tcl, Erlang, and Swift.

<text>Pyridine is a basic heterocyclic organic compound with the chemical formula . It is structurally related to benzene, with one methine group replaced by a nitrogen atom . It is a highly flammable, weakly alkaline, water-miscible liquid with a distinctive, unpleasant fish-like smell. Pyridine is colorless, but older or impure samples can appear yellow, due to the formation of extended, unsaturated polymeric chains, which show significant electrical conductivity. The pyridine ring occurs in many important compounds, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and vitamins. Historically, pyridine was produced from coal tar. As of 2016, it is synthesized on the scale of about 20,000 tons per year worldwide.

==Properties==
===Physical properties===
Pyridine is diamagnetic. Its critical parameters are: pressure 5.63 MPa, temperature 619 K and volume 248 cm3/mol. In the temperature range 340–426 °C its vapor pressure &quot;p&quot; can be described with the Antoine equation
:formula_1
where &quot;T&quot; is temperature, &quot;A&quot; = 4.16272, &quot;B&quot; = 1371.358 K and &quot;C&quot; = −58.496 K.

Pyridine ring forms a hexagon. Slight variations of the and distances as well as the bond angles are observed.

===Crystallography===
Pyridine crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal system with space group &quot;Pna21&quot; and lattice parameters &quot;a&quot; = 1752 pm, &quot;b&quot; = 897 pm, &quot;c&quot; = 1135 pm, and 16 formula units per unit cell (measured at 153 K). For comparison, crystalline benzene is also orthorhombic, with space group &quot;Pbca&quot;, &quot;a&quot; = 729.2 pm, &quot;b&quot; = 947.1 pm, &quot;c&quot; = 674.2 pm (at 78 K), but the number of molecules per cell is only 4. This difference is partly related to the lower symmetry of the individual pyridine molecule (C2v vs D6h for benzene). A trihydrate (pyridine·3H2O) is known; it also crystallizes in an orthorhombic system in the space group &quot;Pbca&quot;, lattice parameters &quot;a&quot; = 1244 pm, &quot;b&quot; = 1783 pm, &quot;c&quot; = 679 pm and eight formula units per unit cell (measured at 223 K).

===Spectroscopy===
The optical absorption spectrum of pyridine in hexane consists of bands at the wavelengths of 195, 251, and 270 nm. With respective extinction coefficients (&quot;ε&quot;) of 7500, 2000, and 450 L·mol−1·cm−1, these bands are assigned to π → π*, π → π*, and n → π* transitions. The compound displays very low fluorescence.

The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum shows signals for α-(δ 8.5), γ-(δ7.5) and β-protons (δ7). By contrast, the proton signal for benzene is found at δ7.27. The larger chemical shifts of the α- and γ-protons in comparison to benzene result from the lower electron density in the α- and γ-positions, which can be derived from the resonance structures. The situation is rather similar for the 13C NMR spectra of pyridine and benzene: pyridine shows a triplet at &quot;δ&quot;(α-C) = 150 ppm, δ(β-C) = 124 ppm and δ(γ-C) = 136 ppm, whereas benzene has a single line at 129 ppm. All shifts are quoted for the solvent-free substances. Pyridine is conventionally detected by the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry methods.

===Bonding===

Pyridine has a conjugated system of six π electrons that are delocalized over the ring. The molecule is planar and, thus, follows the Hückel criteria for aromatic systems. In contrast to benzene, the electron density is not evenly distributed over the ring, reflecting the negative inductive effect of the nitrogen atom. For this reason, pyridine has a dipole moment and a weaker resonant stabilization than benzene (resonance energy 117 kJ/mol in pyridine vs. 150 kJ/mol in benzene).

The ring atoms in the pyridine molecule are sp2-hybridized. The nitrogen is involved in the π-bonding aromatic system using its unhybridized p orbital. The lone pair is in an sp2 orbital, projecting outward from the ring in the same plane as the σ bonds. As a result, the lone pair does not contribute to the aromatic system but importantly influences the chemical properties of pyridine, as it easily supports bond formation via an electrophilic attack. However, because of the separation of the lone pair from the aromatic ring system, the nitrogen atom cannot exhibit a positive mesomeric effect.

Many analogues of pyridine are known where N is replaced by other heteroatoms from the same column of the Periodic Table of Elements (see figure below). Substitution of one C–H in pyridine with a second N gives rise to the diazine heterocycles (C4H4N2), with the names pyridazine, pyrimidine, and pyrazine.

==History==

Impure pyridine was undoubtedly prepared by early alchemists by heating animal bones and other organic matter, but the earliest documented reference is attributed to the Scottish scientist Thomas Anderson. In 1849, Anderson examined the contents of the oil obtained through high-temperature heating of animal bones. Among other substances, he separated from the oil a colorless liquid with unpleasant odor, from which he isolated pure pyridine two years later. He described it as highly soluble in water, readily soluble in concentrated acids and salts upon heating, and only slightly soluble in oils.

Owing to its flammability, Anderson named the new substance &quot;pyridine&quot;, after (pyr) meaning &quot;fire&quot;. The suffix &quot;&quot; was added in compliance with the chemical nomenclature, as in &quot;toluidine&quot;, to indicate a cyclic compound containing a nitrogen atom.

The chemical structure of pyridine was determined decades after its discovery. Wilhelm Körner (1869) and James Dewar (1871) suggested that, in analogy between quinoline and naphthalene, the structure of pyridine is derived from benzene by substituting one C–H unit with a nitrogen atom. The suggestion by Körner and Dewar was later confirmed in an experiment where pyridine was reduced to piperidine with sodium in ethanol. In 1876, William Ramsay combined acetylene and hydrogen cyanide into pyridine in a red-hot iron-tube furnace. This was the first synthesis of a heteroaromatic compound.

The first major synthesis of pyridine derivatives was described in 1881 by Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch. The Hantzsch pyridine synthesis typically uses a 2:1:1 mixture of a β-keto acid (often acetoacetate), an aldehyde (often formaldehyde), and ammonia or its salt as the nitrogen donor. First, a double hydrogenated pyridine is obtained, which is then oxidized to the corresponding pyridine derivative. Emil Knoevenagel showed that asymmetrically substituted pyridine derivatives can be produced with this process.

The contemporary methods of pyridine production had a low yield, and the increasing demand for the new compound urged to search for more efficient routes. A breakthrough came in 1924 when the Russian chemist Aleksei Chichibabin invented a pyridine synthesis reaction, which was based on inexpensive reagents. This method is still used for the industrial production of pyridine.

==Occurrence==
Pyridine is not abundant in nature, except for the leaves and roots of belladonna (&quot;Atropa belladonna&quot;) and in marshmallow (&quot;Althaea officinalis&quot;). Pyridine derivatives, however, are often part of biomolecules such as alkaloids.

In daily life, trace amounts of pyridine are components of the volatile organic compounds that are produced in roasting and canning processes, e.g. in fried chicken, sukiyaki, roasted coffee, potato chips, and fried bacon. Traces of pyridine can be found in Beaufort cheese, vaginal secretions, black tea, saliva of those suffering from gingivitis, and sunflower honey.

Trace amounts of up to 16 μg/m3 have been detected in tobacco smoke. Minor amounts of pyridine are released into environment from some industrial processes such as steel manufacture, processing of oil shale, coal gasification, coking plants and incinerators. The atmosphere at oil shale processing plants can contain pyridine concentrations of up to 13 μg/m3, and 53 μg/m3 levels were measured in the groundwater in the vicinity of a coal gasification plant. According to a study by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, about 43,000 Americans work in contact with pyridine.

===In foods===
Pyridine has historically been added to foods to give them a bitter flavour, although this practise is now banned in the U.S. It may still be added to ethanol to make it unsuitable for drinking.

==Production==
Historically, pyridine was extracted from coal tar or obtained as a byproduct of coal gasification. The process is labor-consuming and inefficient: coal tar contains only about 0.1% pyridine, and therefore a multi-stage purification was required, which further reduced the output. Nowadays, most pyridines are synthesized from ammonia, aldehydes, and nitriles, a few combinations of which are suited for pyridine itself. Various name reactions are also known, but they are not practiced on scale.

In 1989, 26,000 tonnes of pyridine was produced worldwide. Other major derivatives are 2-, 3-, 4-methylpyridines and 5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine. The combined scale of these alkylpyridines matches that of pyridine itself. Among the largest 25 production sites for pyridine, eleven are located in Europe (as of 1999). The major producers of pyridine include Evonik Industries, Rütgers Chemicals, Jubilant Life Sciences, Imperial Chemical Industries, and Koei Chemical. Pyridine production significantly increased in the early 2000s, with an annual production capacity of 30,000 tonnes in mainland China alone. The US–Chinese joint venture Vertellus is currently the world leader in pyridine production.

===Chichibabin synthesis===
The Chichibabin pyridine synthesis was reported in 1924 and the basic approach underpins several industrial routes. In its general form, the reaction involves the condensation reaction of aldehydes, ketones, α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, or any combination of the above, in ammonia or ammonia derivatives. Application of the Chichibabin pyridine synthesis suffer from low yields, often about 30%, however the precursors are inexpensive. In particular, unsubstituted pyridine is produced from formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. First, acrolein is formed in a Knoevenagel condensation from the acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. The acrolein then condenses with acetaldehyde and ammonia to give dihydropyridine, which is oxidized to pyridine. This process is carried out in a gas phase at 400–450 °C. Typical catalysts are modified forms of alumina and silica. The reaction has been tailored to produce various methylpyridines.


===Dealkylation and decarboxylation of substituted pyridines===
Pyridine can be prepared by dealkylation of alkylated pyridines, which are obtained as byproducts in the syntheses of other pyridines. The oxidative dealkylation is carried out either using air over vanadium(V) oxide catalyst, by vapor-dealkylation on nickel-based catalyst, or hydrodealkylation with a silver- or platinum-based catalyst. Yields of pyridine up to be 93% can be achieved with the nickel-based catalyst. Pyridine can also be produced by the decarboxylation of nicotinic acid with copper chromite.

===Bönnemann cyclization===

The trimerization of a part of a nitrile molecule and two parts of acetylene into pyridine is called Bönnemann cyclization. This modification of the Reppe synthesis can be activated either by heat or by light. While the thermal activation requires high pressures and temperatures, the photoinduced cycloaddition proceeds at ambient conditions with CoCp2(cod) (Cp = cyclopentadienyl, cod = 1,5-cyclooctadiene) as a catalyst, and can be performed even in water. A series of pyridine derivatives can be produced in this way. When using acetonitrile as the nitrile, 2-methylpyridine is obtained, which can be dealkylated to pyridine.

===Other methods===
The Kröhnke pyridine synthesis provides a fairly general method for generating substituted pyridines using pyridine itself as a reagent which does not become incorporated into the final product. The reaction of pyridine with bromomethyl ketones gives the related pyridinium salt, wherein the methylene group is highly acidic. This species undergoes a Michael-like addition to α,β-unsaturated carbonyls in the presence of ammonium acetate to undergo ring closure and formation of the targeted substituted pyridine as well as pyridinium bromide.

The Ciamician–Dennstedt rearrangement entails the ring-expansion of pyrrole with dichlorocarbene to 3-chloropyridine.

In the Gattermann–Skita synthesis, a malonate ester salt reacts with dichloromethylamine.

Other methods include the Boger pyridine synthesis and Diels–Alder reaction of an alkene and an oxazole.

===Biosynthesis===
Several pyridine derivatives play important roles in biological systems. While its biosynthesis is not fully understood, nicotinic acid (vitamin B3) occurs in some bacteria, fungi, and mammals. Mammals synthesize nicotinic acid through oxidation of the amino acid tryptophan, where an intermediate product, the aniline derivative kynurenine, creates a pyridine derivative, quinolinate and then nicotinic acid. On the contrary, the bacteria &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; produce nicotinic acid by condensation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and aspartic acid.

==Reactions==
Because of the electronegative nitrogen in the pyridine ring, pyridine enters less readily into electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions than benzene derivatives. Instead, in terms of its reactivity, pyridine resembles nitrobenzene.

Correspondingly pyridine is more prone to nucleophilic substitution, as evidenced by the ease of metalation by strong organometallic bases. The reactivity of pyridine can be distinguished for three chemical groups. With electrophiles, electrophilic substitution takes place where pyridine expresses aromatic properties. With nucleophiles, pyridine reacts at positions 2 and 4 and thus behaves similar to imines and carbonyls. The reaction with many Lewis acids results in the addition to the nitrogen atom of pyridine, which is similar to the reactivity of tertiary amines. The ability of pyridine and its derivatives to oxidize, forming amine oxides (&quot;N&quot;-oxides), is also a feature of tertiary amines.

The nitrogen center of pyridine features a basic lone pair of electrons. This lone pair does not overlap with the aromatic π-system ring, consequently pyridine is basic, having chemical properties similar to those of tertiary amines. Protonation gives pyridinium, C5H5NH+.The p&quot;K&quot;a of the conjugate acid (the pyridinium cation) is 5.25. The structures of pyridine and pyridinium are almost identical. The pyridinium cation is isoelectronic with benzene. Pyridinium &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonate (PPTS) is an illustrative pyridinium salt; it is produced by treating pyridine with &quot;p&quot;-toluenesulfonic acid. In addition to protonation, pyridine undergoes N-centred alkylation, acylation, and &quot;N&quot;-oxidation. Pyridine and poly(4-vinyl) pyridine have been shown to form conducting molecular wires with remarkable polyenimine structure on UV irradiation, a process which accounts for at least some of the visible light absorption by aged pyridine samples. These wires have been theoretically predicted to be both highly efficient electron donors and acceptors, and yet are resistant to air oxidation.

===Electrophilic substitutions===
Owing to the decreased electron density in the aromatic system, electrophilic substitutions are suppressed in pyridine and its derivatives. Friedel–Crafts alkylation or acylation, usually fail for pyridine because they lead only to the addition at the nitrogen atom. Substitutions usually occur at the 3-position, which is the most electron-rich carbon atom in the ring and is, therefore, more susceptible to an electrophilic addition.

Direct nitration of pyridine is sluggish. Pyridine derivatives wherein the nitrogen atom is screened sterically and/or electronically can be obtained by nitration with nitronium tetrafluoroborate (NO2BF4). In this way, 3-nitropyridine can be obtained via the synthesis of 2,6-dibromopyridine followed by nitration and debromination.

Sulfonation of pyridine is even more difficult than nitration. However, pyridine-3-sulfonic acid can be obtained. Reaction with the SO3 group also facilitates addition of sulfur to the nitrogen atom, especially in the presence of a mercury(II) sulfate catalyst.

In contrast to the sluggish nitrations and sulfonations, the bromination and chlorination of pyridine proceed well.
====Pyridine &quot;N&quot;-oxide====

Oxidation of pyridine occurs at nitrogen to give pyridine &quot;N&quot;-oxide. The oxidation can be achieved with peracids:
:C5H5N + RCO3H → C5H5NO + RCO2H

Some electrophilic substitutions on the pyridine are usefully effected using pyridine &quot;N&quot;-oxide followed by deoxygenation. Addition of oxygen suppresses further reactions at nitrogen atom and promotes substitution at the 2- and 4-carbons. The oxygen atom can then be removed, e.g., using zinc dust.

===Nucleophilic substitutions===
In contrast to benzene ring, pyridine efficiently supports several nucleophilic substitutions. The reason for this is relatively lower electron density of the carbon atoms of the ring. These reactions include substitutions with elimination of a hydride ion and elimination-additions with formation of an intermediate aryne configuration, and usually proceed at the 2- or 4-position.

Many nucleophilic substitutions occur more easily not with bare pyridine but with pyridine modified with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, or sulfonic acid fragments that then become a leaving group. So fluorine is the best leaving group for the substitution with organolithium compounds. The nucleophilic attack compounds may be alkoxides, thiolates, amines, and ammonia (at elevated pressures).

In general, the hydride ion is a poor leaving group and occurs only in a few heterocyclic reactions. They include the Chichibabin reaction, which yields pyridine derivatives aminated at the 2-position. Here, sodium amide is used as the nucleophile yielding 2-aminopyridine. The hydride ion released in this reaction combines with a proton of an available amino group, forming a hydrogen molecule.

Analogous to benzene, nucleophilic substitutions to pyridine can result in the formation of pyridyne intermediates as heteroaryne. For this purpose, pyridine derivatives can be eliminated with good leaving groups using strong bases such as sodium and potassium tert-butoxide. The subsequent addition of a nucleophile to the triple bond has low selectivity, and the result is a mixture of the two possible adducts.

===Radical reactions===
Pyridine supports a series of radical reactions, which is used in its dimerization to bipyridines. Radical dimerization of pyridine with elemental sodium or Raney nickel selectively yields 4,4&#x27;-bipyridine, or 2,2&#x27;-bipyridine, which are important precursor reagents in the chemical industry. One of the name reactions involving free radicals is the Minisci reaction. It can produce 2-&quot;tert&quot;-butylpyridine upon reacting pyridine with pivalic acid, silver nitrate and ammonium in sulfuric acid with a yield of 97%.

===Reactions on the nitrogen atom===

Lewis acids easily add to the nitrogen atom of pyridine, forming pyridinium salts. The reaction with alkyl halides leads to alkylation of the nitrogen atom. This creates a positive charge in the ring that increases the reactivity of pyridine to both oxidation and reduction. The Zincke reaction is used for the selective introduction of radicals in pyridinium compounds (it has no relation to the chemical element zinc).

===Hydrogenation and reduction===
Piperidine is produced by hydrogenation of pyridine with a nickel-, cobalt-, or ruthenium-based catalyst at elevated temperatures. The hydrogenation of pyridine to piperidine releases 193.8 kJ/mol, which is slightly less than the energy of the hydrogenation of benzene (205.3 kJ/mol).

Partially hydrogenated derivatives are obtained under milder conditions. For example, reduction with lithium aluminium hydride yields a mixture of 1,4-dihydropyridine, 1,2-dihydropyridine, and 2,5-dihydropyridine. Selective synthesis of 1,4-dihydropyridine is achieved in the presence of organometallic complexes of magnesium and zinc, and (Δ3,4)-tetrahydropyridine is obtained by electrochemical reduction of pyridine. Birch reduction converts pyridine to dihydropyridines.

===Lewis basicity and coordination compounds===
Pyridine is a Lewis base, donating its pair of electrons to a Lewis acid. Its Lewis base properties are discussed in the ECW model. Its relative donor strength toward a series of acids, versus other Lewis bases, can be illustrated by C-B plots. One example is the sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (melting point 175 °C), which is a sulfation agent used to convert alcohols to sulfate esters. Pyridine-borane (, melting point 10–11 °C) is a mild reducing agent.

Transition metal pyridine complexes are numerous. 
Typical octahedral complexes have the stoichiometry and . Octahedral homoleptic complexes of the type are rare or tend to dissociate pyridine. Numerous square planar complexes are known, such as Crabtree&#x27;s catalyst. The pyridine ligand replaced during the reaction is restored after its completion.

The &quot;η&quot;6 coordination mode, as occurs in &quot;η&quot;6 benzene complexes, is observed only in sterically encumbered derivatives that block the nitrogen center.

==Applications==
===Pesticides and pharmaceuticals===
The main use of pyridine is as a precursor to the herbicides paraquat and diquat. The first synthesis step of insecticide chlorpyrifos consists of the chlorination of pyridine. Pyridine is also the starting compound for the preparation of pyrithione-based fungicides. Cetylpyridinium and laurylpyridinium, which can be produced from pyridine with a Zincke reaction, are used as antiseptic in oral and dental care products. Pyridine is easily attacked by alkylating agents to give &quot;N&quot;-alkylpyridinium salts. One example is cetylpyridinium chloride.

It is also used in the textile industry to improve network capacity of cotton.

===Laboratory use===
Pyridine is used as a polar, basic, low-reactive solvent, for example in Knoevenagel condensations. It is especially suitable for the dehalogenation, where it acts as the base for the elimination reaction. In esterifications and acylations, pyridine activates the carboxylic acid chlorides and anhydrides. Even more active in these reactions are the derivatives 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and 4-(1-pyrrolidinyl) pyridine. Pyridine is also used as a base in some condensation reactions.

===Reagents===

As a base, pyridine can be used as the Karl Fischer reagent, but it is usually replaced by alternatives with a more pleasant odor, such as imidazole.

Pyridinium chlorochromate, pyridinium dichromate, and the Collins reagent (the complex of chromium(VI) oxide) are used for the oxidation of alcohols.

==Hazards==
Pyridine is a toxic, flammable liquid with a strong and unpleasant fishy odour. Its odour threshold of 0.04 to 20 ppm is close to its threshold limit of 5 ppm for adverse effects, thus most (but not all) adults will be able to tell when it is present at harmful levels. Pyridine easily dissolves in water and harms both animals and plants in aquatic systems.

===Fire===
Pyridine has a flash point of 20 °C and is therefore highly flammable. Combustion produces toxic fumes which can include bipyridines, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide.

===Short-term exposure===
Pyridine can cause chemical burns on contact with the skin and its fumes may be irritating to the eyes or upon inhalation. Pyridine depresses the nervous system giving symptoms similar to intoxication with vapor concentrations of above 3600 ppm posing a greater health risk. The effects may have a delayed onset of several hours and include dizziness, headache, lack of coordination, nausea, salivation, and loss of appetite. They may progress into abdominal pain, pulmonary congestion and unconsciousness. The lowest known lethal dose (LDLo) for the ingestion of pyridine in humans is 500 mg/kg.

===Long-term exposure===
Prolonged exposure to pyridine may result in liver, heart and kidney damage. Evaluations as a possible carcinogenic agent showed that there is inadequate evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of pyridine, although there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals. Therefore, IARC considers pyridine as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).

==Metabolism==

Exposure to pyridine would normally lead to its inhalation and absorption in the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, where it either remains unchanged or is metabolized. The major products of pyridine metabolism are &quot;N&quot;-methylpyridiniumhydroxide, which are formed by &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferases (e.g., pyridine &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase), as well as pyridine &quot;N&quot;-oxide, and 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxypyridine, which are generated by the action of monooxygenase. In humans, pyridine is metabolized only into &quot;N&quot;-methylpyridiniumhydroxide.

==Environmental fate==
Pyridine is readily degraded by bacteria to ammonia and carbon dioxide. The unsubstituted pyridine ring degrades more rapidly than picoline, lutidine, chloropyridine, or aminopyridines, and a number of pyridine degraders have been shown to overproduce riboflavin in the presence of pyridine. Ionizable &quot;N&quot;-heterocyclic compounds, including pyridine, interact with environmental surfaces (such as soils and sediments) via multiple pH-dependent mechanisms, including partitioning to soil organic matter, cation exchange, and surface complexation. Such adsorption to surfaces reduces bioavailability of pyridines for microbial degraders and other organisms, thus slowing degradation rates and reducing ecotoxicity.

==Nomenclature==
The systematic name of pyridine, within the Hantzsch–Widman nomenclature recommended by the IUPAC, is &quot;&quot;. However, systematic names for simple compounds are used very rarely; instead, heterocyclic nomenclature follows historically established common names. IUPAC discourages the use of in favor of &quot;pyridine&quot;. The numbering of the ring atoms in pyridine starts at the nitrogen (see infobox). An allocation of positions by letter of the Greek alphabet (α-γ) and the substitution pattern nomenclature common for homoaromatic systems (&quot;ortho&quot;, &quot;meta&quot;, &quot;para&quot;) are used sometimes. Here α (&quot;ortho&quot;), β (&quot;meta&quot;), and γ (&quot;para&quot;) refer to the 2, 3, and 4 position, respectively. The systematic name for the pyridine derivatives is &quot;pyridinyl&quot;, wherein the position of the substituted atom is preceded by a number. However, the historical name &quot;pyridyl&quot; is encouraged by the IUPAC and used instead of the systematic name. The cationic derivative formed by the addition of an electrophile to the nitrogen atom is called &quot;pyridinium&quot;.

<text>Production car racing, showroom stock racing, street stock, pure stock, touring and U-car racing are all categories of auto racing where unmodified (or very lightly modified) production cars race each other, outright and also in classes. 

==Oval track racing==

When the first oval speedway built for automobile racing was constructed in England in 1906, ordinary street cars were the vehicles of choice for racing. These cars were typically procured directly from dealerships, with minimal alterations made to meet the demands of the racetrack. The affordability and accessibility of stock cars allowed racing enthusiasts from all walks of life to participate, contributing to the growth and popularity of the sport. 

As the sport evolved, so did the modifications made to the stock cars. Drivers started customizing their vehicles by enhancing performance and safety features, such as reinforcing chassis frames, installing roll cages, and improving engines and suspension systems. These modifications allowed the stock cars to withstand the intense demands of racing, turning them into formidable competitive machines.

These modifications increased the cost to compete, and in order to attract new competitors, race promotors responded by adding new divisions for &quot;lesser modified&quot; passenger cars.
Requirements for these introductory divisions can vary greatly, but all are based on a full-bodied passenger vehicle and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) production engine. Roll cages must be welded into the frame, and all glass, vinyl, upholstery and lights must be removed from the vehicle. 

In various regions, they may be known as hobby stocks, street stocks, pure stocks, bombers, factory stocks or stingers. In British oval racing, the term &quot;production car racing&quot; has been used as an alternative for hot rods, as run in the West Country during the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, and a production car world championships. The West Country production cars were later reclassified as hot rods to come in line with the country&#x27;s other promoters although this causes some confusion with the history of the West country racing as there was another class called hot rods that ran on those tracks. 

The major U.S. sanctioning organizations – International Motor Contest Association (IMCA), DIRTcar, NASCAR, and Championship Racing Association (CRA/ASA) -- generally promote these classes as one of three levels: entry, intermediate, or advanced.

=== Entry-level ===
The Sport Compact (IMCA, DIRTcar) or Pure Stock (NASCAR) or Mini-Stock or Bomber divisions are the lowest entry-level racing class. Four-passenger vehicles with a four-cylinder or limited six-cylinder engines, the rules for these race cars mandate a stock body and a stock suspension. The vehicles can be made race ready for $500 to $2,000, and involve merely gutting the interior and adding a racing seat and roll cage. 

=== Intermediate ===
The Hobby Stock (IMCA) or Factory Stock (DIRTcar) or Thunder Car (NASCAR) are also divisions designed to give new competitors the chance to go racing. The body and frame must match, and very few alterations are allowed to the stock frame and suspension. The engines produce roughly 300 horsepower and must reflect the correct pairing to the model. Racers can generally build competitive cars for between $3,500 and $10,000. 

=== Advanced ===
The Stock (IMCA, DIRTcar) or Street Stock (NASCAR, CRA/ASA) or Pro Stock (DIRTcar Northeast) divisions characteristically have bigger engines that produce roughly 360 horsepower, yet still require an OEM passenger vehicle production block. The rules also allow for some changes to the suspension, including the addition of screw jacks. While a used race car can be purchased for around $6,500, competitive stock cars can cost upwards of $25,000.

==Touring car racing==

Many production racing categories are based on particular makes of cars. There are many Porsche and Audi racing series around the world. These are also called &quot;one make series&quot;. Some series use a handicapped start, where the smaller cars are released up to 45 seconds ahead of the larger cars, and are slowly caught, the idea being that all the cars are together at the finish of the race. Many series follow the group N regulation with a few exceptions. There are several different series that have run all over the world, most notably, Japan&#x27;s Super Taikyu and IMSA&#x27;s Firehawk Series which ran between the 1980s to 1990s all over the United States.

Cars usually have a protective roll cage and run race tires (either slicks or radials). Some freedoms are allowed, like gearbox coolers, giving the cars increased performance and components longevity. Production car racing, known in the US as &quot;showroom stock&quot;, is an economical and rules restricted version of touring car racing.

Major races include the Bathurst 6 Hour, Bahrain 24 Hour, Dubai 24 Hour and Malaysian 12 Hour and sanctioned by organisations such as the FIA and SCCA. Normally using an entry-level formula, it has grown into a stand-alone series, with national, state and club events and championships. The first NASCAR &quot;strictly stock&quot; race was held at Charlotte Speedway, on June 19, 1949. Where a racing class requires that the cars raced be production vehicles only slightly adapted for racing, manufacturers typically produce a limited run of such vehicles for public sale so that they can legitimately race them in the class. These cars are commonly called &quot;homologation specials&quot;.

==Drag racing==
The World Drag Alliances (WDRA), which operates in the U.S., Canada, and Aruba provides a &quot;Factory Street&quot; class for factory produced vehicles to race legally and safely on a drag strip. The regulations for Factory Street vehicles rely on the manufacturers unaltered standard safety features of the vehicle to. All the vehicle’s original and unaltered OEM safety equipment is mandatory and must be fully functional.

The National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) promotes a &quot;Stock &quot; class in the U.S. and Canada where virtually any car is eligible to compete, and entries are classified using a system that divides factory shipping weight by a horsepower factor. Bodies must be unaltered and retain a full factory interior. Engines must be correct for the make and model vehicle and must retain stock cylinder heads, intake manifold, and carburetor. The NHRA has developed a Stock Car Classification Guide to position a vehicle in its proper class.

The International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) has included a &quot;Sportsman&quot; class which is open to door cars only. Electronics, pneumatics, hydraulics, throttle timers, staging controllers and counters prohibited, as are or any other device which may way affect the throttle operation.
In Australia, the IHRA promotes a &quot;Real Street&quot; class, which requires the vehicles be legally registered and licensed.

Every September at Mid-Michigan Raceway in Stanton, hosts the Pure Stock Muscle Car Drag Race. The event hosts classic drag racing with stock (or nearly stock) U.S. muscle cars factory built between 1955 and 1979.

<doc id="23865" wikidata="Q407142" url="?curid=23865" title="Phenols">
<text>In organic chemistry, phenols, sometimes called phenolics, are a class of chemical compounds consisting of one or more hydroxyl groups (−O H) bonded directly to an aromatic hydrocarbon group. The simplest is phenol, . Phenolic compounds are classified as simple phenols or polyphenols based on the number of phenol units in the molecule.

Phenols are both synthesized industrially and produced by plants and microorganisms.

==Properties==
===Acidity===
Phenols are more acidic than typical alcohols. The acidity of the hydroxyl group in phenols is commonly intermediate between that of aliphatic alcohols and carboxylic acids (their pKa is usually between 10 and 12). Deprotonation of a phenol forms a corresponding negative phenolate ion or phenoxide ion, and the corresponding salts are called phenolates or phenoxides (aryloxides according to the IUPAC Gold Book).

===Condensation with aldehydes and ketones===
Phenols are susceptible to Electrophilic aromatic substitutions. Condensation with formaldehyde gives resinous materials, famously Bakelite.

Another industrial-scale electrophilic aromatic substitution is the production of bisphenol A, which is produced by the condensation with acetone.

===C-Alkylation with alkenes===
Phenol is readily alkylated at the ortho positions using alkenes in the presence of a Lewis acid such as aluminium phenoxide:
: CH2=CR2 + C6H5OH → R2CHCH2-2-C6H4OH
More than 100,000 tons of tert-butyl phenols are produced annually (year: 2000) in this way, using isobutylene (CH2=CMe2) as the alkylating agent. Especially important is 2,6-ditert-butylphenol, a versatile antioxidant.

===Other reactions===
Phenols undergo esterification. Phenol esters are active esters, being prone to hydrolysis. Phenols are reactive species toward oxidation. Oxidative cleavage, for instance cleavage of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene to the monomethylester of 2,4 hexadienedioic acid with oxygen, copper chloride in pyridine Oxidative de-aromatization to quinones also known as the Teuber reaction. and oxone. In reaction depicted below 3,4,5-trimethylphenol reacts with singlet oxygen generated from oxone/sodium carbonate in an acetonitrile/water mixture to a para-peroxyquinole. This hydroperoxide is reduced to the quinole with sodium thiosulfate.
Phenols are oxidized to hydroquinones in the Elbs persulfate oxidation.

Reaction of naphtols and hydrazines and sodium bisulfite in the Bucherer carbazole synthesis.

==Synthesis==
Many phenols of commercial interest are prepared by elaboration of phenol or cresols. They are typically produced by the alkylation of benzene/toluene with propylene to form cumene then is added with to form phenol (Hock process). In addition to the reactions above, many other more specialized reactions produce phenols:
* rearrangement of esters in the Fries rearrangement
* rearrangement of &quot;N&quot;-phenylhydroxylamines in the Bamberger rearrangement
* dealkylation of phenolic ethers
* reduction of quinones
* replacement of an aromatic amine by an hydroxyl group with water and sodium bisulfide in the Bucherer reaction
* thermal decomposition of aryl diazonium salts, the salts are converted to phenol
* by the oxidation of aryl silanes—an aromatic variation of the Fleming-Tamao oxidation
* catalytic synthesis from aryl bromides and iodides using nitrous oxide

== Classification ==

There are various classification schemes. A commonly used scheme is based on the number of carbons and was devised by Jeffrey Harborne and Simmonds in 1964 and published in 1980:

===Drugs and bioactive natural products===
More than 371 drugs approved by the FDA between the years of 1951 and 2020 contain either a phenol or a phenolic ether (a phenol with an alkyl), with nearly every class of small molecule drugs being represented, and natural products making up a large portion of this list.

<text>Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (; 29 September 106 BC – 28 September 48 BC), known in English as Pompey ( ) or Pompey the Great, was a general and statesman of the Roman Republic. He played a significant role in the transformation of Rome from republic to empire. Early in his career, he was a partisan and protégé of the Roman general and dictator Sulla; later, he became the political ally, and finally the enemy, of Julius Caesar.

A member of the senatorial nobility, Pompey entered into a military career while still young. He rose to prominence serving Sulla as a commander in the civil war of 83–81 BC. Pompey&#x27;s success as a general while young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without following the traditional &quot;cursus honorum&quot; (the required steps to advance in a political career). He was elected as consul on three occasions (70, 55, 52 BC). He celebrated three triumphs, served as a commander in the Sertorian War, the Third Servile War, the Third Mithridatic War, and in various other military campaigns. Pompey&#x27;s early success earned him the cognomen &quot;Magnus&quot; – &quot;the Great&quot; – after his boyhood hero Alexander the Great. His adversaries gave him the nickname &quot;adulescentulus carnifex&quot; (&quot;teenage butcher&quot;) for his ruthlessness.

In 60 BC, Pompey joined Crassus and Caesar in the informal political alliance known as the First Triumvirate, cemented by Pompey&#x27;s marriage with Caesar&#x27;s daughter, Julia. After the deaths of Julia and Crassus (in 54 and 53 BC), Pompey switched to the political faction known as the &quot;optimates&quot;—a conservative faction of the Roman Senate. Pompey and Caesar then began contending for leadership of the Roman state in its entirety, eventually leading to Caesar&#x27;s Civil War. Pompey was defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC, and he sought refuge in Ptolemaic Egypt, where he was assassinated by the courtiers of Ptolemy XIII.

==Early life and career==
Pompey was born in Picenum on 29 September 106 BC, eldest son of a provincial noble called Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo. Although the dominant family in Picenum, Strabo was the first of his branch to achieve senatorial status in Rome; he completed the traditional &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, becoming consul in 89 BC, and acquired a reputation for greed, political duplicity, and military ruthlessness. Pompey began his career serving with his father in the Social War (91–87 BC).

Strabo died in 87 BC during the short-lived civil war known as the , although sources differ on whether he succumbed to disease, or was murdered by his own soldiers. Prior to his death, Strabo was accused of embezzlement; as his legal heir, Pompey was held responsible for the alleged crime and put on trial. He was acquitted, supposedly after agreeing to marry the judge&#x27;s daughter, Antistia.

One of the main issues at stake in 87 BC was the appointment of the consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla as commander of the Roman army in the ongoing First Mithridatic War, an opportunity to amass enormous wealth. During his absence in the East, his political rivals led by Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Gnaeus Papirius Carbo and Gaius Marius the Younger regained control of the Roman Senate. Sulla&#x27;s return in 83 BC sparked a civil war within the Roman world.

==Pompey during Sulla&#x27;s civil war==

In the year prior to Sulla&#x27;s return Pompey had raised and equipped a full legion from amongst his father&#x27;s old clients and veterans in Picenum. In the spring of 83 Sulla landed in Brundusium. As he marched north-west towards Campania, Pompey led his own legion south to join him. The government in Rome sent out three separate armies in an attempt to prevent the union between Pompey&#x27;s and Sulla&#x27;s army. Pompey attacked one of these armies and routed it. The three enemy commanders, unable to agree on a course of action, withdrew. Soon after Pompey arrived at Sulla&#x27;s camp. He was greeted by Sulla with the official title of Imperator (General).

At some point in 83 BC, it is not clear when but definitely before the onset of winter, Sulla sent Pompey back to Picenum to raise more troops. When fighting broke out once more in 82 Sulla advanced towards Rome, while Metellus (one of his lieutenants), supported by Pompey, campaigned against the consul Gaius Papirius Carbo in Cisalpine Gaul. During this campaign Pompey acted as Metellus&#x27;s cavalry commander.

Metellus and Pompey defeated Carbo&#x27;s lieutenant, the praetor Gaius Carrinas, in a six-hour battle at the river Aesis, only to be blockaded by Carbo himself. When word of Sulla&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Sacriportus reached them, Carbo retreated to his base at Ariminium, severely harassed by Pompey&#x27;s cavalry. Some time later Metellus defeated Gaius Marcius Censorinus, another of Carbo&#x27;s lieutenants, Pompey&#x27;s cavalry caught Censorinus&#x27;s fleeing troops outside their base at Sena Gallica, defeating them and plundering the town. While Metellus remained in the north-west, Pompey seems to have transferred to Sulla&#x27;s command in the south.

Pompey advanced south-west along the Via Flaminia towards Spoletium, where he joined Marcus Licinius Crassus, together they defeated Carrinas once again. Pompey laid siege to Carrinas in Spoletium but the latter managed to escape. Pompey resumed his march to join Sulla&#x27;s command. Not long afterwards Pompey successfully ambushed another large force under Censorinus, which was trying to get through to Praeneste where Carbo&#x27;s consular colleague, Marius the Younger (who was the figurehead of the struggle against Sulla), was blockaded. It was the failure of these attempts to get through the Sullan blockade in Umbria and Etruria, added to Metellus&#x27;s success in winning control of the north, which broke the back of the government&#x27;s resistance. 

At the end of the campaigning season of 82, the government forces made one final effort to march to the relief of Praeneste. They mustered 10,000 legionaries and marched to join forces with the Samnites and the Lucanians, fierce enemies of Sulla, who had campaigned against them in the Social War. Pursued by Pompey they united their forces and made for Praeneste. Unable to break through Sulla&#x27;s blockade, they marched for undefended Rome, only to be caught just in time and defeated by Sulla at the Battle of the Colline Gate. Pompey, who was pursuing the government forces, arrived just after the battle.

By the end of 82 BC, Sulla had expelled his opponents from Italy, and engineered his nomination as Dictator by the Senate. Either through admiration of his abilities, or concern at his ambition, Sulla sought to consolidate his alliance with Pompey by persuading him to divorce Antistia, and marry his stepdaughter Aemilia. Plutarch claims she was already pregnant by her former husband, and died in childbirth soon after.

==Sicily, Africa and Lepidus&#x27; rebellion==
The surviving Marians escaped to Sicily, where their ally Marcus Perperna was propraetor. They were supported by a fleet under Carbo, while Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus occupied the Roman province of Africa. Perperna abandoned Sicily after Pompey landed on the island with a large force, while Carbo was captured and later executed. Pompey claimed this was justified by Carbo&#x27;s alleged crimes against Roman citizens, but his opponents nicknamed him &quot;adulescentulus carnifex&quot;, or &quot;young butcher&quot;, as a result. 

Pompey now sailed for Africa, leaving Sicily in the hands of his brother-in-law, Gaius Memmius. After defeating and killing Ahenobarbus at the Battle of Utica, Pompey subdued Numidia and executed its king Hiarbas, a Marian ally. He restored the deposed Hiempsal to the Numidian throne. Around this time, his troops began referring to him as &quot;Magnus&quot;, or &quot;the Great&quot;, after Alexander the Great, a figure much admired by the Romans. Shortly thereafter, Pompey formally made this part of his name.

On returning to Rome, he asked for a triumph to celebrate his victories, an unprecedented demand for someone so young. Pompey refused to disband his army until Sulla agreed, although the latter tried to offset the impact by awarding simultaneous triumphs to Lucius Licinius Murena and Gaius Valerius Flaccus. Sometime during this period, Pompey married Mucia Tertia, a member of the powerful Metellus family. They had three children before their divorce in 61 BC; Pompey the younger, usually known as Gnaeus, a daughter, Pompeia Magna, and a younger son, Sextus.

Pompey supported Marcus Aemilius Lepidus as consul for 78 BC; Plutarch claims he did so against Sulla&#x27;s advice, but most modern historians refute the idea. When Sulla died in 78 BC, Lepidus sought to block his state funeral and roll back some of Sulla&#x27;s laws, then became proconsul of Cisalpine and Transalpine Gaul in January 77 BC. When the Senate ordered him back to Rome, Lepidus refused to comply unless granted another term as consul, a proposal that was rapidly rejected. Assembling an army, he began marching on Rome; the Senate responded with a series of measures, one of which was to appoint Pompey to a military command.

While Lepidus continued south, Pompey raised troops from among his veterans in Picenum, and moved north to besiege Mutina, capital of Cisalpine Gaul. The town was held by Lepidus&#x27; ally Marcus Junius Brutus, who surrendered after a lengthy siege, and was assassinated next day, allegedly on Pompey&#x27;s orders. Catulus then defeated Lepidus outside Rome, while Pompey marched against his rear, catching him near Cosa. Lepidus and the remnants of his army retreated to Sardinia, where he died.

==Sertorian War==

The Sertorian War began in 80 BC when Quintus Sertorius, a prominent proscribed Marian general, initiated a rebellion in Hispania, where he was joined by other Roman exiles like Perperna. Supported by local Iberian tribes, he took control of Hispania Ulterior and repeatedly defeated Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius through skillful use of guerrilla warfare. Sertorius defeated other Roman generals sent to oust him and soon conquered Hispania Citerior as well. Backed by his allies in the Senate, Pompey was appointed military commander in Spain with proconsular authority in order to defeat Sertorius. This act was technically illegal as he had yet to hold public office, illustrating Pompey&#x27;s preference for military glory, and disregard for traditional political constraints.

Pompey recruited 30,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry, evidence of the threat posed by Sertorius. En route to Hispania, he subdued a rebellion in Gallia Narbonensis, after which his army entered winter quarters near Narbo Martius. In early 76 BC, he crossed the Col de Portet and entered the Iberian peninsula, where he would remain for the next five years. His arrival boosted the morale of Metellus&#x27; troops, while some rebels changed sides, but soon after he was defeated by Sertorius at the Battle of Lauron, losing one third of his army while inflicting next to no losses on Sertorius&#x27; army. This was a serious blow to Pompey&#x27;s prestige, who spent the rest of the year re-organising his army. Metellus&#x27; failure to dislodge Sertorius and Pompey&#x27;s defeat meant the senatorial generals made no progress in the year.

In 75 BC, Sertorius led the campaign against Metellus, while Pompey defeated his subordinates Perperna and Gaius Herennius outside Valencia. When Sertorius took over operations against Pompey, Metellus defeated his deputy Lucius Hirtuleius at the Battle of Italica. Pompey faced Sertorius in the indecisive Battle of Sucro, in which Sertorius defeated Pompey&#x27;s right flank and nearly captured Pompey himself, but his legate Lucius Afranius defeated the Sertorian right. Sertorius withdrew inland, then turned to fight at Saguntum, where Pompey lost 6,000 men, including his brother-in-law Memmius, reputedly his most effective subordinate. Sertorius himself suffered 3,000 casualties, one of whom was Hirtuleius.

Although Metellus defeated Perperna in a separate battle, Sertorius was able to withdraw to Clunia late in the year, where he repaired the walls to lure his opponents into a siege, while forming garrisons from other towns into a new field army. Once this was ready, he escaped from Clunia and used it to disrupt Roman logistics on land and by sea. Lack of supplies forced Metellus to quarter his troops in Gaul, while Pompey wintered among the Vaccaei. Dire straits caused by this stretch of the campaign and Sertorius&#x27; guerrilla warfare led Pompey to write a letter to the Senate asking for funds and men, and scolding their lack of support for him and Metellus.

Pompey&#x27;s letter had the effect of galvanizing the Senate into sending him more men and funds. Reinforced by two more legions, in 74 BC he and Metellus began a war of attrition against their enemy. As his chief opponent had lost most of his Roman legionaries and could no longer match him in the field, Pompey, along with Metellus, gained the upper hand, conquering more and more Sertorian cities, slowly grinding down Sertorius&#x27; revolt. By now, Sertorius was being undermined by internal divisions. Discontent in Sertorius&#x27; coalition of Iberian and Roman forces came to a head in 72 or 73 BC when Perperna, leading a conspiracy with other prominent Sertorians, had Sertorius assassinated and assumed control of the rebel army.

Pompey engaged Perperna in battle and defeated him swiftly at the Battle near Osca. Perperna was captured and attempted to persuade Pompey to spare him by giving over Sertorius&#x27; correspondence, allegedly containing proof of communications between the rebel leader and leading men in Rome. Pompey burned the letters unread and executed Perperna, and then spent some time restructuring the local Roman administration, showing a lack of animosity towards his former opponents, which extended his patronage throughout Hispania and into southern Gaul. Pompey and his army remained in Hispania for a few years conquering the Sertorian remnants, and then marched back to Rome.

==First Consulship==
During Pompey&#x27;s absence, Marcus Licinius Crassus was charged with suppressing the slave rebellion led by Spartacus known as the Third Servile War. Pompey returned to Italy just before Crassus defeated the main rebel army in 71 BC, arriving in time to massacre 6,000 fugitives from the battle. His claim to have ended the war by doing so was a long-standing source of resentment for Crassus.

Pompey was granted a second triumph for his victory in Hispania, and nominated for the consulship. Since he was both too young and technically ineligible, this required a special senatorial decree. Plutarch suggests Pompey supported Crassus as his co-consul in order to put him under an obligation. The two men were elected consuls for 70 BC, but allegedly differed on almost every measure, rendering their term &quot;politically barren and without achievement.&quot;

However, their consulship did see the plebeian tribune recover powers removed by Sulla. One of the most significant was the ability to veto Senatorial bills, an act often seen as a turning point in the politics of the late Republic. Although popular with the people, the measure must have been opposed by the &quot;optimates&quot;, and thus passing it required support from both consuls, although most extant sources barely mention Crassus.

==Campaign against the pirates==

Pirates operated throughout the Mediterranean, while their fleets often formed temporary alliances with enemies of Rome, including Sertorius and Mithridates. Their power and range had increased over the past fifty years, partly because of the decline of traditional naval powers like Rhodes, while previous attempts to subdue them had been unsuccessful. However, Romans routinely referred to their opponents as &quot;pirates&quot; or &quot;brigands&quot;, and some historians argue it is more accurate to see them as a conventional enemy, rather than disorganised outlaws.

Principally based in Cilicia, in 68 BC they raided as far as Ostia, Rome&#x27;s port, and kidnapped two senators, to general outrage. Prompted by Pompey, Aulus Gabinius, tribune of the plebs in 67 BC, proposed the &quot;Lex Gabinia de piratis persequendis&quot;, giving him a mandate for their suppression. It granted him proconsular authority for three years in any province within 50 miles of the Mediterranean, along with the power to appoint legates and significant financial resources. Concerned by one man holding such wide-ranging powers, the Senate opposed the law but it was passed by the people. Most of the difficulties Pompey faced came from officials who resented his authority. In Gaul, Piso hampered his recruitment efforts, while in Crete, Quintus Metellus refused to comply with his instructions.

Pompey spread his forces throughout the Mediterranean to prevent the pirates escaping a Roman fleet by moving elsewhere. Fifteen legates were given specific areas to patrol, while he secured the grain route to Rome. These measures won him control of the western Mediterranean in just 40 days, after which his fleets moved to the east, forcing the pirates back to their bases in Cilicia. Pompey led the decisive assault on their stronghold in Coracaesium, winning the Battle of Korakesion and concluding the war in only three months.

Most of his opponents surrendered without fighting, thanks to Pompey&#x27;s reputation for clemency. They were granted lands in cities devastated during the Mithridatic War, notably Soli, renamed Pompeiopolis, and Dyme in Greece, with others sent to towns in Libya and Calabria. These communities retained a strong attachment to both Rome and Pompey.

==Third Mithridatic War and re-organisation of the east==

=== Third Mithridatic War ===

In 73 BC, Lucius Licinius Lucullus, formerly one of Sulla&#x27;s chief lieutenants, was made proconsul of Cilicia, and commander in the Third Mithridatic War. The war began in 74 BC, when the last ruler of Bithynia died and left his kingdom to Rome, sparking an invasion by Mithridates VI of Pontus, and Tigranes the Great of Armenia. Lucullus was a skilled general who won numerous victories, but claims he was protracting the war for &quot;power and wealth&quot; led to a Senate investigation, while by 69 BC his troops were weary and mutinous.

In 68 BC, Quintus Marcius Rex replaced Lucullus in Cicilia, while Manius Acilius Glabrio received Bithynia. He also assumed leadership of the war against Mithridates, but failed to respond decisively when the latter re-occupied much of Pontus in 67 BC, then attacked Cappadocia, a Roman ally. Seeing an opportunity, in 66 BC Pompey used the tribunate to pass the &quot;lex Manilia&quot;, giving him extensive powers throughout Asia Minor in order to defeat Mithridates, in addition to those granted by the &quot;lex Gabinia&quot;. The &quot;optimates&quot; were privately horrified that one man should hold so much influence, but fearful of his popularity allowed the measure to pass.

Incensed at being replaced, Lucullus called Pompey a &quot;vulture&quot; who profited from the work of others, a reference both to his new command and claim to have finished the war against Spartacus. Pompey agreed an alliance with Phraates III, king of Parthia, whom he persuaded to invade Armenia. When Mithridates offered a truce, Lucullus argued the war was over, but Pompey demanded concessions which could not be accepted. Outnumbered, Mithridates withdrew into Armenia, followed by Pompey, who defeated him at Lycus near the end of 66 BC.

According to contemporary sources, Mithridates and a small contingent escaped the battle, outstripped their pursuers, and reached Colchis on the Black Sea. While there, he took control of the Cimmerian Bosporus from its Roman-backed ruler, his son Machares, who later committed suicide. Meanwhile, Pompey invaded Armenia supported by Tigranes the Younger, whose father quickly came to terms; in return for the restoration of Armenian territories taken by Lucullus, he paid a substantial cash indemnity and allowed Roman troops to be based on his territory.

In 65 BC, Pompey set out to take Colchis, but to do so had first to subdue various local tribes and allies of Mithridrates. After winning a series of battles, he reached Phasis and linked up with Servilius, admiral of his Euxine fleet, before a fresh revolt in Caucasian Albania forced him to retrace his steps. Victory at the Abas enabled him to impose terms on the Albanians and agree truces with other tribes on the northern side of the Caucasus. Pompey then wintered in Armenia, settling minor border contests and raids between his allies Phraates and Tigranes.

Relying on his naval blockade to wear down Mithridates, Pompey spent 64 BC annexing the independent and wealthy cities of Syria, which were incorporated into a new Roman province. In the process, he acquired large amounts of money and prestige, as well as criticism from his opponents in Rome, who argued doing so exceeded his authority. Meanwhile, an ageing Mithridates had been cornered in Panticapaeum by another of his sons, Pharnaces II of Pontus. An attempt to commit suicide by taking poison allegedly failed due to his habit of taking &quot;precautionary antidotes&quot;, and he was killed by the rebels. Pharnaces sent his embalmed body to Pompey, in return for which he was granted the Bosporan Kingdom and made an ally of Rome.

===Re-organisation of the East===

The final collapse of the Seleucid Empire allowed Pompey to annex Syria in 64 BC, but its dissolution destabilised the region, while many of its cities had used the power vacuum to achieve independence. In early 63 BC, Pompey left Antioch and marched south, occupying coastal cities like Apamea, before crossing the Anti-Lebanon Mountains and capturing Pella, Jordan and Damascus.

Pompey&#x27;s incursion further south, into Judea, was occasioned on account of its inhabitants, under the leadership of Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, having ravaged Phoenicia and Pompey wanting to bring a stop to it. The initial onslaught was disrupted by the Hasmonean Civil War, in which Pompey backed Hyrcanus II over his brother Aristobulus II. When he compelled the latter to surrender Jerusalem, its defenders took refuge in the Temple, which the Romans first stormed, then looted. Judea became a client kingdom ruled by Hyrcanus, while its northern section was incorporated into the Decapolis, a league of semi-autonomous cities (see map). Both Judea and the League were made subordinate to the new province of Syria.

Other organisational changes included creating the province of Bithynia and Pontus, with the rest of Mithridates&#x27; territories distributed among Roman allies. Elsewhere, Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia was restored to his throne, while Lesser Armenia was taken from Tigranes and incorporated into Galatia, with Pompey&#x27;s client Deiotarus becoming ruler of the new kingdom. Finally, Cilicia received the coastal region of Pamphylia, previously a centre of piracy, along with other inland areas and reorganised into six parts. These actions significantly increased Roman state income and presented Pompey with multiple opportunities to increase his personal wealth and patronage base.

==Return to Rome and the First Triumvirate==
Before his return to Italy in 62 BC, Pompey paid his troops bonuses totalling around 16,000 talents, but despite fears he intended to follow Sulla&#x27;s example, they were dismissed upon arrival at Brundisium. His journey to Rome drew huge crowds wherever he stopped, showing that although opinion in the Senate was divided, Pompey remained as popular as ever with the masses. He was awarded a third triumph for his achievements in Asia Minor, celebrated on his 45th birthday in 61 BC.

Pompey claimed the new provinces established in the East had increased annual state income from 200 million to 340 million sesterces, plus an additional payment of 480 million sesterces to the treasury. He refused to provide details of his personal fortune, but given the amounts declared publicly, this must have been enormous. Some of it was used to build one of the most famous structures of Ancient Rome, the Theatre of Pompey.

However, the Senate then refused to ratify the treaties agreed by Pompey as part of his settlement of the East. Opposition was led by the &quot;optimates&quot; Cato the Younger and Metellus Celer, whose sister Mucia had recently been divorced by Pompey, for reasons still disputed. They also defeated a bill to distribute farmland to his veterans, and landless members of the urban poor. A similar measure had been rejected in 63 BC, which arguably made the Senate over confident in their ability to control popular unrest.

Although Pompey could not overcome &quot;optimate&quot; opposition on his own, the situation changed when Marius&#x27; nephew Julius Caesar sought his endorsement for the consulship in 59 BC. A skilled, unscrupulous, and ambitious politician, Caesar used this alliance to harness Pompey&#x27;s influence with the urban electorate. With additional support from Crassus, Caesar became one of the two consuls for 59 BC, the other being the &quot;optimate&quot; Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. This meant Caesar could help pass legislation sponsored by Pompey and Crassus, while it was in his interest to keep them aligned, an important factor given the rivalry between his two patrons.

Despite appearing to be the most junior, Caesar thus became central to the First Triumvirate, an informal political alliance designed to counter-balance the &quot;optimates&quot;. Pompey&#x27;s influence was based on his reputation as a military commander, and popularity with the Roman people. Crassus&#x27; wealth allowed him to construct extensive patronage networks, but he lacked the military clout essential for political success in the late Republican era.

Once elected, Caesar secured the passage of a new agrarian bill, helped by Pompey&#x27;s veterans, who filled the streets of Rome and allegedly intimidated the Senate. When Bibulus opposed the measure, he was attacked in the forum, and spent the rest of his consulship under virtual house arrest. Caesar then ensured ratification of Pompey&#x27;s settlements in the east, while the &quot;Lex Vatinia&quot; made him governor of Gallia Cisalpina and Illyricum. He was also assigned Gallia Transalpina after its governor died in office, before leaving Rome to launch the Gallic Wars in 58 BC. His alliance with Pompey was strengthened when the latter married Caesar&#x27;s daughter Julia.

Senatorial opposition to the triumvirate was led by Cicero, a long-standing Pompeian ally. Despite this, the latter supported the populist politician Publius Clodius Pulcher in an attack on Cicero for executing Roman citizens without trial during the Catilinarian conspiracy. Although Clodius succeeded in having Cicero exiled, he was recalled to Rome by Pompey eighteen months later in 58 BC. As a result, when shortages of grain caused popular unrest in 57 BC, a grateful Cicero backed Pompey&#x27;s appointment as &quot;praefectus annonae&quot;, a temporary position set up for such occasions.

Pompey and Crassus were competing for command of a new expedition to Asia Minor, and in 56 BC they met with Caesar to resolve these issues. Although Crassus was a long-standing rival, there are also indications Pompey felt his status as the foremost soldier of the Republic was threatened by Caesar&#x27;s success in Gaul. With this in mind, Pompey set aside his differences with Crassus to promote their joint candidature as consuls for 55 BC. With Caesar&#x27;s support, they were duly elected after prolonged periods of the violence which had become a feature of Roman political campaigns. 

Once in office, they ensured passage of a law giving Crassus the province of Syria and command of a punitive expedition against Parthia, providing him opportunities for both military glory and loot. Pompey was assigned the restive provinces of Hispania, along with Africa, while Caesar&#x27;s governorships in Gaul were extended. All three men were given these positions for a period of five years, as well as the right to levy troops and &quot;make peace and war with whomsoever they pleased.&quot;

==From confrontation to civil war==
In 54 BC, Caesar continued his conquest of Gaul, Crassus opened his campaign against the Parthians, and Pompey remained in Rome, where his wife Julia died in child birth in September. Contemporary sources suggest that combined with the death of Crassus and his son Publius at Carrhae in May 53 BC, this removed any obstacle to direct confrontation between Caesar and Pompey.

Consular elections in 52 BC had to be suspended due to widespread violence. Seeking to end his alliance with Caesar, the &quot;optimate&quot; Bibulus proposed Pompey be elected sole consul, an unprecedented act backed by both Cato and the tribunate. Having restored order, Pompey married Cornelia, widow of Publius Crassus and daughter of Metellus Scipio Nasica, whom he appointed as his colleague for the last five months of the year. 

As consul, Pompey helped enact legislation which some historians view as crucial to understanding the drift to war in 49 BC. Accused of using violence during his consulship in 59 BC, Caesar had previously been shielded by his proconsular immunity. With private support from Pompey, new laws made such prosecutions retrospective, which meant Caesar would probably be put on trial the moment he left Gaul and lost his &quot;Imperium&quot;. To avoid this, he had secured approval to stand for the consulship in 48 BC while still in Gaul, but another law backed by Pompey required electoral candidates to be physically present in Rome. 

Although the two continued to co-operate in public, Pompey clearly viewed his colleague as a threat, as did much of the Senate. Both consuls for 50 BC, Paullus and Gaius Claudius, were opponents of Caesar, as was Curio, a plebeian tribune. They initiated legislation to remove Caesar from his command in Gaul, who allegedly bypassed this by bribing Paullus and Curio. For whatever reason, Curio came up with an alternative proposal; Caesar and Pompey should disarm at the same time, or be declared enemies of the state.

This was a clever move, since it was popular with those who wanted to avoid war, but unacceptable to the &quot;optimates&quot; who saw Caesar as a danger that had to be eliminated. Rejection made open conflict more likely, and the Senate agreed to fund a consular army, organised by Pompey. When he fell ill while recruiting in Naples, the celebrations that followed his recovery allegedly convinced Pompey his popularity was sufficient to see off any opponent. In December, Caesar crossed the Alps with a single veteran legion and arrived at Ravenna, close to the border with the Roman Republic.

A significant number of senators opposed any concessions to Caesar, but many also mistrusted Pompey, who has been criticised for &quot;weak and ineffectual leadership&quot; in this period. On 1 January 49 BC, Caesar sent an ultimatum demanding acceptance of his compromise, failing which he would march on Rome &quot;to avenge his country&#x27;s wrongs&quot;. Confident their forces significantly outnumbered those available to Caesar, on 7 January the Senate declared him a public enemy; four days later, he crossed the Rubicon into Italy.

==The Road to Pharsalus==
When the war began, Caesar was a rebel with no navy and three understrength legions, while Pompey was backed by all the resources of the Roman state and his clients in the East. However, his position was weaker than it seemed, since he was simply an advisor to the Senate, many of whose members either preferred a negotiated solution, or regarded him with as much suspicion as Caesar. His military strategy had to be approved by the consuls, and he could only issue recommendations, which were not always followed. For example, Cicero rejected a request to help him with recruitment, and Cato refused to take command of Sicily, vital for control of Rome&#x27;s grain supply.

Plans to defend Italy were undone by the speed with which Caesar moved, advancing directly on Rome with minimal resistance. Although outnumbered, his troops were experienced veterans, while many of Pompey&#x27;s were new recruits, a weakness made worse by lack of co-ordination. Cato&#x27;s brother-in-law, the &quot;optimate&quot; leader Lucius Domitius, was cut off and captured in a hopeless defence of Corfinium, and his 13,000 men incorporated into Caesar&#x27;s army. Led by Asinius Pollio, they were later used to occupy Sicily.

Pompey had abandoned Rome, ordering all senators and public officials to accompany him as he withdrew south to Brundisium. From there, he transported his troops across the Adriatic to Dyrrhachium in Thessaly, an operation performed with almost complete success. Lacking ships to pursue him, Caesar first secured his rear by subduing Pompeian forces in Hispania, before returning to Rome in December 49 BC. This gave Pompey time to build an army nearly twice the size of his opponents, while his navy destroyed two fleets being built for Caesar, ensuring the Pompeians retained control of the sea lanes.

Despite this, in January 48 BC Caesar managed to cross the Adriatic with seven legions and land in southern Albania. After capturing Oricum and Apollonia, he advanced on Pompey&#x27;s main supply base at Dyrrhachium. The latter arrived in time to block the attempt, and establish a fortified camp on the other side of the River Apus, where the two armies remained until spring. Neither commander was anxious to begin hostilities, since Caesar was too weak militarily, while as with Mithridates, Pompey preferred to starve his opponent into submission. 

In late March the stalemate was broken when Mark Antony finally managed to cross the Adriatic with four more legions and land at Nymphaeum, some 57 kilometres north of Dyrrachium. Pompey tried to prevent the two Caesarian armies from linking up, by marching north-east and laying an ambush for Antony. The ambush, however, was revealed to Antony by some local Caesarian sympathisers, and he stayed in camp until Caesar approached. Pompey not willing to be caught between the two Caesarian forces withdrew.

Caesar, his army now united with Antony&#x27;s force, redeployed his forces by sending one-and-a-half legion to win support and gather supplies in Aetolia and Thessaly, and a further two legions under Domitius Calvinus to intercept Metellus Scipio in Macedonia. Meanwhile, Gnaeus, Pompey&#x27;s oldest son, managed to destroy Caesar&#x27;s fleet at Oricum and Lissus, making sure no more reinforcements and supplies would reach Caesar from Italy. Caesar tried to lure Pompey into a pitched battle at Asparagium, but the latter refused. The next day Caesar outmaneuvred Pompey and marched for Dyrrachium again. When Pompey arrived at the city Caesar had already set up camp.

Caesar lacked the siege equipment needed to take Dyrrhachium, and could not risk leaving Pompey to threaten his rear. He solved this by besieging Pompey in his camp. Although the latter had enough food, water was scarce because Caesar had dammed the local rivers, and the Pompeian cavalry lacked forage for their horses. Ending the stalemate became a matter of urgency, and in late July Pompey finally managed to break through part of Caesar&#x27;s defensive lines. Since this made the blockade pointless, Caesar cut his losses and withdrew to Apollonia.

At this point Metellus Scipio arrived in Thessaly. Caesar moved south to confront this threat and link up with Domitius Calvinus, allowing his men to sack Gomphi en route. Pursued by Pompey, he then withdrew to the area near Pharsalus, but failed to tempt Pompey into giving battle. Although it was later claimed Pompey only did so after being pressured by his subordinates, the delay may simply have been a reflection of his natural caution.

Regardless, Pompey&#x27;s army of around 38,000 outnumbered the 22,000 men commanded by Caesar, with 7,000 cavalry to 1,000. On 9 August he deployed his men in battle formation, planning to use his superior cavalry to outflank his opponent on his left. Caesar had anticipated this, and repulsed the cavalry which fled in confusion, exposing the infantry behind them. Under pressure from the left and in front, the Pompeian army collapsed.

==Death==

Pompey escaped from the battlefield and made his way to Mytilene, where he was reunited with his wife Cornelia. Most of his Eastern allies were present at Pharsalus and had either been killed or captured. The main absentee was 14-year-old Ptolemy XIII, ruler of the wealthy and strategically important kingdom of Egypt, making it an obvious destination. Cato announced his intention to continue the war from Africa, although most of his senatorial colleagues, including Cicero and Marcus Junius Brutus, made their peace with Caesar and returned to Rome.

Pompey sailed from Cyprus with a small fleet, and on 28 September 48 BC arrived at Pelusium in Egypt, where Ptolemy was engaged in a bitter civil war with his co-ruler and elder sister, Cleopatra VII. When he went ashore to greet an official delegation, Pompey was killed by Lucius Septimius, a Roman officer and former colleague serving in the Egyptian army. His body was cremated by two servants, while the head was kept as evidence. 

One suggestion is that Ptolemy and his advisors feared Pompey planned to seize control of Egypt, especially since many Egyptian army officers were Roman mercenaries like Septimius who had previously served with him. At the same time, it seemed an easy way to win Caesar&#x27;s support against Cleopatra, although ultimately this proved not to be the case. Pompey&#x27;s head was later returned to Cornelia for burial at his villa in the Alban Hills, while his ignominious death prompted Cicero to write &quot;his life outlasted his power&quot;.

==Marriages and issue==

Pompey had five wives:
* Antistia. They married in 86 BC and divorced in 82 BC. By her he had no issue.
* Aemilia Scaura. When they married in 82 BC, Aemilia was pregnant by her former husband and died in childbirth in the same year.
* Mucia Tertia. They married in 79 BC and divorced in 61 BC. By her he had two sons and a daughter:
** Gnaeus Pompeus
** Pompeia
** Sextus Pompeus 
* Julia, the daughter of Julius Caesar. They married in 59 BC and she died in childbirth in 54 BC. The child died a few days after birth.
* Cornelia Metella. They married in 52 BC and had no children together.

==Generalship==

Pompey&#x27;s military glory was second to none for two decades, yet his skills were occasionally criticized by some of his contemporaries. Sertorius or Lucullus, for instance, were especially critical. Pompey&#x27;s tactics were usually efficient, albeit not particularly innovative or imaginative, and they could prove insufficient against greater tacticians. However, Pharsalus was his only decisive defeat. At times, he was reluctant to risk an open battle. While not extremely charismatic, Pompey could display tremendous bravery and fighting skills on the battlefield, which inspired his men. While being a superb commander, Pompey also earned a reputation for stealing other generals&#x27; victories.

On the other hand, Pompey is usually considered an outstanding strategist and organizer, who could win campaigns without displaying genius on the battlefield, but simply by constantly outmaneuvering his opponents and gradually pushing them into a desperate situation. Pompey was a great forward planner, and had tremendous organizational skill, which allowed him to devise grand strategies and operate effectively with large armies. During his campaigns in the east, he relentlessly pursued his enemies, choosing the ground for his battles.

Above all, he was often able to adapt to his enemies and showed determination. On many occasions, he acted very swiftly and decisively, as he did during his campaigns in Sicily and Africa, or against the Cilician pirates. During the Sertorian war, on the other hand, Pompey was beaten several times by Sertorius. Despite an abysmal first year of the war for Pompey in 76 BC, he continued to campaign vigorously and as a result defeated many of Sertorius&#x27; subordinates. After Sertorius&#x27; army was greatly diminished, Pompey then decided to conduct a war of attrition, in which he would avoid open battles against his chief opponent but instead tried to gradually regain the strategic advantage by capturing his fortresses and cities and defeating his junior officers. This strategy was unspectacular, but it led to constant territorial gains and did much to demoralize the Sertorian forces. By 73 or 72 BC, when he was assassinated, Sertorius was already in a desperate situation and his troops were deserting. Against Perperna, a tactician far inferior to his former commander-in-chief, Pompey decided to revert to a more aggressive strategy and he scored a decisive victory that effectively ended the war.

Against Caesar too, his strategy was sound. During the campaign in Greece, he managed to regain the initiative, join his forces to that of Metellus Scipio (something that Caesar wanted to avoid) and trap his enemy. His strategic position was hence much better than that of Caesar and he could have starved Caesar&#x27;s army to death. However, he was finally compelled to fight an open battle by his allies, and his conventional tactics proved no match to those of Caesar (who also commanded the more experienced troops).

== Literary heritage ==
Pompey was so striking a figure, and his fall so dramatic, that his story became the subject of frequent literary treatment. In the century after his death, the civil war between himself and Caesar was retold in Lucan&#x27;s epic &quot;De Bello Civili&quot;, now known as the &quot;Pharsalia&quot; after the culminating battle. In the poem&#x27;s final sections, however, Pompey&#x27;s vengeful ghost returns to possess those responsible for his murder in Egypt and bring about their death.

In Renaissance Britain, too, several plays returned to the subject of &quot;Caesar and Pompey&quot;, including George Chapman&#x27;s &quot;The Wars of Pompey and Caesar&quot; (c. 1604). Another contemporary treatment by Thomas Kyd, &quot;Cornelia, or Pompey the Great, his faire Cornelia&#x27;s tragedy&quot; (1594), was a translation from the French of Robert Garnier. Later in France, Pompey&#x27;s story was told without the character appearing onstage in Pierre Corneille&#x27;s &quot;La Mort de Pompée&quot; (1643) and this too had English adaptations: as &quot;Pompey&quot; (1663) by Catherine Philips, as &quot;Pompey the Great&quot; by Edmund Waller and others in 1664, and later as &quot;The Death of Pompey&quot; (1724) by Colley Cibber.

Later in the 18th century, Pompey is made the recipient of a &#x27;heroical epistle&#x27; in rhyming couplets from a supposed former lover in John Hervey&#x27;s &quot;Flora to Pompey&quot;. He also figures in narrative poems of the 19th century. John Edmund Reade&#x27;s &quot;The Vale of Tempe&quot; records the fugitive&#x27;s desperate appearance as glimpsed by a bystander in the Greek valley; his arrival in Egypt is related by Alaric Watts in &quot;The Death of Pompey the Great&quot;, and the ruined column raised to mark the site of his killing outside Alexandria is described by Nicholas Michell in &quot;Ruins of Many Lands&quot;. These were followed by John Masefield&#x27;s prose drama &quot;The Tragedy of Pompey the Great&quot; of 1910, covering the period from his decision to fight Caesar to his assassination in Egypt. The play was later filmed for television in 1950 for the &quot;BBC Sunday Night Theatre&quot;.

Pompey&#x27;s career is recapitulated a century later in series of historical novels. In Colleen McCullough&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Rome&quot;, Pompey is mainly featured in Books III-V, covering his rise to prominence through to his betrayal and murder in Egypt. Pompey is also a recurring character in Steven Saylor&#x27;s &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; crime fiction novels, where he brushes shoulders with Gordianus, the main protagonist of the series. Another fiction series in which Pompey plays a part in the historical background is Robert Harris&#x27;s trilogy of the life of Cicero.

<doc id="23871" wikidata="Q178" url="?curid=23871" title="Pasta">
<text>Pasta (, ; ) is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Pasta was originally only made with durum, although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet, such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils. Pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine, with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.

Pastas are divided into two broad categories: dried () and fresh (Italian: ). Most dried pasta is produced commercially via an extrusion process, although it can be produced at home. Fresh pasta is traditionally produced by hand, sometimes with the aid of simple machines. Fresh pastas available in grocery stores are produced commercially by large-scale machines.

Both dried and fresh pastas come in a number of shapes and varieties, with 310 specific forms known by over 1,300 documented names. In Italy, the names of specific pasta shapes or types often vary by locale. For example, the pasta form is known by 28 different names depending upon the town and region. Common forms of pasta include long and short shapes, tubes, flat shapes or sheets, miniature shapes for soup, those meant to be filled or stuffed, and specialty or decorative shapes.

As a category in Italian cuisine, both fresh and dried pastas are classically used in one of three kinds of prepared dishes: as (or ), cooked pasta is plated and served with a complementary sauce or condiment; a second classification of pasta dishes is , in which the pasta is part of a soup-type dish. A third category is , in which the pasta is incorporated into a dish that is subsequently baked in the oven. Pasta dishes are generally simple, but individual dishes vary in preparation. Some pasta dishes are served as a small first course or for light lunches, such as pasta salads. Other dishes may be portioned larger and used for dinner. Pasta sauces similarly may vary in taste, color and texture.

In terms of nutrition, cooked plain pasta is 31% carbohydrates (mostly starch), 6% protein, and low in fat, with moderate amounts of manganese, but pasta generally has low micronutrient content. Pasta may be enriched or fortified, or made from whole grains.

==Etymology==
Earliest appearances in the English language are in the 1830s; the word &quot;pasta&quot; comes from Italian , in turn from Latin , latinisation of the .

==History==

Evidence of Etruscans making pasta dates back to 400 BCE. The first concrete information on pasta products in Italy dates to the 13th or 14th centuries.
In the 1st-century writings of Horace, (: ) were fine sheets of fried dough and were an everyday foodstuff. Writing in the 2nd century, Athenaeus of Naucratis provides a recipe for which he attributes to the 1st-century Chrysippus of Tyana: sheets of dough made of wheat flour and the juice of crushed lettuce, then flavored with spices and deep-fried in oil. An early 5th-century cookbook describes a dish called that consisted of layers of dough with meat stuffing, an ancestor of modern-day lasagna. However, the method of cooking these sheets of dough does not correspond to the modern definition of either a fresh or dry pasta product, which only had similar basic ingredients and perhaps the shape.

Historians have noted several lexical milestones relevant to pasta, none of which changes these basic characteristics. For example, the works of the 2nd-century Greek physician Galen mention , homogeneous compounds made of flour and water. The Jerusalem Talmud records that , a kind of boiled dough, was common in Palestine from the 3rd to 5th centuries. A dictionary compiled by the 9th-century Arab physician and lexicographer Isho bar Ali defines , the Arabic cognate, as string-like shapes made of semolina and dried before cooking. 

The geographical text of Muhammad al-Idrisi, compiled for the Norman King of Sicily Roger II in 1154 mentions manufactured and exported from Norman Sicily:

One form of with a long history is , which in Latin refers to thin sheets of dough, and gave rise to the Italian .


In North Africa, a food similar to pasta, known as couscous, has been eaten for centuries. However, it lacks the distinguishing malleable nature of pasta, couscous being more akin to droplets of dough. At first, dry pasta was a luxury item in Italy because of high labor costs; durum wheat semolina had to be kneaded for a long time.

There is a legend of Marco Polo importing pasta from China which originated with the &quot;Macaroni Journal&quot;, published by an association of food industries with the goal of promoting pasta in the United States. Rustichello da Pisa writes in his &quot;Travels&quot; that Marco Polo described a food similar to . The way pasta reached Europe is unknown, however there are many theories, Jeffrey Steingarten asserts that Moors introduced pasta in the Emirate of Sicily in the ninth century, mentioning also that traces of pasta have been found in ancient Greece and that Jane Grigson believed the Marco Polo story to have originated in the 1920s or 1930s in an advertisement for a Canadian spaghetti company.

Food historians estimate that the dish probably took hold in Italy as a result of extensive Mediterranean trading in the Middle Ages. From the 13th century, references to pasta dishes—macaroni, ravioli, gnocchi, vermicelli—crop up with increasing frequency across the Italian peninsula. In the 14th-century writer Boccaccio&#x27;s collection of earthy tales, &quot;The Decameron&quot;, he recounts a mouthwatering fantasy concerning a mountain of Parmesan cheese down which pasta chefs roll macaroni and ravioli to gluttons waiting below.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, dried pasta became popular for its easy storage. This allowed people to store pasta on ships when exploring the New World. A century later, pasta was present around the globe during the voyages of discovery.

Although tomatoes were introduced to Italy in the 16th century and incorporated in Italian cuisine in the 17th century, description of the first Italian tomato sauces dates from the late 18th century: the first written record of pasta with tomato sauce can be found in the 1790 cookbook by Roman chef Francesco Leonardi. Before tomato sauce was introduced, pasta was eaten dry with the fingers; the liquid sauce demanded the use of a fork.

===History of manufacturing===
At the beginning of the 17th century, Naples had rudimentary machines for producing pasta, later establishing the kneading machine and press, making pasta manufacturing cost-effective. In 1740, a license for the first pasta factory was issued in Venice. During the 1800s, watermills and stone grinders were used to separate semolina from the bran, initiating expansion of the pasta market. In 1859, Joseph Topits (1824−1876) founded Hungary&#x27;s first pasta factory, in the city of Pest, which worked with steam machines; it was one of the first pasta factories in Central Europe. By 1867, Buitoni Company in Sansepolcro, Tuscany, was an established pasta manufacturer. During the early 1900s, artificial drying and extrusion processes enabled greater variety of pasta preparation and larger volumes for export, beginning a period called &quot;The Industry of Pasta&quot;. In 1884, the Zátka Brothers&#x27;s plant in Boršov nad Vltavou was founded, making it Bohemia&#x27;s first pasta factory.

===In modern times===
The art of pasta making and the devotion to the food as a whole has evolved since pasta was first conceptualized. In 2008, it was estimated that Italians ate over of pasta per person, per year, easily beating Americans, who ate about per person. Pasta is so beloved in Italy that individual consumption exceeds the average production of wheat of the country; thus, Italy frequently imports wheat for pasta making. In contemporary society, pasta is ubiquitous and there is a variety of types in local supermarkets, in many countries. With the worldwide demand for this staple food, pasta is now largely mass-produced in factories and only a tiny proportion is crafted by hand.

==Ingredients and preparation==

Since at least the time of Cato&#x27;s , basic pasta dough has been made mostly of wheat flour or semolina, with durum wheat used predominantly in the south of Italy and soft wheat in the north. Regionally other grains have been used, including those from barley, buckwheat, rye, rice, and maize, as well as chestnut and chickpea flours. Liquid, often in the form of eggs, is used to turn the flour into a dough.

To address the needs of people affected by gluten-related disorders (such as coeliac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers), some recipes use rice or maize for making pasta. Grain flours may also be supplemented with cooked potatoes.

Other additions to the basic flour-liquid mixture may include vegetable purees such as spinach or tomato, mushrooms, cheeses, herbs, spices and other seasonings. While pastas are, most typically, made from unleavened doughs, at least nine different pasta forms are known to use yeast-raised doughs.

Additives in dried, commercially sold pasta include vitamins and minerals that are lost from the durum wheat endosperm during milling. They are added back to the semolina flour once it is ground, creating enriched flour. Micronutrients added may include niacin (vitamin B3), riboflavin (vitamin B2), folate, thiamine (vitamin B1), and ferrous iron.

==Varieties==

===Fresh===
Fresh pasta is usually locally made with fresh ingredients unless it is destined to be shipped, in which case consideration is given to the spoilage rates of the desired ingredients such as eggs or herbs. Furthermore, fresh pasta is usually made with a mixture of eggs and all-purpose flour or &quot;00&quot; low-gluten flour. Since it contains eggs, it is more tender compared to dried pasta and only takes about half the time to cook. Delicate sauces are preferred for fresh pasta in order to let the pasta take front stage.

Fresh pastas do not expand in size after cooking; therefore, of pasta are needed to serve four people generously. Fresh egg pasta is generally cut into strands of various widths and thicknesses depending on which pasta is to be made (e.g., fettuccine, pappardelle, and lasagne). It is best served with meat, cheese, or vegetables to create filled pastas such as ravioli, tortellini, and cannelloni. Fresh egg pasta is well known in the Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna regions of northern Italy. In this area, dough is only made out of egg yolk and flour resulting in a very refined flavor and texture. This pasta is often served simply with butter sauce and thinly sliced truffles that are native to this region. In other areas, such as Apulia, fresh pasta can be made without eggs. The only ingredients needed to make the pasta dough are semolina flour and water, which is often shaped into orecchiette or . Fresh pasta for is also popular in other places including Sicily. However, the dough is prepared differently: it is made of flour and ricotta cheese instead.

===Dried===
Dried pasta can also be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually produced in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture. Dried pasta can be shipped further and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make dried pasta include semolina flour and water. Eggs can be added for flavor and richness, but are not needed to make dried pasta. In contrast to fresh pasta, dried pasta needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. Dried pastas are best served in hearty dishes, such as ragù sauces, soups, and casseroles. Once it is cooked, the dried pasta will usually grow to twice its original size. Therefore, approximately of dried pasta serves up to four people.

==Culinary uses==

===Cooking===
Pasta, whether dry or fresh, is eaten after cooking it in hot water. For Italian pasta, which is unsalted, salt is added to the cooking water. This is not the case for Asian wheat noodles, such as udon and lo mein, which are made from salty dough.

In Italy, pasta is often cooked to be al dente, such that it is still firm to the bite. This is because it is then often cooked in the sauce for a short time, which makes it soften further.

There are a number of urban myths about how pasta should be cooked. In fact, it does not generally matter whether pasta is cooked at a lower or a higher temperature, although lower temperatures require more stirring to avoid sticking, and certain stuffed pasta, such as tortellini, break up in higher temperatures. It also does not matter whether salt is added before or after bringing the water to a boil. The amount of salt has no influence on cooking speed.

===Sauce===
Pasta is generally served with some type of sauce; the sauce and the type of pasta are usually matched based on consistency and ease of eating. Northern Italian cooking uses less tomato sauce, garlic and herbs, and béchamel sauce is more common. However, Italian cuisine is best identified by individual regions. Pasta dishes with lighter use of tomato are found in Trentino-Alto Adige and Emilia-Romagna regions of northern Italy. In Bologna, the meat-based Bolognese sauce incorporates a small amount of tomato concentrate and a green sauce called pesto originates from Genoa. In central Italy, there are sauces such as tomato sauce, , , and the egg-based carbonara.

Tomato sauces are also present in southern Italian cuisine, where they originated. In southern Italy more complex variations include pasta paired with fresh vegetables, olives, capers or seafood. Varieties include , (tomatoes, eggplant and fresh or baked cheese), (fresh sardines, pine nuts, fennel and olive oil), (), (crispy peppers and breadcrumbs).

Pasta can be served also in broth (pastina, or stuffed pasta, such as tortellini, and ) or in vegetable soup, typically minestrone or bean soup ().

==Processing==
===Fresh===

Ingredients to make pasta dough include semolina flour, egg, salt and water. Flour is first mounded on a flat surface and then a well in the pile of flour is created. Egg is then poured into the well and a fork is used to mix the egg and flour. There are a variety of ways to shape the sheets of pasta depending on the type required. The most popular types include penne, spaghetti, and macaroni.

Kitchen pasta machines, also called pasta makers, are popular with cooks who make large amounts of fresh pasta. The cook feeds sheets of pasta dough into the machine by hand and, by turning a hand crank, rolls the pasta to thin it incrementally. On the final pass through the pasta machine, the pasta may be directed through a machine &#x27;comb&#x27; to shape of the pasta as it emerges.

===Matrix and extrusion===
Semolina flour consists of a protein matrix with entrapped starch granules. Upon the addition of water, during mixing, intermolecular forces allow the protein to form a more ordered structure in preparation for cooking.

Durum wheat is ground into semolina flour which is sorted by optical scanners and cleaned. Pipes allow the flour to move to a mixing machine where it is mixed with warm water by rotating blades. When the mixture is of a lumpy consistency, the mixture is pressed into sheets or extruded. Varieties of pasta such as spaghetti and linguine are cut by rotating blades, while pasta such as penne and fusilli are extruded. The size and shape of the dies in the extruder through which the pasta is pushed determine the shape that results. The pasta is then dried at a high temperature.

===Factory-manufactured===
The ingredients to make dried pasta usually include water and semolina flour; egg for color and richness (in some types of pasta), and possibly vegetable juice (such as spinach, beet, tomato, carrot), herbs or spices for color and flavor. After mixing semolina flour with warm water the dough is kneaded mechanically until it becomes firm and dry. If pasta is to be flavored, eggs, vegetable juices, and herbs are added at this stage. The dough is then passed into the laminator to be flattened into sheets, then compressed by a vacuum mixer-machine to clear out air bubbles and excess water from the dough until the moisture content is reduced to 12%. Next, the dough is processed in a steamer to kill any bacteria it may contain.

The dough is then ready to be shaped into different types of pasta. Depending on the type of pasta to be made, the dough can either be cut or extruded through dies. The pasta is set in a drying tank under specific conditions of heat, moisture, and time depending on the type of pasta. The dried pasta is then packaged: Fresh pasta is sealed in a clear, airtight plastic container with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that inhibits microbial growth and prolongs the product&#x27;s shelf life; dried pastas are sealed in clear plastic or cardboard packages.

===Gluten-free===
Gluten, the protein found in grains such as wheat, rye, spelt, and barley, contributes to protein aggregation and firm texture of a normally cooked pasta. Gluten-free pasta is produced with wheat flour substitutes, such as vegetable powders, rice, corn, quinoa, amaranth, oats and buckwheat flours. Other possible gluten-free pasta ingredients may include hydrocolloids to improve cooking pasta with high heat resistance, xanthan gum to retain moisture during storage, or hydrothermally-treated polysaccharide mixtures to produce textures similar to those of wheat pasta.

===Storage===
The storage of pasta depends on its processing and extent of drying. Uncooked pasta is kept dry and can sit in the cupboard for a year if airtight and stored in a cool, dry area. Cooked pasta is stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of five days in an airtight container. Adding a couple teaspoons of oil helps keep the food from sticking to itself and the container. Cooked pasta may be frozen for up to two or three months. Should the pasta be dried completely, it can be placed back in the cupboard.

==Science==

===Molecular and physical composition===
Pasta exhibits a random molecular order rather than a crystalline structure. The moisture content of dried pasta is typically around 12%, indicating that dried pasta will remain a brittle solid until it is cooked and becomes malleable. The cooked product is, as a result, softer, more flexible, and chewy.

Semolina flour is the ground endosperm of durum wheat, producing granules that absorb water during heating and an increase in viscosity due to semi-reordering of starch molecules.

Another major component of durum wheat is protein which plays a large role in pasta dough rheology. Gluten proteins, which include monomeric gliadins and polymeric glutenin, make up the major protein component of durum wheat (about 75–80%). As more water is added and shear stress is applied, gluten proteins take on an elastic characteristic and begin to form strands and sheets. The gluten matrix that results during forming of the dough becomes irreversibly associated during drying as the moisture content is lowered to form the dried pasta product.

===Impact of processing on physical structure===
Before the mixing process takes place, semolina particles are irregularly shaped and present in different sizes. Semolina particles become hydrated during mixing. The amount of water added to the semolina is determined based on the initial moisture content of the flour and the desired shape of the pasta. The desired moisture content of the dough is around 32% wet basis and will vary depending on the shape of pasta being produced.

The forming process involves the dough entering an extruder in which the rotation of a single or double screw system pushes the dough toward a die set to a specific shape. As the starch granules swell slightly in the presence of water and a low amount of thermal energy, they become embedded within the protein matrix and align along the direction of the shear caused by the extrusion process.

Starch gelatinization and protein coagulation are the major changes that take place when pasta is cooked in boiling water. Protein and starch competing for water within the pasta cause a constant change in structure as the pasta cooks.

==Production and market==
In 2015–16, the largest producers of dried pasta were Italy (3.2 million tonnes), the United States (2 million tonnes), Turkey (1.3 million tons), Brazil (1.2 million tonnes), and Russia (1 million tons). In 2018, Italy was the world&#x27;s largest exporter of pasta, with $2.9 billion sold, followed by China with $0.9 billion.

The largest per capita consumers of pasta in 2015 were Italy (23.5kg/person), Tunisia (16.0kg/person), Venezuela (12.0kg/person) and Greece (11.2kg/person). In 2017, the United States was the largest consumer of pasta with 2.7 million tons.

==Nutrition==
When cooked, plain pasta is composed of 62% water, 31% carbohydrates (26% starch), 6% protein, and 1% fat. A portion of unenriched cooked pasta provides of food energy and a moderate level of manganese (15% of the Daily Value), but few other micronutrients.

Pasta has a lower glycemic index than many other staple foods in Western culture, such as bread, potatoes, and rice.

==International adaptations==
As pasta was introduced elsewhere in the world, it became incorporated into a number of local cuisines, which often have significantly different ways of preparation from those of Italy. When pasta was introduced to different nations, each culture would adopt a different style of preparation. In the past, ancient Romans cooked pasta-like foods by frying rather than boiling. It was also sweetened with honey or tossed with garum. Ancient Romans also enjoyed baking it in rich pies, called timballi.

===Africa===
Countries such as Somalia, Ethiopia, and Eritrea were introduced to pasta from colonization and occupation through the Italian Empire, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Southern Somalia has a dish called which has a meat sauce, typically beef based, with their local spice mix. In Ethiopia, pasta can also be served over , where it is also eaten with hands instead of cutlery. A dollop of bolognese with spice blend can be served on the side.

===Asia===
In Hong Kong, the local Chinese have adopted pasta, primarily spaghetti and macaroni, as an ingredient in the Hong Kong–style Western cuisine. In , macaroni is cooked in water and served in broth with ham or frankfurter sausages, peas, black mushrooms, and optionally eggs, reminiscent of noodle soup dishes. This is often a course for breakfast or light lunch fare. These affordable dining shops evolved from American food rations after World War II due to lack of supplies, and they continue to be popular for people with modest means.

Two common spaghetti dishes served in Japan are the Bolognese and the Naporitan.

In Nepal, macaroni has been adopted and cooked in a Nepalese way. Boiled macaroni is sautéed along with cumin, turmeric, finely chopped green chillies, onions and cabbage.

In the Philippines, spaghetti is often served with a distinct, slightly sweet yet flavorful meat sauce (based on tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork and diced hot dogs and ham. It is spiced with soy sauce, heavy quantities of garlic, dried oregano sprigs and sometimes with dried bay leaf, and topped with grated cheese. Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in Filipino kitchens, such as carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are often cooked for gatherings and special occasions, such as family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in , a local chicken broth soup.

===Europe===
In Armenia, a popular traditional pasta called arishta is first dry pan toasted so as slightly golden, and then boiled to make the pasta dish which is often topped with yogurt, butter and garlic.

In Greece, is considered one of the finest types of dried egg pasta. It is cooked either in tomato sauce or with various kinds of casserole meat. It is usually served with Greek cheese of any type.

In Sweden, spaghetti is traditionally served with (Bolognese sauce), which is minced meat in a thick tomato soup.

Twice a year, hundreds of people in Sardinia make a nighttime pilgrimage from the city of Nuoro to the village of Lula for the biannual Feast of San Francesco, where they eat what is possibly the world&#x27;s rarest pasta. ( in the Sardinian language) is an incredibly intricate semolina pasta made by just three women who only make the pasta for the festival.

===South America===
Pasta is also widespread in the Southern Cone, as well most of the rest of Brazil, mostly pervasive in the areas with mild to strong Italian roots, such as Central Argentina, and the eight southernmost Brazilian states (where macaroni is called , and more general pasta is known under the umbrella term , , together with some Japanese noodles, such as &quot;bifum&quot; rice vermicelli and yakisoba, which also entered general taste). The local names for the pasta are many times varieties of the Italian names, such as for gnocchi, for ravioli, or for tagliatelle, although some of the most popular pasta in Brazil, such as the (&#x27;screw&#x27;, &#x27;bolt&#x27;), a specialty of the country&#x27;s pasta salads, are also way different both in name and format from its closest Italian relatives, in this case the fusilli.

===North America===
In the United States, fettuccine Alfredo is a popular Italian-style dish.

===Oceania===
In Australia, boscaiola sauce, based on bacon and mushrooms, is popular.

==Regulations==
===Italy===

Although numerous variations of ingredients for different pasta products are known, in Italy the commercial manufacturing and labeling of pasta for sale as a food product within the country is highly regulated. Italian regulations recognize three categories of commercially manufactured dried pasta as well as manufactured fresh and stabilized pasta:

* Pasta, or dried pasta with three subcategories – (i.) Durum wheat semolina pasta (), (ii.) Low grade durum wheat semolina pasta () and (iii.) Durum wheat whole meal pasta (). Pastas made under this category must be made only with durum wheat semolina or durum wheat whole-meal semolina and water, with an allowance for up to 3% of soft-wheat flour as part of the durum flour. Dried pastas made under this category must be labeled according to the subcategory.
* Special pastas (&quot;paste speciali&quot;) – As with the pasta above, with additional ingredients other than flour and water or eggs. Special pastas must be labeled as durum wheat semolina pasta on the packaging completed by mentioning the added ingredients used (e.g., spinach). The 3% soft flour limitation still applies.
* Egg pasta () – May only be manufactured using durum wheat semolina with at least 4 hens&#x27; eggs (chicken) weighing at least (without the shells) per kilogram of semolina, or a liquid egg product produced only with hen&#x27;s eggs. Pasta made and sold in Italy under this category must be labeled egg pasta.
* Fresh and stabilized pastas () – Includes fresh and stabilized pastas, which may be made with soft-wheat flour without restriction on the amount. Prepackaged fresh pasta must have a water content not less than 24%, must be stored refrigerated at a temperature of not more than (with a tolerance), must have undergone a heat treatment at least equivalent to pasteurisation, and must be sold within five days of the date of manufacture. Stabilized pasta has a lower allowed water content of 20%, and is manufactured using a process and heat treatment that allows it to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures.

The Italian regulations under Presidential Decree No. 187 apply only to the commercial manufacturing of pastas both made and sold within Italy. They are not applicable either to pasta made for export from Italy or to pastas imported into Italy from other countries. They also do not apply to pastas made in restaurants.

===United States===
In the US, regulations for commercial pasta products occur both at the federal and state levels. At the Federal level, consistent with Section 341 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has defined standards of identity for what are broadly termed &quot;macaroni products&quot;. These standards appear in 21 CFR Part 139. Those regulations state the requirements for standardized &quot;macaroni products&quot; of 15 specific types of dried pastas, including the ingredients and product-specific labeling for conforming products sold in the US, including imports:

* Macaroni products – defined as the class of food prepared by drying formed units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour, or any combination of those ingredients with water. Within this category various optional ingredients may also be used within specified ranges, including egg white, frozen egg white or dried egg white alone or in any combination; disodium phosphate; onions, celery, garlic or bay leaf, alone or in any combination; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate. Specific dimensions are given for the shapes named macaroni, spaghetti and vermicelli.
** Enriched macaroni products – largely the same as &quot;macaroni products&quot; except that each such food must contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin or niacinamide, folic acid and iron, with specified limits. Additional optional ingredients that may be added include vitamin D, calcium, and defatted wheat germ. The optional ingredients specified may be supplied through the use of dried yeast, dried torula yeast, partly defatted wheat germ, enriched farina, or enriched flour.
** Enriched macaroni products with fortified protein – similar to &quot;enriched macaroni products&quot; with the addition of other ingredients to meet specific protein requirements. Edible protein sources that may be used include food grade flours or meals from nonwheat cereals or oilseeds. Products in this category must include specified amounts of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin or niacinamide and iron, but not folic acid. The products in this category may also optionally contain up to of calcium.
** Milk macaroni products – the same as &quot;macaroni products&quot; except that milk or a specified milk product is used as the sole moistening ingredient in preparing the dough. Other than milk, allowed milk products include concentrated milk, evaporated milk, dried milk, and a mixture of butter with skim, concentrated skim, evaporated skim, or nonfat dry milk, in any combination, with the limitation on the amount of milk solids relative to amount of milk fat.
** Nonfat milk macaroni products – the same as &quot;macaroni products&quot; except that nonfat dry milk or concentrated skim milk is used in preparing the dough. The finished macaroni product must contain between 12% and 25% milk solids-not-fat. Carageenan or carageenan salts may be added in specified amounts. The use of egg whites, disodium phosphate and gum gluten optionally allowed for &quot;macaroni products&quot; is not permitted for this category.
*** Enriched nonfat milk macaroni products – similar to &quot;nonfat milk macaroni products&quot; with added requirements that products in this category contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin or niacinamide, folic acid and iron, all within specified ranges.
** Vegetable macaroni products – &quot;macaroni products&quot; except that tomato (of any red variety), artichoke, beet, carrot, parsley or spinach is added in a quantity such that the solids of the added component are at least 3% by weight of the finished macaroni product. The vegetable additions may be in the form of fresh, canned, dried or a puree or paste. The addition of either the various forms of egg whites or disodium phosphate allowed for &quot;macaroni products&quot; is not permitted in this category.
*** Enriched vegetable macaroni products – the same as &quot;vegetable macaroni products&quot; with the added requirement for nutrient content specified for &quot;enriched macaroni products&quot;.
** Whole wheat macaroni products – similar to &quot;macaroni products&quot; except that only whole wheat flour or whole wheat durum flour, or both, may be used as the wheat ingredient. Further the addition of the various forms of egg whites, disodium phosphate and gum gluten are not permitted.
** Wheat and soy macaroni products – begins as &quot;macaroni products&quot; with the addition of at least 12.5% of soy flour as a fraction of the total soy and wheat flour used. The addition the various forms of egg whites and disodium phosphate are not permitted. Gum gluten may be added with a limitation that the total protein content derived from the combination of the flours and added gluten not exceed 13%.
* Noodle products – the class of food that is prepared by drying units of dough made from semolina, durum flour, farina, flour, alone or in any combination with liquid eggs, frozen eggs, dried eggs, egg yolks, frozen yolks, dried yolks, alone or in any combination, with or without water. Optional ingredients that may be added in allowed amounts are onions, celery, garlic, and bay leaf; salt; gum gluten; and concentrated glyceryl monostearate.
** Enriched noodle products – similar to &quot;noodle products&quot; with the addition of specific requirements for amounts of thiamin, riboflavin, niacin or niacinamide, folic acid and iron, each within specified ranges. Additionally products in this category may optionally contain added vitamin D, calcium or defatted wheat germ, each within specified limits.
** Vegetable noodle products – the same as &quot;noodle products&quot; with the addition of tomato (of any red variety), artichoke, beet, carrot, parsley, or spinach in an amount that is at least 3% of the finished product weight. The vegetable component may be added as fresh, canned, dried, or in the form of a puree or paste.
*** Enriched vegetable noodle products – the same as &quot;vegetable noodle products&quot; excluding carrot, with the specified nutrient requirements for &quot;enriched noodle products&quot;.
** Wheat and soy noodle products – similar to &quot;noodle products&quot; except that soy flour is added in a quantity not less than 12.5% of the combined weight of the wheat and soy ingredients.

====State mandates====
The federal regulations under 21 CFR Part 139 are standards for the products noted, not mandates. Following the FDA&#x27;s standards, a number of states have, at various times, enacted their own statutes that serve as mandates for various forms of macaroni and noodle products that may be produced or sold within their borders. Many of these specifically require that the products sold within those states be of the enriched form. According to a report released by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research, when Connecticut&#x27;s law was adopted in 1972 that mandated certain grain products, including macaroni products, sold within the state to be enriched it joined 38 to 40 other states in adopting the federal standards as mandates.

====USDA school nutrition====
Beyond the FDA&#x27;s standards and state statutes, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which regulates federal school nutrition programs, broadly requires grain and bread products served under these programs either be enriched or whole grain (see 7 CFR 210.10 (k) (5)). This includes macaroni and noodle products that are served as part the category grains/breads requirements within those programs. The USDA also allows that enriched macaroni products fortified with protein may be used and counted to meet either a grains/breads or meat/alternative meat requirement, but not as both components within the same meal.

<text>In polymer chemistry, polymerization (American English), or polymerisation (British English), is a process of reacting monomer molecules together in a chemical reaction to form polymer chains or three-dimensional networks. There are many forms of polymerization and different systems exist to categorize them.

In chemical compounds, polymerization can occur via a variety of reaction mechanisms that vary in complexity due to the functional groups present in the reactants and their inherent steric effects. In more straightforward polymerizations, alkenes form polymers through relatively simple radical reactions; in contrast, reactions involving substitution at a carbonyl group require more complex synthesis due to the way in which reactants polymerize.

As alkenes can polymerize in somewhat straightforward radical reactions, they form useful compounds such as polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which are produced in high tonnages each year due to their usefulness in manufacturing processes of commercial products, such as piping, insulation and packaging. In general, polymers such as PVC are referred to as &quot;homopolymers&quot;, as they consist of repeated long chains or structures of the same monomer unit, whereas polymers that consist of more than one monomer unit are referred to as copolymers (or co-polymers).

Other monomer units, such as formaldehyde hydrates or simple aldehydes, are able to polymerize themselves at quite low temperatures (ca. −80 °C) to form trimers; molecules consisting of 3 monomer units, which can cyclize to form ring cyclic structures, or undergo further reactions to form tetramers, or 4 monomer-unit compounds. Such small polymers are referred to as oligomers. Generally, because formaldehyde is an exceptionally reactive electrophile it allows nucleophilic addition of hemiacetal intermediates, which are in general short-lived and relatively unstable &quot;mid-stage&quot; compounds that react with other non-polar molecules present to form more stable polymeric compounds.

Polymerization that is not sufficiently moderated and proceeds at a fast rate can be very hazardous. This phenomenon is known as autoacceleration, and can cause fires and explosions.

==Step-growth vs. chain-growth polymerization==
Step-growth and chain-growth are the main classes of polymerization reaction mechanisms. The former is often easier to implement but requires precise control of stoichiometry. The latter more reliably affords high molecular-weight polymers, but only applies to certain monomers.

===Step-growth===
In step-growth (or step) polymerization, pairs of reactants, of any lengths, combine at each step to form a longer polymer molecule. The average molar mass increases slowly. Long chains form only late in the reaction.

Step-growth polymers are formed by independent reaction steps between functional groups of monomer units, usually containing heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen. Most step-growth polymers are also classified as condensation polymers, since a small molecule such as water is lost when the polymer chain is lengthened. For example, polyester chains grow by reaction of alcohol and carboxylic acid groups to form ester links with loss of water. However, there are exceptions; for example polyurethanes are step-growth polymers formed from isocyanate and alcohol bifunctional monomers) without loss of water or other volatile molecules, and are classified as addition polymers rather than condensation polymers.

Step-growth polymers increase in molecular weight at a very slow rate at lower conversions and reach moderately high molecular weights only at very high conversion (i.e., &gt;95%). Solid state polymerization to afford polyamides (e.g., nylons) is an example of step-growth polymerization.

===Chain-growth===

In chain-growth (or chain) polymerization, the only chain-extension reaction step is the addition of a monomer to a growing chain with an active center such as a free radical, cation, or anion. Once the growth of a chain is initiated by formation of an active center, chain propagation is usually rapid by addition of a sequence of monomers. Long chains are formed from the beginning of the reaction.

Chain-growth polymerization (or addition polymerization) involves the linking together of unsaturated monomers, especially containing carbon-carbon double bonds. The pi-bond is lost by formation of a new sigma bond. Chain-growth polymerization is involved in the manufacture of polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and acrylate. In these cases, the alkenes RCH=CH2 are converted to high molecular weight alkanes (-RCHCH2-)n (R = H, CH3, Cl, CO2CH3).

Other forms of chain growth polymerization include cationic addition polymerization and anionic addition polymerization. A special case of chain-growth polymerization leads to living polymerization. Ziegler–Natta polymerization allows considerable control of polymer branching.

Diverse methods are employed to manipulate the initiation, propagation, and termination rates during chain polymerization. A related issue is temperature control, also called heat management, during these reactions, which are often highly exothermic. For example, for the polymerization of ethylene, 93.6 kJ of energy are released per mole of monomer.

The manner in which polymerization is conducted is a highly evolved technology. Methods include emulsion polymerization, solution polymerization, suspension polymerization, and precipitation polymerization. Although the polymer dispersity and molecular weight may be improved, these methods may introduce additional processing requirements to isolate the product from a solvent.

=== Photopolymerization ===

Most photopolymerization reactions are chain-growth polymerizations which are initiated by the absorption of visible or ultraviolet light. Photopolymerization can also be a step-growth polymerization. The light may be absorbed either directly by the reactant monomer (&quot;direct&quot; photopolymerization), or else by a &quot;photosensitizer&quot; which absorbs the light and then transfers energy to the monomer. In general, only the initiation step differs from that of the ordinary thermal polymerization of the same monomer; subsequent propagation, termination, and chain-transfer steps are unchanged.
In step-growth photopolymerization, absorption of light triggers an addition (or condensation) reaction between two comonomers that do not react without light. A propagation cycle is not initiated because each growth step requires the assistance of light.

Photopolymerization can be used as a photographic or printing process because polymerization only occurs in regions which have been exposed to light. Unreacted monomer can be removed from unexposed regions, leaving a relief polymeric image. Several forms of 3D printing—including layer-by-layer stereolithography and two-photon absorption 3D photopolymerization—use photopolymerization.

Multiphoton polymerization using single pulses have also been demonstrated for fabrication of complex structures using a digital micromirror device.

<doc id="23873" wikidata="Q266947" url="?curid=23873" title="Pat Cadigan">
<text>Patricia Oren Kearney Cadigan (born September 10, 1953) is a British-American science fiction author, whose work is most often identified with the cyberpunk movement. Her novels and short stories often explore the relationship between the human mind and technology. Her debut novel, &quot;Mindplayers&quot;, was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1988.

==Early years==
Cadigan was born in Schenectady, New York, and grew up in Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

In the 1960s Cadigan and a childhood friend &quot;invented a whole secret life in which we were twins from the planet Venus&quot;, she told National Public Radio. &quot;The Beatles &quot;came to us for advice about their songs and how to deal with fame and other important matters.&quot; She goes on to say: &quot;On occasion, they would ask us to use our highly developed shape-shifting ability to become them, and finish recording sessions and concert tours when they were too tired to go on themselves.&quot; The Venusian twins had other superpowers, that they would sometimes use to help out Superman, Wonder Woman and other heroes, she said.

Cadigan was educated in theater at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and studied science fiction and science fiction writing at the University of Kansas (KU) under science fiction author and editor James Gunn.

Cadigan met her first husband, Rufus Cadigan, while in college; they divorced shortly after she graduated from KU in 1975. That same year, Cadigan joined the convention committee for MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention being held in Kansas City, Missouri, over the 1976 Labor Day weekend; she served on the committee as the convention&#x27;s guest liaison to writer guest of honor Robert A. Heinlein, as well as helped to develop programming for the convention. At the same time, she also worked for fantasy writer Tom Reamy at his Nickelodeon Graphics Arts Service studio, where she daily typset various jobs. She also prepared the type galleys for MidAmeriCon&#x27;s various publications, including the convention&#x27;s hardcover program book. Following Reamy&#x27;s death on 4 November 1977, Cadigan went to work as a writer for Kansas City, MO&#x27;s Hallmark Cards company. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, she also edited the small press fantasy and science fiction magazines &quot;Chacal&quot; and later &quot;Shayol&quot; with her second husband, Arnie Fenner. She and Fenner’s son, Robert, was born in 1985.

Cadigan emigrated to London in 1996, where she is married to her third husband, Christopher Fowler (not to be confused with the author of the same name). She became a UK citizen in late 2014.

==Writing career==
Cadigan sold her first professional science fiction story in 1980. Her success as an author encouraged her to become a full-time writer in 1987.

Cadigan&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Mindplayers&quot;, introduces what becomes the common theme to all her works: her stories blur the line between reality and perception by making the human mind a real, explorable place. Her second novel, &quot;Synners&quot;, expands upon the same theme; both feature a future where direct access to the mind via technology is possible. While her stories include many of the gritty, unvarnished characteristics of the cyberpunk genre, she further specializes in this exploration of the speculative relationship between technology and the perceptions of the human mind.

Cadigan has won a number of awards, including the 2013 Hugo Award for &quot;The Girl-Thing Who Went Out for Sushi&quot; in the Best Novelette category, and the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 1992 and 1995 for her novels &quot;Synners&quot; and &quot;Fools&quot;.

Robert A. Heinlein dedicated his 1982 novel &quot;Friday&quot; in part to Cadigan following her being the guest liaison to him at the 34th Worldcon in Kansas City.

==Health==
In 2013, Cadigan announced that she had been diagnosed with cancer. She underwent surgery after an early diagnosis, suffered a relapse some years after, and recovered after extensive chemotherapy.

<doc id="23875" wikidata="Q7186763" url="?curid=23875" title="Phoenix (Australian TV series)">
<text>Phoenix is a Logie Award-winning Australian crime drama television series broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1992 to 1993. It was created by Alison Nisselle and Tony McDonald.

The first series recounts the investigation of the bombing of a Victorian police social function, loosely based on the real life Russell Street Bombing in 1986. It was followed by a second series, &quot;Phoenix II&quot;, based on a series of violent aggravated burglaries (&quot;ag burgs&quot;) against wealthy senior citizens.

The series was filmed in Melbourne, Victoria and was characterised by its dark, noir-ish visual tone and non-linear editing, reminiscent of the ABC crime dramas &quot;Scales of Justice&quot;, &quot;Blue Murder&quot; and &quot;Wildside&quot;, which all also dealt with corruption in the police force.

The show was lauded for its realistic depiction of police investigation techniques, aided by extensive research by the show&#x27;s writers. It won several Logie Awards, including Most Outstanding Miniseries Logie in 1993 and 1994, as well as several Australian Film Institute Awards, and the Television or Film Theme of the Year Award at the APRA Music Awards of 1993.

The series spawned the 1994 spin-off &quot;Janus&quot;, with Simon Westaway reprising his role as Sergeant Peter Faithful.

<text>Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds from the family Spheniscidae () of the order Sphenisciformes (). They live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.

They spend about half of their lives on land and the other half in the sea. The largest living species is the emperor penguin (&quot;Aptenodytes forsteri&quot;): on average, adults are about tall and weigh . The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin (&quot;Eudyptula minor&quot;), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around tall and weighs . Today, larger penguins generally inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an adult human. There was a great diversity of species in subantarctic regions, and at least one giant species in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, during the Late Eocene, a climate decidedly warmer than today.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;penguin&quot; first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century as a synonym for the great auk. When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related.

The etymology of the word &quot;penguin&quot; is still debated. The English word is not apparently of French, Breton or Spanish origin (the latter two are attributed to the French word ), but first appears in English or Dutch.

Some dictionaries suggest a derivation from Welsh , &#x27;head&#x27; and , &#x27;white&#x27;, including the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; and &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot;, on the basis that the name was originally applied to the great auk, either because it was found on White Head Island () in Newfoundland, or because it had white circles around its eyes (though the head was black). However, the Welsh word can also be used to mean &#x27;front&#x27; and, in a maritime context, means &#x27;front end or part, bow (of a ship), prow&#x27;.
An alternative etymology links the word to Latin , which means &#x27;fat&#x27; or &#x27;oil&#x27;. Support for this etymology can be found in the alternative Germanic word for penguin, or &#x27;fat-goose&#x27;, and the related Dutch word .

Adult male penguins are sometimes called &quot;cocks&quot;, females sometimes called &quot;hens&quot;; a group of penguins on land is a &quot;waddle&quot;, and a group of penguins in the water is a &quot;raft&quot;.

=== Pinguinus ===

Since 1871, the Latin word &quot;Pinguinus&quot; has been used in scientific classification to name the genus of the great auk (&quot;Pinguinus impennis&quot;, meaning &quot;plump or fat without flight feathers&quot;), which became extinct in the mid-19th century. As confirmed by a 2004 genetic study, the genus &quot;Pinguinus&quot; belongs in the family of the auks (Alcidae), within the order of the Charadriiformes.

The birds currently known as penguins were discovered later and were so named by sailors because of their physical resemblance to the great auk. Despite this resemblance, however, they are not auks, and are not closely related to the great auk. They do not belong in the genus &quot;Pinguinus&quot;, and are not classified in the same family and order as the great auk. They were classified in 1831 by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in several distinct genera within the family Spheniscidae and order Sphenisciformes.

==Systematics and evolution==
=== Taxonomy ===

The family name of Spheniscidae was given by Charles Lucien Bonaparte from the genus Spheniscus, the name of that genus comes from the Greek word &quot;sphēn&quot; &quot;wedge&quot; used for the shape of an African penguin&#x27;s swimming flippers.

Some recent sources apply the phylogenetic taxon Spheniscidae to what here is referred to as Spheniscinae. Furthermore, they restrict the phylogenetic taxon Sphenisciformes to flightless taxa, and establish the phylogenetic taxon Pansphenisciformes as equivalent to the Linnean taxon Sphenisciformes, i.e., including any flying basal &quot;proto-penguins&quot; to be discovered eventually. Given that neither the relationships of the penguin subfamilies to each other nor the placement of the penguins in the avian phylogeny is presently resolved, this is confusing, so the established Linnean system is followed here.

The number of penguin species is typically listed as between seventeen and nineteen. The International Ornithologists&#x27; Union recognizes six genera and eighteen species:

===Evolution===

Although the evolutionary and biogeographic history of Sphenisciformes is well-researched, many prehistoric forms are not fully described. Some seminal articles about the evolutionary history of penguins have been published since 2005.

The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event in the general area of southern New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica. Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than apart rather than . The most recent common ancestor of penguins and Procellariiformes can be roughly dated to the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary, around 70–68 mya.

====Basal fossils====
The oldest known fossil penguin species is &quot;Waimanu manneringi&quot;, which lived 62 mya in New Zealand. While they were not as well-adapted to aquatic life as modern penguins, &quot;Waimanu&quot; were flightless, with short wings adapted for deep diving. They swam on the surface using mainly their feet, but the wings were – as opposed to most other diving birds (both living and extinct) – already adapting to underwater locomotion.

&quot;Perudyptes&quot; from northern Peru was dated to 42 mya. An unnamed fossil from Argentina proves that, by the Bartonian (Middle Eocene), some 39–38 mya, primitive penguins had spread to South America and were in the process of expanding into Atlantic waters.

====Palaeeudyptines====
During the Late Eocene and the Early Oligocene (40–30 mya), some lineages of gigantic penguins existed. Nordenskjoeld&#x27;s giant penguin was the tallest, growing nearly tall. The New Zealand giant penguin was probably the heaviest, weighing or more. Both were found on New Zealand, the former also in the Antarctic farther eastwards.

Traditionally, most extinct species of penguins, giant or small, had been placed in the paraphyletic subfamily called Palaeeudyptinae. More recently, with new taxa being discovered and placed in the phylogeny if possible, it is becoming accepted that there were at least two major extinct lineages. One or two closely related ones occurred in Patagonia, and at least one other—which is or includes the paleeudyptines as recognized today – occurred on most Antarctic and Subantarctic coasts.

Size plasticity was significant at this initial stage of radiation: on Seymour Island, Antarctica, for example, around 10 known species of penguins ranging in size from medium to large apparently coexisted some 35 mya during the Priabonian (Late Eocene). It is not known whether the palaeeudyptines constitute a monophyletic lineage, or whether gigantism was evolved independently in a restricted Palaeeudyptinae and the Anthropornithinae – whether they were considered valid, or whether there was a wide size range present in the Palaeeudyptinae as delimited (i.e., including &quot;Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi&quot;). The oldest well-described giant penguin, the -tall &quot;Icadyptes salasi&quot;, existed as far north as northern Peru about 36 mya.

Gigantic penguins had disappeared by the end of the Paleogene, around 25 mya. Their decline and disappearance coincided with the spread of the Squalodontidae and other primitive, fish-eating toothed whales, which competed with them for food and were ultimately more successful. A new lineage, the Paraptenodytes, which includes smaller and stout-legged forms, had already arisen in southernmost South America by that time. The early Neogene saw the emergence of another morphotype in the same area, the similarly sized but more gracile Palaeospheniscinae, as well as the radiation that gave rise to the current biodiversity of penguins.

====Origin and systematics of modern penguins====
Modern penguins constitute two undisputed clades and another two more basal genera with more ambiguous relationships. To help resolve the evolution of this order, 19 high-coverage genomes that, together with two previously published genomes, encompass all extant penguin species have been sequenced. The origin of the Spheniscinae lies probably in the latest Paleogene and, geographically, it must have been much the same as the general area in which the order evolved: the oceans between the Australia-New Zealand region and the Antarctic. Presumably diverging from other penguins around 40 mya, it seems that the Spheniscinae were for quite some time limited to their ancestral area, as the well-researched deposits of the Antarctic Peninsula and Patagonia have not yielded Paleogene fossils of the subfamily. Also, the earliest spheniscine lineages are those with the most southern distribution.

The genus &quot;Aptenodytes&quot; appears to be the basalmost divergence among living penguins. They have bright yellow-orange neck, breast, and bill patches; incubate by placing their eggs on their feet, and when they hatch the chicks are almost naked. This genus has a distribution centred on the Antarctic coasts and barely extends to some Subantarctic islands today.

&quot;Pygoscelis&quot; contains species with a fairly simple black-and-white head pattern; their distribution is intermediate, centred on Antarctic coasts but extending somewhat northwards from there. In external morphology, these apparently still resemble the common ancestor of the Spheniscinae, as &quot;Aptenodytes&quot;″ autapomorphies are, in most cases, fairly pronounced adaptations related to that genus&#x27; extreme habitat conditions. As the former genus, &quot;Pygoscelis&quot; seems to have diverged during the Bartonian, but the range expansion and radiation that led to the present-day diversity probably did not occur until much later; around the Burdigalian stage of the Early Miocene, roughly 20–15 mya.

The genera &quot;Spheniscus&quot; and &quot;Eudyptula&quot; contain species with a mostly Subantarctic distribution centred on South America; some, however, range quite far northwards. They all lack carotenoid colouration and the former genus has a conspicuous banded head pattern; they are unique among living penguins by nesting in burrows. This group probably radiated eastwards with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current out of the ancestral range of modern penguins throughout the Chattian (Late Oligocene), starting approximately 28 mya. While the two genera separated during this time, the present-day diversity is the result of a Pliocene radiation, taking place some 4–2 mya.

The &quot;Megadyptes&quot;–&quot;Eudyptes&quot; clade occurs at similar latitudes (though not as far north as the Galápagos penguin), has its highest diversity in the New Zealand region, and represents a westward dispersal. They are characterized by hairy yellow ornamental head feathers; their bills are at least partly red. These two genera diverged apparently in the Middle Miocene (Langhian, roughly 15–14 mya), although the living species of &quot;Eudyptes&quot; are the product of a later radiation, stretching from about the late Tortonian (Late Miocene, 8 mya) to the end of the Pliocene.

====Geography====
The geographical and temporal pattern of spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented in the paleoclimatic record. The emergence of the Subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the Subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself. Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of &quot;Spheniscus&quot; to South America and eventually beyond. Despite this, there is no fossil evidence to support the idea of crown radiation from the Antarctic continent in the Paleogene, although DNA study favors such a radiation.

Later, an interspersed period of slight warming was ended by the Middle Miocene Climate Transition, a sharp drop in global average temperature from 14 to 12 mya, and similar abrupt cooling events followed at 8 mya and 4 mya; by the end of the Tortonian, the Antarctic ice sheet was already much like today in volume and extent. The emergence of most of today&#x27;s Subantarctic penguin species almost certainly was caused by this sequence of Neogene climate shifts.

====Relationship to other bird orders====
Penguin ancestry beyond &quot;Waimanu&quot; remains unknown and not well-resolved by molecular or morphological analyses. The latter tend to be confounded by the strong adaptive autapomorphies of the Sphenisciformes; a sometimes perceived fairly close relationship between penguins and grebes is almost certainly an error based on both groups&#x27; strong diving adaptations, which are homoplasies. On the other hand, different DNA sequence datasets do not agree in detail with each other either.
What seems clear is that penguins belong to a clade of Neoaves (living birds except for paleognaths and fowl) that comprises what is sometimes called &quot;higher waterbirds&quot; to distinguish them from the more ancient waterfowl. This group contains such birds as storks, rails, and the seabirds, with the possible exception of the Charadriiformes.

Inside this group, penguin relationships are far less clear. Depending on the analysis and dataset, a close relationship to Ciconiiformes or to Procellariiformes has been suggested. Some think the penguin-like plotopterids (usually considered relatives of cormorants and anhingas) may actually be a sister group of the penguins and those penguins may have ultimately shared a common ancestor with the Pelecaniformes and consequently would have to be included in that order, or that the plotopterids were not as close to other pelecaniforms as generally assumed, which would necessitate splitting the traditional Pelecaniformes into three.

A 2014 analysis of whole genomes of 48 representative bird species has concluded that penguins are the sister group of Procellariiformes, from which they diverged about 60 million years ago (95% CI, 56.8–62.7).

The distantly related Puffins, which live in the North Pacific and North Atlantic, developed similar characteristics to survive in the Arctic and sub-Arctic environments. Like the penguins, puffins have a white chest, black back and short stubby wings providing excellent swimming ability in icy water. But, unlike penguins, puffins can fly, as flightless birds would not survive alongside land-based predators such as polar bears and foxes; there are no such predators in the Antarctic. Their similarities indicate that similar environments, although at great distances, can result in similar evolutionary developments, i.e. convergent evolution.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins&#x27; swimming looks very similar to birds&#x27; flight in the air. Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved, ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.

All penguins are countershaded for camouflage – that is, they have black backs and wings with white fronts. A predator looking up from below (such as an orca or a leopard seal) has difficulty distinguishing between a white penguin belly and the reflective water surface. The dark plumage on their backs camouflages them from above.

Gentoo penguins are the fastest underwater birds in the world. They are capable of reaching speeds up to 36 km (about 22 miles) per hour while searching for food or escaping from predators. They are also able to dive to depths of 170–200 meters (about 560–660 feet). The small penguins do not usually dive deep; they catch their prey near the surface in dives that normally last only one or two minutes. Larger penguins can dive deep in case of need. Emperor penguins are the world&#x27;s deepest-diving birds. They can dive to depths of approximately while searching for food.

Penguins either waddle on their feet or slide on their bellies across the snow while using their feet to propel and steer themselves, a movement called &quot;tobogganing&quot;, which conserves energy while moving quickly. They also jump with both feet together if they want to move more quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain.

Penguins have an average sense of hearing for birds; this is used by parents and chicks to locate one another in crowded colonies. Their eyes are adapted for underwater vision and are their primary means of locating prey and avoiding predators; in air it has been suggested that they are nearsighted, although research has not supported this hypothesis.

Penguins have a thick layer of insulating feathers that keeps them warm in water (heat loss in water is much greater than in air). The emperor penguin has a maximum feather density of about nine feathers per square centimeter which is actually much lower than other birds that live in Antarctic environments. However, they have been identified as having at least four different &quot;types&quot; of feather: in addition to the traditional feather, the emperor has afterfeathers, plumules, and filoplumes. The afterfeathers are downy plumes that attach directly to the main feathers and were once believed to account for the bird&#x27;s ability to conserve heat when under water; the plumules are small down feathers that attach directly to the skin, and are much more dense in penguins than other birds; lastly the filoplumes are small (less than 1 cm long) naked shafts that end in a splay of fibers— filoplumes were believed to give flying birds a sense of where their plumage was and whether or not it needed preening, so their presence in penguins may seem inconsistent, but penguins also preen extensively.

The emperor penguin has the largest body mass of all penguins, which further reduces relative surface area and heat loss. They also are able to control blood flow to their extremities, reducing the amount of blood that gets cold, but still keeping the extremities from freezing. In the extreme cold of the Antarctic winter, the females are at sea fishing for food, leaving the males to brave the weather by themselves. They often huddle together to keep warm and rotate positions to make sure that each penguin gets a turn in the centre of the heat pack.

Calculations of the heat loss and retention ability of marine endotherms suggest that most extant penguins are too small to survive in such cold environments. In 2007, Thomas and Fordyce wrote about the &quot;heterothermic loophole&quot; that penguins utilize in order to survive in Antarctica. All extant penguins, even those that live in warmer climates, have a counter-current heat exchanger called the humeral plexus. The flippers of penguins have at least three branches of the axillary artery, which allows cold blood to be heated by blood that has already been warmed and limits heat loss from the flippers. This system allows penguins to efficiently use their body heat and explains why such small animals can survive in the extreme cold.

They can drink salt water because their supraorbital gland filters excess salt from the bloodstream. The salt is excreted in a concentrated fluid from the nasal passages.

The great auk of the Northern Hemisphere, now extinct, was superficially similar to penguins, and the word &quot;penguin&quot; was originally used for that bird centuries ago. They are only distantly related to the penguins, but are an example of convergent evolution.
Around one in 50,000 penguins (of most species) are born with brown rather than black plumage. These are called isabelline penguins. Isabellinism is different from albinism. Isabelline penguins tend to live shorter lives than normal penguins, as they are not well-camouflaged against the deep and are often passed over as mates.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

Penguins for the most part breed in large colonies, the exceptions being the yellow-eyed and Fiordland species; these colonies may range in size from as few as 100 pairs for gentoo penguins to several hundred thousand in the case of king, macaroni and chinstrap penguins. Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds, which has led to a large repertoire of visual as well as vocal displays in all penguin species. &quot;Agonistic&quot; displays are those intended to confront or drive off, or alternately appease and avoid conflict with, other individuals.

Penguins form monogamous pairs for a breeding season, though the rate the same pair recouples varies drastically. Most penguins lay two eggs in a clutch, although the two largest species, the emperor and the king penguins, lay only one. With the exception of the emperor penguin, where the male does it all, all penguins share the incubation duties. These incubation shifts can last days and even weeks as one member of the pair feeds at sea.

Penguins generally only lay one brood; the exception is the little penguin, which can raise two or three broods in a season.

Penguin eggs are smaller than any other bird species when compared proportionally to the weight of the parent birds; at , the little penguin egg is 4.7% of its mothers&#x27; weight, and the emperor penguin egg is 2.3%. The relatively thick shell forms between 10 and 16% of the weight of a penguin egg, presumably to reduce the effects of dehydration and to minimize the risk of breakage in an adverse nesting environment. The yolk, too, is large and comprises 22–31% of the egg. Some yolk often remains when a chick is born, and is thought to help sustain the chick if the parents are delayed in returning with food.

When emperor penguin mothers lose a chick, they sometimes attempt to &quot;steal&quot; another mother&#x27;s chick, usually unsuccessfully as other females in the vicinity assist the defending mother in keeping her chick. In some species, such as emperor and king penguins, the chicks assemble in large groups called crèches.

==Distribution and habitat==

Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin actually live so far south. Several species live in the temperate zone; one, the Galápagos penguin, lives as far north as the Galápagos Islands, but this is only made possible by the cold, rich waters of the Antarctic Humboldt Current that flows around these islands. Also, though the climate of the Arctic and Antarctic regions is similar, there are no penguins found in the Arctic.

Several authors have suggested that penguins are a good example of Bergmann&#x27;s Rule where larger-bodied populations live at higher latitudes than smaller-bodied populations. There is some disagreement about this and several other authors have noted that there are fossil penguin species that contradict this hypothesis and that ocean currents and upwellings are likely to have had a greater effect on species diversity than latitude alone.

Major populations of penguins are found in Angola, Antarctica, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Namibia, New Zealand, and South Africa. Satellite images and photos released in 2018 show the population of 2 million in France&#x27;s remote Ile aux Cochons has collapsed, with barely 200,000 remaining, according to a study published in Antarctic Science.

=== Conservation status ===
The majority of living penguin species have declining populations. According to the IUCN Red List, their conservation statuses range from Least Concern through to Endangered.
==Penguins and humans==
Penguins have no special fear of humans and will often approach groups of people. This is probably because penguins have no land predators in Antarctica or the nearby offshore islands. They are preyed upon by other birds like skuas, especially in eggs and as fledglings. Other birds like petrels, sheathbills, and gulls also eat the chicks. Dogs preyed upon penguins while they were allowed in Antarctica during the age of early human exploration as sled dogs, but dogs have long since been banned from Antarctica. Instead, adult penguins are at risk at sea from predators such as sharks, orcas, and leopard seals. Typically, penguins do not approach closer than around , at which point they appear to become nervous.

In June 2011, an emperor penguin came ashore on New Zealand&#x27;s Peka Peka Beach, off course on its journey to Antarctica. Nicknamed Happy Feet, after the film of the same name, it was suffering from heat exhaustion and had to undergo a number of operations to remove objects like driftwood and sand from its stomach. Happy Feet was a media sensation, with extensive coverage on TV and the web, including a live stream that had thousands of views and a visit from English actor Stephen Fry. Once he had recovered, Happy Feet was released back into the water south of New Zealand.

===In popular culture===

Penguins are widely considered endearing for their unusually upright, waddling gait, swimming ability and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white tie suit. Some writers and artists have penguins based at the North Pole, but there are no wild penguins in the Arctic. The cartoon series &quot;Chilly Willy&quot; helped perpetuate this myth, as the title penguin would interact with Arctic or sub-Arctic species, such as polar bears and walruses.

Penguins have been the subject of many books and films, such as &quot;Happy Feet&quot;, &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; and &quot;Penguins of Madagascar&quot;, all CGI films; &quot;March of the Penguins&quot;, a documentary based on the migration process of the emperor penguin; and &quot;Farce of the Penguins&quot;, a parody of the documentary. &quot;Mr. Popper&#x27;s Penguins&quot; is a children&#x27;s book written by Richard and Florence Atwater; it was named a Newbery Honor Book in 1939. Penguins have also appeared in a number of cartoons and television dramas, including &quot;Pingu&quot;, co-created by Otmar Gutmann and Erika Brueggemann in 1990 and covering more than 100 short episodes. At the end of 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;Whether they were walking (&quot;March of the Penguins&quot;), dancing (&quot;Happy Feet&quot;), or hanging ten (&quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;), these oddly adorable birds took flight at the box office all decade long.&quot;

A video game called &quot;Pengo&quot; was released by Sega in 1982. Set in Antarctica, the player controls a penguin character who must navigate mazes of ice cubes. The player is rewarded with cut-scenes of animated penguins marching, dancing, saluting and playing peekaboo. Several remakes and enhanced editions have followed, most recently in 2012. Penguins are also sometimes depicted in music.

In 1941, DC Comics introduced the avian-themed character of the Penguin as a supervillain adversary of the superhero Batman (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #58). He became one of the most enduring enemies in Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery. In the 60s &quot;Batman&quot; TV series, as played by Burgess Meredith, he was one of the most popular characters, and in Tim Burton&#x27;s reimagining of the story, the character played by Danny Devito in the 1992 film &quot;Batman Returns&quot;, employed an actual army of penguins (mostly African penguins and king penguins).
Several pro, minor, college and high school sport teams in the United States have named themselves after the species, including the Pittsburgh Penguins team in the National Hockey League and the Youngstown State Penguins in college athletics.

Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of U.K. cartoonist Steve Bell in his strip in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, particularly during and following the Falklands War. Opus the Penguin, from the cartoons of Berkeley Breathed, is also described as hailing from the Falklands. Opus was a comical, &quot;existentialist&quot; penguin character in the cartoons &quot;Bloom County&quot;, &quot;Outland&quot; and &quot;Opus&quot;. He was also the star in the animated Christmas TV special &quot;A Wish for Wings That Work&quot;.

In the mid-2000s, penguins became one of the most publicized species of animals that form lasting homosexual couples. A children&#x27;s book, &quot;And Tango Makes Three&quot;, was written about one such penguin family in the New York Zoo.

<doc id="23880" wikidata="Q163038" url="?curid=23880" title="Psycho (1960 film)">
<text>Psycho is a 1960 American horror film produced and directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The screenplay, written by Joseph Stefano, was based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The film stars Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam. The plot centers on an encounter between on-the-run embezzler Marion Crane (Leigh) and shy motel proprietor Norman Bates (Perkins) and its aftermath, in which a private investigator (Balsam), Marion&#x27;s lover Sam Loomis (Gavin) and her sister Lila (Miles) investigate her disappearance.

&quot;Psycho&quot; was seen as a departure from Hitchcock&#x27;s previous film, &quot;North by Northwest&quot; (1959), as it was filmed on a small budget in black-and-white by the crew of his television series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. Initially, the film divided critics due to its controversial subject matter, but audience interest and outstanding box-office returns prompted a major critical re-evaluation. &quot;Psycho&quot; was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Director for Hitchcock and Best Supporting Actress for Leigh.

&quot;Psycho&quot; is now considered one of Hitchcock&#x27;s best films, and is arguably his most famous and influential work. It has been hailed as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars who praise its slick direction, tense atmosphere, impressive camerawork, memorable score and iconic performances. It is regarded as &quot;the most heavily analyzed film in the long career of the most investigated director in the history of American film&quot; and often ranked among the greatest films of all time. It set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films, and has been considered to be one of the earliest examples of the slasher film genre. After Hitchcock&#x27;s death in 1980, Universal Pictures produced follow-ups: three sequels, a remake, a made-for-television spin-off and a television series. In 1992, the Library of Congress deemed the film &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

== Plot ==
Marion Crane, a real estate secretary in Phoenix, steals $40,000 in cash () from her employer after hearing her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, complain that his debts are delaying their marriage. She sets off to drive to Sam&#x27;s home in the town of Fairvale, California, switching cars in Bakersfield after an encounter with a suspicious policeman. 

A heavy rainstorm forces Marion to stop at the Bates Motel just a few miles from Fairvale. Norman Bates, the proprietor, whose Second Empire style house overlooks the motel, registers Marion (who uses an alias) and invites her to dinner with him in the motel&#x27;s office. When Norman returns to his house to retrieve the food, Marion overhears him arguing with his mother about his desire to dine with Marion. After he returns, he discusses his hobby as a taxidermist, his mother&#x27;s &quot;illness&quot; and how people have a &quot;private trap&quot; they want to escape. When Marion suggests that Norman should have his mother institutionalized, he becomes greatly offended and insists that she&#x27;s harmless. Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money. As she showers, a shadowy figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Shortly afterward, Norman comes to check on Marion, only to discover her dead body. Horrified, he hurriedly cleans up the murder scene. He then places Marion&#x27;s body, her belongings, and, unbeknownst to him, the hidden cash in her car, before sinking the vehicle in a swamp.

Marion&#x27;s sister, Lila, arrives in Fairvale a week later, tells Sam about the theft and demands information about Marion&#x27;s whereabouts. He denies knowing anything about Marion&#x27;s disappearance. A private investigator named Arbogast approaches them, stating that he has been hired to retrieve the money. He stops at the Bates Motel and questions Norman, whose nervous conduct, stuttering and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. He examines the guest register and discovers from her handwriting that Marion spent a night in the motel. When Arbogast infers from Norman that Marion had spoken to his mother, he asks to speak to her, but Norman refuses to allow it. After Arbogast enters the Bates house to search for Norman&#x27;s mother, a shadowy figure assaults him at the top of the stairs and stabs him to death.

When Sam and Lila do not hear back from Arbogast, Sam goes to the motel to look for him. He spots a silhouette in the house who he assumes is Norman&#x27;s mother. Lila and Sam alert the local sheriff, Al Chambers, who tells them Norman&#x27;s mother died in a murder–suicide by strychnine poisoning a decade earlier. Chambers suggests that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that something unusual happened to Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Sam distracts Norman in the office while Lila sneaks into the Bates house. Suspicious, Norman knocks Sam unconscious. As he heads to the house, Lila hides in the fruit cellar, where she discovers the mummified body of Norman&#x27;s mother. Lila screams in horror, and Norman, wearing women&#x27;s clothes and a wig, enters the cellar and attempts to stab her. Sam appears and subdues him.

At the police station, a psychiatrist explains that Norman killed his mother and her lover ten years prior out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he mummified his mother&#x27;s corpse and treated it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother as an alternate personality, as jealous and possessive towards Norman as he felt about his mother. Whenever Norman is attracted to a woman, &quot;Mother&quot; takes over. Under the &quot;Mother&quot; personality, Norman killed two women before he killed Marion and Arbogast. The psychiatrist concludes that &quot;Mother&quot; has now submerged Norman&#x27;s personality. Norman sits in a jail cell and hears his mother&#x27;s voice stating the murders were his doing. Meanwhile, Marion&#x27;s car, which contains her remains and the stolen money, is retrieved from the swamp.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
&quot;Psycho&quot; is based on Robert Bloch&#x27;s 1959 novel of the same name, loosely inspired by the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein. Both Gein, who lived only from Bloch, and the story&#x27;s protagonist Norman Bates, were solitary murderers in isolated rural locations. Each had deceased, domineering mothers, had sealed off a room in their home as a shrine to them and dressed in women&#x27;s clothes. Gein was apprehended after killing only twice.
Peggy Robertson, Hitchcock&#x27;s long-time assistant, read Anthony Boucher&#x27;s positive review of the novel in his &quot;Criminals at Large&quot; column in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and decided to show the book to her employer; however, studio readers at Paramount Pictures had already rejected its premise for a film. Hitchcock acquired rights to the novel for $9,500 and reportedly ordered Robertson to buy all copies to preserve the novel&#x27;s surprises. Hitchcock, who had come to face genre competitors whose works were critically compared to his own, was seeking new material to recover from two aborted projects with Paramount: &quot;Flamingo Feather&quot; and &quot;No Bail for the Judge&quot;. He disliked stars&#x27; salary demands and trusted only a few people to choose prospective material, including Robertson.

Paramount executives balked at Hitchcock&#x27;s proposal and refused to provide his usual budget. In response, Hitchcock offered to film &quot;Psycho&quot; quickly and cheaply in black and white using the crew from his television series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their soundstages were booked, but the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered that he personally would finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director&#x27;s fee, he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative. This combined offer was accepted, and Hitchcock went ahead in spite of naysaying from producer Herbert Coleman and Shamley Productions executive Joan Harrison.

=== Screenplay ===

James P. Cavanagh, a writer on &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, wrote the first draft of the screenplay. Hitchcock felt the script dragged and read like a television short horror story, an assessment shared by an assistant. Although Joseph Stefano had worked on only one film before, Hitchcock agreed to meet with him; despite Stefano&#x27;s inexperience, the meeting went well and he was hired.

The screenplay is relatively faithful to the novel, with a few significant changes by Hitchcock and Stefano. Stefano found the character of Norman Bates unsympathetic—in the book, he is middle-aged, overweight and more overtly unstable—but became more intrigued when Hitchcock suggested casting Anthony Perkins. Stefano eliminated Bates&#x27; alcoholism, which necessitated removing Bates&#x27; &quot;becoming&quot; the mother personality when in a drunken stupor. Also removed was Bates&#x27; interest in spiritualism, the occult and pornography. Hitchcock and Stefano elected to open the film with scenes in Marion&#x27;s life and not introduce Bates at all until the twenty-minute mark, rather than open with Bates reading a history book as Bloch does. Writer Joseph W. Smith observes that Marion&#x27;s story &quot;occupies only two of the novel&#x27;s 17 chapters. Hitchcock and Stefano expanded this to nearly half the narrative&quot;.

Smith likewise mentions the absence of a hotel tryst between Marion and Sam in the novel. For Stefano, the conversation between Marion and Norman in the hotel parlor in which she displays maternal sympathy towards him makes it possible for the audience to switch their sympathies towards Norman after Marion&#x27;s murder. When Lila is looking through Norman&#x27;s bedroom in the film, she opens a book with a blank cover whose contents are unseen; in the novel, these are &quot;pathologically pornographic&quot; illustrations. Stefano wanted to give the audience &quot;indications that something was quite wrong, but it could not be spelled out or overdone&quot;. In his book of conversations with Hitchcock, François Truffaut says the novel &quot;cheats&quot; by having extended conversations between Norman and &quot;Mother&quot; and stating what Mother is &quot;doing&quot; at various given moments.

The first name of the female protagonist was changed from Mary to Marion because a real Mary Crane lived in Phoenix. Also changed is the novel&#x27;s budding romance between Sam and Lila. Hitchcock preferred to focus the audience&#x27;s attention on the solution to the mystery, and Stefano thought such a relationship would make Sam seem cheap. Instead of having Sam explain Norman&#x27;s pathology to Lila, the film uses a psychiatrist. Stefano was in therapy dealing with his relationship with his own mother while writing the script. The novel is more violent than the film: Marion is decapitated in the shower rather than being stabbed to death. Minor changes include changing Marion&#x27;s telltale earring found after her death to a scrap of paper that failed to flush down the toilet. This provided some shock effect because toilets were almost never seen in American cinema at the time of the film&#x27;s release. The location of Arbogast&#x27;s death was moved from the house&#x27;s foyer to the stairwell. Stefano thought this would make it easier to conceal the truth about &quot;Mother&quot; without tipping that something was being hidden. As Leigh put it, this gave Hitchcock more options for his camera.

=== Pre-production ===
Paramount Pictures, whose contract guaranteed another film by Hitchcock, did not want Hitchcock to make &quot;Psycho&quot;. Paramount was expecting &quot;No Bail for the Judge&quot;, but Hitchcock scrapped the production after star Audrey Hepburn became pregnant and bowed out. The studio&#x27;s official stance was that Bloch&#x27;s book was &quot;too repulsive&quot; and &quot;impossible for films&quot;, and nothing but another of Hitchcock&#x27;s star-studded mystery thrillers would suffice. Paramount did not like &quot;anything about [the book] at all&quot; and denied Hitchcock his usual budget. 

In response, Hitchcock financed the film&#x27;s creation through his own Shamley Productions, shooting at Universal Studios under the Revue television unit. The original Bates Motel and Bates house set buildings, which were constructed on the same stage as Lon Chaney&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925), are still standing at the Universal Studios backlot in Universal City near Hollywood and are a regular attraction on the studio&#x27;s tour. 

As a further result of cost-cutting, Hitchcock chose to film &quot;Psycho&quot; in black-and-white, keeping the budget under $1 million. Among other reasons for shooting in black-and-white were Hitchcock&#x27;s desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory.

As a further cost-cutting measure, and because he was most comfortable around them, Hitchcock took most of his crew from his television series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, including cinematographer John L. Russell, set designer George Milo, script supervisor Marshall Schlom and assistant director Hilton A. Green. He hired regular collaborators Bernard Herrmann as the music composer, George Tomasini as editor, and Saul Bass for the title design and storyboarding of the shower scene. In all, his crew cost $62,000.

Through the strength of his reputation, Hitchcock cast Leigh for a quarter of her usual fee, paying only $25,000 (in the 1967 book &quot;Hitchcock/Truffaut&quot;, Hitchcock said that Leigh owed Paramount one final film on her seven-year contract which she had signed in 1953). His first choice, Leigh agreed having only read the novel and making no inquiry into her salary. Her co-star, Anthony Perkins, agreed to $40,000. Both stars were experienced and proven box-office draws.

Paramount distributed the film, but four years later Hitchcock sold his stock in Shamley to Universal&#x27;s parent company, MCA, and his remaining six films were made at and distributed by Universal Pictures. After another four years, Paramount sold all rights to Universal.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Psycho&quot;, independently produced and financed by Hitchcock, was shot at Revue Studios, the same location as his television show. The film was shot on a tight budget of $807,000, beginning on November 11, 1959, and ending on February 1, 1960. Filming started in the morning and finished by six p.m. or earlier on Thursdays (when Hitchcock and his wife would dine at Chasen&#x27;s). Nearly the whole film was shot with 50 mm lenses on 35 mm cameras. This provided an angle of view similar to human vision, which helped to further involve the audience.

Before shooting began in November, Hitchcock dispatched Green to Phoenix to scout locations and shoot the opening scene. The shot was supposed to be an aerial shot of Phoenix that slowly zoomed into the hotel window of a passionate Marion and Sam. Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio. Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between Gorman and Fresno, California, for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix. Footage of her driving into Bakersfield to trade her car is also shown. They also provided the location shots for the scene in which Marion is discovered sleeping in her car by the suspicious policeman. In one street scene shot in downtown Phoenix, Christmas decorations were discovered to be visible; rather than re-shoot the footage, Hitchcock chose to add onscreen text to the opening scene marking the date as &quot;Friday, December the Eleventh&quot;.

Green also took photos of a prepared list of 140 locations for later reconstruction in the studio. These included many real estate offices and homes such as those belonging to Marion and her sister. He also found a girl who looked just as he imagined Marion and photographed her whole wardrobe, which would enable Hitchcock to demand realistic looks from Helen Colvig, the wardrobe supervisor. The look of the Bates house was modeled on Edward Hopper&#x27;s painting &quot;House by the Railroad&quot;, a fanciful portrait of the Second Empire Victorian home at 18 Conger Avenue in Haverstraw, New York.
Lead actors Perkins and Leigh were given the freedom to interpret their roles and improvise as long as it did not involve moving the camera. An example of Perkins&#x27; improvisation is Norman&#x27;s habit of eating candy corn. Throughout filming, Hitchcock created and hid various versions of the &quot;Mother corpse&quot; prop in Leigh&#x27;s dressing room closet. Leigh took the joke well, and wondered whether it was done to keep her in suspense or to judge which corpse would be scarier for the audience.

Hitchcock was forced uncharacteristically to do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion&#x27;s eye and zooms in and out, proved difficult for Leigh because the water splashing in her eyes made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well because he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were required for the opening scene because Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying, &quot;Not inordinately&quot; for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which &quot;Mother&quot; is discovered required complicated coordination of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila) hitting the light bulb and a lens flare, which proved to be difficult. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were effected to his satisfaction.

According to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were directed by Green based on Bass&#x27; storyboards while Hitchcock was incapacitated by the common cold. However, upon viewing the dailies of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were &quot;no good&quot; because they did not portray &quot;an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs&quot;. Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic, owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film&#x27;s twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chair-like device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.

Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cameo is a signature occurrence in most of his films. In &quot;Psycho&quot;, he can be seen through a window—wearing a Stetson hat—standing outside Marion&#x27;s workplace. Wardrobe mistress Rita Riggs has said that Hitchcock chose this scene for his cameo so that he could be in a scene with his daughter, who played one of Marion&#x27;s colleagues. Others have suggested that he chose this early appearance in the film to avoid distracting the audience.

==== Shower scene ====
The murder of Leigh&#x27;s character in the shower is the film&#x27;s pivotal scene and one of the best-known in all of cinema. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. The scene was shot from December 17–23, 1959, after Leigh had twice postponed the filming, first because of a cold and then because of her period. 

The finished scene runs some three minutes, and its flurry of action and edits has produced contradictory attempts to count its parts. Hitchcock himself contributed to this pattern, telling Truffaut that &quot;there were seventy camera setups for forty-five seconds of footage&quot;, and maintaining to other interviewers that there were &quot;seventy-eight pieces of the film&quot;. The 2017 documentary &quot;78/52: Hitchcock&#x27;s Shower Scene&quot;, by director Alexandre O. Philippe, latches onto this last figure for the production&#x27;s tagline, &quot;78 Shots &amp; 52 Cuts That Changed Cinema Forever&quot;. But in his careful description of the shower scene, film scholar Philip J. Skerry counted only 60 separate shots, with a table breaking down the middle 34 by type, camera position, angle, movement, focus, POV and subject. Absent an alternative tabulation, Richard Schickel and Frank Capra, in their 2001 book &quot;The Men Who Made the Movies&quot;, concluded the most reasonable calculation was 60. Many are close-ups, including extreme close-ups, except for medium shots in the shower directly before and directly after the murder. The combination of the close shots with their short duration makes the sequence feel more subjective than if the images were presented alone or at a wider angle, an example of the technique Hitchcock described as &quot;transferring the menace from the screen into the mind of the audience&quot;.
To capture the straight-on shot of the shower head, the camera had to be equipped with a long lens. The inner holes on the shower head were blocked and the camera placed a sufficient distance away so that the water, while appearing to be aimed directly at the lens, actually went around and past it.

The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled &quot;The Murder&quot;. Hitchcock originally intended to have no music for the sequence (and all motel scenes), but Herrmann insisted he try his composition. Afterward, Hitchcock agreed it vastly intensified the scene, and nearly doubled Herrmann&#x27;s salary. The blood in the scene was Hershey&#x27;s chocolate syrup, which shows up better on black-and-white film, and has more realistic density than stage blood. The sound of the knife entering flesh was created by plunging a knife into a melon.

There are varying accounts whether Leigh was in the shower the entire time or a body double was used for some parts of the murder sequence and its aftermath. In an interview with Roger Ebert and in the 1990 book by Stephen Rebello, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho&quot;, Leigh stated she appeared in the scene the entire time and Hitchcock used a stand-in only for the sequence in which Norman wraps Marion&#x27;s body in a shower curtain and places it in the trunk of her car. The 2010 book &quot;The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Shower&quot; by Robert Graysmith and the documentary &quot;78/52: Hitchcock&#x27;s Shower Scene&quot; contradicts this, identifying Marli Renfro as Leigh&#x27;s body double for some of the shower scene&#x27;s shots. Graysmith also stated that Hitchcock later acknowledged Renfro&#x27;s participation in the scene. Rita Riggs, who was in charge of the wardrobe, claims it was Leigh in the shower the entire time, explaining that Leigh did not wish to be nude and so she devised strategic items including pasties, moleskin and bodystockings, to be pasted on Leigh for the scene. Riggs and Leigh went through striptease magazines that showed all the different costumes, but none of them worked because they all had tassels on them.

A popular myth emerged that ice-cold water was used in the shower scene to make Leigh&#x27;s scream realistic. Leigh denied this on numerous occasions, saying the crew was accommodating, using hot water throughout the week-long shoot. All of the screams are Leigh&#x27;s. 

According to Donald Spoto in &quot;The Dark Side of Genius&quot; and Rebello in &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho&quot;, Hitchcock&#x27;s wife and trusted collaborator, Alma Reville, spotted a blooper in one of the last edits of the film before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink. According to Patricia Hitchcock, talking in Laurent Bouzereau&#x27;s &quot;Making of&quot; documentary, Alma spotted that Leigh&#x27;s character appeared to take a breath. In either case, the postmortem activity was edited out and was never seen by audiences. Although Marion&#x27;s eyes should have been dilated after her death, the contact lenses necessary for this effect would have required six weeks of acclimatization to wear them, so Hitchcock decided to forgo them.

It is often claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the shower scene never once shows a knife puncturing flesh. However, a frame by frame analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh&#x27;s abdomen, an effect created through lighting and reverse motion. Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw it that she no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all the doors and windows and would leave the bathroom and shower door open. She never realized until she first watched the film &quot;how vulnerable and defenseless one is&quot;.

Before production, Leigh and Hitchcock fully discussed what the scene meant:
Film theorist Robin Wood also discusses how the shower washes &quot;away her guilt&quot;. He comments upon the &quot;alienation effect&quot; of killing off the &quot;apparent center of the film&quot; with which spectators had identified. The scene was the subject of Philippe&#x27;s 2017 documentary &quot;78/52: Hitchcock&#x27;s Shower Scene&quot;, the title of which references the putative number of cuts and set-ups, respectively, that Hitchcock used to shoot it.

==== Saul Bass&#x27;s claim to credit ====
Aside from the cold water myth, another claim was that graphic designer Saul Bass directed the shower scene. This was denied by several figures associated with the film, including Leigh, who stated: &quot;Absolutely not! I have emphatically said this in any interview I&#x27;ve ever given. I&#x27;ve said it to his face in front of other people ... I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera for every one of those seventy-odd shots&quot;. Green also rebuts the claim: &quot;There is not a shot in that movie that I didn&#x27;t roll the camera for. And I can tell you I never rolled the camera for Mr. Bass&quot;. Ebert, a longtime admirer of Hitchcock&#x27;s work, summarily dismissed the rumor: &quot;It seems unlikely that a perfectionist with an ego like Hitchcock&#x27;s would let someone else direct such a scene&quot;.

Commentators such as Rebello and Bill Krohn have argued in favor of Bass&#x27;s contribution to the scene in his capacity as a visual consultant and storyboard artist. Along with designing the opening credits, Bass is termed &quot;Pictorial Consultant&quot; in the credits. When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, Truffaut asked about the extent of Bass&#x27; contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass&#x27; having provided storyboards for the shower scene.

According to Krohn&#x27;s &quot;Hitchcock at Work&quot;, Bass&#x27; first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution. Krohn&#x27;s analysis of the production, while rebutting Bass&#x27; claims for having directed the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh&#x27;s desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks and the transition from the drain to Marion Crane&#x27;s dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for &quot;Vertigo&quot;. Krohn also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a Mitchell BNC, the other a handheld French &quot;Éclair&quot; camera which Orson Welles had used in &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958). To create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a Moviola on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor George Tomasini worked on with Hitchcock&#x27;s advice, however, did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass&#x27;s storyboards.

== Soundtrack ==
=== Score ===
Hitchcock insisted that Bernard Herrmann write the score for &quot;Psycho&quot; despite the composer&#x27;s refusal to accept a reduced fee for the film&#x27;s lower budget. The resulting score, according to Christopher Palmer in &quot;The Composer in Hollywood&quot; (1990) is &quot;perhaps Herrmann&#x27;s most spectacular Hitchcock achievement&quot;. Hitchcock was pleased with the tension and drama the score added to the film, later remarking &quot;33% of the effect of &quot;Psycho&quot; was due to the music&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Psycho&quot; depended heavily on Herrmann&#x27;s music for its tension and sense of pervading doom&quot;.

Herrmann used the lowered music budget to his advantage by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock&#x27;s request for a jazz score. He thought of the single-tone color of the all-string soundtrack as a way of reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play &quot;con sordini&quot; (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to &quot;Psycho&quot;, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.

The main title music, a tense, hurtling piece, sets the tone of impending violence and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the title music remains in the audience&#x27;s mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film through the use of ostinato.

There were rumors that Herrmann had used electronic means, including amplified bird screeches to achieve the shocking effect of the music in the shower scene. The effect was achieved, however, only with violins in a &quot;screeching, stabbing sound-motion of extraordinary viciousness&quot;. The only electronic amplification employed was in the placing of the microphones close to the instruments, to get a harsher sound. Besides the emotional impact, the shower scene cue ties the soundtrack to birds. The association of the shower scene music with birds also telegraphs to the audience that it is Norman, the stuffed-bird collector, who is the murderer rather than his mother.

Herrmann biographer Steven C. Smith writes that the music for the shower scene is &quot;probably the most famous (and most imitated) cue in film music&quot;, but Hitchcock was originally opposed to having music in this scene. When Herrmann played the shower scene cue for Hitchcock, the director approved its use in the film. Herrmann reminded Hitchcock of his instructions not to score this scene, to which Hitchcock replied: &quot;Improper suggestion, my boy, improper suggestion&quot;. This was one of two important disagreements Hitchcock had with Herrmann, in which Herrmann ignored Hitchcock&#x27;s instructions. The second one, over the score for &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966), resulted in the end of their professional collaboration. A survey conducted by PRS for Music, in 2009, showed that the British public considers the score from &#x27;the shower scene&#x27; to be the scariest theme from any film.

In 1968 Herrmann reworked his original score into a concert piece named &quot;Psycho: A Narrative for String Orchestra&quot;, which he recorded with the London Philharmonic Orchestra the following year. Most of the suite, which included new music, subsequently went missing. In 1999, the conductor John Mauceri, with the help of Herrmann&#x27;s widow, reconstructed the suite and edited it for publication. He produced a second edition in 2013 that restored Herrmann&#x27;s notated string bowings.

To honor the fiftieth anniversary of &quot;Psycho&quot;, in July 2010, the San Francisco Symphony obtained a print of the film with the soundtrack removed, and projected it on a large screen in Davies Symphony Hall while the orchestra performed the score live. This was previously mounted by the Seattle Symphony in October 2009 as well, performing at the Benaroya Hall for two consecutive evenings.

=== Recordings ===
Several CDs of the film score have been released, including:
* October 2, 1975, recording with Bernard Herrmann conducting the National Philharmonic Orchestra [Unicorn CD, 1993].
* The 1997 Varèse Sarabande CD features a re-recording of the complete score performed by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and conducted by Joel McNeely.
* The 1998 Soundstage Records SCD 585 CD claims to feature the tracks from the original master tapes, but it has been asserted that the release is a bootleg recording.
* The 2016 Doxy Records Picture Disc release (Catalog #: DOP 8008) of the complete original score conducted by Herrmann.

== Censorship and taboos ==
&quot;Psycho&quot; is a prime example of the type of film that appeared in the United States during the 1960s after the erosion of the Production Code. It was unprecedented in its depiction of sexuality and violence, right from the opening scene in which Sam and Marion are shown as lovers sharing a bed, with Marion in a bra. In the Production Code standards of that time, unmarried couples shown in the same bed would have been taboo.

Another issue was the gender nonconformity. Perkins, who was allegedly homosexual, and Hitchcock, who previously made &quot;Rope&quot;, were both experienced in the film&#x27;s transgressive subject matter. The viewer is unaware of Bates&#x27;s crossdressing until, at the end of the film, it is revealed during the attempted murder of Lila. At the station, Sam asks why Bates was dressed that way. The police officer, ignorant of Bates&#x27;s split personality, announces his conclusion that Bates is a transvestite. The psychiatrist corrects him and explains that Bates believes that he is his own mother when he dresses in her clothes.

According to Stephen Rebello&#x27;s 1990 book &quot;Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho&quot;, the censors in charge of enforcing the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh&#x27;s breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, and those who had not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh&#x27;s stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Because board members did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed. Another cause of concern for the censors was that Marion was shown flushing a toilet, with its contents (torn-up note paper) fully visible. No flushing toilet had appeared in mainstream film and television in the United States at that time.

Internationally, Hitchcock was forced to make minor changes to the film, mostly to the shower scene. In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) required cuts to stabbing sounds and visible nude shots, and in New Zealand the shot of Norman washing blood from his hands was seen as disgusting. In Singapore, though the shower scene was left untouched, the murder of Arbogast and a shot of Norman&#x27;s mother&#x27;s corpse were removed. In Ireland, censor Gerry O&#x27;Hara banned it upon his initial viewing in 1960. The next year, a highly edited version missing some 47 feet of film was submitted to the Irish censor. O&#x27;Hara ultimately requested that an additional seven cuts be made: the line where Marion tells Sam to put his shoes on (which implied that he had his pants or trousers off), two shots of Norman spying on Marion through the hole in the wall, Marion&#x27;s undressing, the shots of Marion&#x27;s blood flowing down the shower, the shots of Norman washing his hands when blood is visible, repeated incidents of stabbings (&quot;One stab is surely enough&quot;, wrote O&#x27;Hara), the words &quot;in bed&quot; from the sheriff&#x27;s wife&#x27;s line, &quot;Norman found them dead together in bed&quot;, and Arbogast&#x27;s questions to Norman about whether he spent the night with Marion. In 1986, the uncut version of &quot;Psycho&quot; was accepted by the BBFC, which classified it at 15. In 2020, Universal Pictures released the uncut version of the film on Blu-ray for the first time to coincide with its 60th anniversary.

== Release ==

The film was released on June 16, 1960, at the DeMille Theatre and the Baronet Theatre in New York City. It was the first film sold in the US on the basis that no one would be admitted to the theater after the film had started.

Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;no late admission&quot; policy for the film was unusual for the time. It was not an entirely original publicity strategy as Clouzot had done the same in France for &quot;Les Diaboliques&quot; (1955). Hitchcock believed people who entered the theater late and thus never saw the appearance of star actress Janet Leigh would feel cheated. At first theater owners opposed the idea, thinking they would lose business. However, after the first day, the owners enjoyed long lines of people waiting to see the film. Shortly before the release of &quot;Psycho&quot;, Hitchcock promised a film in &quot;the &quot;Diabolique&quot; manner&quot;.

The week after the New York premiere, the film opened at the Paramount Theatre, Boston; the Woods Theatre, Chicago, and the Arcadia Theatre, Philadelphia. After nine weeks of release at the DeMille and the Baronet, the film was released in neighborhood New York theaters, the first time a film had played on Broadway and the neighborhood theaters simultaneously.

=== Promotion ===

Hitchcock did most of the promotion himself, forbidding Leigh and Perkins to make the usual television, radio, and print interviews for fear of them revealing the plot. Even critics were not given private screenings but rather had to see the film with the general public, which may have affected their reviews.

The film&#x27;s original trailer features a jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer on a tour of the set and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is &quot;tracked&quot; with Herrmann&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Trouble with Harry&quot;; most of Hitchcock&#x27;s dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after the completion of the film, and because Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Because the title &quot;Psycho&quot; instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a freeze-frame analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.

=== Rating ===
&quot;Psycho&quot; has been rated and re-rated several times over the years by the MPAA. Upon its initial release, the film received a certificate stating that it was &quot;Approved&quot; (certificate #19564) under the simple pass/fail system of the Production Code in use at that time. Later, when the MPAA switched to a voluntary letter ratings system in 1968, &quot;Psycho&quot; was one of a number of high-profile motion pictures to be retro-rated with an &quot;M&quot; (Suggested for mature audiences: Parental discretion advised) for further distribution. This remained the only rating the film would receive for 16 years, and according to the guidelines of the time &quot;M&quot; was the equivalent of a &quot;PG&quot; rating. In 1984, amidst a controversy surrounding the levels of violence depicted in &quot;PG&quot;-rated films in the VCR era, the film was re-classified to its current rating of &quot;R&quot;.

=== Re-release ===
The film had another successful theatrical reissue in 1969. The film was re-released to cinemas on September 20 and 23, 2015, as part of the &quot;TCM Presents&quot; series by Turner Classic Movies and Fathom Events.

=== Television ===
CBS purchased the television rights for $450,000. CBS planned to televise the film on September 23, 1966, as an installment of its new movie night &quot;The CBS Friday Night Movies&quot;. Three days prior to the scheduled telecast, Valerie Percy, daughter of Illinois senate candidate Charles H. Percy, was murdered. As her parents slept mere feet away, she was stabbed a dozen times with a double-edged knife. In light of the murder, CBS agreed to postpone the broadcast. As a result of the Apollo 1 fire on January 27, 1967, the network again postponed the screening of &quot;Psycho&quot;.

Shortly afterward Paramount included the film in its first syndicated package of post-1950 movies, &quot;Portfolio I&quot;. WABC-TV in New York City was the first station in the country to air &quot;Psycho&quot; (with some scenes significantly edited), on its late-night movie series, &quot;The Best of Broadway&quot;, on June 24, 1967.

The film finally made its way to general television broadcast in one of Universal&#x27;s syndicated programming packages for local stations in 1970. &quot;Psycho&quot; was aired for 20 years in this format, then leased to cable for two years before returning to syndication as part of the &quot;List of a Lifetime&quot; package.

=== Home media ===
The film has been released several times on CED, VHS, LaserDisc, DVD and Blu-ray. DiscoVision first released &quot;Psycho&quot; on the LaserDisc format in &quot;standard play&quot; (five sides) in 1979, and &quot;extended play&quot; (two sides) in October 1981. MCA/Universal Home Video released a new LaserDisc version of &quot;Psycho&quot; in August 1988 (Catalog #: 11003). In May 1998, Universal Studios Home Video released a deluxe edition of &quot;Psycho&quot; as part of their Signature Collection. This THX-certified Widescreen (1.85:1) LaserDisc Deluxe Edition (Catalog #: 43105) is spread across four extended-play sides and one standard-play side, and includes a new documentary and isolated Bernard Herrmann score. A DVD edition was released at the same time as the LaserDisc.

A version of the film with extended footage of Marion undressing (showing her taking off her bra), Norman cleaning up after the murder, and Arbogast&#x27;s death (in which he is stabbed four times instead of two) has been shown on German TV, and was released there on Blu-ray in 2015. This footage had been cut from the US version of the film in 1968 before the re-release of the movie after the ratings system was first established by the MPAA; these cuts were mandated by the National Legion of Decency.

For the DVD release, Laurent Bouzereau produced a documentary looking at the film&#x27;s production and reception. Universal released a 50th anniversary edition on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on August 9, 2010, with Australia making the same edition (with a different cover) available on September 1. To mark the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary, a Blu-ray in the U.S. was released on October 19, 2010, featuring yet another cover. The film is also included on two different Alfred Hitchcock Blu-ray box-sets from Universal.

The film was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray as part of The Alfred Hitchcock Classics Collection in September 2020, along with an individual &quot;60th anniversary&quot; Blu-Ray release as well. This release includes the extended footage from the German release, making it the first time that these scenes were presented to US home video audiences as Hitchcock intended.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
Initial reviews of the film were mixed. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low-budget job&quot;. Crowther called the &quot;slow buildups to sudden shocks&quot; reliably melodramatic but contested Hitchcock&#x27;s psychological points, reminiscent of Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s studies, as less effective. While the film did not conclude satisfactorily for the critic, he commended the cast&#x27;s performances as &quot;fair&quot;. British critic C. A. Lejeune was so offended that she not only walked out before the end, but permanently resigned her post as film critic for &quot;The Observer&quot;. Other negative reviews stated, &quot;a blot on an honorable career&quot;, &quot;plainly a gimmick movie&quot;, and &quot;merely one of those television shows padded out to two hours&quot;. The Catholic Legion of Decency gave the film a B rating, meaning &quot;morally objectionable in part&quot;.

Critics from other New York newspapers, such as the &quot;Daily News&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Village Voice&quot; were positive, writing: &quot;Anthony Perkins&#x27; performance is the best of his career ... Janet Leigh has never been better&quot;, &quot;played out beautifully&quot;, and &quot;first American movie since &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; (1958) to stand in the same creative rank as the great European films&quot;, respectively. A mixed review from the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; stated it was &quot;rather difficult to be amused at the forms insanity may take [but nonetheless] keeps your attention like a snake-charmer&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&#x27; Philip K. Scheuer remarked, in another mixed review, that the film was &quot;one of his most brilliantly directed shockers and also his most disagreeable&quot;. The film ranked ninth on &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;″s Top 10 Films of the Year List in 1960.

It was also well received in Florida, where the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;″s Jack Anderson wrote that &quot;the pudgy master of suspense has dished up a real shocker. And I mean shocker. &quot;Psycho&quot; saws away at every nerve right from its first scene with Janet Leigh in her unmentionables to its last gruesome moment&quot;. Robin Barrett of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s got all the ingredients of a typical Hitchcock if Hitchcock can be termed in any way &quot;typical&quot;, and it&#x27;s definitely his best effort to date, but it&#x27;s unlike anything he&#x27;s done in the past. Mr. H. has pledged us not to reveal the shocking ending or talk about the bizarre plot and shaking fear of diabolical Hitchcock reprisals — we won&#x27;t&quot;.

The film opened to a slightly more muted phrase in Washington, D.C.. Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;marvelously gruesome [...] the sort of eerie, creaky, gobby Snap-Apple-Night that will find many sharooshed and others liverish&quot;. Harry MacArthur of Washington &quot;Evening Star&quot; wrote that &quot;Alfred Hitchcock lets his well-known glee with the gruesome romp all over the place in &quot;Psycho&quot;, latest of his excursions in mayhem and suspense, at the Town Theater. This is a movie he might have made to prove the truth of his oft-quoted statement that he makes pictures for his own amusement. This does not mean, of course, that other moviegoers will not be amused—or shocked or even scared out of their wit by &quot;Psycho&quot;. It does mean that this is a somewhat transparent example of the master&#x27;s work in that you can see him sitting there behind it fiendishly dreaming up shocking situations for the sake of shock alone&quot;. Don Maclean of &quot;The Washington Daily News&quot; urged the reader to &quot;go see it if you like movies that shake you up. But if you&#x27;re afraid to go in your house afterwards and keep watching behind you the rest of the night, don&#x27;t blame me&quot;.

A critic who used the Mae Tinee pseudonym in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; wrote that &quot;the old pro really poured it on in this production. I&#x27;m sure the wily Mr. Hitchcock had fun making this one. He used his camera with a sharp skill to achieve shock value the staring eye, the flowing blood, the sudden plunge of a knife. Audiences react much as they do on a high ride, giggling with nerves and excitement&quot;. In Buffalo, Jeanette Eichel of the &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot; remarked that &quot;Alfred Hitchcock, master of mystery, fuses fear and suspense in his shiver-and-shock show &quot;Psycho&quot; in the Paramount Theater. His pride is that he does not let an audience down by misleading it. His clues are honest and few persons guess the outcome. He especially asked in an epilogue that patrons not betray the ending&quot;.

A more mixed review came courtesy of Marjory Adams of the &quot;Boston Daily Globe&quot;, who wrote that it &quot;is far more macabre and mysterious than any of his previous full-length features. However, the settings are dreary and lack those magnificent backgrounds which Hitchcock employed so effectively in &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;. Perhaps the old mystery master has been more influenced in &quot;Psycho&quot; by his television programs than by his own classics such as &quot;39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Notorious&quot;. However, he gives the audience its money&#x27;s worth. You see two murders committed, with accompanying gore and grisly details. There are so many shocks the theater might be connected to an electric battery&quot;.

Helen Bower of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; was appalled by the film, opening her article by writing: &quot;Gee, whiz, Mr. Hitchcock! Stick to making pictures like &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, instead of one like &quot;Psycho&quot; at the Palms Theater, will you, huh? So okay, &quot;Psycho&quot; gets some nervous laughter and a couple of yips of shock from the audience. But when even the great Hitchcock tries to make visual the dark side of star Anthony Perkin&#x27;s psychopathic personality, the effect is ridiculous. Perhaps the get-up would be the only thing a young man in Perkins&#x27; state of mind could produce. All the same, it makes this phase of Hitch&#x27;s horror movie look laughably corny&quot;. Glenn C. Pullen of the &quot;Cleveland Plain Dealer&quot; praised the performances of Leigh and Perkins, opening his review by writing that &quot;if the movie theater business has any ills, according to &#x27;Doctor&#x27; Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s diagnosis, they can be cured promptly by some blood-letting horrors, a healthy shot of mystery juice, and a chilling bath in bizarre melodrama. This whimsical prescription by the old master of suspense films again proved to be eminently correct in the case of his long-heralded &quot;Psycho&quot;&quot;. Francis Melrose of the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot; praised Leigh&#x27;s and Perkins&#x27; performances and called the film &quot;a shocker that hits you like a pile driver. You most likely will be stunned and reeling as you come out of the theater&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, the film broke attendance records at the London Plaza Cinema, but nearly all British film critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock&#x27;s taste and judgment and calling it his worst film ever. Reasons cited for this were the lack of preview screenings; the fact that they had to turn up at a set time as they would not be admitted after the film had started; their dislike of the gimmicky promotion; and Hitchcock&#x27;s expatriate status. Alexander Walker of the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; wrote that &quot;Alfred Hitchcock may at any time try to frighten me to death, and welcome to him. But I draw the line at being bored to death. There were moments in &quot;Psycho&quot; when I thought he had almost succeeded. Quite an achievement, when you consider the stomach-turning contents of this nasty essay into horror by the master of suspense. &quot;Psycho&quot; is the grisly story of multiple murders at a lonely motel on the edge of Arizona swamp land. Hitchcock has laid the film out like a morbid morgue attendant. His eye for corpses has never been as wide open, nor his sense of bizarre death sharper. But what nauseates one is his sick relish of anything in it that is perverted or blood-spattered. And much is&quot;. Dick Richards of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; called it &quot;a fairly ordinary, sometimes ridiculous melodrama&quot;.

Jack Bentley of the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; wrote that &quot;Alfred Hitchcock, the &#x27;master of suspense&#x27;, has sadly underestimated the intelligence of his audience in presenting this gory story about a homicidal maniac. For his publicity department&#x27;s entreaties to cinemagoers not to reveal the ending is totally unnecessary. I soon tumbled to it—and so will you. There are, however, excellent performances from Vera Miles, Janet Leigh and, in particular, Anthony Perkins&quot;. Ernest Betts of the &quot;Sunday People&quot; called it a &quot;mad, morbid and monstrous film [in which] Hitchcock mixes old-fashioned hokum and the jargon of the psychiatrist to stretch your nerves to screaming point&quot;. In a scathing observation, Frank Lewis of the &quot;Sunday Dispatch&quot; told viewers to &quot;ignore those pleas to keep the ending secret. Anyone above the mental age of 10 will know, only too well, what&#x27;s coming&quot;.

A critic in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; who only gave the initials of R.P.M.G. wrote that the film was &quot;for this director, a disappointing murder melodrama with more absurdities than thrills. It is out of the ordinary only in that it is a little unpleasant. The most rewarding feature is Anthony Perkins&#x27; study of the murderer suffering as the title foretells from psychological disorders. Janet Leigh also gives a pleasing performance as the girl he kills with a knife while she is under a shower&quot;. A critic for the same newspaper, Patrick Gibbs, wrote that &quot;it almost seems as if the director were pulling our legs and by way of improving the joke he leads us up the garden path—like Haydn in the &#x27;Surprise Symphony&#x27;—with some serious completely realistic opening passages typically full of tension and suspense&quot;. C.A. Lejeune of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote that &quot;the stupid air of mystery and portent surrounding &quot;Psycho&quot;″s presentation strikes me as a tremendous error. It makes the film automatically suspect&quot;. However, an unidentified critic in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, then based in Manchester, was somewhat more favorable in his reaction, saying that the film offered &quot;no more than quite a good sample of the old Hitchcock style, rich in suspense, tension, and the rest of it; and it is also typical in being brilliant in patches and, as a whole, quite implausible&quot;.

Critics later reassessed the film far more positively. &quot;Time&quot; magazine switched its opinion from &quot;Hitchcock bears down too heavily in this one&quot; to &quot;superlative&quot; and &quot;masterly&quot;, and Bosley Crowther changed his initial opinion and included it in his Top Ten list of 1960, deeming it a &quot;bold psychological mystery picture... [I]t represented expert and sophisticated command of emotional development with cinematic techniques&quot;.

&quot;Psycho&quot; was criticized for inspiring other filmmakers to show gory content; three years later, &quot;Blood Feast&quot;, considered to be the first &quot;splatter film&quot;, was released. Inspired by &quot;Psycho&quot;, Hammer Film Productions launched a series of mystery thrillers including &quot;The Nanny&quot; (1965) starring Bette Davis and William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Homicidal&quot; (1961) was followed by a slew of more than thirteen other splatter films.

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Psycho&quot; has an approval rating of 97% based on 117 reviews, with an average score of 9.3/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Infamous for its shower scene, but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre. Because &quot;Psycho&quot; was filmed with tact, grace, and art, Hitchcock didn&#x27;t just create modern horror, he validated it&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 97 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In his 1998 review of &quot;Psycho&quot; film critic Roger Ebert summarised the film&#x27;s enduring appeal, writing: 

=== Box office ===
In its opening week, &quot;Psycho&quot; grossed $46,500 at the DeMille and a record $19,500 at the Baronet. Following its expansion the following week, it grossed $143,000 from 5 theaters. &quot;Psycho&quot; broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.

It went on to become the second highest-grossing film of 1960, behind &quot;Spartacus&quot;, earning a box office gross of $32 million, which generated approximately $9.1 million in North American theatrical rentals. &quot;Psycho&quot; remains the most commercially successful film of Hitchcock&#x27;s career. Hitchcock personally earned in excess of $15 million from &quot;Psycho&quot;. He then swapped his rights to &quot;Psycho&quot; and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.

==Accolades==
In 1992, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 1998, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it No. 8 on their list of the 50 Greatest Movies on TV (and Video).

&quot;Psycho&quot; has appeared on a number of lists by websites, television channels, and magazines. The shower scene was featured as number four on the list of Bravo Network&#x27;s 100 Scariest Movie Moments, while the finale was ranked number four on &quot;Premiere&quot;″s similar list. In the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the greatest films ever made, &quot;Psycho&quot; was 35th among critics and 48th among directors.

In the earlier 2002 version of the list the film ranked 35th among critics and 19th among directors. In the 2022 edition of BFI&#x27;s &quot;Greatest films of all time&quot; list the film ranked 31st in the critics poll and 46th in the director&#x27;s poll. In 1998 &quot;Time Out&quot; conducted a reader&#x27;s poll and &quot;Psycho&quot; was voted the 29th greatest film of all time. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; ranked &quot;Psycho&quot; at No. 19 in its Top 250 &quot;Best Films of the Century&quot; list in 1999, based on a poll of critics. The film was listed as one of TCM&#x27;s top 15 most influential films of all-time list.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; voted it the 11th Greatest film of all time in 1999. In January 2002, the film was voted at No. 72 on the list of the &quot;Top 100 Essential Films of All Time&quot; by the National Society of Film Critics. The film was included in &quot;Time&quot;″s All-Time 100 best movies list in 2005. In 2005, &quot;Total Film&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Psycho&quot; as the 6th-greatest horror film of all time. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper ranked it as &quot;the best horror film of all time&quot;. Director Martin Scorsese included &quot;Psycho&quot; in his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time. The film was named as the third best horror movie of all time in a readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2014. In 2017 Empire magazine&#x27;s reader&#x27;s poll ranked &quot;Psycho&quot; at No. 53 on its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot;. In an earlier poll held by the same magazine in 2008, it was voted 45th on the list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time&quot;. In 2021, the film was ranked at No. 5 by Time Out on their list of &quot;The 100 best horror movies&quot;.

In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed the film as the twelfth best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its membership. &quot;Psycho&quot; was ranked 8th in BBC&#x27;s 2015 list of the 100 greatest American films. In 2022, Variety named &quot;Psycho&quot; the greatest movie of all time, and in 2024 as the third greatest horror film.

== Themes and style ==
=== Subversion of romance through irony ===
In &quot;Psycho&quot;, Hitchcock subverts the romantic elements that are seen in most of his work. The film is instead ironic as it presents &quot;clarity and fulfillment&quot; of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters &quot;struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories&quot; and ultimately fail. Lesley Brill writes: &quot;The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness&quot;. The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film. Marion is like Persephone of Greek mythology, who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral prints like Persephone&#x27;s flowers, but they are only &quot;reflected in mirrors, as images of images—twice removed from reality&quot;. In the scene of Marion&#x27;s death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion&#x27;s lifeless eye, &quot;like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption&quot;.

Marion is deprived of &quot;the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family&quot;, which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among &quot;Psycho&quot;″s secondary characters a lack of &quot;familial warmth and stability&quot;, which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion&#x27;s sister Lila, in investigating Marion&#x27;s disappearance, develop an &quot;increasingly connubial&quot; relationship, a development that Marion is denied. Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has &quot;an infantile and divided personality&quot; and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are &quot;frozen in time&quot; and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion&#x27;s suggestion to put his mother &quot;someplace&quot; and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains: Someplace&#x27; for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed&quot;.

Light and darkness feature prominently in &quot;Psycho&quot;. The first shot after the intertitle is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness. Bright lights are also &quot;the ironic equivalent of darkness&quot; in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam&#x27;s and Marion&#x27;s hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, &quot;the glaring white&quot; of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar&#x27;s exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman&#x27;s mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock&#x27;s films.

=== Motifs ===
The film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds&#x27; shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman&#x27;s mother is seen in only shadows until the end. More subtly, backlighting turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila&#x27;s head.

Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman&#x27;s sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership&#x27;s bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion&#x27;s windshield and the telephone booth when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.

There are a number of references to birds. Norman&#x27;s hobby is stuffing birds. Marion&#x27;s last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. (In the novel, Norman&#x27;s hobby is taxidermy but it is not focused on birds, and Marion is from Dallas, Texas.) Norman comments that she eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman&#x27;s hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, &quot;stuffing birds&quot;, &quot;bird&quot; being British slang for a desirable woman. Robert Allan suggests that Norman&#x27;s mother is his original &quot;stuffed bird&quot;, both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman&#x27;s emotional bond with her.

=== Psychoanalytic interpretation ===
&quot;Psycho&quot; has been called &quot;the first psychoanalytical thriller&quot;. The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. French film critic Serge Kaganski wrote: &quot;The shower scene is both feared and desired. Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists because Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene&quot;.

In his documentary &quot;The Pervert&#x27;s Guide to Cinema&quot;, Slavoj Žižek remarks that Norman Bates&#x27; mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates&#x27; mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates&#x27; ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and the basement would be Bates&#x27; id. Žižek interprets Bates&#x27; moving his mother&#x27;s corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.

== Legacy ==

&quot;Psycho&quot; has become one of the most recognizable films in cinema history, and is arguably Hitchcock&#x27;s best known film. In his novel, Bloch used an uncommon plot structure: he repeatedly introduced sympathetic protagonists, then killed them off. This played on his reader&#x27;s expectations of traditional plots, leaving them uncertain and anxious. Hitchcock recognized the effect this approach could have on audiences, and utilized it in his adaptation, killing off Leigh&#x27;s character at the end of the first act. This daring plot device, coupled with the fact that the character was played by the biggest box-office name in the film, was a shocking turn of events in 1960.

The shower scene has become a pop culture touchstone and is often regarded as one of the most iconic moments in cinematic history, as well as the most suspenseful scene ever filmed. Its effectiveness is often credited to the use of startling editing techniques borrowed from the Soviet montage filmmakers, and to the iconic screeching violins in Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s musical score. In 2000 &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the shower scene at No. 2 on their list of &quot;The top 10 film moments&quot;. The scene has been frequently parodied and referenced in popular culture, complete with the screeching violin sound effects (such as &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;, among many others). &quot;78/52: Hitchcock&#x27;s Shower Scene&quot;, a documentary on its production by Alexandre O. Philippe, was released on October 13, 2017. It features interviews with and analysis by Guillermo del Toro, Peter Bogdanovich, Bret Easton Ellis, Jamie Lee Curtis, Karyn Kusama, Eli Roth, Oz Perkins, Leigh Whannell, Walter Murch, Danny Elfman, Elijah Wood, Richard Stanley, and Neil Marshall.

&quot;Psycho&quot; is considered by some to be the first film in the slasher film genre, though some critics and film historians point to Michael Powell&#x27;s &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;, a lesser-known film with similar themes of voyeurism and sexualized violence, whose release happened to precede &quot;Psycho&quot;″s by a few months. However, due to &quot;Peeping Tom&quot;″s critical drubbing at the time and short lifespan at the box office, &quot;Psycho&quot; was the more widely known and influential film.

In 2018, Zachary Paul of Bloody Disgusting said &quot;Psycho&quot; inspired subsequent horror films that had gender bender reveals, citing &quot;Terror Train&quot; (1980), &quot;Sleepaway Camp&quot; (1983), and the &quot;Insidious&quot; franchise (2011-) as examples. Paul criticized all these films for equating queerness with derangement but noted the makers of these films didn&#x27;t intend to offend anyone. Paul added &quot;The days of gender reveals posing as a big twist come the third act of any mystery or hack n&#x27; slash flick are likely numbered. The trope has certainly had its day in the sun, and it&#x27;s best we all move on&quot;.

&quot;Psycho&quot; has been referenced in other films numerous times: examples include the 1974 musical comedy horror film &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot;; the 1978 horror film &quot;Halloween&quot; (which starred Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh&#x27;s daughter, and which featured a character named Sam Loomis); the 1977 Mel Brooks tribute to many of Hitchcock&#x27;s thrillers, &quot;High Anxiety&quot;; the 1980 &quot;Fade to Black&quot;; the 1980 &quot;Dressed to Kill&quot;; and Wes Craven&#x27;s 1996 horror satire &quot;Scream&quot;. Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s opening theme has been sampled by rapper Busta Rhymes on his song &quot;Gimme Some More&quot; (1998). Manuel Muñoz&#x27;s 2011 novel &quot;What You See in the Dark&quot; includes a sub-plot that fictionalizes elements of the filming of &quot;Psycho&quot;, referring to Hitchcock and Leigh only as &quot;The Director&quot; and &quot;The Actress&quot;. In the comic book stories of Jonni Future, the house inherited by the title character is patterned after the Bates Motel. The film was played alongside &quot;The Shining&quot; at the drive-in theater as part of the Night of Horrors combo in the 1996 film &quot;Twister&quot;. In the 2003 animated film &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, the &quot;Psycho&quot; theme song is played in reference to Dr. Sherman&#x27;s niece Darla, whose pet fish are known to have died in her possession.

The film boosted Perkins&#x27; career, but he soon began to suffer from typecasting. When Perkins was asked whether he would have still taken the role knowing that he would be typecast afterwards, he said, &quot;Yes&quot;. As Perkins was in New York working on a Broadway stage show when the shower sequence was filmed, actresses Anne Dore and Margo Epper stepped in as his body doubles for that scene. Until her death in 2004, Leigh received strange and sometimes threatening calls, letters, and even tapes detailing what the caller would like to do to Marion Crane. One letter was so &quot;grotesque&quot; that she passed it to the FBI. Two agents visited Leigh and told her the culprits had been located and that she should notify the FBI if she received any more letters of that type.

Leigh said: &quot;No other murder mystery in the history of the movies has inspired such merchandising&quot;. A number of items emblazoned with &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, stills, lobby cards, and highly valuable posters are available for purchase. In 1992 Innovation Comics published a three-issue, shot-for-shot comics miniseries adaptation of the film. In 2010, Taylor Swift starred in a TV concert-documentary special that aired on NBC on Thanksgiving to promote her album &quot;Speak Now&quot;. In the special, Swift and her band perform her song &quot;Haunted&quot; at the Bates haunted house during Universal&#x27;s Halloween Horror Nights. The film was mentioned and a trademark of its soundtrack was also used in Billy Joel&#x27;s song &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;.

== Sequels and remake ==

Three sequels were produced after Hitchcock died: &quot;Psycho II&quot; (1983), &quot;Psycho III&quot; (1986), and &quot;Psycho IV: The Beginning&quot; (1990), the last being a part-prequel television movie written by the original screenplay author, Joseph Stefano. Anthony Perkins returned to his role of Norman Bates in all three sequels, and also directed the third film. The voice of Norman Bates&#x27; mother was maintained by noted radio actress Virginia Gregg with the exception of &quot;Psycho IV&quot;, where the role was played by Olivia Hussey. Vera Miles also reprised her role of Lila Crane in &quot;Psycho II&quot;. The sequels received mixed reviews and were universally considered inferior to the original.

In 1998, Gus Van Sant made a nearly shot-for-shot remake (in color) starring Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, and Anne Heche. Van Sant said that his film was &quot;a huge kind of experimental project&quot;, and that, though it did not do well commercially or critically, he may do it again, with more changes.

<text>The protocol stack or network stack is an implementation of a computer networking protocol suite or protocol family. Some of these terms are used interchangeably but strictly speaking, the &quot;suite&quot; is the definition of the communication protocols, and the &quot;stack&quot; is the software implementation of them.

Individual protocols within a suite are often designed with a single purpose in mind. This modularization simplifies design and evaluation. Because each protocol module usually communicates with two others, they are commonly imagined as layers in a stack of protocols. The lowest protocol always deals with low-level interaction with the communications hardware. Each higher layer adds additional capabilities. User applications usually deal only with the topmost layers.

==General protocol suite description==
 T ~ ~ ~ T
 [A] [B]_____[C]

Imagine three computers: &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; both have radio equipment and can communicate via the airwaves using a suitable network protocol (such as IEEE 802.11). &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are connected via a cable, using it to exchange data (again, with the help of a protocol, for example Point-to-Point Protocol). However, neither of these two protocols will be able to transport information from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;C&quot;, because these computers are conceptually on different networks. An inter-network protocol is required to connect them.

One could combine the two protocols to form a powerful third, mastering both cable and wireless transmission, but a different super-protocol would be needed for each possible combination of protocols. It is easier to leave the base protocols alone and design a protocol that can work on top of any of them (the Internet Protocol is an example). This will make two stacks of two protocols each. The inter-network protocol will communicate with each of the base protocols in their simpler language; the base protocols will not talk directly to each other.

A request on computer &quot;A&quot; to send a chunk of data to &quot;C&quot; is taken by the upper protocol, which (through whatever means) knows that &quot;C&quot; is reachable through &quot;B&quot;. It, therefore, instructs the wireless protocol to transmit the data packet to &quot;B&quot;. On this computer, the lower layer handlers will pass the packet up to the inter-network protocol, which, on recognizing that &quot;B&quot; is not the final destination, will again invoke lower-level functions. This time, the cable protocol is used to send the data to &quot;C&quot;. There, the received packet is again passed to the upper protocol, which (with &quot;C&quot; being the destination) will pass it on to a higher protocol or application on &quot;C&quot;.

In practical implementation, protocol stacks are often divided into three major sections: media, transport, and applications. A particular operating system or platform will often have two well-defined software interfaces: one between the media and transport layers, and one between the transport layers and applications. The media-to-transport interface defines how transport protocol software makes use of particular media and hardware types and is associated with a device driver. For example, this interface level would define how TCP/IP transport software would talk to the network interface controller. Examples of these interfaces include ODI and NDIS in the Microsoft Windows and DOS environment. The application-to-transport interface defines how application programs make use of the transport layers. For example, this interface level would define how a web browser program would talk to TCP/IP transport software. Examples of these interfaces include Berkeley sockets and System V STREAMS in Unix-like environments, and Winsock for Microsoft Windows.

==Examples==


==Spanning layer==
An important feature of many communities of interoperability based on a common protocol stack is a spanning layer, a term coined by David Clark
Certain protocols are designed with the specific purpose of bridging differences at the lower layers, so that common agreements are not required there. Instead, the layer provides the definitions that permit translation to occur between a range of services or technologies used below. Thus, in somewhat abstract terms, at and above such a layer common standards contribute to interoperation, while below the layer translation is used. Such a layer is called a &quot;spanning layer&quot; in this paper. As a practical matter, real interoperation is achieved by the definition and use of effective spanning layers. But there are many different ways that a spanning layer can be crafted.

In the Internet protocol stack, the Internet Protocol Suite constitutes a spanning layer that defines a best-effort service for global routing of datagrams at Layer 3. The Internet is the community of interoperation based on this spanning layer.

<text>Pilsner (also pilsener or simply pils) is a type of pale lager. It takes its name from the Bohemian city of Plzeň (), where the world&#x27;s first pale lager (now known as Pilsner Urquell) was produced in 1842 by Pilsner Urquell Brewery.

==History==

===Origin===
The city of Plzeň was granted brewing rights in 1307. Until the mid-1840s, most Bohemian beers were top-fermented. The Pilsner Urquell Brewery, originally called in (, ), is where Pilsen beer was first brewed.

Brewers had begun aging beer made with cool fermenting yeasts in caves (lager, i.e., [stored]), which improved the beer&#x27;s clarity and shelf-life. Part of this research benefited from the knowledge already expounded on in a book (printed in German in 1794, in Czech in 1799) written by Czech brewer () (1753–1805) from Brno.

The Plzeň brewery recruited the Bavarian brewer Josef Groll (1813–1887) who, using the local ingredients, produced the first batch of pale lager on 5 October 1842. The combination of Plzeň&#x27;s remarkably soft water, local Saaz noble hops from nearby Žatec, low-protein Moravian barley malt prepared by indirectly heated kilning, and Bavarian-style lagering produced a clear, golden beer.

By 1853, the beer was available at 35 pubs in Prague. In 1856, it came to Vienna and in 1862 to Paris. In 1859, was registered as a brand name at the Chamber of Commerce and Trade in Plzeň. In 1898, the Pilsner Urquell trademark was created to put emphasis on being the original brewery (&quot;Urquell,&quot; meaning &#x27;original source&#x27;).

Some beers are labeled &quot;Urtyp Pilsener&quot; (UP) meaning they are brewed according to the original process, although many breweries use this accolade for their top beer.

===Modern developments===
The introduction of modern refrigeration to Germany by Carl von Linde in the late 19th century eliminated the need for caves for beer storage, enabling the brewing and storing of cool fermenting beer in many new locations.

Until 1993 the Pilsner Urquell brewery fermented its beer using open barrels in the cellars beneath their brewery. This changed in 1993 with the use of large cylindrical tanks. Small samples are still brewed in a traditional way for taste comparisons.

A modern pale lager termed a &quot;pilsner&quot; may have a very light, clear colour from pale to golden yellow, with varying levels of hop aroma and flavour. The alcohol strength of beers termed pilsner vary but are typically around 4.5%–5% (by volume). There are categories such as &quot;European-Style Pilsner&quot; at beer competitions such as the World Beer Cup. Pilsner style lagers are marketed internationally by numerous small brewers and larger conglomerates.

==Styles==
;Czech-style Pilsner: Bright golden colour, moderately bitter and distinct aroma, brewed with malt and Saaz hops. In the Czech Republic, only Pilsner Urquell is named as &quot;pilsner&quot;. However, outside of the Czech Republic, Czech-style Pilsner is synonymous with any such lager beers (including any Czech brand) – for example Pilsner Urquell, Budweiser Budvar, Gambrinus, Kozel, Radegast, Staropramen, Starobrno and Krušovice.

;German-style Pilsner:Light straw to golden colour with more bitter or earthy taste – such as Beck&#x27;s, Bitburger, Flensburger, Fürstenberg, Holsten, Jever, König, Krombacher, Radeberger, St. Pauli Girl, Veltins, Warsteiner, Wernesgrüner and Einbecker.

;European-style Pilsner:Has a slightly sweet taste, can be produced from grains other than barley malt – such as the Dutch: Amstel, Grolsch and Heineken or Belgian: Jupiler, Maes and Stella Artois.

;Mexican-style Pilsner:A type of pale lager, with a taste that is crisp, clean, and balanced. Many German and other Europeans immigrated during the period of the Second Mexican Empire, with Maximilian I of Mexico (who had his own brewer) coming from the Austrian branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, and they brought their style of beer making traditions with them. Except for some dark beers (Dos Equis Ambar, León Negra, Modelo Negra, and Noche Buena), which are Vienna-style beers almost all beer produced in Mexico is pilsner. Pacífico, a Mexican pilsner is named after the Pacific Ocean. Modelo Especial is described as a Pilsner lager by the brewer, but has a slightly richer and fuller taste than Corona.

;American-style Pilsner: German immigrants brought pilsner style beers to America in the mid-19th century. American pilsners today are still closer to the German style, but a traditional grist may contain up to 25% corn and/or rice. American pilsners have “significantly less flavor, hops, and bitterness than traditional European Pilsners,” according to the Beer Judge Certification Program.

;Australian-style Pilsner: Light straw to golden colour with more crisp, clean earthy taste.

<doc id="23886" wikidata="Q120999319" url="?curid=23886" title="Phlogiston theory">
<text>The phlogiston theory, a superseded scientific theory, postulated the existence of a fire-like element dubbed phlogiston () contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. The name comes from the Ancient Greek (&quot;burning up&quot;), from (&quot;flame&quot;). The idea of a substance was first proposed in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher and later put together more formally in 1703 by Georg Ernst Stahl. Phlogiston theory attempted to explain chemical processes such as combustion and rusting, now collectively known as oxidation. The theory was challenged by the concomitant weight increase and was abandoned before the end of the 18th century following experiments by Antoine Lavoisier in the 1770s and by other scientists. Phlogiston theory led to experiments that ultimately resulted in the identification (), and naming (1777), of oxygen by Joseph Priestley and Antoine Lavoisier, respectively.

==Theory==
Phlogiston theory states that &quot;phlogisticated&quot; substances contain phlogiston and that they &quot;dephlogisticate&quot; when burned, releasing stored phlogiston, which is absorbed by the air. Growing plants then absorb this phlogiston, which is why air does not spontaneously combust and also why plant matter burns. This method of accounting for combustion was inverse to the oxygen theory by Antoine Lavoisier.

In general, substances that burned in the air were said to be rich in phlogiston; the fact that combustion soon ceased in an enclosed space was taken as clear-cut evidence that air had the capacity to absorb only a finite amount of phlogiston. When the air had become completely phlogisticated it would no longer serve to support the combustion of any material, nor would a metal heated in it yield a calx; nor could phlogisticated air support life. Breathing was thought to take phlogiston out of the body.

Joseph Black&#x27;s Scottish student Daniel Rutherford discovered nitrogen in 1772, and the pair used the theory to explain his results. The residue of air left after burning, in fact, a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, was sometimes referred to as &quot;phlogisticated air,&quot; having taken up all of the phlogiston. Conversely, when Joseph Priestley discovered oxygen, he believed it to be &quot;dephlogisticated air,&quot; capable of combining with more phlogiston and thus supporting combustion for longer than ordinary air.

==History==
Empedocles had formulated the classical theory that there were four elements—water, earth, fire, and air—and Aristotle reinforced this idea by characterising them as moist, dry, hot, and cold. Fire was thus thought of as a substance, and burning was seen as a process of decomposition that applied only to compounds. Experience had shown that burning was not always accompanied by a loss of material, and a better theory was needed to account for this.

=== Johann Joachim Becher ===
In 1667, Johann Joachim Becher published his book , which contained the first instance of what would become the phlogiston theory. In his book, Becher eliminated fire and air from the classical element model and replaced them with three forms of the earth: , , and . was the element that imparted oily, sulphurous, or combustible properties. Becher believed that was a key feature of combustion and was released when combustible substances were burned. Becher did not have much to do with phlogiston theory as we know it now, but he had a large influence on his student Stahl. Becher&#x27;s main contribution was the start of the theory itself, however much of it was changed after him. Becher&#x27;s idea was that combustible substances contain an ignitable matter, the .

=== Georg Ernst Stahl ===
In 1703, Georg Ernst Stahl, a professor of medicine and chemistry at Halle, proposed a variant of the theory in which he renamed Becher&#x27;s to &quot;phlogiston&quot;, and it was in this form that the theory probably had its greatest influence. The term &#x27;phlogiston&#x27; itself was not something that Stahl invented. There is evidence that the word was used as early as 1606, and in a way that was very similar to what Stahl was using it for. The term was derived from a Greek word meaning inflame. The following paragraph describes Stahl&#x27;s view of phlogiston:

Stahl&#x27;s first definition of phlogiston first appeared in his , published in 1697. His most quoted definition was found in the treatise on chemistry entitled in 1723. According to Stahl, phlogiston was a substance that was not able to be put into a bottle but could be transferred nonetheless. To him, wood was just a combination of ash and phlogiston, and making a metal was as simple as getting a metal calx and adding phlogiston. Soot was almost pure phlogiston, which is why heating it with a metallic calx transforms the calx into the metal and Stahl attempted to prove that the phlogiston in soot and sulphur were identical by converting sulphates to liver of sulphur using charcoal. He did not account for the increase in weight on combustion of tin and lead that were known at the time.

=== J. H. Pott ===
Johann Heinrich Pott, a student of one of Stahl&#x27;s students, expanded the theory and attempted to make it much more understandable to a general audience. He compared phlogiston to light or fire, saying that all three were substances whose natures were widely understood but not easily defined. He thought that phlogiston should not be considered as a particle but as an essence that permeates substances, arguing that in a pound of any substance, one could not simply pick out the particles of phlogiston. Pott also observed the fact that when certain substances are burned they increase in mass instead of losing the mass of the phlogiston as it escapes; according to him, phlogiston was the basic fire principle and could not be obtained by itself. Flames were considered to be a mix of phlogiston and water, while a phlogiston-and-earthy mixture could not burn properly. Phlogiston permeates everything in the universe, it could be released as heat when combined with an acid. Pott proposed the following properties:
# The form of phlogiston consists of a circular movement around its axis.
# When homogeneous it cannot be consumed or dissipated in a fire.
# The reason it causes expansion in most bodies is unknown, but not accidental. It is proportional to the compactness of the texture of the bodies or to the intimacy of their constitution.
# The increase of weight during calcination is evident only after a long time, and is due either to the fact that the particles of the body become more compact, decrease the volume and hence increase the density as in the case of lead, or those little heavy particles of air become lodged in the substance as in the case of powdered zinc oxide.
# Air attracts the phlogiston of bodies.
# When set in motion, phlogiston is the chief active principle in nature of all inanimate bodies.
# It is the basis of colours.
# It is the principal agent in fermentation.

Pott&#x27;s formulations proposed little new theory; he merely supplied further details and rendered existing theory more approachable to the common man.

=== Others ===
Johann Juncker also created a very complete picture of phlogiston. When reading Stahl&#x27;s work, he assumed that phlogiston was in fact very material. He, therefore, came to the conclusion that phlogiston has the property of levity, or that it makes the compound that it is in much lighter than it would be without the phlogiston. He also showed that air was needed for combustion by putting substances in a sealed flask and trying to burn them.

Guillaume-François Rouelle brought the theory of phlogiston to France, where he was a very influential scientist and teacher, popularizing the theory very quickly. Many of his students became very influential scientists in their own right, Lavoisier included. The French viewed phlogiston as a very subtle principle that vanishes in all analysis, yet it is in all bodies. Essentially they followed straight from Stahl&#x27;s theory.

Giovanni Antonio Giobert introduced Lavoisier&#x27;s work in Italy. Giobert won a prize competition from the Academy of Letters and Sciences of Mantua in 1792 for his work refuting phlogiston theory. He presented a paper at the of Turin on 18 March 1792, entitled (&quot;Chemical examination of the doctrine of phlogiston and the doctrine of pneumatists in relation to the nature of water&quot;), which is considered the most original defence of Lavoisier&#x27;s theory of water composition to appear in Italy.

==Challenge and demise==
Eventually, quantitative experiments revealed problems, including the fact that some metals gained weight after they burned, even though they were supposed to have lost phlogiston.
Some phlogiston proponents, like Robert Boyle, explained this by concluding that phlogiston has negative mass; others, such as Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, gave the more conventional argument that it is lighter than air. However, a more detailed analysis based on Archimedes&#x27; principle, the densities of magnesium and its combustion product showed that just being lighter than air could not account for the increase in weight. Stahl himself did not address the problem of the metals that burn gaining weight, but those who followed his school of thought were the ones that worked on this problem.

During the eighteenth century, as it became clear that metals gained weight after they were oxidized, phlogiston was increasingly regarded as a &quot;principle&quot; rather than a material substance. By the end of the eighteenth century, for the few chemists who still used the term phlogiston, the concept was linked to hydrogen. Joseph Priestley, for example, in referring to the reaction of steam on iron, while fully acknowledging that the iron gains weight after it binds with oxygen to form a calx, iron oxide, iron also loses &quot;the basis of inflammable air (hydrogen), and this is the substance or principle, to which we give the name phlogiston&quot;. Following Lavoisier&#x27;s description of oxygen as the &quot;oxidizing principle&quot; (hence its name, from Ancient Greek: , &quot;sharp&quot;; , &quot;birth&quot; referring to oxygen&#x27;s supposed role in the formation of acids), Priestley described phlogiston as the &quot;alkaline principle.&quot;

Phlogiston remained the dominant theory until the 1770s when Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier showed that combustion requires a gas that has weight (specifically, oxygen) and could be measured by means of weighing closed vessels. The use of closed vessels by Lavoisier and earlier by the Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov also negated the buoyancy that had disguised the weight of the gases of combustion, and culminated in the principle of mass conservation. These observations solved the mass paradox and set the stage for the new oxygen theory of combustion. The British chemist Elizabeth Fulhame demonstrated through experiment that many oxidation reactions occur only in the presence of water, that they directly involve water, and that water is regenerated and is detectable at the end of the reaction. Based on her experiments, she disagreed with some of the conclusions of Lavoisier as well as with the phlogiston theorists that he critiqued. Her book on the subject appeared in print soon after Lavoisier&#x27;s execution for Farm-General membership during the French Revolution.

Experienced chemists who supported Stahl&#x27;s phlogiston theory attempted to respond to the challenges suggested by Lavoisier and the newer chemists. In doing so, phlogiston theory became more complicated and assumed too much, contributing to the overall demise of the theory. Many people tried to remodel their theories on phlogiston to have the theory work with what Lavoisier was doing in his experiments. Pierre Macquer reworded his theory many times, and even though he is said to have thought the theory of phlogiston was doomed, he stood by phlogiston and tried to make the theory work.

<text>In German folklore and ghostlore, a poltergeist ( or ; ; or ) is a type of ghost or spirit that is responsible for physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects being moved or destroyed. Most claims or fictional descriptions of poltergeists show them as being capable of pinching, biting, hitting, and tripping people. They are also depicted as capable of the movement or levitation of objects such as furniture and cutlery, or noises such as knocking on doors. Foul smells are also associated with poltergeist occurrences, as well as spontaneous fires and different electrical issues such as flickering lights.

These manifestations have been recorded in many cultures and countries, including Brazil, Australia, the United States, Japan and most European nations. The first recorded cases date back to the 1st century.

Skeptics explain poltergeists as juvenile tricksters fooling credulous adults.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;poltergeist&quot; comes from the German language words and and the term itself translates as , or a .

==Suggested explanations==
===Hoax===
Many claims have been made that poltergeist activity explains strange events (including those by modern self-styled ghost hunters), however, their evidence has so far not stood up to scrutiny. Many claimed poltergeist events have been proven upon investigation to be hoaxes.

Psychical researcher Frank Podmore proposed the &#x27;naughty little girl&#x27; theory for poltergeist cases (many of which have seemed to centre on an adolescent, usually a girl). He found that the centre of the disturbance was often a child who was throwing objects around to fool or scare people for attention. Skeptical investigator Joe Nickell says that claimed poltergeist incidents typically originate from &quot;an individual who is motivated to cause mischief&quot;. According to Nickell:

In the typical poltergeist outbreak, small objects are hurled through the air by unseen forces, furniture is overturned, or other disturbances occur—usually just what could be accomplished by a juvenile trickster determined to plague credulous adults.

Nickell writes that reports are often exaggerated by credulous witnesses.

Time and time again in other &quot;poltergeist&quot; outbreaks, witnesses have reported an object leaping from its resting place supposedly on its own, when it is likely that the perpetrator had secretly obtained the object sometime earlier and waited for an opportunity to fling it, even from outside the room—thus supposedly proving he or she was innocent.

Unsubstantiated claims:
* Stockwell ghost (1772) - since 1825 
* Ballechin House (1876)
* The Enfield poltergeist claim (1977) - John Beloff, a former president of the Society for Psychical Research and Anita Gregory concluded that the claimants were playing tricks on the investigators.
* Columbus poltergeist case (1984)

===Psychological===
A claim of activity at Caledonia Mills (1899–1922) was investigated by Walter Franklin Prince, research officer for the American Society for Psychical Research in 1922. Prince concluded that the mysterious fires and alleged poltergeist phenomena were because of a psychological state of dissociation.

Nandor Fodor investigated the Thornton Heath poltergeist claim (1938). His conclusion of the case were a psychoanalytical explanation and in a subsequent publication: &quot;The poltergeist is not a ghost. It is a bundle of projected repressions,&quot;.

According to research in anomalistic psychology, claims of poltergeist activity can be explained by psychological factors such as illusion, memory lapses, and wishful thinking. A study (Lange and Houran, 1998) wrote that poltergeist experiences are delusions &quot;resulting from the affective and cognitive dynamics of percipients&#x27; interpretation of ambiguous stimuli&quot;. Psychologist Donovan Rawcliffe has written that almost all poltergeist cases that have been investigated turned out to be based on trickery, whilst the rest are attributable to psychological factors such as hallucinations.

Psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung was interested in the concept of poltergeists and the occult in general. Jung believed that a female cousin&#x27;s trance states were responsible for a dining table splitting in two and his later discovery of a broken bread knife.

Jung also believed that when a bookcase gave an explosive cracking sound during a meeting with Sigmund Freud in 1909, he correctly predicted there would be a second sound, speculating that such phenomena were caused by &#x27;exteriorization&#x27; of his subconscious mind. Freud disagreed, and concluded there was some natural cause. Freud biographers maintain the sounds were likely caused by the wood of the bookcase contracting as it dried out.

===Unverified natural phenomena===
Attempts have also been made to scientifically explain poltergeist disturbances that have not been traced to fraud or psychological factors. Skeptic and magician Milbourne Christopher found that some cases of poltergeist activity can be attributed to unusual air currents, such as a 1957 case on Cape Cod where downdrafts from an uncovered chimney became strong enough to blow a mirror off a wall, overturn chairs and knock things off shelves.

In the 1950s, Guy William Lambert proposed that reported poltergeist phenomena could be explained by the movement of underground water causing stress on houses. He suggested that water turbulence could cause strange sounds or structural movement of the property, possibly causing the house to vibrate and move objects. Later researchers, such as Alan Gauld and Tony Cornell, tested Lambert&#x27;s hypothesis by placing specific objects in different rooms and subjecting the house to strong mechanical vibrations. They discovered that although the structure of the building had been damaged, only a few of the objects moved a very short distance. The skeptic Trevor H. Hall criticized the hypothesis claiming if it was true &quot;the building would almost certainly fall into ruins.&quot; According to Richard Wiseman the hypothesis has not held up to scrutiny.

Michael Persinger has theorized that seismic activity could cause poltergeist phenomena. However, Persinger&#x27;s claims regarding the effects of environmental geomagnetic activity on paranormal experiences have not been independently replicated and, like his findings regarding the God helmet, may simply be explained by the suggestibility of participants.

David Turner, a retired physical chemist, suggested that ball lightning might cause the &quot;spooky movement of objects blamed on poltergeists.&quot;

* Sampford Peverell (1810–1811) - poltergeistal noises were determined made by smugglers from behind a false wall 

===Paranormal===
Parapsychologists Nandor Fodor and William G. Roll suggested that poltergeist activity can be explained by psychokinesis.

Historically, actual malicious spirits were blamed for apparent poltergeist-type activity, such as objects moving seemingly of their own accord. According to Allan Kardec, the founder of Spiritism, poltergeists are manifestations of disembodied spirits of low level, belonging to the sixth class of the third order. Under this explanation, they are believed to be closely associated with the elements (fire, air, water, earth). In Finland, somewhat famous are the case of the &quot;Mäkkylä Ghost&quot; in 1946, which received attention in the press at the time, and the &quot;Devils of Martin&quot; in Ylöjärvi in the late 19th century, for which affidavits were obtained in court. Samuli Paulaharju has also recorded a memoir of a typical the case of &quot;Salkko-from the south of Lake Inari in his book &quot;Memoirs of Lapland&quot; (&quot;Lapin muisteluksia&quot;). The story has also been published in the collection of &quot;Mythical Stories&quot; (&quot;Myytillisiä tarinoita&quot;) edited by Lauri Simonsuuri.

<text>A pulley is a wheel on an axle or shaft enabling a taut cable or belt passing over the wheel to move and change direction, or transfer power between itself and a shaft. A sheave or pulley wheel is a pulley using an axle supported by a frame or shell (block) to guide a cable or exert force.

A pulley may have a groove or grooves between flanges around its circumference to locate the cable or belt. The drive element of a pulley system can be a rope, cable, belt, or chain.

The earliest evidence of pulleys dates back to Ancient Egypt in the Twelfth Dynasty (1991–1802 BC) and Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC. In Roman Egypt, Hero of Alexandria (c. 10–70 AD) identified the pulley as one of six simple machines used to lift weights. Pulleys are assembled to form a block and tackle in order to provide mechanical advantage to apply large forces. Pulleys are also assembled as part of belt and chain drives in order to transmit power from one rotating shaft to another. Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; recounts a scene where Archimedes proved the effectiveness of compound pulleys and the block-and-tackle system by using one to pull a fully laden ship towards him as if it was gliding through water.

==Block and tackle==

A block is a set of pulleys (wheels) assembled so that each pulley rotates independently from every other pulley. Two blocks with a rope attached to one of the blocks and threaded through the two sets of pulleys form a block and tackle.
A block and tackle is assembled so one block is attached to the fixed mounting point and the other is attached to the moving load. The ideal mechanical advantage of the block and tackle is equal to the number of sections of the rope that support the moving block.

In the diagram on the right, the ideal mechanical advantage of each of the block and tackle assemblies shown is as follows:
* Gun tackle: 2
* Luff tackle: 3
* Double tackle: 4
* Gyn tackle: 5
* Threefold purchase: 6

==Rope and pulley systems==
A rope and pulley system—that is, a block and tackle—is characterised by the use of a single continuous rope to transmit a tension force around one or more pulleys to lift or move a load—the rope may be a light line or a strong cable. This system is included in the list of simple machines identified by Renaissance scientists.

If the rope and pulley system does not dissipate or store energy, then its mechanical advantage is the number of parts of the rope that act on the load. This can be shown as follows.

Consider the set of pulleys that form the moving block and the parts of the rope that support this block. If there are &quot;p&quot; of these parts of the rope supporting the load &quot;W,&quot; then a force balance on the moving block shows that the tension in each of the parts of the rope must be &quot;W/p.&quot; This means the input force on the rope is &quot;T&quot;=&quot;W/p.&quot; Thus, the block and tackle reduces the input force by the factor &quot;p.&quot;

===Method of operation===
The simplest theory of operation for a pulley system assumes that the pulleys and lines are weightless and that there is no energy loss due to friction. It is also assumed that the lines do not stretch.

In equilibrium, the forces on the moving block must sum to zero. In addition the tension in the rope must be the same for each of its parts. This means that the two parts of the rope supporting the moving block must each support half the load.
These are different types of pulley systems:
* Fixed: A &quot;fixed&quot; pulley has an axle mounted in bearings attached to a supporting structure. A fixed pulley changes the direction of the force on a rope or belt that moves along its circumference. Mechanical advantage is gained by combining a fixed pulley with a movable pulley or another fixed pulley of a different diameter. 
* Movable: A &quot;movable&quot; pulley has an axle in a movable block. A single movable pulley is supported by two parts of the same rope and has a mechanical advantage of two.
* Compound: A combination of fixed and movable pulleys forms a block and tackle. A &quot;block and tackle&quot; can have several pulleys mounted on the fixed and moving axles, further increasing the mechanical advantage.

The mechanical advantage of the gun tackle can be increased by interchanging the fixed and moving blocks so the rope is attached to the moving block and the rope is pulled in the direction of the lifted load. In this case the block and tackle is said to be &quot;rove to advantage.&quot; Diagram 3 shows that now three rope parts support the load &quot;W&quot; which means the tension in the rope is &quot;W/3&quot;. Thus, the mechanical advantage is three.

By adding a pulley to the fixed block of a gun tackle the direction of the pulling force is reversed though the mechanical advantage remains the same, Diagram 3a. This is an example of the Luff tackle.

===Free body diagrams===
The mechanical advantage of a pulley system can be analysed using free body diagrams which balance the tension force in the rope with the force of gravity on the load. In an ideal system, the massless and frictionless pulleys do not dissipate energy and allow for a change of direction of a rope that does not stretch or wear. In this case, a force balance on a free body that includes the load, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; supporting sections of a rope with tension &quot;T&quot;, yields:

:formula_1

The ratio of the load to the input tension force is the mechanical advantage &quot;MA&quot; of the pulley system,

:formula_2

Thus, the mechanical advantage of the system is equal to the number of sections of rope supporting the load.

==Belt and pulley systems==

A belt and pulley system is characterized by two or more pulleys in common to a belt. This allows for mechanical power, torque, and speed to be transmitted across axles. If the pulleys are of differing diameters, a mechanical advantage is realized.

A belt drive is analogous to that of a chain drive; however, a belt sheave may be smooth (devoid of discrete interlocking members as would be found on a chain sprocket, spur gear, or timing belt) so that the mechanical advantage is approximately given by the ratio of the pitch diameter of the sheaves only, not fixed exactly by the ratio of teeth as with gears and sprockets.

In the case of a drum-style pulley, without a groove or flanges, the pulley often is slightly convex to keep the flat belt centered. It is sometimes referred to as a crowned pulley. Though once widely used on factory line shafts, this type of pulley is still found driving the rotating brush in upright vacuum cleaners, in belt sanders and bandsaws. Agricultural tractors built up to the early 1950s generally had a belt pulley for a flat belt (which is what &quot;Belt Pulley&quot; magazine was named after). It has been replaced by other mechanisms with more flexibility in methods of use, such as power take-off and hydraulics.

Just as the diameters of gears (and, correspondingly, their number of teeth) determine a gear ratio and thus the speed increases or reductions and the mechanical advantage that they can deliver, the diameters of pulleys determine those same factors. Cone pulleys and step pulleys (which operate on the same principle, although the names tend to be applied to flat belt versions and V-belt versions, respectively) are a way to provide multiple drive ratios in a belt-and-pulley system that can be shifted as needed, just as a transmission provides this function with a gear train that can be shifted. V-belt step pulleys are the most common way that drill presses deliver a range of spindle speeds.

With belts and pulleys, friction is one of the most important forces. Some uses for belts and pulleys involve peculiar angles (leading to bad belt tracking and possibly slipping the belt off the pulley) or low belt-tension environments, causing unnecessary slippage of the belt and hence extra wear to the belt. To solve this, pulleys are sometimes lagged. Lagging is the term used to describe the application of a coating, cover or wearing surface with various textured patterns which is sometimes applied to pulley shells. Lagging is often applied in order to extend the life of the shell by providing a replaceable wearing surface or to improve the friction between the belt and the pulley. Notably drive pulleys are often rubber lagged (coated with a rubber friction layer) for exactly this reason. Applying powdered rosin to the belt may increase the friction temporarily, but may shorten the life of the belt.

<doc id="23890" wikidata="Q2991463" url="?curid=23890" title="Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty">
<text>The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], also known as the Madrid Protocol, is a complementary legal instrument to the Antarctic Treaty signed in Madrid on 4 October 1991. It entered into force on 14 January 1998.

The Madrid Protocol designates Antarctica as a &quot;natural reserve, devoted to peace and science&quot; (Art. 2). It complements and reinforces the Antarctic Treaty in order to increase the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems.

== Signatories ==
As of 2024, the original 26 nations to sign the Madrid Protocol have been joined by a further 16 nations. Of the 42 total signatories, 29 are Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty, and the other 13 are Non-Consultative Parties (see Appendix 1).

== Main provisions ==
The Protocol consists of a preamble, a main body with 27 articles, an appendix on Arbitration (13 additional articles) and six annexes, the last of which has not yet entered into force.  

The Protocol&#x27;s preamble describes the desire of the Antarctic Treaty Parties to develop a comprehensive regime for the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, in the interest of mankind as a whole.

The main body of the Protocol includes the following key provisions:

* Article 2: &quot;The Parties commit themselves to the comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems and hereby designate Antarctica as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science.&quot;
* Article 3 contains the environmental principles on which the Protocol is based. These principles state the need to protect the natural and scientific values of Antarctica, with particular emphasis on the obligation to carry out careful planning of Antarctic activities, in order to avoid or mitigate the harmful impacts on the environment that they could cause.
* Article 7 prohibits any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research. 
* Article 8 establishes that, before proceeding with an activity in Antarctica, prior assessment of the likely impacts of the proposed activity on the Antarctic environment or on dependent or associated ecosystems must be carried out. 
* Articles 11 and 12 establish the Committee for Environmental Protection and its functions, which comprise providing advice and formulating recommendations to the Parties in connection with the implementation of the Protocol. 
* Article 14 stresses the need to carry out inspections (in accordance with Article VII of the Antarctic Treaty) in order to promote the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, and to ensure compliance with the Protocol.
* Article 15 establishes that each Party agrees to provide for prompt and effective response action in cases of environmental emergencies in the Antarctic Treaty area that might arise in the performance of scientific research programmes, tourism and all other governmental and non-governmental activities.

== Annexes to the Protocol ==
The Protocol has six annexes with practical provisions for the protection of the Antarctic ecosystem. Article 9 of the Protocol allows for the amendment or modification of Annexes and provides for the possibility that new annexes be added to the existing ones, in order to guarantee a permanent updating mechanism.

The annexes are:

# Environmental Impact Assessment
# Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora
# Waste Disposal and Waste Management
# Prevention of Marine Pollution
# Area Protection and Management
# Liability Arising from Environmental Emergencies

The Protocol and its first four annexes entered into force on 14 January 1998, after being adopted by all the Consultative Parties to the Antarctic Treaty. Annex V was drafted after the first four annexes and entered into force on 24 May 2002. The sixth annex was agreed at the XXVIII Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (Stockholm, 2005) and has not yet entered into force as it still awaits adoption by all Consultative Parties. As of 2024, 20 of the 29 Consultative Parties have adopted it. In 2009 an amendment to Annex II was adopted.  

=== Annex I: Environmental Impact Assessment ===
This Annex establishes that all activities carried out in the Antarctic Treaty area must be preceded by an environmental impact assessment (EIA), to foresee the likely impacts that such activities might cause on the Antarctic environment. The EIA is a process that aims to provide information to decision-makers about the environmental consequences of a proposed activity. Such assessment allows the development and implementation of mitigation and restoration measures.

=== Annex II: Conservation of Antarctic flora and fauna ===
In order to protect Antarctic fauna and flora and taking into account that human activity may represent a threat to their survival, Annex II establishes that the taking and harmful interference of Antarctic species, as well as the introduction of non-native species to the continent, are prohibited, except with a permit issued by an Antarctic Treaty Party.

According to Annex II, the taking of Antarctic species means to kill, injure, capture, handle or molest a native mammal or bird, or to remove or damage such quantities of native plants or invertebrates that their local distribution or abundance would be significantly affected. Annex II also establishes that harmful interference to an Antarctic species can occur due to multiple reasons, among which are:

* the flight or landing of helicopters or other aircraft, the use of vehicles or boats (including hovercraft and small boats), or explosives and firearms, that disturb the concentration of native birds or seals; 
* wilful disturbance of breeding or moulting native birds or concentrations of native birds or seals by persons on foot;
* significant damage to concentrations of native terrestrial plants by landing aircraft, driving vehicles, by stepping on such plants, or by any other means; and 
* any activity that results in the significant adverse modification of habitats of any species or population of native mammal, bird, plant or invertebrate.

Annex II also prohibits the introduction onto land or ice shelves, or into water, in the Antarctic Treaty Area of any non-native species of living organisms, except in accordance with a permit. The prohibition of introducing non-native species is related to their potential to negatively affect native species. A non-native species may act as a competitor (for habitat and/or food) with the native species; as a vector of diseases to which native species are not accustomed; as a habitat-modifying agent, or as a predator of the native species. The only types of species allowed to enter Antarctica, after a permit has been issued, are cultivated plants and their reproductive propagules for controlled use and species of living organisms for controlled experimental use.

Finally, Annex II allows for the designation as &quot;Specially Protected Antarctic Species&quot; those species of native mammals, birds, plants and invertebrates, whose survival or stability could be in a particularly compromised situation.  

=== Annex III: Waste Disposal and Treatment ===
Pursuant to this Annex, Antarctic waste management includes the planning, classification, management, storage, transportation and final disposal of all waste generated south of 60°S.  

Annex III prohibits the open burning or disposal of waste onto ice-free areas or into freshwater systems.  

It also establishes that the amount of waste produced or disposed of in the Antarctic Treaty area shall be reduced as far as practicable so as to minimise impact on the Antarctic environment.  

The Protocol contemplates three methods for the final disposal of waste in Antarctica:

* Removal: Annex III establishes that Antarctic wastes be removed from the Antarctic Treaty Area to the maximum extent practicable. Before being removed, all waste shall be stored in such a way as to prevent its dispersal into the environment. 
* Controlled incineration: This option can only be carried out in those facilities which, to the maximum extent practicable, reduce harmful emissions (controlled combustion incinerators). Only biodegradable waste can be incinerated. The solid residue of such incineration shall be removed from the Antarctic Treaty area. 
* Disposal to the sea: Disposal of sewage and domestic liquid waste to the sea is allowed, exclusively in areas where conditions exist for its initial dilution and rapid dispersion (i.e., in currents that go offshore). When the station exceeds 30 people, the Annex requires that such waste be previously treated, at least by maceration.

This Annex also proposes a classification system for waste generated in Antarctica, which serves as a basis for keeping a record of waste and to facilitate studies aimed at evaluating the impacts on the environment of scientific activities and associated logistical support. To this end, this Annex establishes that the waste generated must be classified into five groups:

• Group 1: sewage and domestic liquid waste,

• Group 2: other liquid wastes and chemicals, including fuels and lubricants,

• Group 3: solids to be combusted,

• Group 4: other solid wastes, and

• Group 5: radioactive material.

To further reduce the impact of waste on the Antarctic environment, Annex III to the Protocol establishes that each National Programme* must prepare, review and periodically update waste treatment plans for bases, camps and vessels, specifying programmes for cleaning up existing waste disposal sites and abandoned work sites.  

=== Annex IV: Prevention of Marine Pollution ===
This Annex establishes prohibitions and restrictions on the dumping of waste from ships, while operating in the Antarctic Treaty area. This Annex is part of the provisions of the convention to prevent Marine Pollution from ships, known internationally as MARPOL 73/78 (originally signed in 1973, with amendments in 1978), within the framework of which, in 1990, it was agreed to grant Antarctic waters the status of &quot;Special Zone&quot;, where greater restrictions must be observed than in other international waters.

Thus, any discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixture, any noxious liquid substance, and any other chemical or other substances (in quantities or concentrations that are harmful to the marine environment), and all plastics (including but not limited to synthetic ropes, synthetic fishing nets, and plastic garbage bags) shall be prohibited.  

The Annex also regulates discharges into the sea of untreated sewage, as defined in Annex IV of MARPOL 73/78, and establishes that all ships, before entering the Antarctic Treaty area, are fitted with a tank or tanks of sufficient capacity on board for the retention of all sludge, dirty ballast, tank washing water and other oily residues and mixtures.

Finally, Annex IV states that, to respond more effectively to marine pollution emergencies, the Parties shall develop contingency plans for marine pollution response in the Antarctic Treaty area.  

=== Annex V: Area Protection and Management ===
Annex V to the Protocol establishes a new scheme of protected areas in Antarctica, made up of three categories: Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs), Antarctic Specially Managed Areas (ASMAs), and Historic Sites and Monuments (HSMs).

An &quot;Antarctic Specially Protected Area&quot; (ASPA) is a terrestrial or marine area that has outstanding environmental, scientific, aesthetic, historic or wilderness values, or ongoing or planned scientific research, that the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM), after any Party&#x27;s proposal, designates as such to protect those values. Former &quot;Sites of Special Scientific Interest&quot; and former &quot;Specially Protected Areas&quot;, designated as such by previous Consultative Meetings, were then reclassified as ASPAs.

Annex V prohibits entering an ASPA, except in accordance with a permit issued by any Party to the Antarctic Treaty. It also establishes that each ASPA shall have a Management Plan, a document that identifies the values to be protected and the measures to be taken to guarantee their proper management.

An &quot;Antarctic Specially Managed Area&quot; (ASMA) is an area where different types of human activities (logistics, scientific, conservation, tourism) concur and might pose risks of mutual interference or cumulative environmental impacts. They are designated as ASMAs to help plan and coordinate activities, avoid potential conflicts of interest, improve cooperation between Parties or minimise adverse environmental impacts. ASMAs can comprise marine or terrestrial sectors, and may contain ASPAs. Entry to ASMAs does not require a permit, but, if there is an ASPA within, entry to this does require it.

Finally, certain sites, graves, objects, constructions or artifacts located on the Antarctic continent have a historical value that the Antarctic Treaty System recognises through their designation as &quot;Antarctic Historic Sites and Monuments&quot; (HSMs). HSMs can be part of ASPAs, ASMAs, or simply be listed as such. The elements that are part of a Historic Site and Monument must not be damaged, removed or destroyed.

As of 2024, there are 76 ASPAs, 6 ASMAs and 91 HSMs, although these numbers tend to increase gradually with advances in knowledge of the continent. The Antarctic Treaty Secretariat maintains a database and maps of all protected areas in Antarctica.

=== Annex VI: Responsibility arising from Environmental Emergencies ===
This Annex outlines arrangements to prevent and respond to environmental emergencies in the Antarctic Treaty area arising from scientific research programmes, tourism and other governmental and non-governmental activities. It establishes the rules governing liability for environmental emergencies, and provides that compensation may be claimed from the polluter if that party has not taken prompt and effective response action.

== Background of the Protocol ==
The protection of the Antarctic environment was not one of the main original objectives of the Antarctic Treaty. The main engines of this agreement were the safeguarding of peace and freedom for the development of scientific research. However, some prohibitions and restrictions contained in the Treaty, especially those referring to nuclear activity, can be considered important from the environmental point of view. Once the Antarctic Treaty entered into force in 1961, a series of measures were agreed under the provisions of its article IX (which provides for the creation of measures aimed at &quot;the preservation and conservation of living resources in Antarctica&quot;), or in separate conventions, which focused on issues such as the protection of flora and fauna, the designation of protected areas, and waste and fuel management, among others.

The Madrid Protocol was negotiated by the Parties to the Antarctic Treaty between 1989 and 1991, following the failure to agree on an international regulatory instrument governing mining in Antarctica (the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, or CRAMRA).

The Protocol built on a range of environmental provisions agreed at several ATCMs since the signing of the Treaty including the 1964 Agreed Measures on the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora.  It also picked up environmental management elements that had been developed during the CRAMRA negotiations (such as emergency response provisions), as well as previous work of the Scientific Committee of Antarctic Research (SCAR) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO), on waste management and marine pollution, respectively.

The agreement on the Madrid Protocol constituted the culmination of years of development of environmental standards and practices, which were synthesised and articulated into a single comprehensive agreement. The Protocol set out new rules on environmental protection, including new restrictions to human activity in Antarctica and a framework to incorporate new issues through the elaboration of additional annexes.  Through the Protocol, the protection of the Antarctic environment was established as the third pillar of the Antarctic Treaty, together with peaceful use and international scientific cooperation.  

== The issue of minerals in the Protocol ==
Article 7 of the Madrid Protocol expressly prohibits any activity related to the exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources, except for scientific research. In principle, this prohibition of exploration and exploitation of mineral resources is valid indefinitely, although Article 25 of the Protocol establishes the possibility that any Consultative Party may request a review of the application of its content, once 50 years have elapsed since the entry into force of the Protocol (in the year 2048). This provision applies by extension to Article 7. With particular reference to mineral resources, Article 25, in its first paragraph, establishes that, before proceeding with an amendment to Article 7, a series of circumstances and preconditions must be met. It is for this reason that some authors maintain that the Protocol establishes a 50-year moratorium on the exploration and exploitation of Antarctic minerals, although, in fact, a moratorium would imply the automatic fall of the provisions of Article 7, and this is not exactly the case raised by Article 25.

== Appendix 1: Countries that have signed the Madrid Protocol ==
&quot;*The Protocol entered into force on 14 January 1998.&quot;

==Campaign==
The treaty followed a lengthy campaign by Greenpeace, including the construction of an Antarctic base from 1987 to 1991. Greenpeace claims the protocol as a victory.

==Honours==
Madrid Dome in Aristotle Mountains, Antarctica is named in connection with the Protocol.

<doc id="23891" wikidata="Q945733" url="?curid=23891" title="Particle radiation">
<text>Particle radiation is the radiation of energy by means of fast-moving subatomic particles. Particle radiation is referred to as a particle beam if the particles are all moving in the same direction, similar to a light beam.

Due to the wave–particle duality, all moving particles also have wave character. Higher energy particles more easily exhibit particle characteristics, while lower energy particles more easily exhibit wave characteristics.

==Types and production==
Particles can be electrically charged or uncharged:

Particle radiation can be emitted by an unstable atomic nucleus (via radioactive decay), or it can be produced from some other kind of nuclear reaction. Many types of particles may be emitted:

*protons and other hydrogen nuclei stripped of their electrons
*positively charged alpha particles (α), equivalent to a helium-4 nucleus
*helium ions at high energy levels
*HZE ions, which are nuclei heavier than helium
*positively or negatively charged beta particles (high-energy positrons β+ or electrons β−; the latter being more common)
*high-speed electrons that are not from the beta decay process, but others such as internal conversion and Auger effect
*neutrons, subatomic particles which have no charge; neutron radiation
*neutrinos
*mesons
*muons

Mechanisms that produce particle radiation include:
*alpha decay
*Auger effect
*beta decay
*cluster decay
*internal conversion
*neutron emission
*nuclear fission and spontaneous fission
*nuclear fusion
*particle colliders in which streams of high energy particles are smashed
*proton emission
*solar flares
*solar particle events
*supernova explosions
*Additionally, galactic cosmic rays include these particles, but many are from unknown mechanisms

Charged particles (electrons, mesons, protons, alpha particles, heavier HZE ions, etc.) can be produced by particle accelerators. Ion irradiation is widely used in the semiconductor industry to introduce dopants into
materials, a method known as ion implantation.

Particle accelerators can also produce neutrino beams. Neutron beams are mostly produced by nuclear reactors.

==Passage through matter==

In radiation protection, radiation is often separated into two categories, &quot;ionizing&quot; and &quot;non-ionizing&quot;, to denote the level of danger posed to humans. Ionization is the process of removing electrons from atoms, leaving two electrically charged particles (an electron and a positively charged ion) behind. The negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions created by ionizing radiation may cause damage in living tissue. Basically, a particle is ionizing if its energy is higher than the ionization energy of a typical substance, i.e., a few eV, and interacts with electrons significantly.

According to the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, electromagnetic radiations from ultraviolet to infrared, to radiofrequency (including microwave) radiation, static and time-varying electric and magnetic fields, and ultrasound belong to the non-ionizing radiations.
The charged particles mentioned above all belong to the ionizing radiations. When passing through matter, they ionize and thus lose energy in many small steps. The distance to the point where the charged particle has lost all its energy is called the range of the particle. The range depends upon the type of particle, its initial energy, and the material it traverses. Similarly, the energy loss per unit path length, the &#x27;stopping power&#x27;, depends on the type and energy of the charged particle and upon the material. The stopping power and hence, the density of ionization, usually increases toward the end of range and reaches a maximum, the Bragg Peak, shortly before the energy drops to zero.

<text>Per capita income (PCI) or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc.) in a specified year. 

In many countries, per capita income is determined using regular population surveys, such as the American Community Survey. This allows the calculation of per capita income for both the country as a whole and specific regions or demographic groups. However, comparing per capita income across different countries is often difficult, since methodologies, definitions and data quality can vary greatly. Since the 1990s, the OECD has conducted regular surveys among its 38 member countries using a standardized methodology and set of questions.

Per capita income is often used to measure a sector&#x27;s average income and compare the wealth of different populations. Per capita income is also often used to measure a country&#x27;s standard of living. When used to compare income levels of different countries, it is usually expressed using a commonly used international currency, such as the euro or United States dollar. It is one of the three components of the Human Development Index of a country.

==Limitations==
While per capita income can be useful for many economic studies, it is important to keep in mind its limitations.
* Comparisons of per capita income over time need to consider inflation. Without adjusting for inflation, figures tend to overstate the effects of economic growth.
* International comparisons can be distorted by cost of living differences not reflected in exchange rates. Where the objective is to compare living standards between countries, adjusting for differences in purchasing power parity will more accurately reflect what people are actually able to buy with their money.
* It is a mean value and does not reflect income distribution. If a country&#x27;s income distribution is skewed, a small wealthy class can increase per capita income substantially while the majority of the population has no change in income. In this respect, median income is more useful when measuring of prosperity than per capita income, as it is less influenced by outliers.
* Non-monetary activity, such as barter or services provided within the family, is usually not counted. The importance of these services varies widely among economies.
* Per capita income does not consider whether income is invested in factors likely to improve the area&#x27;s development, such as health, education, or infrastructure.

<text>The Purus River (Portuguese: &quot;Rio Purus&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Río Purús&quot;) is a tributary of the Amazon River in South America. Its drainage basin is , and the mean annual discharge is . The river shares its name with the Alto Purús National Park and the Purús Province (and its conformed Purús District), one of the four provinces of Peru in the Ucayali Region.

== Geography ==

The Purus River rises in Peru.
It defines the boundary between Peru and Brazil in the centre of the state of Acre, then runs for a short distance along the boundary of the Santa Rosa do Purus National Forest, a sustainable use conservation unit created in 2001 after it is joined by the Santa Rosa River.
The Purus then flows north east through Manoel Urbano
It runs through a continuous forest at the bottom of the great depression, lying between the Madeira River, which skirts the edge of the Brazilian sandstone plateau, and the Ucayali River, which hugs the base of the Andes.

In the state of Amazonas the river runs through the Arapixi Extractive Reserve, created in 2006 and past the town of Boca do Acre at the end of the BR-317 highway.
Further down, it forms the west boundary of the Purus National Forest, created in 1988.
From the town of Pauini down to the town of Lábrea the river is bordered by the Médio Purus Extractive Reserve, created in 2008.
Below this it runs through the Canutama Extractive Reserve along the stretch between the towns of Lábrea and Canutama.
In the lowest reaches the river flows through the Piagaçu-Purus Sustainable Development Reserve, established in 2003, which holds a large part of its floodplain.
It enters the Amazon River west of the Madeira River, which it parallels as far south as the falls of the latter stream.

William Chandless found its elevation above sea level to be only from its mouth. It is one of the most crooked streams in the world, and its length in a straight line is less than half of its length following its curves. It is practically only a drainage ditch for the half-submerged, lake-flooded district it crosses.
Its width is very uniform for up, and for its depth is never less than .

== Biodiversity ==
The Purús red howler (&quot;Alouatta puruensis&quot;) is a species of howler monkey native to Brazil, Peru and north of Bolivia.
&quot;Peckoltia brevis&quot;, a kind of catfish, is found in the middle and upper Amazon within the Purus river basin.

Most of the central and lower sections of the river flow through the Purus várzea ecoregion.
In the municipality of Tapauá, Amazonas, the river flows through the Abufari Biological Reserve, a strictly protected area.

== Earthworks discovery ==

In 2008, a previously unknown pre-Columbian civilization was discovered in the upper region of the river close to the Bolivian border. After much of the forest in the region was cleared for agricultural use, satellite pictures revealed the remains of large geometric earthworks.

<doc id="23899" wikidata="Q685475" url="?curid=23899" title="Pastaza River">
<text>The Pastaza River (, formerly known as the Sumatara) also known as the Patate, flowing in Ecuador and Peru is a large tributary to the Marañón River in the northwestern Amazon Basin of South America.

It has its headwaters in the Ecuadorian province of Cotopaxi, flowing off the northwestern slopes of the volcano Cotopaxi and known as the Patate River. The Patate flows south and in Tungurahua Province it is joined by the Chambo River just upstream from the town of Baños de Agua Santa just north of the volcano Mount Tungurahua and becomes the Pastaza. Seven kilometers east of Baños, it is dammed for the Agoyán hydroelectric project, which has created a silty lagoon by the village of La Cieniga. The Agoyán dam was placed in that location specifically to leave the famous Falls of Agoyán, about 5 km further downstream, intact. After the waterfall the river enters a gorge where there is very fast whitewater with class-4 rapids; it is often used for whitewater rafting although it is not considered to be of the same quality as the Tena River and is therefore less popular for the sport.

From the junction with the Chambo, the Pastaza flows almost due east for about where it then turns south-east, as it is joined by the Topo River. The Troncal Amazonas highway parallels the river from Baños to Puyo, passing through seven tunnels, and four major waterfalls that are touristic destinations for many Ecuadorians (Agoyán and Pailón del Diablo being the most popular.) Just past the town of Santa Inez, the Pastaza River crosses into the province of Pastaza, where it forms the boundary between that province and Morona-Santiago. At the town of Mera, shortly before reaching Puyo, the river exits the mountains and flows into a wide valley, becoming wider and shallower. After Shell the river becomes braided and meanders, leaving oxbows and sloughs along its route across the Amazonian floodplain.

After cutting through Ecuador, the Pastaza passes into Peru at the village of Hito Zoilaluz on Isla Zoilaluz and flows south into the Marañón River near Puerto Industrial.

==Tributaries==
The Pastaza has numerous tributaries, both above and below the hydroelectric dam. These contribute to its rapid flow and to its tendency to flood. On the highway side of the Pastaza, a tributary river occurs about every 3–4 km for a stretch of about 50 km; on the opposite bank, the number of tributaries is slightly lower. The major tributaries are the Chambo, Bobonaza, and Huasaga, also important are the Ambato, the Pindo, and the Puyo.

==Economy==

There are no major fisheries on the Pastaza River - it is primarily used as a means of transport by canoe. Its rise and fall are rapid and uncertain, and it is shallow and full of sandbanks and snags. Flooding occurs seasonally.

==Bridges==
In Ecuador, there are very few bridges across the Pastaza. The most significant ones are in Tungurahua province - namely a large span over the exact point of headwaters, just north of Baños, and the secondary span created by the Agoyán dam. After this, bridges tend to be of the suspension type, suitable for foot or small vehicle passage only. However, it is notable that the Pastaza can be forded during the dry season in a 4x4 truck, going across the floodplains below the town of Mera.

<text>In geometry, a polyhedral compound is a figure that is composed of several polyhedra sharing a common centre. They are the three-dimensional analogs of polygonal compounds such as the hexagram.

The outer vertices of a compound can be connected to form a convex polyhedron called its convex hull. A compound is a faceting of its convex hull.

Another convex polyhedron is formed by the small central space common to all members of the compound. This polyhedron can be used as the core for a set of stellations.

== Regular compounds ==

A regular polyhedral compound can be defined as a compound which, like a regular polyhedron, is vertex-transitive, edge-transitive, and face-transitive. Unlike the case of polyhedra, this is not equivalent to the symmetry group acting transitively on its flags; the compound of two tetrahedra is the only regular compound with that property. There are five regular compounds of polyhedra:

Best known is the regular compound of two tetrahedra, often called the stella octangula, a name given to it by Kepler. The vertices of the two tetrahedra define a cube, and the intersection of the two define a regular octahedron, which shares the same face-planes as the compound. Thus the compound of two tetrahedra is a stellation of the octahedron, and in fact, the only finite stellation thereof.

The regular compound of five tetrahedra comes in two enantiomorphic versions, which together make up the regular compound of ten tetrahedra. The regular compound of ten tetrahedra can also be seen as a compound of five stellae octangulae.

Each of the regular tetrahedral compounds is self-dual or dual to its chiral twin; the regular compound of five cubes and the regular compound of five octahedra are dual to each other.

Hence, regular polyhedral compounds can also be regarded as dual-regular compounds.

Coxeter&#x27;s notation for regular compounds is given in the table above, incorporating Schläfli symbols. The material inside the square brackets, [&quot;d&quot;{&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}], denotes the components of the compound: &quot;d&quot; separate {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}&#x27;s. The material &quot;before&quot; the square brackets denotes the vertex arrangement of the compound: &quot;c&quot;{&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;}[&quot;d&quot;{&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}] is a compound of &quot;d&quot; {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}&#x27;s sharing the vertices of {&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;} counted &quot;c&quot; times. The material &quot;after&quot; the square brackets denotes the facet arrangement of the compound: [&quot;d&quot;{&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}]&quot;e&quot;{&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;} is a compound of &quot;d&quot; {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}&#x27;s sharing the faces of {&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;} counted &quot;e&quot; times. These may be combined: thus &quot;c&quot;{&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;}[&quot;d&quot;{&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}]&quot;e&quot;{&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;} is a compound of &quot;d&quot; {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;}&#x27;s sharing the vertices of {&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;} counted &quot;c&quot; times &quot;and&quot; the faces of {&quot;s&quot;,&quot;t&quot;} counted &quot;e&quot; times. This notation can be generalised to compounds in any number of dimensions.

== Dual compounds ==

A dual compound is composed of a polyhedron and its dual, arranged reciprocally about a common midsphere, such that the edge of one polyhedron intersects the dual edge of the dual polyhedron. There are five dual compounds of the regular polyhedra.

The core is the rectification of both solids. The hull is the dual of this rectification, and its rhombic faces have the intersecting edges of the two solids as diagonals (and have their four alternate vertices). For the convex solids, this is the convex hull.

The tetrahedron is self-dual, so the dual compound of a tetrahedron with its dual is the regular stellated octahedron.

The octahedral and icosahedral dual compounds are the first stellations of the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron, respectively.

The small stellated dodecahedral (or great dodecahedral) dual compound has the great dodecahedron completely interior to the small stellated dodecahedron.

== Uniform compounds ==
In 1976 John Skilling published &quot;Uniform Compounds of Uniform Polyhedra&quot; which enumerated 75 compounds (including 6 as infinite prismatic sets of compounds, #20-#25) made from uniform polyhedra with rotational symmetry. (Every vertex is vertex-transitive and every vertex is transitive with every other vertex.) This list includes the five regular compounds above. 

The 75 uniform compounds are listed in the Table below. Most are shown singularly colored by each polyhedron element. Some chiral pairs of face groups are colored by symmetry of the faces within each polyhedron.

* 1-19: Miscellaneous (4,5,6,9,17 are the 5 &quot;regular compounds&quot;)

* 20-25: Prism symmetry embedded in prism symmetry,

* 26-45: Prism symmetry embedded in octahedral or icosahedral symmetry,

* 46-67: Tetrahedral symmetry embedded in octahedral or icosahedral symmetry,

* 68-75: enantiomorph pairs
== Other compounds ==

* Compound of three octahedra
* Compound of four cubes

Two polyhedra that are compounds but have their elements rigidly locked into place are the small complex icosidodecahedron (compound of icosahedron and great dodecahedron) and the great complex icosidodecahedron (compound of small stellated dodecahedron and great icosahedron). If the definition of a uniform polyhedron is generalised, they are uniform.

The section for enantiomorph pairs in Skilling&#x27;s list does not contain the compound of two great snub dodecicosidodecahedra, as the pentagram faces would coincide. Removing the coincident faces results in the compound of twenty octahedra.

== 4-polytope compounds ==
In 4-dimensions, there are a large number of regular compounds of regular polytopes. Coxeter lists a few of these in his book Regular Polytopes. McMullen added six in his paper &quot;New Regular Compounds of 4-Polytopes&quot;.

==Group theory==
In terms of group theory, if &quot;G&quot; is the symmetry group of a polyhedral compound, and the group acts transitively on the polyhedra (so that each polyhedron can be sent to any of the others, as in uniform compounds), then if &quot;H&quot; is the stabilizer of a single chosen polyhedron, the polyhedra can be identified with the orbit space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; – the coset &quot;gH&quot; corresponds to which polyhedron &quot;g&quot; sends the chosen polyhedron to.

==Compounds of tilings==
There are eighteen two-parameter families of regular compound tessellations of the Euclidean plane. In the hyperbolic plane, five one-parameter families and seventeen isolated cases are known, but the completeness of this listing has not been enumerated.

The Euclidean and hyperbolic compound families 2 {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;p&quot;} (4 ≤ &quot;p&quot; ≤ ∞, &quot;p&quot; an integer) are analogous to the spherical stella octangula, 2 {3,3}.
A known family of regular Euclidean compound honeycombs in any number of dimensions is an infinite family of compounds of hypercubic honeycombs, all sharing vertices and faces with another hypercubic honeycomb. This compound can have any number of hypercubic honeycombs.

There are also &quot;dual-regular&quot; tiling compounds. A simple example is the E2 compound of a hexagonal tiling and its dual triangular tiling, which shares its edges with the deltoidal trihexagonal tiling. The Euclidean compounds of two hypercubic honeycombs are both regular and dual-regular.

<doc id="23905" wikidata="Q188745" url="?curid=23905" title="Platonic solid">
<text>In geometry, a Platonic solid is a convex, regular polyhedron in three-dimensional Euclidean space. Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five such polyhedra:

Geometers have studied the Platonic solids for thousands of years. They are named for the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, who hypothesized in one of his dialogues, the &quot;Timaeus&quot;, that the classical elements were made of these regular solids.

== History ==
The Platonic solids have been known since antiquity. It has been suggested that certain carved stone balls created by the late Neolithic people of Scotland represent these shapes; however, these balls have rounded knobs rather than being polyhedral, the numbers of knobs frequently differed from the numbers of vertices of the Platonic solids, there is no ball whose knobs match the 20 vertices of the dodecahedron, and the arrangement of the knobs was not always symmetrical.

The ancient Greeks studied the Platonic solids extensively. Some sources (such as Proclus) credit Pythagoras with their discovery. Other evidence suggests that he may have only been familiar with the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron and that the discovery of the octahedron and icosahedron belong to Theaetetus, a contemporary of Plato. In any case, Theaetetus gave a mathematical description of all five and may have been responsible for the first known proof that no other convex regular polyhedra exist.
The Platonic solids are prominent in the philosophy of Plato, their namesake. Plato wrote about them in the dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot; 360 B.C. in which he associated each of the four classical elements (earth, air, water, and fire) with a regular solid. Earth was associated with the cube, air with the octahedron, water with the icosahedron, and fire with the tetrahedron. Of the fifth Platonic solid, the dodecahedron, Plato obscurely remarked, &quot;...the god used [it] for arranging the constellations on the whole heaven&quot;. Aristotle added a fifth element, aither (aether in Latin, &quot;ether&quot; in English) and postulated that the heavens were made of this element, but he had no interest in matching it with Plato&#x27;s fifth solid.

Euclid completely mathematically described the Platonic solids in the &quot;Elements&quot;, the last book (Book XIII) of which is devoted to their properties. Propositions 13–17 in Book XIII describe the construction of the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron in that order. For each solid Euclid finds the ratio of the diameter of the circumscribed sphere to the edge length. In Proposition 18 he argues that there are no further convex regular polyhedra. Andreas Speiser has advocated the view that the construction of the five regular solids is the chief goal of the deductive system canonized in the &quot;Elements&quot;. Much of the information in Book XIII is probably derived from the work of Theaetetus.
In the 16th century, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler attempted to relate the five extraterrestrial planets known at that time to the five Platonic solids. In &quot;Mysterium Cosmographicum&quot;, published in 1596, Kepler proposed a model of the Solar System in which the five solids were set inside one another and separated by a series of inscribed and circumscribed spheres. Kepler proposed that the distance relationships between the six planets known at that time could be understood in terms of the five Platonic solids enclosed within a sphere that represented the orbit of Saturn. The six spheres each corresponded to one of the planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn). The solids were ordered with the innermost being the octahedron, followed by the icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and finally the cube, thereby dictating the structure of the solar system and the distance relationships between the planets by the Platonic solids. In the end, Kepler&#x27;s original idea had to be abandoned, but out of his research came his three laws of orbital dynamics, the first of which was that the orbits of planets are ellipses rather than circles, changing the course of physics and astronomy. He also discovered the Kepler solids, which are two &quot;nonconvex&quot; regular polyhedra.

==Cartesian coordinates==
For Platonic solids centered at the origin, simple Cartesian coordinates of the vertices are given below. The Greek letter formula_1 is used to represent the golden ratio formula_2.

The coordinates for the tetrahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron are given in two positions such that each can be deduced from the other: in the case of the tetrahedron, by changing all coordinates of sign (central symmetry), or, in the other cases, by exchanging two coordinates (reflection with respect to any of the three diagonal planes).

These coordinates reveal certain relationships between the Platonic solids: the vertices of the tetrahedron represent half of those of the cube, as {4,3} or , one of two sets of 4 vertices in dual positions, as h{4,3} or . Both tetrahedral positions make the compound stellated octahedron.

The coordinates of the icosahedron are related to two alternated sets of coordinates of a nonuniform truncated octahedron, t{3,4} or , also called a &quot;snub octahedron&quot;, as s{3,4} or , and seen in the compound of two icosahedra.

Eight of the vertices of the dodecahedron are shared with the cube. Completing all orientations leads to the compound of five cubes.

== Combinatorial properties ==
A convex polyhedron is a Platonic solid if and only if all three of the following requirements are met.
* All of its faces are congruent convex regular polygons.
* None of its faces intersect except at their edges.
* The same number of faces meet at each of its vertices.

Each Platonic solid can therefore be assigned a pair {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;} of integers, where &quot;p&quot; is the number of edges (or, equivalently, vertices) of each face, and &quot;q&quot; is the number of faces (or, equivalently, edges) that meet at each vertex. This pair {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;}, called the Schläfli symbol, gives a combinatorial description of the polyhedron. The Schläfli symbols of the five Platonic solids are given in the table below.

All other combinatorial information about these solids, such as total number of vertices (&quot;V&quot;), edges (&quot;E&quot;), and faces (&quot;F&quot;), can be determined from &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;. Since any edge joins two vertices and has two adjacent faces we must have:

formula_3

The other relationship between these values is given by Euler&#x27;s formula:

formula_4

This can be proved in many ways. Together these three relationships completely determine &quot;V&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, and &quot;F&quot;:

formula_5

Swapping &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; interchanges &quot;F&quot; and &quot;V&quot; while leaving &quot;E&quot; unchanged. For a geometric interpretation of this property, see .

=== As a configuration===
The elements of a polyhedron can be expressed in a configuration matrix. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, and faces. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole polyhedron. The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column&#x27;s element occur in or at the row&#x27;s element. Dual pairs of polyhedra have their configuration matrices rotated 180 degrees from each other.

== Classification ==
The classical result is that only five convex regular polyhedra exist. Two common arguments below demonstrate no more than five Platonic solids can exist, but positively demonstrating the existence of any given solid is a separate question—one that requires an explicit construction.

=== Geometric proof ===
The following geometric argument is very similar to the one given by Euclid in the &quot;Elements&quot;:

=== Topological proof ===
A purely topological proof can be made using only combinatorial information about the solids. The key is Euler&#x27;s observation that &quot;V&quot; − &quot;E&quot; + &quot;F&quot; = 2, and the fact that &quot;pF&quot; = 2&quot;E&quot; = &quot;qV&quot;, where &quot;p&quot; stands for the number of edges of each face and &quot;q&quot; for the number of edges meeting at each vertex. Combining these equations one obtains the equation

formula_6

Simple algebraic manipulation then gives

formula_7

Since &quot;E&quot; is strictly positive we must have

formula_8

Using the fact that &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; must both be at least 3, one can easily see that there are only five possibilities for {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;}:
== Geometric properties ==
=== Angles ===
There are a number of angles associated with each Platonic solid. The dihedral angle is the interior angle between any two face planes. The dihedral angle, &quot;θ&quot;, of the solid {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;} is given by the formula

formula_9

This is sometimes more conveniently expressed in terms of the tangent by

formula_10

The quantity &quot;h&quot; (called the Coxeter number) is 4, 6, 6, 10, and 10 for the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron respectively.

The angular deficiency at the vertex of a polyhedron is the difference between the sum of the face-angles at that vertex and 2. The defect, &quot;δ&quot;, at any vertex of the Platonic solids {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;} is

formula_11

By a theorem of Descartes, this is equal to 4 divided by the number of vertices (i.e. the total defect at all vertices is 4).

The three-dimensional analog of a plane angle is a solid angle. The solid angle, &quot;Ω&quot;, at the vertex of a Platonic solid is given in terms of the dihedral angle by

formula_12

This follows from the spherical excess formula for a spherical polygon and the fact that the vertex figure of the polyhedron {&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;} is a regular &quot;q&quot;-gon.

The solid angle of a face subtended from the center of a platonic solid is equal to the solid angle of a full sphere (4 steradians) divided by the number of faces. This is equal to the angular deficiency of its dual.

The various angles associated with the Platonic solids are tabulated below. The numerical values of the solid angles are given in steradians. The constant &quot;φ&quot; = is the golden ratio.

=== Radii, area, and volume ===
Another virtue of regularity is that the Platonic solids all possess three concentric spheres:

* the circumscribed sphere that passes through all the vertices,
* the midsphere that is tangent to each edge at the midpoint of the edge, and
* the inscribed sphere that is tangent to each face at the center of the face.

The radii of these spheres are called the &quot;circumradius&quot;, the &quot;midradius&quot;, and the &quot;inradius&quot;. These are the distances from the center of the polyhedron to the vertices, edge midpoints, and face centers respectively. The circumradius &quot;R&quot; and the inradius &quot;r&quot; of the solid {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;} with edge length &quot;a&quot; are given by

formula_13

where &quot;θ&quot; is the dihedral angle. The midradius &quot;ρ&quot; is given by

formula_14

where &quot;h&quot; is the quantity used above in the definition of the dihedral angle (&quot;h&quot; = 4, 6, 6, 10, or 10). The ratio of the circumradius to the inradius is symmetric in &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;:

formula_15

The surface area, &quot;A&quot;, of a Platonic solid {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;} is easily computed as area of a regular &quot;p&quot;-gon times the number of faces &quot;F&quot;. This is:

formula_16

The volume is computed as &quot;F&quot; times the volume of the pyramid whose base is a regular &quot;p&quot;-gon and whose height is the inradius &quot;r&quot;. That is,

formula_17

The following table lists the various radii of the Platonic solids together with their surface area and volume. The overall size is fixed by taking the edge length, &quot;a&quot;, to be equal to 2.

The constants &quot;φ&quot; and &quot;ξ&quot; in the above are given by

formula_18

Among the Platonic solids, either the dodecahedron or the icosahedron may be seen as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface area to volume ratio is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume). The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.

===Point in space===
For an arbitrary point in the space of a Platonic solid with circumradius &quot;R&quot;, whose distances to the centroid of the Platonic solid and its &quot;n&quot; vertices are &quot;L&quot; and &quot;di&quot; respectively, and

formula_19,

we have

formula_20
For all five Platonic solids, we have

formula_21

If &quot;di&quot; are the distances from the &quot;n&quot; vertices of the Platonic solid to any point on its circumscribed sphere, then

formula_22

===Rupert property===
A polyhedron &quot;P&quot; is said to have the Rupert property if a polyhedron of the same or larger size and the same shape as &quot;P&quot; can pass through a hole in &quot;P&quot;.
All five Platonic solids have this property.

== Symmetry ==
=== Dual polyhedra ===
Every polyhedron has a dual (or &quot;polar&quot;) polyhedron with faces and vertices interchanged. The dual of every Platonic solid is another Platonic solid, so that we can arrange the five solids into dual pairs.

* The tetrahedron is self-dual (i.e. its dual is another tetrahedron).
* The cube and the octahedron form a dual pair.
* The dodecahedron and the icosahedron form a dual pair.

If a polyhedron has Schläfli symbol {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;}, then its dual has the symbol {&quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;}. Indeed, every combinatorial property of one Platonic solid can be interpreted as another combinatorial property of the dual.

One can construct the dual polyhedron by taking the vertices of the dual to be the centers of the faces of the original figure. Connecting the centers of adjacent faces in the original forms the edges of the dual and thereby interchanges the number of faces and vertices while maintaining the number of edges.

More generally, one can dualize a Platonic solid with respect to a sphere of radius &quot;d&quot; concentric with the solid. The radii (&quot;R&quot;, &quot;ρ&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) of a solid and those of its dual (&quot;R&quot;*, &quot;ρ&quot;*, &quot;r&quot;*) are related by

formula_23

Dualizing with respect to the midsphere (&quot;d&quot; = &quot;ρ&quot;) is often convenient because the midsphere has the same relationship to both polyhedra. Taking &quot;d&quot;2 = &quot;Rr&quot; yields a dual solid with the same circumradius and inradius (i.e. &quot;R&quot;* = &quot;R&quot; and &quot;r&quot;* = &quot;r&quot;).

=== Symmetry groups ===
In mathematics, the concept of symmetry is studied with the notion of a mathematical group. Every polyhedron has an associated symmetry group, which is the set of all transformations (Euclidean isometries) which leave the polyhedron invariant. The order of the symmetry group is the number of symmetries of the polyhedron. One often distinguishes between the &quot;full symmetry group&quot;, which includes reflections, and the &quot;proper symmetry group&quot;, which includes only rotations.

The symmetry groups of the Platonic solids are a special class of three-dimensional point groups known as polyhedral groups. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the action of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is transitive on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is &quot;regular&quot; if and only if it is vertex-uniform, edge-uniform, and face-uniform.

There are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:

* the tetrahedral group &quot;T&quot;,
* the octahedral group &quot;O&quot; (which is also the symmetry group of the cube), and
* the icosahedral group &quot;I&quot; (which is also the symmetry group of the dodecahedron).

The orders of the proper (rotation) groups are 12, 24, and 60 respectively – precisely twice the number of edges in the respective polyhedra. The orders of the full symmetry groups are twice as much again (24, 48, and 120). See (Coxeter 1973) for a derivation of these facts. All Platonic solids except the tetrahedron are &quot;centrally symmetric,&quot; meaning they are preserved under reflection through the origin.

The following table lists the various symmetry properties of the Platonic solids. The symmetry groups listed are the full groups with the rotation subgroups given in parentheses (likewise for the number of symmetries). Wythoff&#x27;s kaleidoscope construction is a method for constructing polyhedra directly from their symmetry groups. They are listed for reference Wythoff&#x27;s symbol for each of the Platonic solids.

== In nature and technology ==
The tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron all occur naturally in crystal structures. These by no means exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals. However, neither the regular icosahedron nor the regular dodecahedron are amongst them. One of the forms, called the pyritohedron (named for the group of minerals of which it is typical) has twelve pentagonal faces, arranged in the same pattern as the faces of the regular dodecahedron. The faces of the pyritohedron are, however, not regular, so the pyritohedron is also not regular. Allotropes of boron and many boron compounds, such as boron carbide, include discrete B12 icosahedra within their crystal structures. Carborane acids also have molecular structures approximating regular icosahedra.

In the early 20th century, Ernst Haeckel described (Haeckel, 1904) a number of species of Radiolaria, some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include &quot;Circoporus octahedrus&quot;, &quot;Circogonia icosahedra&quot;, &quot;Lithocubus geometricus&quot; and &quot;Circorrhegma dodecahedra&quot;. The shapes of these creatures should be obvious from their names.

Many viruses, such as the herpes virus, have the shape of a regular icosahedron. Viral structures are built of repeated identical protein subunits and the icosahedron is the easiest shape to assemble using these subunits. A regular polyhedron is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein used over and over again; this saves space in the viral genome.

In meteorology and climatology, global numerical models of atmospheric flow are of increasing interest which employ geodesic grids that are based on an icosahedron (refined by triangulation) instead of the more commonly used longitude/latitude grid. This has the advantage of evenly distributed spatial resolution without singularities (i.e. the poles) at the expense of somewhat greater numerical difficulty.

Geometry of space frames is often based on platonic solids. In the MERO system, Platonic solids are used for naming convention of various space frame configurations. For example, O+T refers to a configuration made of one half of octahedron and a tetrahedron.

Several Platonic hydrocarbons have been synthesised, including cubane and dodecahedrane and not tetrahedrane.

Platonic solids are often used to make dice, because dice of these shapes can be made fair. 6-sided dice are very common, but the other numbers are commonly used in role-playing games. Such dice are commonly referred to as d&quot;n&quot; where &quot;n&quot; is the number of faces (d8, d20, etc.); see dice notation for more details.

These shapes frequently show up in other games or puzzles. Puzzles similar to a Rubik&#x27;s Cube come in all five shapes – see magic polyhedra.

=== Liquid crystals with symmetries of Platonic solids ===
For the intermediate material phase called liquid crystals, the existence of such symmetries was first proposed in 1981 by H. Kleinert and K. Maki.
In aluminum the icosahedral structure was discovered three years after this by Dan Shechtman, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2011.

== In architecture ==

Architects liked the idea of Plato&#x27;s timeless forms that can be seen by the soul in the objects of the material world, but turned these shapes into more suitable for construction sphere, cylinder, cone, and square pyramid. In particular, one of the leaders of neoclassicism, Étienne-Louis Boullée, was preoccupied with the architects&#x27; version of &quot;Platonic solids&quot;.

== Related polyhedra and polytopes ==
=== Uniform polyhedra ===
There exist four regular polyhedra that are not convex, called Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra. These all have icosahedral symmetry and may be obtained as stellations of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.

The next most regular convex polyhedra after the Platonic solids are the cuboctahedron, which is a rectification of the cube and the octahedron, and the icosidodecahedron, which is a rectification of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (the rectification of the self-dual tetrahedron is a regular octahedron). These are both &quot;quasi-regular&quot;, meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen Archimedean solids, which are the convex uniform polyhedra with polyhedral symmetry. Their duals, the rhombic dodecahedron and rhombic triacontahedron, are edge- and face-transitive, but their faces are not regular and their vertices come in two types each; they are two of the thirteen Catalan solids.

The uniform polyhedra form a much broader class of polyhedra. These figures are vertex-uniform and have one or more types of regular or star polygons for faces. These include all the polyhedra mentioned above together with an infinite set of prisms, an infinite set of antiprisms, and 53 other non-convex forms.

The Johnson solids are convex polyhedra which have regular faces but are not uniform. Among them are five of the eight convex deltahedra, which have identical, regular faces (all equilateral triangles) but are not uniform. (The other three convex deltahedra are the Platonic tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron.)

=== Regular tessellations ===
The three regular tessellations of the plane are closely related to the Platonic solids. Indeed, one can view the Platonic solids as regular tessellations of the sphere. This is done by projecting each solid onto a concentric sphere. The faces project onto regular spherical polygons which exactly cover the sphere. Spherical tilings provide two infinite additional sets of regular tilings, the hosohedra, {2,&quot;n&quot;} with 2 vertices at the poles, and lune faces, and the dual dihedra, {&quot;n&quot;,2} with 2 hemispherical faces and regularly spaced vertices on the equator. Such tesselations would be degenerate in true 3D space as polyhedra.

Every regular tessellation of the sphere is characterized by a pair of integers {&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;} with  +  &gt; . Likewise, a regular tessellation of the plane is characterized by the condition  +  = . There are three possibilities:
In a similar manner, one can consider regular tessellations of the hyperbolic plane. These are characterized by the condition  +  &lt; . There is an infinite family of such tessellations.
=== Higher dimensions ===

In more than three dimensions, polyhedra generalize to polytopes, with higher-dimensional convex regular polytopes being the equivalents of the three-dimensional Platonic solids.

In the mid-19th century the Swiss mathematician Ludwig Schläfli discovered the four-dimensional analogues of the Platonic solids, called convex regular 4-polytopes. There are exactly six of these figures; five are analogous to the Platonic solids : 5-cell as {3,3,3}, 16-cell as {3,3,4}, 600-cell as {3,3,5}, tesseract as {4,3,3}, and 120-cell as {5,3,3}, and a sixth one, the self-dual 24-cell, {3,4,3}.

In all dimensions higher than four, there are only three convex regular polytopes: the simplex as {3,3...,3}, the hypercube as {4,3...,3}, and the cross-polytope as {3,3...,4}. In three dimensions, these coincide with the tetrahedron as {3,3}, the cube as {4,3}, and the octahedron as {3,4}.
