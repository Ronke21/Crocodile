<text>The PowerBook (known as Macintosh PowerBook before 1997) is a family of Macintosh laptop computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer from 1991 to 2006. It was targeted at the professional market; in 1999, the line was supplemented by the home and education-focused iBook family.

During its lifetime, the PowerBook went through several major revisions and redesigns, often being the first to incorporate features that would later become standard in competing laptops. The PowerBook was replaced by the MacBook Pro in 2006 as part of the Mac transition to Intel processors.

===PowerBook 100 series===
In October 1991, Apple released the first three PowerBooks: the low-end PowerBook 100, the more powerful PowerBook 140, and the high end PowerBook 170, the only one with an active matrix display. These machines caused a stir in the industry with their compact dark grey cases, built-in trackball, and the innovative positioning of the keyboard that left room for palmrests on either side of the pointing device. Portable PC computers at the time were still oriented toward DOS, and tended to have the keyboard forward towards the user, with empty space behind it that was often used for function key reference cards. In the early days of Microsoft Windows, many notebook computers came with a clip on trackball that fit on the edge of the keyboard molding. As usage of DOS gave way to the graphical user interface, the PowerBook&#x27;s arrangement became the standard layout all future notebooks would follow.

The PowerBook 140 and 170 were the original PowerBook designs, while the PowerBook 100 was the result of Apple having sent the schematics of the Mac Portable to Sony, who miniaturized the components. Hence the PowerBook 100&#x27;s design does not match those of the rest of the series, as it was actually designed after the 140 and 170 and further benefited from improvements learned during their development. The PowerBook 100, however, did not sell well until Apple dropped the price substantially.

The 100 series PowerBooks were intended to tie into the rest of the Apple desktop products utilizing the corporate Snow White design language incorporated into all product designs since 1986. Unlike the Macintosh Portable, however, which was essentially a battery-powered desktop in weight and size, the light colors and decorative recessed lines did not seem appropriate for the scaled-down designs. In addition to adopting the darker grey colour scheme that coordinated with the official corporate look, they also adopted a raised series of ridges mimicking the indented lines on the desktops. The innovative look not only unified their entire product line, but set Apple apart in the marketplace. These early series would be the last to utilize the aging Snow White look, with the 190 adopting a new look along with the introduction of the 500 series.

The first series of PowerBooks were hugely successful, capturing 40% of all laptop sales. Despite this, the original team left to work at Compaq, setting back updated versions for some time. When attempting to increase processing power, Apple was hampered by the overheating problems of the 68040; this resulted in the 100-series PowerBook being stuck with the aging 68030, which could not compete with newer-generation Intel 80486-based PC laptops introduced in 1994. For several years, new PowerBook and PowerBook Duo computers were introduced that featured incremental improvements, including color screens, but by mid-decade, most other companies had copied the majority of the PowerBook&#x27;s features. Apple was unable to ship a 68040-equipped PowerBook until the PowerBook 500 series in 1994.

The original PowerBook 100, 140, and 170 were replaced by the 145 (updated to the 145B in 1993), 160, and 180 in 1992. The 160 and 180 have video output, allowing them to drive an external monitor. In addition, the PowerBook 180 had a superb-for-the-time active-matrix grayscale display, making it popular with the Mac press. In 1993, the PowerBook 165c was the first PowerBook with a color screen, later followed by the 180c. In 1994, the last true member of the 100-series form factor introduced was the PowerBook 150, targeted at value-minded consumers and students. The PowerBook 190, released in 1995, bears no resemblance to the rest of the PowerBook 100 series, and is in fact simply a Motorola 68LC040-based version of the PowerBook 5300 (and the last Macintosh model to utilize a Motorola 68k-family processor). Like the 190, however, the 150 also used the 5300 IDE-based logic-board architecture. From the 100&#x27;s 68000 processor, to the 190&#x27;s 68LC040 processor, the 100 series PowerBooks span the entire Apple 68K line, with the 190 even upgradable to a PowerPC processor.

===PowerBook Duo===

In 1992, Apple released a hybrid portable/desktop computer, the PowerBook Duo, continuing to streamline the subnotebook features introduced with the PowerBook 100. The Duos were a series of very thin and lightweight laptops with a minimum of features, which could be inserted into a docking station to provide the system with extra video memory, storage space, connectors, and could be connected to a monitor.

===PowerBook 500 series===
1994 saw the introduction of the Motorola 68LC040-based PowerBook 500 series, code-named Blackbird. These models of PowerBooks were much sleeker and faster than the 100 series, which they replaced as the mid and high-end models. The 500 series featured DSTN (520) or active-matrix LCD displays (540 and 550), stereo speakers, and was the first computer to use a trackpad (although a similar technology had been included on the pioneering Gavilan SC 11 years earlier); it was also the first portable computer to offer built-in Ethernet networking. The PowerBook 500 series was the mainstay of the product line until the PowerBook 5300. The 500 series was the first PowerBook to feature PCMCIA slots, although this was an optional feature that required the user to sacrifice one of the two available battery slots to house the PCMCIA expansion cage.

The PowerBook 500 series was released as Apple was already moving its desktop machines to the PowerPC processor range, and a future upgrade was promised from the start. This came in 1995, as an Apple Motherboard containing a 100 MHz 603e processor and 8 MB of RAM (which snapped into a slot containing the previous 25 or 33 MHz 68040 processor and the 4 MB of RAM on the previous daughterboard). At the same time Newer Technology offered an Apple-authorized 117 MHz Motherboard, which was more popular than the Apple product, and optionally came without any RAM. The company later offered 167 MHz and 183 MHz upgrades containing more memory and onboard cache memory to improve performance. Nonetheless, the internal architecture of the 500 series meant that the speed increase provided by the 100 and 117 MHz upgrades was, for most users, relatively small.

The 500 series was completely discontinued upon the introduction of its replacement the PPC-based PowerBook 5300, with the PowerBook 190 replacing the 500 as the only 68LC040 PowerBook Apple offered.

== PowerPC-based models ==
The PowerBook 5300, while highly anticipated as one of the first PowerPC-based PowerBooks (along with the PowerBook Duo 2300c, both released on the same day), had numerous problems. In its 5300ce incarnation with a TFT of 800×600 pixels, Apple offered a 117 MHz PPC, 32 MB of onboard RAM, and a hot-swappable drive bay. With all of these features, though, the 5300ce was quite ahead of other laptop models at the time. Multiple problems with reliability, stability and safety (by some, the model was referred as the &quot;HindenBook&quot; because the lithium ion batteries used actually burst into flame in Apple tests, necessitating a recall and downgrade to nickel metal hydride batteries) were present in the early 5300s. After Apple offered an Extended Repair Program, the series turned into a remarkably attractive machine, but never lost its bad reputation. The bad publicity of 5300 series added to the woes of &quot;beleaguered Apple&quot; during the mid-1990s.

Apple recovered from the 5300 debacle in 1996 and 1997 by introducing three new PowerBooks: the PowerBook 1400, intended to replace the 5300 as a general-purpose PowerBook; the PowerBook 2400, intended as a slim, sleek sub-notebook to replace the PowerBook Duo; and the luxury model PowerBook 3400. The PowerBook 1400 and 3400 were the first PowerBooks ever to include an internal CD drive. Late in 1997, the PowerBook 3400 was adapted into the first PowerBook G3, codenamed the Kanga. This series was the last PowerBook model to employ a &quot;real&quot; keyboard with 1 cm high keys; all later models have flat keys.

=== PowerBook G3 ===
The first PowerBook G3 Series (completely redesigned from the Kanga) was released in 1998, although it was still an Old World ROM Mac.
These new PowerBooks took design cues from the 500 series PowerBook, sporting dramatic curves and a jet-black plastic case. They were so fashionable that various G3 models became the personal computer of Carrie Bradshaw in the long-running &quot;Sex and the City&quot; television show. Debuting at roughly the same time as the G3 iMac, the &quot;WallStreet/Mainstreet&quot; series composed of models with varying features, such as different processing speeds (from 233 to 300 MHz) and the choice of 12-, 13-, or 14-inch screens. They all included dual drive bays capable of accommodating floppy drives, CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drives, hard drives, or even extra batteries. A second PowerBook G3 Series code-named &quot;PDQ&quot; was introduced later in 1998, with minor changes in configuration options, notably the inclusion of L2 cache in even the lowest-priced 233 MHz model, which helped overall performance.

Apple introduced two later G3 PowerBook models, similar in appearance (curved, black plastic case with black rubberized sections) but thinner, lighter and with revised internal systems. The &quot;Lombard&quot; appeared in 1999, (AKA: Bronze Keyboard) a thinner, lighter, and faster (333 or 400 MHz) PowerBook with a longer battery life and had both USB and SCSI built in and was a New World ROM Mac, and then the &quot;Pismo&quot; in 2000, which replaced the single SCSI port with two FireWire ports, updated the PowerBook line to AGP graphics, a 100 MHz bus speed, and DVD-ROM optical drives standard, in addition to dropping the &quot;G3&quot; from the PowerBook name. The Pismo revision also brought AirPort wireless networking capability (802.11b), which had debuted in Apple&#x27;s iBook in July 1999. CPU upgrade cards are available for both Lombard and Pismo models.

===PowerBook G4===
Interim CEO Steve Jobs turned his eye to the redesign of the PowerBook series in 2000. The result, introduced in January 2001, was a completely re-designed New World PowerBook with a titanium skin and a 15.2-inch wide-aspect screen suitable for watching widescreen movies. Built with the PowerPC G4 processor, it was billed as &quot;the first supercomputer you can actually take with you on an airplane.&quot; It was lighter than most PC based laptops, and due to the low power consumption of the PowerPC it outlasted them by hours.

The &quot;TiBooks&quot;, as they were nicknamed, became a fashion item. They were especially popular in the entertainment business, where they adorned many desks in Hollywood motion pictures. Because of their large screens and high performance, Titanium Powerbooks were the first laptops to be widely deployed as desktop replacement computers.

The industrial design of the notebooks quickly became a standard that others in the industry would follow, creating a new wave of wide-screened notebook computers.

The Titanium PowerBooks were released in configurations of 400 MHz, 500 MHz, 550 MHz, 667 MHz, 800 MHz, 867 MHz, and 1 GHz. They are the last PowerBooks able to boot Mac OS 9 natively.

In 2003, Apple Computer launched both the largest-screen laptop in the world and Apple&#x27;s smallest full-featured notebook computer. Both machines were made of anodized aluminum (coining the new nickname &quot;AlBook&quot;), featured DVD-burning capabilities, AirPort Extreme networking, Bluetooth, and 12.1-inch or 17-inch LCD displays. The 17-inch model included a fiber optic-illuminated keyboard, which eventually became standard on all 15-inch and 17-inch PowerBooks. Two ambient light sensors, located under each speaker grille, adjusted the brightness of the backlit keyboard and the display according to the light level.

The 12-inch PowerBook&#x27;s screen did not use the same panel as that used on the 12-inch iBook, while the 17-inch PowerBook used the same screen as that used on the 17-inch flat-panel iMac, but with a thinner backlight.

Later in 2003, the 15-inch PowerBooks were redesigned and featured the same aluminum body style as their smaller and larger siblings, and with the same feature set as the 17-inch model (including the backlit keyboard). This basic design would carry through the transition to the Intel-based MacBook Pro, lasting until late 2008.

In April 2004, the aluminum PowerBooks were upgraded. The SuperDrive was upgraded to 4× burning speed for DVDs, the fastest processor available was upgraded to 1.5 GHz, and the graphics cards were replaced with newer models, offering up to 128 MB of video memory. A third built-in speaker was added to the 12-inch model for improved midrange sound. In addition, AirPort Extreme cards became standard for all PowerBooks instead of being offered as an add-on option.

In January 2005, the specifications of the aluminum PowerBooks were revised once more to accompany a price decrease. Processor speeds were increased to a maximum of 1.67 GHz on the higher specification 15-inch and all 17-inch versions, while the lower specification 15-inch model and the 12-inch unit saw an increase in speed to 1.5 GHz. Optical audio output was added to the 17-inch version. Memory and hard drive defaults were increased to 512 MB and 5400 rpm, respectively, with a new storage maximum of 100 GB on the 17-inch model. Each model also received an enhanced trackpad with scrolling capabilities, a revised Bluetooth module supporting BT 2.0+EDR, and a new feature that parks the drive heads when sudden motion is detected by an internal sensor. Support for the 30-inch Apple Cinema display was also introduced in the new 17-inch model and was optional in the 15-inch model via a build-to-order upgrade to the computer&#x27;s video hardware. The SuperDrive now included DVD+R capability.

In October 2005, the two higher-end PowerBooks were upgraded once again, with higher-resolution displays (1440 × 960 pixels on the 15-inch model, and 1680 × 1050 pixels on the 17-inch model) and faster 533 MHz DDR2 (PC2-4200) memory. The SuperDrive became standard equipment and included support for dual-layer DVDs on the 15- and 17-inch models. The 17-inch model was updated with a 120 GB standard hard drive, as well as a 7200 rpm, 100 GB build-to-order option. These drives were also options on the 15-inch PowerBook. The 12-inch model with SuperDrive remained unchanged in this respect, although each new PowerBook boasted a longer battery life.

====Battery recall====

On May 20, 2005, Apple and the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall of some Apple PowerBook G4 batteries. These batteries were manufactured by Sony; Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo, HP, Fujitsu and Acer laptops were also affected by the defective batteries. The joint Apple/CPSC press release stated that an internal short could cause the battery cells to overheat, posing a fire hazard. Approximately 128,000 defective units were sold. Though the problems first appeared to be solved, they continued for many users. In early August 2006, Engadget reported that a PowerBook had &quot;violently exploded&quot; because of faulty battery. On August 24, 2006, Apple and the CPSC announced an additional recall of more batteries for the same PowerBook models. About 1.1 million battery packs in the United States were recalled; an additional 700,000 were sold outside the U.S.

== Discontinuation ==
At the 2006 Macworld Conference &amp; Expo, the MacBook Pro was introduced. The new notebooks, however, only came in 15.4-inch models and the 12-inch and 17-inch PowerBooks remained available for sale at Apple stores and retailers, as well as the 15-inch model, which was sold until supplies ran out. On April 24, 2006, the 17-inch PowerBook G4 was replaced by a 17-inch MacBook Pro variant. The 12-inch PowerBook G4 remained available until May 16, 2006, when the MacBook was introduced as a replacement for the iBook. Because of its availability in highly powerful configurations, it was also considered a replacement for the 12-inch PowerBook, ending the nearly 15-year production of PowerBook-branded computers. An indirect successor, the 13-inch MacBook Pro, was introduced in mid 2009.

== Timeline ==
== Legacy ==
Traditionally, the portable line trailed the desktops in the utilization of the latest processors, with the notable exception of the PowerBook G3, which was released simultaneously with the desktop Power Macintosh G3. PowerBooks would continue to trail behind the desktop Macs, however, never even adopting the G5 processor. This was due primarily to the extreme heat caused by most of the full-sized processors available and unacceptable power consumption. With the introduction of the Intel-based Macs, once again, the MacBook Pro joined the iMac in sharing the new technology simultaneously.

<text>Philip David Ochs (; December 19, 1940 – April 9, 1976) was an American songwriter, protest singer (or, as he preferred, &quot;topical singer&quot;), and political activist. Ochs was known for his sharp wit, sardonic humor, and political commentary. He wrote approximately 200 songs throughout the 1960s and 1970s, and released eight albums.

Ochs performed at many political events throughout the course of his career—including the 1968 Democratic National Convention, multiple mass demonstrations sponsored by the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, civil rights rallies, student events, and organized labor events—and was known to perform at benefits for free. Politically, early in his career, Ochs described himself as a &quot;left social democrat,&quot; but became an early revolutionary after the police riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which had a profound effect on his state of mind.

After years of prolific writing in the 1960s, Ochs&#x27; mental stability declined in the 1970s. He had a number of mental health problems, including depression, bipolar disorder and alcoholism, and died by suicide on April 9, 1976.

Ochs&#x27; influences included Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Bob Gibson, Faron Young, and Merle Haggard. His best-known songs include &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot;, &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;, &quot;Changes&quot;, &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, &quot;Draft Dodger Rag&quot;, &quot;Love Me, I&#x27;m a Liberal&quot;, &quot;Outside of a Small Circle of Friends&quot;, &quot;Power and the Glory&quot;, &quot;There but for Fortune&quot;, and &quot;The War Is Over&quot;.

==Early life==
Philip David Ochs was born on December 19, 1940, in El Paso, Texas, to Jacob &quot;Jack&quot; Ochs (August 11, 1909 – April 30, 1963), a physician who was born in New York to Polish-Jewish parents, and Gertrude Ochs (née Phin; February 26, 1912 – March 9, 1994), who was born in Scotland to Jewish parents. His parents met and married in Edinburgh where Jack was attending medical school, and afterwards moved to the United States. Ochs grew up with an older sister, Sonia (known as Sonny, born April 12, 1937), and a younger brother, Michael (born February 27, 1943).

After being drafted into the army, Jack was sent overseas near the end of World War II and treated soldiers at the Battle of the Bulge. His war experiences, however, affected his mental health and he received an honorable medical discharge in November 1945. Upon arriving home, Jack was hospitalized for bipolar disorder and depression, and was distant from his wife and children. He was also unable to establish a successful medical practice and instead worked at a series of hospitals around the country. As a result, Ochs and his family moved frequently: first to Far Rockaway, New York, when Ochs was a teenager; then to Perrysburg in western New York, where he first studied music; and then to Columbus, Ohio.

As a teen, Ochs was recognized as a talented clarinet player; in an evaluation, one music instructor wrote: &quot;You have exceptional musical feeling and the ability to transfer it on your instrument is abundant.&quot; His musical skills allowed him to play clarinet with the orchestra at the Capital University Conservatory of Music in Ohio, where he rose to the status of principal soloist before he was 16. Although Ochs played classical music, he soon became interested in other music sounds he heard on the radio, such as early rock icons (Buddy Holly and Elvis Presley) and country artists (Faron Young, Ernest Tubb, Hank Williams Sr., and Johnny Cash). 

Ochs also spent a lot of time at the movies while living in Far Rockaway, as there were three theaters in town. Because his mother did not want to hire a babysitter, she instead gave her sons money and the brothers saw five to six films each week. He especially liked big screen heroes (John Wayne and Audie Murphy) and later developed an interest in movie rebels (Marlon Brando and James Dean).

=== Education and journalism: 1956–1961 ===
From 1956 to 1958, Ochs was a student at the Staunton Military Academy in rural Virginia, and after graduating, he returned to Columbus and enrolled at Ohio State University. Unhappy after his first quarter, 18-year-old Ochs took a leave of absence and went to Florida, where was jailed for two weeks for sleeping on a park bench in Miami, an incident he would later recall:

Somewhere during the course of those fifteen days I decided to become a writer. My primary thought was journalism ... so in a flash, I decided—I&#x27;ll be a writer and a major in journalism.
Ochs returned to Ohio State to study journalism and developed an interest in politics, with a particular interest in the Cuban Revolution of 1959. At Ohio State, he met Jim Glover, a fellow student who was a devotee of folk music and whose father was a socialist. Glover introduced Ochs to the music of Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, and the Weavers. Glover taught Ochs how to play guitar, and they debated politics. Ochs began writing newspaper articles, often on radical themes. When the student paper refused to publish some of his more radical articles, he started his own underground newspaper called &quot;The Word&quot;, as well as writing for the satire magazine, &quot;The Sundial&quot;, with fellow classmate R.L. Stine. His two main interests, politics and music, soon merged, and Ochs began writing topical political songs. Ochs and Glover formed a duet called &quot;The Singing Socialists&quot;, later renamed &quot;The Sundowners&quot;, but the duo broke up before their first professional performance and Glover went to New York City to become a folksinger.

Ochs&#x27; parents and brother had moved from Columbus to Cleveland, and Ochs started to spend more time there, performing professionally at a local folk club called Farragher&#x27;s Back Room. He was the opening act for a number of musicians in the summer of 1961, including the Smothers Brothers. Ochs met folk singer Bob Gibson that summer as well, and according to Dave Van Ronk, Gibson became &quot;&quot;the&quot; seminal influence&quot; on Ochs&#x27; writing. Ochs continued at Ohio State into his senior year, but was bitterly disappointed at not being appointed editor-in-chief of the college newspaper, and dropped out in his last quarter without graduating. He left for New York, as Glover had, to become a folksinger.

== Career ==

=== New York City: 1962–1966 ===
Ochs arrived in New York City in 1962 and began performing in numerous small folk nightclubs, eventually becoming an integral part of the Greenwich Village folk music scene. He emerged as an unpolished but passionate vocalist who wrote pointed songs about current events: war, civil rights, labor struggles and other topics. While others described his music as &quot;protest songs&quot;, Ochs preferred the term &quot;topical songs&quot;.

However, in order to get by, in November 1962, Ochs accepted $50 to record a children&#x27;s album, a collection of traditional popular campfire songs, titled &quot;Camp Favorites&quot; (1963). In 1963, Cameo Records released this budget LP. Ochs requested his name not be used and it wasn&#x27;t until well after his death that its existence became known. The Campers consists of Ochs (who is not credited on the record), an unknown female vocalist and a group of children.

Ochs described himself as a &quot;singing journalist&quot;, saying he built his songs from stories he read in &quot;Newsweek&quot;. By the summer of 1963, he was sufficiently well known in folk circles to be invited to sing at the Newport Folk Festival, where he performed &quot;Too Many Martyrs&quot; (co-written with Bob Gibson), &quot;Talking Birmingham Jam&quot;, and &quot;Power and the Glory&quot;—his patriotic Guthrie-esque anthem that brought the audience to its feet. Other performers at the 1963 folk festival included Peter, Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and Tom Paxton. Ochs&#x27; return appearance at Newport in 1964, where he performed &quot;Draft Dodger Rag,&quot; &quot;Talking Vietnam Blues,&quot; and other songs, was widely praised. However, he was not invited to appear in 1965, the festival when Dylan infamously performed &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot; with an electric guitar. Although many in the folk world decried Dylan&#x27;s choice, Ochs admired Dylan&#x27;s courage in defying the folk establishment, and publicly defended him.

In 1963, Ochs performed at New York&#x27;s Carnegie Hall and Town Hall in hootenannies. He made his first solo appearance at Carnegie Hall in 1966. Throughout his career, Ochs would perform at a wide range of venues, including civil rights rallies, anti-war demonstrations, and concert halls.

Ochs contributed many songs and articles to the influential &quot;Broadside Magazine&quot;. He recorded his first three albums for Elektra Records: &quot;All the News That&#x27;s Fit to Sing&quot; (1964), &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot; (1965), and &quot;Phil Ochs in Concert&quot; (1966). Critics wrote that each album was better than its predecessors, and fans seemed to agree; record sales increased with each new release.

On these records, Ochs was accompanied only by an acoustic guitar. The albums contain many of Ochs&#x27;s topical songs, such as &quot;Too Many Martyrs&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot;, and &quot;Draft Dodger Rag&quot;; and some musical reinterpretation of older poetry, such as &quot;The Highwayman&quot; (poem by Alfred Noyes) and &quot;The Bells&quot; (poem by Edgar Allan Poe). &quot;Phil Ochs in Concert&quot; includes some more introspective songs, such as &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;.

During the early period of his career, Ochs and Bob Dylan had a friendly rivalry. Dylan said of Ochs, &quot;I just can&#x27;t keep up with Phil—and he&#x27;s gettin&#x27; better and better&quot;. On another occasion, when Ochs criticized either &quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot; or &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot; (sources differ), Dylan threw him out of his limousine, saying, &quot;You&#x27;re not a folk singer. You&#x27;re a journalist.&quot;

In 1962, Ochs married Alice Skinner, who was pregnant with their daughter Meegan, in a City Hall ceremony with Jim Glover as best man and Jean Ray as bridesmaid, and witnessed by Dylan&#x27;s girlfriend at the time, Suze Rotolo. Phil and Alice separated in 1965, but they never divorced.

Like many people of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he disagreed with the president on issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he thought he was going to die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.

Ochs&#x27;s managers during this part of his career were Albert Grossman (who also managed Bob Dylan, Peter, Paul, and Mary and Gordon Lightfoot) followed by Arthur Gorson. Gorson had close ties with such groups as Americans For Democratic Action, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and Students for a Democratic Society.

Ochs was writing songs at a fast pace. Some of the songs he wrote during this period were held back and recorded on his later albums.

===California: 1967–1969===
In 1967, Ochs – now managed by his brother Michael—left Elektra Records for A&amp;M Records and moved to Los Angeles, California. He recorded four studio albums for A&amp;M: &quot;Pleasures of the Harbor&quot; (1967), &quot;Tape from California&quot; (1968), &quot;Rehearsals for Retirement&quot; (1969), and the ironically titled &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (1970) (which actually consisted of all new material). For his A&amp;M albums, Ochs moved away from simply produced solo acoustic guitar performances and experimented with ensemble and even orchestral instrumentation, &quot;baroque-folk&quot;, in the hopes of producing a pop-folk hybrid that would be a hit.

Critic Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;Esquire&quot; of &quot;Pleasures of the Harbor&quot; in May 1968, did not consider this new direction a good turn. While describing Ochs as &quot;unquestionably a nice guy&quot;, he went on to say, &quot;too bad his voice shows an effective range of about half an octave [and] his guitar playing would not suffer much if his right hand were webbed.&quot; &quot;Pleasures of the Harbor&quot;, Christgau continued, &quot;epitomizes the decadence that has infected pop since &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;. [The] gaudy musical settings ... inspire nostalgia for the three-chord strum.&quot; 

With an ironic sense of humor, Ochs included Christgau&#x27;s &quot;webbed hand&quot; comment in his 1968 songbook &quot;The War is Over&quot; on a page titled &quot;The Critics Raved&quot;, opposite a full-page picture of Ochs standing in a large metal garbage can. Despite his sense of humor, Ochs was unhappy that his work was not receiving the critical acclaim and popular success he had hoped to achieve. Still, Ochs would joke on the back cover of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; that there were 50 Phil Ochs fans (&quot;50 fans can&#x27;t be wrong!&quot;), a sarcastic reference to an Elvis Presley album that bragged of 50 million Elvis fans.

None of Ochs&#x27;s songs became hits, although &quot;Outside of a Small Circle of Friends&quot; received a good deal of airplay. It reached No. 119 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s national &quot;Hot Prospect&quot; listing before being pulled from some radio stations because of its lyrics, which included &quot;smoking marijuana is more fun than drinking beer&quot;. It was the closest Ochs ever came to the Top 40. Joan Baez, however, did have a Top Ten hit in the U.K. in August 1965, reaching No. 8 with her recording of Ochs&#x27;s song &quot;There but for Fortune&quot;, which was also nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Folk Recording&quot;. In the U.S. it peaked at No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts—a good showing, but not a hit.

Although he was trying new things musically, Ochs did not abandon his protest roots. He was profoundly concerned with the escalation of the Vietnam War, performing tirelessly at anti-war rallies across the country. In 1967, he organized two rallies to declare that &quot;The War Is Over&quot;—&quot;Is everybody sick of this stinking war? In that case, friends, do what I and thousands of other Americans have done—declare the war over.&quot;—one in Los Angeles in June, the other in New York in November. He continued to write and record anti-war songs, such as &quot;The War Is Over&quot; and &quot;White Boots Marching in a Yellow Land&quot;. Other topical songs of this period include &quot;Outside of a Small Circle of Friends&quot;, inspired by the murder of Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death outside of her New York City apartment building while dozens of her neighbors reportedly ignored her cries for help, and &quot;William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed&quot;, about the despair he felt in the aftermath of the Chicago 1968 Democratic National Convention police riot.

Ochs was writing more personal songs as well, such as &quot;Crucifixion&quot;, in which he compared the deaths of Jesus Christ and assassinated President John F. Kennedy as part of a &quot;cycle of sacrifice&quot; in which people build up heroes and then celebrate their destruction; &quot;Chords of Fame&quot;, a warning against the dangers and corruption of fame; &quot;Pleasures of the Harbor&quot;, a lyrical portrait of a lonely sailor seeking human connection far from home; and &quot;Boy in Ohio&quot;, a plaintive look back at Ochs&#x27;s childhood in Columbus.

A lifelong movie fan, Ochs worked the narratives of justice and rebellion that he had seen in films into his music, describing some of his songs as &quot;cinematic&quot;. He was disappointed and bitter when his onetime hero John Wayne embraced the Vietnam War with what Ochs saw as the blind patriotism of Wayne&#x27;s 1968 film, &quot;The Green Berets&quot;:

[H]ere we have John Wayne, who was a major artistic and psychological figure on the American scene, ... who at one point used to make movies of soldiers who had a certain validity, ... a certain sense of honor [about] what the soldier was doing. ... Even if it was a cavalry movie doing a historically dishonorable thing to the Indians, even as there was a feeling of what it meant to be a man, what it meant to have some sense of duty. ... Now today we have the same actor making his new war movie in a war so hopelessly corrupt that, without seeing the movie, I&#x27;m sure it is perfectly safe to say that it will be an almost robot-view of soldiery, just by definition of how the whole country has deteriorated. And I think it would make a very interesting double feature to show a good old Wayne movie like, say, &quot;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon&quot; with &quot;The Green Berets&quot;. Because that would make a very striking comment on what has happened to America in general.

Ochs was involved in the creation of the Youth International Party, known as the Yippies, along with Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Stew Albert, and Paul Krassner. At the same time, Ochs actively supported Eugene McCarthy&#x27;s more mainstream bid for the 1968 Democratic nomination for President, a position at odds with the more radical Yippie point of view. Still, Ochs helped plan the Yippies&#x27; &quot;Festival of Life&quot; which was to take place at the 1968 Democratic National Convention along with demonstrations by other anti-war groups including the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam. 

Despite warnings that there might be trouble, Ochs went to Chicago both as a guest of the McCarthy campaign and to participate in the demonstrations. He performed in Lincoln Park, Grant Park, and at the Chicago Coliseum, witnessed the violence perpetrated by the Chicago police against the protesters, and was arrested at one point. Ochs also purchased the young boar who became known as the Yippie 1968 Presidential candidate &quot;Pigasus the Immortal&quot; from a farm in Illinois.
The events of 1968the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and of Robert F. Kennedy weeks later, the Chicago police riot, and the election of Richard Nixonleft Ochs feeling disillusioned and depressed. The cover of his 1969 album &quot;Rehearsals for Retirement&quot; portrayed a tombstone with the words:

PHIL OCHS(AMERICAN)BORN: EL PASO, TEXAS, 1940DIED: CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, 1968
At the trial of the Chicago Seven in December 1969, Ochs testified for the defense. His testimony included his recitation of the lyrics to his song &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot;. On his way out of the courthouse, Ochs sang the song for the press corps; to Ochs&#x27;s amusement, his singing was broadcast that evening by Walter Cronkite on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;.

===&quot;Greatest Hits&quot;: 1970===
After the riot in Chicago and the subsequent trial, Ochs changed direction again. The events of 1968 convinced him that the average American was not listening to topical songs or responding to Yippie tactics. Ochs thought that by playing the sort of music that had moved him as a teenager he could speak more directly to the American public.

Ochs turned to his musical roots in country music and early rock and roll. He decided he needed to be &quot;part Elvis Presley and part Che Guevara&quot;, so he commissioned a gold lamé suit from Elvis Presley&#x27;s costumer Nudie Cohn. Ochs wore the gold suit on the cover of his 1970 album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, which consisted of new songs largely in rock and country styles.

Ochs went on tour wearing the gold suit, backed by a rock band, singing his own material along with medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard. His fans did not know how to respond. This new Phil Ochs drew a hostile reaction from his audience. Ochs&#x27;s March 27, 1970, concerts at Carnegie Hall were the most successful, and by the end of that night&#x27;s second show, Ochs had won over many in the crowd. The show was recorded and released as &quot;Gunfight at Carnegie Hall&quot;.

During this period, Ochs was taking drugs to get through performances. He had been taking Valium for years to help control his nerves, and he was also drinking heavily. Pianist Lincoln Mayorga said of that period, &quot;He was physically abusing himself very badly on that tour. He was drinking a lot of wine and taking uppers. The wine was pulling him one way and the uppers were pulling him another way, and he was kind of a mess. There were so many pharmaceuticals around – so many pills. I&#x27;d never seen anything like that.&quot; Ochs tried to cut back on the pills, but alcohol remained his drug of choice for the rest of his life.

Depressed by his lack of widespread appreciation and suffering from writer&#x27;s block, Ochs did not record any further albums. He slipped deeper into depression and alcoholism. His personal problems notwithstanding, Ochs performed at the inaugural benefit for Greenpeace on October 16, 1970, at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, British Columbia. A recording of his performance, along with performances by Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, was released by Greenpeace in 2009.

===Traveling: 1971–1975===
In August 1971, Ochs went to Chile, where Salvador Allende, a Marxist, had been democratically elected in the 1970 election. There he met Chilean folksinger Víctor Jara, an Allende supporter, and the two became friends. In October, Ochs left Chile to visit Argentina. Later that month, after singing at a political rally in Uruguay, he and his American traveling companion David Ifshin were arrested and detained overnight. When the two returned to Argentina, they were arrested as they got off the airplane. After a brief stay in an Argentinian prison, Ochs and Ifshin were sent to Bolivia via a commercial airliner where authorities were to detain them.

Ifshin had previously been warned by Argentinian leftist friends that when the authorities sent dissidents to Bolivia, they would disappear forever. When the airliner arrived in Bolivia, the American captain of the Braniff International Airways aircraft allowed Ochs and Ifshin to stay on the aircraft and barred Bolivian authorities from entering. The aircraft then flew to Peru where the two disembarked and they were not detained. Fearful that Peruvian authorities might arrest him, Ochs returned to the United States a few days later.

Ochs was having difficulties writing new songs during this period, but he had occasional breakthroughs. He updated his sarcastic song &quot;Here&#x27;s to the State of Mississippi&quot; as &quot;Here&#x27;s to the State of Richard Nixon&quot;, with cutting lines such as &quot;the speeches of the Spiro are the ravings of a clown&quot;, a reference to Nixon&#x27;s vitriolic vice president, Spiro Agnew—sung as &quot;the speeches of the President are the ravings of a clown&quot; after Agnew&#x27;s resignation.

Ochs was personally invited by John Lennon to sing at a large benefit at the University of Michigan in December 1971 on behalf of John Sinclair, an activist poet who had been arrested on minor drug charges and given a severe sentence. Ochs performed at the John Sinclair Freedom Rally along with Stevie Wonder, Allen Ginsberg, David Peel, Abbie Hoffman, and many others. The rally culminated with Lennon and Yoko Ono, who were making their first public performance in the United States since the breakup of the Beatles.

Although the 1968 election had left him deeply disillusioned, Ochs continued to work for the election campaigns of anti-war candidates, such as George McGovern&#x27;s unsuccessful Presidential bid in 1972.

In 1972, Ochs was asked to write the theme song for the film &quot;Kansas City Bomber&quot;. The task proved difficult, as he struggled to overcome his writer&#x27;s block. Although his song was not used in the soundtrack, it was released as a single.

In mid-1972, Ochs traveled to Australia and New Zealand and then to Africa the following year, where he visited Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, and South Africa. While visiting Tanzania one night, he was attacked and strangled by robbers in Dar es Salaam, which damaged his vocal cords, causing a loss of the top three notes in his vocal range. The attack also exacerbated his growing mental problems, and he became increasingly paranoid. Ochs believed the attack may have been arranged by US government agents, perhaps the CIA. Still, he continued his trip, even recording a single in Kenya, &quot;Bwatue&quot;.

On September 11, 1973, the Allende government of Chile was overthrown in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. Allende committed suicide during the bombing of the presidential palace, and singer Victor Jara was rounded up with other professors and students, tortured and murdered. When Ochs heard about the manner in which his friend had been killed, he was outraged and decided to organize a benefit concert to bring to public attention the situation in Chile, and raise funds for the people of Chile. The concert, &quot;An Evening with Salvador Allende&quot;, was held on May 9, 1974, at New York City&#x27;s Felt Forum, included films of Allende; singers such as Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Dave Van Ronk, and Bob Dylan; and political activists such as former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark. Dylan had agreed to perform at the last minute when he heard that the concert had sold so few tickets that it was in danger of being canceled. Once his participation was announced, the event quickly sold out.

After the Chile benefit, Ochs and Dylan discussed the possibility of a joint concert tour, playing small nightclubs. Nothing came of the Dylan-Ochs plans, but the idea eventually evolved into Dylan&#x27;s Rolling Thunder Revue.

The Vietnam War ended on April 30, 1975. Ochs planned a final &quot;War Is Over&quot; rally, which was held in New York&#x27;s Central Park on May 11. More than 100,000 people came to hear Ochs, joined by Harry Belafonte, Odetta, Pete Seeger, Paul Simon and others. Ochs and Joan Baez sang a duet of &quot;There but for Fortune&quot; and he closed with his song &quot;The War Is Over&quot;.

== Decline and death ==
Ochs&#x27; drinking became more and more of a problem, and his behavior became increasingly erratic. He frightened his friends both with his drunken rants about the FBI and CIA and about his claiming to want to have Elvis&#x27; manager Colonel Tom Parker or Kentucky Fried Chicken&#x27;s Colonel Sanders manage his career.

In mid-1975, Ochs took on the identity of John Butler Train. He told people that Train had murdered Ochs and that he, John Butler Train, had replaced him. Ochs was convinced that someone was trying to kill him, so he carried a weapon at all times: a hammer, a knife, or a lead pipe.

His brother, Michael, attempted to have him committed to a psychiatric hospital. Friends pleaded with him to get help voluntarily. They feared for his safety because he was getting into fights with bar patrons. Unable to pay his rent, he began living on the streets.

After several months, the Train persona faded and Ochs returned, but his talk of suicide disturbed his friends and family. They hoped it was a passing phase, but Ochs was determined. One of his biographers explains Ochs&#x27; motivation:

On Christmas Eve 1975, Ochs visited the apartment of Larry Sloman and Dave Peller, which he had done semi-frequently near the end of 1975. On this particular evening, Peller recorded Ochs singing 10 songs, 5 of them new and intended for an album that &quot;would be an unflinching narrative of his psychosis over the past year&quot; which went by the working title of &quot;Duels in the Sun&quot;. Five other songs were also in some level of completion by this time. A second tape, possibly recorded before Christmas Eve, features additional songs intended for this project. This album would never come to fruition beyond these two recordings.

In January 1976, Ochs moved to Far Rockaway, New York, to live with his sister Sonny. He was lethargic; his only activities were watching television and playing cards with his nephews. Ochs saw a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with bipolar disorder. He was prescribed medication, and he told his sister he was taking it. On April 9, 1976, Ochs died by suicide by hanging himself in Sonny&#x27;s home.

Years after his death, it was revealed that the FBI had a file of nearly 500 pages on Ochs. Much of the information in those files relates to his association with counterculture figures, protest organizers, musicians, and other people described by the FBI as &quot;subversive&quot;. The FBI was often sloppy in collecting information on Ochs: his name was frequently misspelled &quot;Oakes&quot; in their files, and they continued to consider him &quot;potentially dangerous&quot; after his death.

Congresswoman Bella Abzug (Democrat from New York), an outspoken anti-war activist who had appeared at the 1975 &quot;War is Over&quot; rally, entered this statement into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot; on April 29, 1976:

Robert Christgau, who had been so critical of &quot;Pleasures of the Harbor&quot; and Ochs&#x27;s guitar skills eight years earlier, wrote warmly of Ochs in his obituary in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. &quot;I came around to liking Phil Ochs&#x27;s music, guitar included,&quot; Christgau wrote. &quot;My affection [for Ochs] no doubt prejudiced me, so it is worth [noting] that many observers who care more for folk music than I do remember both his compositions and his vibrato tenor as close to the peak of the genre.&quot;

===1976 memorial concert===
On May 28, 1976, at New York City&#x27;s Felt Forum, a memorial concert was held for Ochs. Spearheaded by Michael and Sonny Ochs, the over six hour concert consisted of performances of Ochs&#x27;s best known material by many of his peers and influences, including Dave Van Ronk, Pete Seeger, Jim Glover, Jean Ray, Melanie, Bob Gibson, and Peter Yarrow, with spoken Ed Sanders written tributes delivered by Jerry Rubin and Ramsey Clark.

==Legacy==
Almost 50 years after his death, Ochs&#x27;s songs remain relevant. Ochs continues to influence singers and fans worldwide, most of whom never saw him perform live. There are mailing lists and online discussion groups dedicated to Ochs and his music; websites that have music samples, photographs, and other links; and articles and books continue to be written and published about him.

His sister, Sonny Ochs (Tanzman), runs a series of &quot;Phil Ochs Song Nights&quot; with a rotating group of performers who keep Ochs&#x27;s music and legacy alive by singing his songs in cities across the U.S. His brother Michael Ochs is a photographic archivist of 20th-century music and entertainment personalities. His daughter Meegan Lee Ochs worked with Michael to produce a box set of Ochs&#x27;s music titled &quot;Farewells &amp; Fantasies&quot;, the title of which was taken from Ochs&#x27;s sign-off on the &quot;postcard&quot; on the back of &quot;Tape from California&quot;: &quot;Farewells &amp; Fantasies, Folks, P. Ochs&quot;. Meegan has a son named Caiden Finn Potter, Ochs&#x27;s only grandchild. Alice Skinner Ochs was a photographer; she died in November 2010.

In February 2009, the North American Folk Music and Dance Alliance gave the 2009 Elaine Weissman Lifetime Achievement Award to Ochs.

In September 2014, Meegan Lee Ochs announced that she was donating her father&#x27;s archives to the Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Included are many of his notebooks, journals, videotapes of his performances, the gold lamé suit, photographs, and other documents and memorabilia that Meegan had preserved since his death.

===Covers and updates===

In 2005, Kind Of Like Spitting released an album, &quot;&quot;, consisting of covers of nine songs written by Ochs, to pay tribute to his music and raise awareness of the artist, whom they felt had been overlooked. 

Jello Biafra and Mojo Nixon, on their album &quot;Prairie Home Invasion&quot;, recorded a version of &quot;Love Me, I&#x27;m a Liberal&quot; with lyrics updated to the Clinton era. Evan Greer, part of the Riot-Folk collective, later updated the song for the George W. Bush era. Ryan Harvey, also part of Riot-Folk, remade &quot;Cops Of The World&quot; with updated lyrics. The Clash used some of the lyrics to &quot;United Fruit&quot; in their song &quot;Up in Heaven (Not Only Here)&quot;, which appeared on their 1980 album &quot;Sandinista!&quot;. During their performance on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;, Pearl Jam covered &quot;Here&#x27;s to the State of Mississippi&quot; with updated lyrics to include Jerry Falwell, Dick Cheney, John Roberts, Alberto Gonzales, and George W. Bush. In 2002, with the agreement of Ochs&#x27;s sister Sonny, Richard Thompson added an extra verse to &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot; to reflect recent American foreign policy. Jefferson Starship recorded &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Marching Anymore&quot; with additional lyrics by band member Cathy Richardson for their 2008 release &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Tree of Liberty&quot;.

Neil Young has cited Ochs as a major influence on his music. In a 1969 interview, Young said, &quot;I really think Phil Ochs is a genius ... he&#x27;s written fantastic, incredible songs – he&#x27;s on the same level with Dylan in my eyes.&quot; In 2013, Young performed &quot;Changes&quot; at Farm Aid and included it in his 2014 tour set; it also is the lead track on &quot;A Letter Home&quot;, his 2014 album of covers.

In 2016, Richard Barone released his album &quot;Sorrows &amp; Promises: Greenwich Village in the 1960s&quot;, which includes &quot;When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;. Barone said of the project: &quot;My favorite artist on the album is Phil Ochs. I grew up with Phil Ochs songs. I love his topical songs–and I also like his songs that are not political. He was always really good no matter what he was doing.&quot; On tour, Barone also performed &quot;Changes&quot;.

In 2020, Welsh singer-songwriter Martyn Joseph released &quot;Days of Decision: A Tribute to Phil Ochs&quot; containing 14 Ochs covers, as well as liner notes by Ochs&#x27; sister, Sonny.

In 2024 Phil Odgers and John Kettle released an album of 11 Ochs covers called &quot;Far Rockaway&quot;.

===Tributes===
On learning of Ochs&#x27; death, Tom Paxton wrote a song titled &quot;Phil&quot;, which he recorded for his 1978 album &quot;Heroes&quot;. Ochs is also the subject of &quot;I Dreamed I Saw Phil Ochs Last Night&quot;, by Billy Bragg, from his 1990 album &quot;The Internationale&quot;, which was based on the Alfred Hayes/Earl Robinson song &quot;Joe Hill&quot; which Ochs helped popularize. Ochs also had his own, different song (&quot;Joe Hill&quot;) about the early 20th-century union activist/songwriter. &quot;Thin Wild Mercury,&quot; by Peter Cooper and Todd Snider, is about Ochs&#x27;s infamous clash with Dylan and getting thrown out of Dylan&#x27;s limo. 

Ochs is mentioned in the Dar Williams song &quot;All My Heroes Are Dead&quot;, the Will Oldham song &quot;Gezundheit&quot;, the Chumbawamba song &quot;Love Me&quot;, and the They Might Be Giants song &quot;The Day&quot;. The Josh Joplin Group recorded a tribute to Ochs on their album &quot;Useful Music&quot;. Schooner Fare recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop To Rest (Song for Phil Ochs)&quot; on their 1981 album &quot;Closer to the Wind&quot;.

Singer-songwriter Jen Cass&#x27;s &quot;Standing In Your Memory&quot;, and Harry Chapin&#x27;s &quot;The Parade&#x27;s Still Passing By&quot; are tributes to Ochs. Leslie Fish recorded &quot;Chickasaw Mountain&quot;, which is dedicated to Ochs, on her 1986 album of that name. 

The punk band Squirrel Bait cited Ochs as a major creative influence in the liner notes of their 1986 album &quot;Skag Heaven&quot;, and cover his &quot;Tape From California&quot;. The American hardcore punk supergroup Hesitation Wounds wrote a song called &quot;P. Ochs (The Death of a Rebel)&quot;, which appeared on their self-titled debut EP in 2013. The song&#x27;s lyrics reference the folk singer&#x27;s life and suicide. Ochs has also influenced Greek folk-rock songwriters; Dimitris Panagopoulos&#x27; &quot;Astathis Isoropia&quot; (&quot;Unstable Equilibrium&quot;) (1987) was dedicated to his memory. On the 2005 Kind Of Like Spitting album &quot;In the Red&quot;, songwriter Ben Barnett included his song &quot;Sheriff Ochs&quot;, which was inspired by reading a biography of Ochs. On April 9, 2009, Ochs&#x27; friend Jim Glover performed a tribute to Ochs at Mother&#x27;s Musical Bakery in Sarasota, Florida.

===Popular culture===
Among Ochs&#x27;s many admirers were the short story writer Breece D&#x27;J Pancake and actor Sean Penn. Meegan Lee Ochs, who worked as Sean Penn&#x27;s personal assistant from 1983 to 1985, wrote in her foreword to &quot;Farewells &amp; Fantasies&quot; that she and Penn discussed &quot;over many years&quot; the possibility of making a movie about her father; the plan has not yet come to fruition, although Penn expressed an interest in the project as recently as February 2009.

<text>A prayer wheel, or mani wheel, is a cylindrical wheel (, ) for Buddhist recitation. The wheel is installed on a spindle made from metal, wood, stone, leather, or coarse cotton. Prayer wheels are common in Tibet and areas where Tibetan culture is predominant.

Traditionally, a mantra is written in Ranjana script or Tibetan script, on the outside of the wheel. The mantra Om mani padme hum is most commonly used, but other mantras can also be used.

Prayer wheels sometimes depict dakinis and the eight auspicious symbols (&quot;ashtamangala&quot;). At the core of the cylinder, as the axle of the wheel, is a &quot;life tree&quot; made of wood or metal with mantras written on or wrapped around it. 

According to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, spinning such a wheel will have much the same meritorious effect as orally reciting the prayers.

== Nomenclature and etymology ==
The Tibetan term is a contraction: &quot;&quot; itself is a contraction of Sanskrit &quot;cintamani&quot;; &quot;&quot; is Tibetan for &quot;dharma&quot;; and &quot; or &quot; means &quot;chakrano&quot;.

The common term, “prayer wheel” is a double misnomer. A long strip of rolled-up paper bearing printed or inscribed mantras rather than prayers, per se, is inside the cylinder. The term “mantra mill”, in contrast to “prayer wheel”, is perhaps a better translation of the Tibetan , since a &quot;mill&quot; refers to a turning process that generates a particular output, in this case generating merit.

== Origins and history ==

The first prayer wheels, which are driven by wind, have been used in Tibet and China since the fourth century. The concept of the prayer wheel is a physical manifestation of the phrase &quot;turning the wheel of Dharma&quot;, which describes the way in which the Buddha taught.

Historians, such as , have argued that the prayer wheels developed from Chinese revolving bookcases (), popular among Buddhist monasteries.

According to the Tibetan tradition, the prayer wheel lineage traces back to the famous Indian master, Nagarjuna. Tibetan texts also say that the practice was taught by the Indian Buddhist masters Tilopa and Naropa as well as the Tibetan masters Marpa and Milarepa. Kawaguchi mentions in his book that the prayer wheel originated in the Mani Lhakhang where Je Tsongkhapa invented it.

Prayer wheels originated from ‘The School of Shakyamuni sutra, volume 3 – pagoda and temple’ which states that:
Another theory is that rotating mantras relate to numerous yogic or Tantric practices whereby the Tantric practitioner visualizes the mantra revolving around his or her nadis and especially around the meridian chakras such as the heart and crown. The prayer wheels are a visual aid for developing the capacity for these types of Tantric visualizations.

== Practice ==

According to the lineage texts on prayer wheels, prayer wheels are used to accumulate wisdom and merit (good karma) and to purify negativities (bad karma). In Buddhism, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have created a variety of skillful means (upaya) to help bring practitioners ever closer to realizing enlightenment. The idea of spinning mantras relates to numerous Tantric practices whereby the Tantric practitioner visualizes mantras revolving around the nadis and especially around the meridian chakras such as the heart and crown. Therefore, prayer wheels are a visual aid for developing one&#x27;s capacity for these types of Tantric visualizations.

The spiritual method for those practicing with a prayer wheel is very specific (with slight variations according to different Buddhist sects). The practitioner most often spins the wheel clockwise, as the direction in which the mantras are written is that of the movement of the sun across the sky. On rare occasions, advanced Tantric practitioners such as those of Senge Dongma, the Lion-Faced Dakini, spin prayer wheels counterclockwise to manifest a more wrathful protective energy. As the practitioner turns the wheel, it is best to focus the mind and repeat the Om Mani Padme Hum mantra. Not only does this increase the merit earned by the wheel&#x27;s use, but it is a mind-stabilization technique that trains the mind while the body is in motion. Intoning the mani mantra with mindfulness and the &quot;Bodhicitta&quot; motivation dramatically enhances the effects of the prayer wheel. However, it is said that even turning it while distracted has benefits and merits, and it is stated in the lineage text that even insects that cross a prayer wheel&#x27;s shadow will get some benefit. Each revolution is as meritorious as reading the inscription aloud as many times as it is written on the scroll, and this means that the more Om Mani Padme Hum mantras that are inside a prayer wheel, the more powerful it is. It is best to turn the wheel with a gentle rhythm and not too fast or frantically. While turning smoothly, one keeps in mind the motivation and spirit of compassion and &quot;bodhichitta&quot; (the noble mind that aspires to full enlightenment for the benefit of all beings).

The benefits attributed to the practice of turning the wheel are vast. Not only does it help wisdom, compassion and bodhichitta arise in the practitioner, it also enhances siddhis (spiritual powers such as clairvoyance, precognition, reading others thoughts, etc.).The practitioner can repeat the mantra as many times as possible during the turning of the wheel, stabilizing a calm, meditative mind. At the end of a practice session, there is a Tibetan Buddhist tradition of dedicating any accumulated merits that one may have gathered during practice to the benefit of all sentient beings. Then Om Ah Hum 3 times. This is customary with Tibetans upon completing any Buddhist practice, including the practice of the prayer wheel.

Thubten Zopa Rinpoche has commented that installing a prayer wheel has the capacity to completely transform a place, which becomes &quot;...peaceful, pleasant, and conducive to the mind.&quot;

Simply touching a prayer wheel is said to bring great purification to negative karmas and obscurations.

== Types ==

=== Human-powered ===

==== Handheld wheels ====

The handheld prayer wheel () has a cylindrical, generally sheet-metal body (often beautifully embossed) mounted on a metal shaft or pin set into a wooden or metal handle that turns on a circular bearing commonly made of &quot;Turbinella&quot; (conch) shell. The cylinder itself is affixed with a cord or chain terminating in a small weight allowing it to be spun by a slight rotation of the wrist. The weighted chain, known as a “governor” in Western technology, stabilizes the wheel and keeps it spinning with less input from the practitioner than would otherwise be the case. When the prayer wheel is spun in prayer, the mantras inside become potent with the person&#x27;s intent, allowing the practitioner to accumulate wisdom and merit.

==== Large wheels ====

Prayer wheels larger than human size are to be seen in separate rooms in Tibetan Buddhist temples and can be set in motion by pilgrims. With the help of a small bell the number of revolutions can be counted. The cylinders of fixed prayer wheels are often inscribed with the formula “Om mani padme hum” (meaning “jewel in the lotus”) in ornamental Lantsa (Ranjana) letters.

==== Row installations ====
Many monasteries around Tibet have large, fixed, metal wheels set side by side in a row. Passersby can turn the entire row of wheels simply by sliding their hands over each one. They are set in motion by pilgrims who circumambulate the building in a clockwise direction.

=== Powered by other means ===

==== Water wheels ====

This type of prayer wheel is simply a prayer wheel that is turned by flowing water. The water that is touched by the wheel is said to become blessed and carries its purifying power into all life forms in the oceans and lakes that it feeds into.

==== Fire wheels ====

This wheel is turned by the heat of a candle or electric light. The light emitted from the prayer wheel then purifies the negative karmas of the living beings it touches.

==== Wind wheels ====
This type of wheel is turned by wind. The wind that touches the prayer wheel helps alleviate the negative karma of those it touches.

==== Electric dharma wheels ====

Some prayer wheels are powered by electric motors. , as these electric wheels are sometimes known, contain one thousand copies of the mantra of Chenrezig and many copies of other mantras. The can be accompanied by lights and music if one so chooses.

Electricity can certainly be considered similar to the above sources of energy for PW (water, fire, wind). The merit generated by the PW is due to the power of the Dharma Texts and Mantras; not necessarily the &quot;power&quot; which rotates them. These PW turn all day, all night, all through the year. The Lamas and practitioners who build, maintain and pay for the electricity rightly help to generate and dedicate the merit.

<text>A postage stamp is a small piece of paper issued by a post office, postal administration, or other authorized vendors to customers who pay postage (the cost involved in moving, insuring, or registering mail). Then the stamp is affixed to the face or address-side of any item of mail—an envelope or other postal cover (e.g., packet, box, mailing cylinder)—which they wish to send. The item is then processed by the postal system, where a postmark or cancellation mark—in modern usage indicating date and point of origin of mailing—is applied to the stamp and its left and right sides to prevent its reuse. Next the item is delivered to its address.

Always featuring the name of the issuing nation (with the exception of the United Kingdom), a denomination of its value, and often an illustration of persons, events, institutions, or natural realities that symbolize the nation&#x27;s traditions and values, every stamp is printed on a piece of usually rectangular, but sometimes triangular or otherwise shaped special custom-made paper whose back is either glazed with an adhesive gum or self-adhesive.

Because governments issue stamps of different denominations in unequal numbers and routinely discontinue some lines and introduce others, and because of their illustrations and association with the social and political realities of the time of their issue, they are often prized for their beauty and historical significance by stamp collectors, whose study of their history and of mailing systems is called philately. Because collectors often buy stamps from an issuing agency with no intention to use them for postage, the revenues from such purchases and payments of postage can make them a source of net profit to that agency. On 1 May 1840, the Penny Black, the first adhesive postage stamp, was issued in the United Kingdom. Within three years postage stamps were introduced in Switzerland and Brazil, a little later in the United States, and by 1860, they were in 90 countries around the world. The first postage stamps did not need to show the issuing country, so no country name was included on them. Thus the United Kingdom remains the only country in the world to omit its name on postage stamps; the monarch&#x27;s image signifies the United Kingdom as the country of origin.

== Invention ==
Throughout modern history numerous methods were used to indicate that postage had been paid on a mailed item, so several different men have received credit for inventing the postage stamp.

=== William Dockwra ===
In 1680, William Dockwra, an English merchant in London, and his partner Robert Murray established the London Penny Post. The LPP was a mail system that delivered letters and small parcels inside the city of London for the sum of one penny. Confirmation of paid postage was indicated by the use of a hand &quot;stamp&quot; to frank the mailed item. Though this &quot;stamp&quot; was applied to the letter or parcel itself, rather than to a separate piece of paper, it is considered by many historians to be the world&#x27;s first postage stamp.

=== Lovrenc Košir ===

In 1835, the civil servant Lovrenc Košir from Ljubljana in Austria-Hungary (now Slovenia), suggested the use of &quot;artificially affixed postal tax stamps&quot; using &quot;gepresste Papieroblate&quot; (&quot;pressed paper wafers&quot;), but although civil bureaucrats considered the suggestion in detail, it was not adopted. The &#x27;Papieroblate&#x27; were to produce stamps as paper decals so thin as to prevent their reuse.

=== Rowland Hill ===

In 1836, Robert Wallace, a Member of (British) Parliament, gave Sir Rowland Hill numerous books and documents about the postal service, which Hill described as a &quot;half hundred weight of material&quot;. After a detailed study, on 4 January 1837 Hill submitted a pamphlet entitled &quot;Post Office Reform: Its Importance and Practicability&quot; to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Thomas Spring Rice, which was marked &quot;private and confidential&quot;, and not released to the general public. The Chancellor summoned Hill to a meeting at which he suggested improvements and changes to be presented in a supplement, which Hill duly produced and submitted on 28 January 1837.

Summoned to give evidence before the Commission for Post Office Enquiry on 13 February 1837, Hill read from the letter he wrote to the Chancellor that included a statement saying that the notation of paid postage could be created... by using a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp, and covered at the back with a glutinous wash...&quot; This would eventually become the first unambiguous description of a modern adhesive postage stamp (though the term &quot;postage stamp&quot; originated at a later date). Shortly afterward, Hill&#x27;s revision of the booklet, dated 22 February 1837, containing some 28,000 words, incorporating the supplement given to the Chancellor and statements he made to the commission, was published and made available to the general public. Hansard records that on 15 December 1837, Benjamin Hawes asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer &quot;whether it was the intention of the Government to give effect to the recommendation of the Commissioners of the Post-office, contained in their ninth report relating to the reduction of the rates of postage, and the issuing of penny stamps?&quot;

Hill&#x27;s ideas for postage stamps and charging paid-postage based on weight soon took hold, and were adopted in many countries throughout the world. With the new policy of charging by weight, using envelopes for mailing documents became the norm. Hill&#x27;s brother Edwin invented a prototype envelope-making machine that folded paper into envelopes quickly enough to match the pace of the growing demand for postage stamps.

Rowland Hill and the reforms he introduced to the United Kingdom postal system appear on several of its commemorative stamps.

=== James Chalmers ===
In the 1881 book &quot;The Penny Postage Scheme of 1837&quot;, Scotsman Patrick Chalmers claimed that his father, James Chalmers, published an essay in August 1834 describing and advocating a postage stamp, but submitted no evidence of the essay&#x27;s existence. Nevertheless, until he died in 1891, Patrick Chalmers campaigned to have his father recognized as the inventor of the postage stamp.

The first independent evidence for Chalmers&#x27; claim is an essay, dated 8 February 1838 and received by the Post Office on 17 February 1838, in which he proposed adhesive postage stamps to the General Post Office. In this approximately 800-word document concerning methods of indicating that postage had been paid on mail he states:

:&quot;Therefore, of Mr Hill&#x27;s plan of a uniform rate of postage... I conceive that the most simple and economical mode... would be by Slips... in the hope that Mr Hill&#x27;s plan may soon be carried into operation I would suggest that sheets of Stamped Slips should be prepared... then be rubbed over on the back with a strong solution of gum...&quot;.

Chalmers&#x27; original document is now in the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Postal Museum.

Since Chalmers used the same postage denominations that Hill had proposed in February 1837, it is clear that he was aware of Hill&#x27;s proposals, but whether he obtained a copy of Hill&#x27;s booklet or simply read about it in one or both of the two detailed accounts (25 March 1837 and 20 December 1837) published in &quot;The Times&quot; is unknown. Neither article mentioned &quot;a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp&quot;, so Chalmers could not have known that Hill had made such a proposal. This suggests that either Chalmers had previously read Hill&#x27;s booklet and was merely elaborating Hill&#x27;s idea, or he had independently developed the idea of the modern postage stamp.

James Chalmers organized petitions &quot;for a low and uniform rate of postage&quot;. The first such petition was presented in the House of Commons on 4 December 1837 (from Montrose). Further petitions which he organized were presented on 1 May 1838 (from Dunbar and Cupar), 14 May 1838 (from the county of Forfar), and 12 June 1839. At this same time, other groups organized petitions and presented them to Parliament. All petitions for consumer-oriented, low-cost, volume-based postal rates followed publication of Hill&#x27;s proposals.

== History ==
=== The nineteenth century ===
Postage stamps have facilitated the delivery of mail since the 1840s. Before then, ink and hand-stamps (hence the word &#x27;stamp&#x27;), usually made from wood or cork, were often used to frank the mail and confirm the payment of postage. The first adhesive postage stamp, commonly referred to as the Penny Black, was issued in the United Kingdom in 1840. The invention of the stamp was part of an attempt to improve the postal system in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which, in the early 19th century, was in disarray and rife with corruption. There are varying accounts of the inventor or inventors of the stamp.

Before the introduction of postage stamps, mail in the United Kingdom was paid for by the recipient, a system that was associated with an irresolvable problem: the costs of delivering mail were not recoverable by the postal service when recipients were unable or unwilling to pay for delivered items, and senders had no incentive to restrict the number, size, or weight of items sent, whether or not they would ultimately be paid for. The postage stamp resolved this issue in a simple and elegant manner, with the additional benefit of room for an element of beauty to be introduced. Concurrently with the first stamps, the United Kingdom offered wrappers for mail. Later related inventions include postal stationery such as prepaid-postage envelopes, post cards, lettercards, aerogrammes, and postage meters.

The postage stamp afforded convenience for both the mailer and postal officials, more effectively recovered costs for the postal service, and ultimately resulted in a better, faster postal system. With the conveniences stamps offered, their use resulted in greatly increased mailings during the 19th and 20th centuries. Postage stamps released during this era were the most popular way of paying for mail; however by the end of the 20th century were rapidly being eclipsed by the use of metered postage and bulk mailing by businesses.

As postage stamps with their engraved imagery began to appear on a widespread basis, historians and collectors began to take notice. The study of postage stamps and their use is referred to as philately. Stamp collecting can be both a hobby and a form of historical study and reference, as government-issued postage stamps and their mailing systems have always been involved with the history of nations.

Although a number of people laid claim to the concept of the postage stamp, it is well documented that stamps were first introduced in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 May 1840 as a part of postal reforms promoted by Sir Rowland Hill. With its introduction the postage fee was paid by the sender and not the recipient, though it was still possible to send mail without prepaying. From when the first postage stamps were used, postmarks were applied to prevent the stamps being used again.

The first stamp, the &quot;Penny black&quot;, became available for purchase 1 May 1840, to be valid as of 6 May 1840. Two days later, 8 May 1840, the Two penny blue was introduced. The Penny black was sufficient for a letter less than half an ounce to be sent anywhere within the United Kingdom. Both stamps included an engraving of the young Queen Victoria, without perforations, as the first stamps were separated from their sheets by cutting them with scissors.

The first stamps did not need to show the issuing country, so no country name was included on them. The United Kingdom remains the only country to omit its name on postage stamps, using the reigning monarch&#x27;s head as country identification. Following the introduction of the postage stamp in the United Kingdom, prepaid postage considerably increased the number of letters mailed. Before 1839, the number of letters sent in the United Kingdom was typically 76 million. By 1850, this increased five-fold to 350 million, continuing to grow rapidly until the end of the 20th century when newer methods of indicating the payment of postage reduced the use of stamps.

Other countries soon followed the United Kingdom with their own stamps. The canton of Zürich in Switzerland issued the Zürich 4 and 6 rappen on 1 March 1843. Although the Penny black could be used to send a letter less than half an ounce anywhere within the United Kingdom, the Swiss did not initially adopt that system, instead continuing to calculate mail rates based on distance to be delivered. Brazil issued the Bull&#x27;s Eye stamp on 1 August 1843. Using the same printer used for the Penny black, Brazil opted for an abstract design instead of the portrait of Emperor Pedro II, so his image would not be disfigured by a postmark.

In 1845, some postmasters in the United States issued their own stamps, but it was not until 1847 that the first official United States stamps were issued: 5 and 10 cent issues depicting Benjamin Franklin and George Washington. A few other countries issued stamps in the late 1840s. The famous Mauritius &quot;Post Office&quot; stamps were issued by Mauritius in September 1847. Many others, such as India, started their use in the 1850s, and by the 1860s most countries issued stamps.

Perforation of postage stamps began in January 1854. The first officially perforated stamps were issued in February 1854. Stamps from Henry Archer&#x27;s perforation trials were issued in the last few months of 1850; during the 1851 parliamentary session at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom; and finally in 1853/54 after the United Kingdom government paid Archer £4,000 for his machine and the patent.

The Universal Postal Union, established in 1874, prescribed that nations shall only issue postage stamps according to the quantity of real use, and no living persons shall be taken as subjects. The latter rule lost its significance after World War I.

=== The twentieth and twenty-first century ===

After World War II, it became customary in some countries, especially small Arab nations, to issue postage stamps &quot;en masse&quot; as it was realized how profitable that was.

During the 21st century, the amount of mail—and the use of postage stamps, accordingly—has reduced in the world because of electronic mail and other technological innovations. Iceland has already announced that it will no longer issue new stamps for collectors because sales have decreased and there are enough stamps in stock. In 2013 the Netherlands PostNL introduced Postzegelcodes, a nine-character alphanumeric code that is written as a 3x3 grid on the piece of mail as an alternative to stamps. 
In December 2020, 590,000 people sent cards with these handwritten codes.

== Design ==
When the first postage stamps were issued in the 1840s, they followed an almost identical standard in shape, size and general subject matter. They were rectangular in shape. They bore the images of queens, presidents and other political figures. They also depicted the denomination of the postage-paid, and with the exception of the United Kingdom, depicted the name of the country from which issued. Nearly all early postage stamps depict images of national leaders only.

Soon after the introduction of the postage stamp, other subjects and designs began to appear. Some designs were welcome, others widely criticized. For example, in 1869, the United States Post Office broke the tradition of depicting presidents or other famous historical figures, instead using other subjects including a train and horse.(See: 1869 Pictorial Issue.) The change was greeted with general disapproval, and sometimes harsh criticism from the American public.

=== Perforations ===

Perforations are small holes made between individual postage stamps on a sheet of stamps, facilitating separation of a desired number of stamps. The resulting frame-like, rippled edge surrounding the separated stamp defines a characteristic meme for the appearance of a postage stamp.

In the first decade of postage stamps&#x27; existence (depending on the country), stamps were issued without perforations. Scissors or other cutting mechanisms were required to separate a desired number of stamps from a full sheet. If cutting tools were not used, individual stamps were torn off. This is evidenced by the ragged edges of surviving examples. Mechanically separating stamps from a sheet proved an inconvenience for postal clerks and businesses, both dealing with large numbers of individual stamps on a daily basis. By 1850, methods such as rouletting wheels were being devised in efforts of making stamp separation more convenient, and less time-consuming.

The United Kingdom was the first country to issue postage stamps with perforations. The first machine specifically designed to perforate sheets of postage stamps was invented in London by Henry Archer, an Irish landowner and railroad man from Dublin, Ireland. The 1850 Penny Red was the first stamp to be perforated during trial course of Archer&#x27;s perforating machine. After a period of trial and error and modifications of Archer&#x27;s invention, new machines based on the principles pioneered by Archer were purchased and in 1854 the United Kingdom postal authorities started continuously issuing perforated postage stamps in the Penny Red and all subsequent designs.

In the United States, the use of postage stamps caught on quickly and became more widespread when on 3 March 1851, the last day of its legislative session, Congress passed the &quot;Act of March 3, 1851&quot; (&quot;An Act to reduce and modify the Rates of Postage in the United States&quot;). Similarly introduced on the last day of the Congressional session four years later, the &quot;Act of March 3, 1855&quot; required the prepayment of postage on all mailings. Thereafter, postage stamp use in the United States quickly doubled, and by 1861 had quadrupled.

In 1856, under the direction of Postmaster General James Campbell, Toppan and Carpenter, (&quot;commissioned by the United States government to print United States postage stamps through the 1850s&quot;) purchased a rotary machine designed to separate stamps, patented in England in 1854 by William and Henry Bemrose, who were printers in Derby, England. The original machine cut slits into the paper rather than punching holes, but the machine was soon modified.

The first stamp issue to be officially perforated, the 3-cent George Washington, was issued by the United States Post Office on 24 February 1857. Between 1857 and 1861, all stamps originally issued between 1851 and 1856 were reissued with perforations. Initial capacity was insufficient to perforate all stamps printed, thus perforated issues used between February and July 1857 are scarce and quite valuable.

=== Shapes and materials ===
In addition to the most common rectangular shape, stamps have been issued in geometric (circular, triangular and pentagonal) and irregular shapes. The United States issued its first circular stamp in 2000 as a hologram of the Earth. Sierra Leone and Tonga have issued stamps in the shapes of fruit. Stamps that are printed on sheets are generally separated by perforations, though, more recently, with the advent of gummed stamps that do not have to be moistened prior to affixing them, designs can incorporate smooth edges (although a purely decorative perforated edge is often present).

Stamps are most commonly made from paper designed specifically for them, and are printed in sheets, rolls, or small booklets. Less commonly, postage stamps are made of materials other than paper, such as embossed foil (sometimes of gold). Switzerland made a stamp that contained a bit of lace and one of wood. The United States produced one of plastic. East Germany issued a stamp of synthetic chemicals. In the Netherlands a stamp was made of silver foil. Bhutan issued one with its national anthem on a playable record.

===Graphic characteristics ===

The subjects found on the face of postage stamps are generally what defines a particular stamp issue to the public and are often a reason why they are saved by collectors or history enthusiasts. Graphical subjects found on postage stamps have ranged from the early portrayals of kings, queens and presidents to later depictions of ships, birds and satellites, famous people, historical events, comics, dinosaurs, hobbies (knitting, stamp collecting), sports, holiday themes, and a plethora of other subjects too numerous to list.

Artists, designers, engravers and administrative officials are involved with the choice of subject matter and the method of printing stamps. Early stamp images were almost always produced from an engraving—a design etched into a steel die, which was then hardened and whose impression was transferred to a printing plate. Using an &quot;engraved&quot; image was deemed a more secure way of printing stamps as it was nearly impossible to counterfeit a finely detailed image with raised lines for anyone but a master engraver. In the mid-20th century, stamp issues produced by other forms of printing began to emerge, such as lithography, photogravure, intaglio and web offset printing. These later printing methods were less expensive and typically produced images of lesser quality.

===Scents===
Occasionally, postal authorities issue novelty &quot;scented&quot; or &quot;aromatic&quot; stamps which contain a scent, more readily apparent when rubbed. The effect is achieved by using ink which contains microcapsules that provide the desired fragrance when broken. The scent usually only lasts for a limited time after production, such as a few months or years. Such stamps are usually related to aromatic subjects including coffee, roses, grapes, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, pine needles or freshly baked bread. The first scented stamps were issued by Bhutan in 1973.

== Types ==

* Airmail stamp – for payment of airmail service. The term &quot;airmail&quot; or an equivalent is usually printed on special airmail stamps. Airmail stamps typically depict images of airplanes and/or famous pilots and were used when airmail was a special type of mail delivery separate from mail delivered by train, ship or automobile. Aside from mail with local destinations, today almost all other mail is transported by aircraft and thus airmail is now the standard method of delivery. Scott has a separate category and listing for United States Airmail Postage. Prior to 1940, the Scott Catalogue did not have a special designation for airmail stamps. The various major stamp catalogs have different numbering systems and may not always list airmail stamps the same way.
* &quot;ATM stamp –&quot; stamps dispensed by automates and have their value imprinted only at the time of purchase
* Booklet stamp – stamps produced and issued in booklet format
* Carrier&#x27;s stamp
* Certified mail stamp
* Cinderella stamp (see also: Poster stamp)
* Coil stamps – tear-off stamps issued individually in a vending machine, or purchased in a roll
* Commemorative stamp – a stamp which is issued for a limited time to commemorate a person or event Anniversaries of birthdays and historical events are among the most common examples.
* Computer vended postage – advanced secure postage that uses information-based indicia (IBI) technology. IBI uses a two-dimensional bar code (Datamatrix or PDF417) to encode the originating address, date of mailing, postage and a digital signature to verify the stamp.
* &quot;Customised stamp&quot; – a stamp on which the image can be chosen by the purchaser by sending in a photograph or by use of the computer. Some are not true stamps but technically meter labels.
* Definitive stamps – stamps for everyday postage and are usually produced to meet current postal rates. They often have less appealing designs than commemoratives, though there are notable exceptions. The same design may be used for many years. The use of the same design over an extended period may lead to unintended colour varieties. This may make them just as interesting to philatelists as are commemoratives. A good example would be the US 1903 regular issues, their designs being very picturesque and ornamental. Definitive stamps are often issued in a series of stamps with different denominations.
* Express mail stamp / special delivery stamp
* Late fee stamp – issued to show payment of a fee to allow inclusion of a letter or package in the outgoing dispatch although it has been turned in after the cut-off time
* Local post stamps – used on mail in a local post; a postal service that operates only within a limited geographical area, typically a city or a single transportation route. Some local posts have been operated by governments, while others, known as private local posts, have been operated by for-profit companies.
* Make up stamp – a stamp with a very small value, used to make up the difference when postage rates are increased
* Military stamp – stamp for a country&#x27;s armed forces, usually using a special postal system
* Minisheet – a commemorative issue smaller than a regular full sheet of stamps, but with more than one stamp Minisheets often contain a number of different stamps and often have a decorative border. See also souvenir sheets
* Newspaper stamp – used to pay the cost of mailing newspapers and other periodicals
* Official mail stamp – issued for use by the government or a government agency
* &quot;Occupation stamp&quot; – a stamp for use by an occupying army or by the occupying army or authorities for use by civilians
* Non-denominated postage – postage stamp that remains valid even after the price has risen. It is also known as a permanent or &quot;forever&quot; stamp.
* Overprint – a regularly issued stamp, such as a commemorative or a definitive issue, that has been changed after issuance by &quot;printing over&quot; some part of the stamp. Denominations can be changed in this manner.

* Perforated stamps – While this term usually refers to perforations around a stamp to divide a sheet into individual stamps, it can also be used for stamps perforated across the middle with letters or a pattern or monogram. They are known as &quot;perfins&quot;. The modified stamps are usually purchased by corporations to guard against theft by employees.
* Personalised stamps – allow the user to add their own image
* Pneumatic post stamps – for mail sent using pressurized air tubes, only produced in Italy
* Postage and revenue stamps – stamps which were equally valid for postal and fiscal use
* Postage currency postage stamps used as currency rather than as postage
* Postage due – a stamp showing that the full postage has not been paid, and indicating the amount owed. The United States Post Office Department has issued &quot;parcel post postage due&quot; stamps
* &quot;Postal tax&quot; – a stamp indicating that a tax above the postage rate required for sending letters has been paid. This is often mandatory on mail issued on a particular day or for a few days.
* Poster stamp (see also: Cinderella stamp)
* Self-adhesive stamp – not requiring moisture to stick, self-sticking
* Semi-postal / charity stamp – a stamp with an additional charge for charity. The use of semi-postal stamps is at the option of the purchaser. Countries including Belgium and Switzerland often use charitable fund-raising design stamps which are desirable for collectors.
* Souvenir sheet – a commemorative issue in large format valid for postage often containing a perforated or imperforate stamp as part of its design See also minisheet.
* Specimen stamp – sent to postmasters and postal administrations so that they are able to identify valid stamps and to avoid forgeries
* Test stamp – a label not valid for postage, used by postal authorities to test sorting and cancelling machines or machines that can detect a stamp on an envelope. May also be known as dummy or training stamps
* Variable value stamps - dispensed by machines that print the cost of the postage at the time the stamp is dispensed
* War tax stamp – a variation on the postal tax stamp to defray the cost of war
* Water-activated stamp – For many years, water-activated stamps were the only type available, so this term entered into use with the advent of self-adhesive stamps. The adhesive or gum on a water-activated stamp must be moistened (usually by licking, thus the stamps are also known as &quot;lick and stick&quot;).

Apart from these, there are also revenue stamps (used to collect taxes or fees on items like documents, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, hunting licenses, and medicines) and telegraph stamps (for sending telegrams), which fall in a separate category from postage stamps.

== First day covers ==

Postage stamps are first issued on a specific date, often referred to as the &quot;First day of issue.&quot; A &quot;first day cover&quot; usually consists of an envelope, a postage stamp and a postmark with the date of the stamp&#x27;s first day of issue thereon. Starting in the mid-20th century some countries began assigning the first day of issue to a place associated with the subject of the stamp design, such as a specific town or city. There are two basic types of &quot;First Day Covers&quot; (FDCs) noted by collectors. The first and often most desirable type among advanced collectors is a cover sent through the mail in the course of everyday usage, without the intention of the envelope and stamp ever being retrieved and collected. The second type of FDC is often referred to as &quot;Philatelic&quot;, that is, an envelope and stamp sent by someone with the intention of retrieving and collecting the mailed item at a later time and place. The envelope used for this type of FDC often bears a printed design or cachet of its own in correspondence with the stamp&#x27;s subject and is usually printed well in advance of the first day of issue date. The latter type of FDC is usually far more common; it is usually inexpensive and relatively easy to acquire. Covers which were sent without any secondary purpose are considered &quot;non-philatelic&quot; and often are much more challenging to find and collect.

== Souvenir or miniature sheets ==

Postage stamps are sometimes issued in souvenir sheets or miniature sheets containing one or a small number of stamps. Souvenir sheets typically include additional artwork or information printed on the selvage, the border surrounding the stamps. Sometimes the stamps make up a greater picture. Some countries, and some issues, are produced as individual stamps as well as sheets.

== Stamp collecting ==


Stamp collecting is a hobby. Collecting is not the same as philately, which is defined as the study of stamps. The creation of a valuable or comprehensive collection, however, may require some philatelic knowledge.

Stamp collectors are an important source of revenue for some small countries that create limited runs of elaborate stamps designed mainly to be bought by stamp collectors. The stamps produced by these countries may far exceed their postal needs. Hundreds of countries, each producing scores of different stamps each year, resulted in 400,000 different types of stamps in existence by 2000. Annual world output averages about 10,000 types.

Some countries authorize the production of postage stamps that have no postal use, but are intended instead solely for collectors. Other countries issue large numbers of low denomination stamps that are bundled together in starter packs for new collectors. &quot;Official reprints&quot; are often printed by companies who have purchased or contracted for those rights and such reprints see no postal use. All of these stamps are often found &quot;canceled to order&quot;, meaning they are postmarked without ever having passed through the postal system. Most national post offices produce stamps that would not be produced if there were no collectors, some to a far more prolific degree than others.

Sales of stamps to collectors who do not use them for mailing can result in large profits. Examples of excessive issues have been the stamps produced by Nicholas F. Seebeck and stamps produced for the component states of the United Arab Emirates. Seebeck operated in the 1890s as an agent of Hamilton Bank Note Company. He approached Latin American countries with an offer to produce their entire postage stamp needs for free. In return. he would have exclusive rights to market stamps to collectors. Each year a new issue would be produced, but would expire at the end of the year. This assured Seebeck of a continuing supply of remainders. In the 1960s, printers such as the Barody Stamp Company contracted to produce stamps for the separate Emirates and other countries. The sparse population of the desert states made it wholly unlikely that many of these stamps would ever be used for mailing purposes, and earned them the name of the &quot;sand dune&quot; countries.

<text>The Ponte Vecchio (; &quot;Old Bridge&quot;) is a medieval stone closed-spandrel segmental arch bridge over the Arno, in Florence, Italy. The only bridge in Florence spared from destruction during World War II, it is noted for the shops built along it; building shops on such bridges was once a common practice. Butchers, tanners, and farmers initially occupied the shops; the present tenants are jewellers, art dealers, and souvenir sellers. The Ponte Vecchio&#x27;s two neighbouring bridges are the Ponte Santa Trinita and the Ponte alle Grazie.

The bridge connects Via Por Santa Maria (Lungarno degli Acciaiuoli and Lungarno degli Archibusieri) to Via de&#x27; Guicciardini (Borgo San Jacopo and Via de&#x27; Bardi).

The name was given to what was the oldest Florentine bridge when the Ponte alla Carraia was built, then called in contrast to the old one. Beyond the historical value, the bridge over time has played a central role in the city road system, starting from when it connected the Roman Florentia with the Via Cassia Nova commissioned by the emperor Hadrian in 123 AD.

In contemporary times, despite being closed to vehicular traffic, the bridge is crossed by a considerable pedestrian flow generated both by its fame and by the fact that it connects places of high tourist interest on the two banks of the river: Piazza del Duomo, Piazza della Signoria on one side with the area of Palazzo Pitti and Santo Spirito in the Oltrarno.

The bridge appears in the list drawn up in 1901 by the General Directorate of Antiquities and Fine Arts, as a monumental building to be considered national artistic heritage.

==History and construction==
The bridge spans the Arno at its narrowest point where it is believed that a bridge was first built in Roman times, when the via Cassia crossed the river at this point. The Roman piers were of stone, the superstructure of wood. The bridge first appears in a document of 996 and was destroyed by a flood in 1117 and reconstructed in stone. In 1218 the Ponte alla Carraia, a wooden structure, was established nearby which led to it being referred to as &quot;Ponte Nuovo&quot; relative to the older (Vecchio) structure. It was swept away again in 1333 except for two of its central piers, as noted by Giovanni Villani in his &quot;Nuova Cronica&quot;. It was rebuilt in 1345.

This location marks one of the earliest crossings of the Arno in Florence, possibly originating from Roman times or even before. Although floods have repeatedly damaged it, the current bridge has stood since approximately 1339-1345. For many years, the only older bridge in the city was the Rubaconte bridge, built nearly a century earlier. But after significant 19th-century modifications and its destruction in 1944, the Ponte Vecchio claimed its title as the oldest bridge in Florence.

Giorgio Vasari recorded the traditional view of his day that attributed its design to Taddeo Gaddi— besides Giotto one of the few artistic names of the trecento still recalled two hundred years later. Modern historians present Neri di Fioravanti as a possible candidate as the builder.

Sheltered in a little loggia at the central opening of the bridge is a weathered dedication stone, which once read &quot;Nel trentatrè dopo il mille-trecento, il ponte cadde, per diluvio dell&#x27; acque: poi dieci anni, come al Comun piacque, rifatto fu con questo adornamento&quot;. The Torre dei Mannelli was built at the southeast corner of the bridge to defend it.

The bridge consists of three segmental arches: the main arch has a span of , and the two side arches each span . The rise of the arches is between 3.5 and 4.4 metres (11½ to 14½ feet), and the span-to-rise ratio is 5:1. The shallow segmental arches, which require fewer piers than the semicircular arch traditionally used by Romans, enabled ease of access and navigation for animal-drawn carts. Another notable design element is the large piazza at the center of the bridge that Leon Battista Alberti described as a prominent ornament in the city.

A stone with an inscription from Dante (&quot;Paradiso&quot; xvi. 140-7) records the spot at the entrance to the bridge where Buondelmonte de&#x27; Buondelmonti was murdered by the Amidei clan in 1215, which began the urban fighting of the Guelfs and Ghibellines.

The bridge has always hosted shops and merchants who displayed their goods on tables before their premises, after authorization by the Bargello (a sort of a lord mayor, a magistrate and a police authority).

== Later additions and changes ==

In order to connect the Palazzo Vecchio (Florence&#x27;s town hall) with the Palazzo Pitti, in 1565 Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici had Giorgio Vasari build the Vasari Corridor, part of which runs above the Ponte Vecchio.

To enhance the prestige and clean up the bridge, a decree was made in 1565 that excluded butchers from this bridge (only goldsmiths and jewellers are allowed) that is in effect to this day. The association of butchers had monopolized the shops on the bridge since 1442.

The back shops (&quot;retrobotteghe&quot;) that may be seen from upriver were added in the seventeenth century.

==20th century==
In 1900, to honour and mark the fourth century of the birth of the great Florentine sculptor and master goldsmith Benvenuto Cellini, the leading goldsmiths of the bridge commissioned the Florentine sculptor, Raffaello Romanelli, to create a bronze bust of Cellini to stand atop a fountain in the middle of the Eastern side of the bridge, where it stands to this day.

During World War II, the Ponte Vecchio was not destroyed by the German army during their retreat at the advance of the British 8th Army on 4 August 1944, unlike all the other bridges in Florence. This was, according to many locals and tour guides, because of an express order by Hitler. Access to the Ponte Vecchio was, however, obstructed by the destruction of the buildings at both ends of the bridge, which have since been rebuilt using a combination of original and modern designs.

The bridge was severely damaged in the 1966 flood of the Arno.

Between 2005 and 2006, 5,500 padlocks, known as love locks, which were attached to the railings around the bust of Cellini, were removed by the city council. According to the council, the padlocks were aesthetically displeasing and damaged the bust and its railings. There is now a fine for attaching love locks to the bridge.

An announcement in April 2024 stated that work would be completed on the bridge, including a cleaning, an upgrade of the replacement joints previously installed, strengthening of the stone and restoration of the footpath&#x27;s stone.

<text>Porto Ottiolu is a private marina and a tourist destination located in the comune of Budoni, Province of Sassari, 
Sardinia, Italy, on Tyrrhenian Sea, about 35 km south of Olbia. In the past the area was known because there the legions of the Roman commander &quot;Brizio&quot; defeated the bloodthirsty &quot;Sheriff of Porto Ottiolu&quot;.

==Overview==
It was built in 1988 in the place in where was once the ancient Roman port of &quot;Portiolum,&quot; and after its immediate success, a huge village was built around it with the same name.

The marina can host 405 boats in 8 classes and has complete services. It is the largest marina of the East coast of Sardinia.

In its waters, apneist diver Gianluca Genoni repeatedly scored new world records.

Other activities include fishing.

<doc id="25134" wikidata="Q897509" url="?curid=25134" title="Peenemünde Army Research Center">
<text>The Peenemünde Army Research Center (, HVP) was founded in 1937 as one of five military proving grounds under the German Army Weapons Office (&quot;Heereswaffenamt&quot;). Several German guided missiles and rockets of World War II were developed by the HVP, including the V-2 rocket. The works were attacked by the British in Operation Crossbow from August 1943, before falling to the Soviets in May 1945.

==History==
On April 2, 1936, the aviation ministry paid 750,000 reichsmarks to the town of Wolgast for the whole Northern peninsula of the Baltic island of Usedom. By the middle of 1938, the Army facility had been separated from the Luftwaffe facility and was nearly complete, with personnel moved from Kummersdorf. The Army Research Center (&quot;Peenemünde Ost&quot;) consisted of &quot;Werk Ost&quot; and &quot;Werk Süd&quot;, while &quot;Werk West&quot; (Peenemünde West) was the Luftwaffe Test Site (), one of the four test and research facilities of the Luftwaffe, with its headquarters facility at &quot;Erprobungsstelle Rechlin&quot;.

==HVP organization==
Major-General Walter Dornberger was the military leader of the V-2 rocket programme and other projects.

Wernher von Braun was the HVP technical director (Dr. Walter Thiel was deputy director until 1943) and there were nine major departments:
# Technical Design Office (Walter J H &quot;Papa&quot; Riedel)
# Aeroballistics and Mathematics Laboratory (Dr. Hermann Steuding)
# Wind Tunnel (Dr. Rudolf Hermann)
# Materials Laboratory (Dr. Mäder)
# Flight, Guidance, and Telemetering Devices (German: BSM) (Dr. Ernst Steinhoff and his deputy Helmut Gröttrup)
# Development and Fabrication Laboratory (Arthur Rudolph)
# Test Laboratory (Klaus Riedel)
# Future Projects Office (Ludwig Roth)
#Purchasing Office (Mr. Genthe)

The Measurements Group (Gerhard Reisig) was part of the BSM, and additional departments included the Production Planning Directorate (Detmar Stahlknecht), the Personnel Office (Richard Sundermeyer), and the Drawings Change Service. Erich Apel was head of a development department, Konrad Dannenberg was Walter Riedel&#x27;s deputy, Kurt H. Debus was engineer in charge at Test Stand VII, and Eberhard Rees managed V-2 rocket fabrication and assembly.

==Guided missile and rocket development==

Several German guided missiles and rockets of World War II were developed by the HVP, including the V-2 rocket (A-4) (see test launches), and the Wasserfall (35 Peenemünde trial firings), Schmetterling, Rheintochter, Taifun, and Enzian missiles. The HVP also performed preliminary design work on very-long-range missiles for use against the United States. That project was sometimes called &quot;V-3&quot; and its existence is well documented. The Peenemünde establishment also developed other technologies such as the first closed-circuit television system in the world, installed at Test Stand VII to track the launching rockets.

According to Walter Dornberger, &quot;Rockets worked under water.&quot; In the summer of 1942, led by Ernst Steinhoff, Pennemünde worked on sea launches, either from launching racks on the deck of a submerged submarine, or from towed floats. Dornberger summarized the launches from a depth of 30 to 50 feet (9 to 15 metres), &quot;A staggering sight it was when those twenty heavy powder rockets suddenly rose, with a rush and a roar, from the calm waters of the Baltic.&quot;

===Aerodynamic Institute===
The supersonic wind tunnel at Peenemünde&#x27;s &quot;Aerodynamic Institute&quot; eventually had nozzles for speeds up to the record speed of Mach 4.4 (in 1942 or 1943), as well as an innovative desiccant system to reduce the condensation clouding caused by the use of liquid oxygen, in 1940. Led by Rudolph Hermann, who arrived in April 1937 from the University of Aachen, the number of technical staff members reached two hundred in 1943, and it also included Hermann Kurzweg of the University of Leipzig and Walter Haeussermann.

===Heimat-Artillerie-Park 11===
Initially set up under the HVP as a rocket training battery (Number 444), &quot;Heimat-Artillerie-Park 11 Karlshagen/Pomerania&quot; (HAP 11) also contained the A-A Research Command North for the testing of anti-aircraft rockets. The chemist Magnus von Braun, the youngest brother of Wernher von Braun, was employed in the attempted development at Peenemünde of anti-aircraft rockets. These were never very successful as weapons during World War II. Their development as practical weapons took another decade of development in the United States and in the U.S.S.R.

===Peenemünde V-2 production plant===

In November 1938, Walther von Brauchitsch ordered construction of an A-4 production plant at Peenemünde, and in January 1939, Walter Dornberger created a subsection of Wa Pruf 11 for planning the Peenemünde Production Plant project, headed by G. Schubert, a senior Army civil servant. By midsummer 1943, the first trial runs of the assembly-line in the Production Works at &quot;Werke Süd&quot; were made, but after the end of July 1943 when the enormous hangar &quot;Fertigungshalle 1&quot; (F-1, &quot;Mass Production Plant No. 1&quot;) was just about to go into operation, Operation Hydra bombed Peenemünde. On August 26, 1943, Albert Speer called a meeting with Hans Kammler, Dornberger, Gerhard Degenkolb, and Karl Otto Saur to negotiate the move of A-4 main production to an underground factory in the Harz mountains. In early September, Peenemünde machinery and personnel for production (including Alban Sawatzki, Arthur Rudolph, and about ten engineers) were moved to the Mittelwerk, which also received machinery and personnel from the two other planned A-4 assembly sites. On October 13, 1943, the Peenemünde prisoners from the small F-1 concentration camp boarded rail cars bound for Kohnstein mountain.

==Operation Crossbow==

Two Polish janitors of Peenemünde&#x27;s Camp Trassenheide in early 1943 provided maps, sketches and reports to Polish Home Army Intelligence, and in June 1943 British intelligence had received two such reports which identified the &quot;rocket assembly hall&quot;, &quot;experimental pit&quot;, and &quot;launching tower&quot;. The Allies also received information about the V-1 and V-2 rockets and the production sites from the Austrian resistance group around the priest Heinrich Maier. The group later discovered by the Gestapo was in contact with Allen Dulles, the head of the US secret service OSS in Switzerland, and informed him about the research in Peenemünde.

As the opening attack of the British Crossbow operations against German rocket weapons, the Operation Hydra bombing raid attacked the HVP&#x27;s &quot;Sleeping &amp; Living Quarters&quot; (to specifically target scientists), then the &quot;Factory Workshops&quot;, and finally the &quot;Experimental Station&quot; on the night of August 17/18, 1943. The Polish janitors were given advance warning of the attack, but the workers could not leave due to SS security and the facility had no air raid shelters for the prisoners. Fifteen British and Canadian airmen who were killed on the raid were buried by the Germans in unmarked graves within the secure perimeter. Their recovery at the end of the war was prevented by the Russians authorities and the bodies remain there to this day.

A year later on July 18, August 4, and August 25, the U.S. Eighth Air Force conducted three additional Peenemünde raids to counter suspected hydrogen peroxide production.

==Evacuation==
As with the move of the V-2 Production Works to the Mittelwerk, the complete withdrawal of the development of guided missiles was approved by the Army and SS in October 1943. On August 26, 1943, at a meeting in Albert Speer&#x27;s office, Hans Kammler suggested moving the A-4 Development Works to a proposed underground site in Austria. After a site survey in September by Papa Riedel and Schubert, Kammler chose the code name Zement (&quot;cement&quot;) for it in December, and work to blast a cavern into a cliff in Ebensee near Lake Traunsee commenced in January 1944. To build the tunnels, a concentration camp (a sub unit of Mauthausen-Gusen) was erected in the vicinity of the planned production sites. In early 1944, construction work started for the test stands and launching pads in the Austrian Alps (code name Salamander), with target areas planned for the Tatra Mountains, the Arlberg range, and the area of the Ortler mountain. Other evacuation locations included:
* Hans Lindenmayr&#x27;s valve laboratory near Friedland moved to a castle near the village of Leutenberg, south of Saalfeld near the Bavarian border.
* the materials testing laboratory moved to an air base at Anklam
* the wind tunnels moved to Kochel (then after the war, to the White Oak, Maryland-located U. S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Ordnance Laboratory)
* Engine testing and calibration to Lehesten

;Thuringia
For people being relocated from Peenemünde, the new organization was to be designated &quot;Entwicklungsgemeinschaft Mittelbau&quot; () and Kammler&#x27;s order to relocate to Thuringia arrived by teleprinter on January 31, 1945. On February 3, 1945, at the last meeting at Peenemünde held regarding the relocation, the HVP consisted of A-4 development/ modification (1940 people), A-4b development (27), Wasserfall and Taifun development (1455), support and administration (760). The first train departed on February 17 with 525 people en route to Thuringia (including Bleicherode, Sangerhausen (district), and Bad Sachsa) and the evacuation was complete in mid-March.

;Occupied Poland
Another reaction to the aerial bombing was the creation of a back-up research test range, the Blizna V-2 missile launch site in southeastern Poland. Carefully camouflaged, this secret facility was built by 2000 prisoners from the concentration camp at the SS-Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager. The Polish resistance Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;) captured an intact V2 rocket here in 1943. It had been launched but didn&#x27;t explode and was later retrieved intact from the Bug River and transferred secretly to London.

==Post-war==
The last V-2 launch at Peenemünde happened in February 1945, and on May 5, 1945, the soldiers of the Soviet 2nd Belorussian Front under General Konstantin Rokossovsky captured the seaport of Swinemünde and all of Usedom Island. Soviet infantrymen under the command of Major Anatole Vavilov stormed the installations at Peenemünde and found &quot;75 percent wreckage&quot;. All of the research buildings and rocket test stands had been demolished.

End of April 1945, a group of more than 450 important rocket scientists from Peenemünde were captured by the U.S. Army in Oberammergau while Wernher von Braun, Walter Dornberger and several others surrendered in Reutte on May 2, 1945. As part of Operation Paperclip, a group of 127 engineers was eventually contracted for the continuation of the work at the White Sands Proving Grounds in the USA. Only a few members of the previous HVP staff, such as Helmut Gröttrup and Erich Apel, signed a contract with the Soviets and were forcibly transferred to the USSR as part of Operation Osoaviakhim in October 1946.

Although rumors spread that the Soviet space program revived Peenemünde as a test range, more destruction of the technical facilities of Peenemünde took place between 1948 and 1961. Only the power station, the airport, and the railroad link to Zinnowitz remained functional. The gas plant for the production of liquid oxygen still lies in ruins at the entrance to Peenemünde. Very little remains of most of the other Nazi German facilities there.

The Peenemünde Historical Technical Museum opened in 1992 in the shelter control room and the area of the former power station and is an anchor point of ERIH, the European Route of Industrial Heritage.

The main turbine hall of the Peenemünde plant has been used a concert venue, including a 2022 performance by the New York Philharmonic orchestra and the Baltic Sea Philharmonic as part of the Usedom Classical Music Festival.

<doc id="25135" wikidata="Q943931" url="?curid=25135" title="Padstow">
<text>Padstow (; ) is a town, civil parish and fishing port on the north coast of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The town is situated on the west bank of the River Camel estuary, approximately northwest of Wadebridge, northwest of Bodmin and northeast of Newquay. The population of Padstow civil parish was 3,162 in the 2001 census, reducing to 2,993 at the 2011 census. In addition an electoral ward with the same name exists but extends as far as Trevose Head. The population for this ward is 4,434.

The geology of the low plateau west of Padstow has resulted in such features as Tregudda Gorge where erosion along the faultline has caused sheer cliffs 
to form; and Marble Cliffs which has alternating dark grey and light grey strata. The Round Hole is a collapsed sea cave.

==History==

In English, Padstow was originally named after Æthelstan who was reported by John Leland to be &#x27;chief governor of privileges onto it&#x27;. was commuted into , , or &#x27;Petrock&#x27;s Place&#x27;, after the Welsh missionary Saint Petroc, who landed at Trebetherick around AD 500. After his death a monastery (Lanwethinoc, the church of Wethinoc, an earlier holy man) was established here which was of great importance until (probably Padstow) was raided by the Vikings in 981, according to the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Whether as a result of this attack or later, the monks moved inland to Bodmin, taking with them the relics of St Petroc. The cult of St Petroc was important both in Padstow and Bodmin.

Padstow is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; (1086) when it was held by Bodmin Monastery. There was land for 4 ploughs, 5 villeins who had 2 ploughs, 6 smallholders and 24 acres of pasture. It was valued at 10 shillings (half of a pound sterling).
In the medieval period, Padstow was commonly called Aldestowe (&#x27;old place&#x27; in contrast to Bodmin, the &#x27;new place&#x27;). or Hailemouth ( being Cornish for &#x27;estuary&#x27;). The modern Cornish form derives from and in a simpler form appears in the name of the Lodenek Press, a publisher based in Padstow.

Padstow had considerable importance in the middle ages as a manor belonging to Bodmin monastery and as the site of a safe haven (one of the few on the north coast). So it became a busy fishing port and the site of nine chapels in addition to the parish church. The manor was leased to the family of Prideaux by the last prior before the dissolution in Henry VIII&#x27;s reign. The town prospered through trade with Ireland and the English and Welsh ports on the Bristol Channel. Later trade was the export of tin, copper, lead, slate, cured fish and dairy produce, as well as the importing of timber from Norway and Sweden, salt and wine from France, and hemp, iron and jute from Russia. In the first half of the 19th century it was a significant port of embarcation for emigrants, particular those bound for Canada. Later on a shipbuilding industry developed with five shipyards though by 1900 this had declined. The North Cornwall Railway reached Padstow in 1899, a large hotel was built and there was a revival of the fishing industry.

The seal of the borough of Padstow was a ship with three masts, the sails furled and an anchor hanging from the bow, with the legend &quot;Padstow&quot;.

The TV archaeology programme &quot;Time Team&quot; filmed in Padstow for the episode &quot;From Constantinople to Cornwall,&quot; broadcast on 9 March 2008.

There are two Cornish crosses in the parish: one is built into a wall in the old vicarage garden and another is at Prideaux Place (consisting of a four-holed head and part of an ornamented cross shaft). There is also part of a decorated cross shaft in the churchyard.

During World War II, in 1940, a single aircraft dropped some bombs on the town, one of which hit and demolished a terrace of houses in New Street, killing three.

==Churches==

The church of St Petroc is one of four said to have been founded by the saint, the others being Little Petherick (or St Petroc Minor), Parracombe and Bodmin. It is quite large and mostly of 13th- and 14th-century date. There is a fine 15th-century font of Catacleuse stone; the pulpit of c. 1530 is also of interest. There are two fine monuments to members of the Prideaux family (Sir 
Nicholas, 1627. and Edmund, 1693): there is also a monumental brass of 1421. The benefice is a rectory: Padstow (St Petroc), St Merryn and St Issey with St Petroc Minor now form a group within the deanery of Pydar.

==Economy==
Traditionally a fishing port, Padstow is now a popular tourist destination. Although some of its former fishing fleet remains, it is mainly a yachting haven on a dramatic coastline with few easily navigable harbours. The influence of restaurateur Rick Stein can be seen in the port, and tourists travel from long distances to eat at his restaurant and cafés. This has led to the town being dubbed &quot;Padstein&quot;, by food writers in the British media.

Plans to build a skatepark in Padstow were proposed and funds were raised to create this at the Recreation Ground (Wheal Jubilee Parc). Construction was completed in 2019.

==Transport==
===Maritime traffic===
Padstow had considerable importance in the Middle Ages as a manor belonging to Bodmin monastery and as the site of a safe haven (one of the few on the north coast). So it became a busy fishing port. Padstow prospered through trade with Ireland and the English and Welsh ports on the Bristol Channel, and during the early 18th Century returned over £100 in duties related to coal imports for both the periods 1708-1710 and 1710-1713, more than any other cornish port except Falmouth. Later trade was the export of tin, copper, lead, slate, cured fish and dairy produce, as well as the importing of timber from Norway and Sweden, salt and wine from France, and hemp, iron and jute from Russia.

In the first half of the 19th century Padstow was a significant port of embarcation for emigrants, particularly those bound for Canada, and during the mid-19th century ships carrying timber from Canada such as the barques &quot;Clio&quot;, &quot;Belle&quot; and &quot;Voluna&quot;; and the brig &quot;Dalusia&quot; were making the journey across the Atlantic. Quebec City was a specific destination recorded and while such vessels brought timber, the offer of cheap travel to passengers wishing to emigrate enticed some to make the journey to Canada. Local shipbuilders also benefited from the quality of incoming cargoes, although shipbuilding had been practiced in Padstow for centuries and the town provided ships for the siege of Calais in 1346. The practice continued, aided by the imported materials, and there five shipyards recorded in the late 19th century though by 1900 this had declined.
The approach from the sea into the River Camel is partially blocked by the Doom Bar, a bank of sand extending across the estuary which is a significant hazard to shipping and the cause of many shipwrecks. A lifeboat station was established in 1827.

For ships entering the estuary, the immediate loss of wind due to the cliffs was a particular hazard, often resulting in ships being swept onto the Doom Bar. A manual capstan was installed on the west bank of the river (its remains can still be seen) and rockets were fired to carry a line to ships so that they could be winched to safety.

There have been ferries across the Camel estuary for centuries and the current service, the Black Tor Ferry, carries pedestrians between Padstow and Rock daily throughout the year.
In 1964, the harbour commissioners regained control of the harbour from the British Transport Commission and then made some improvements to it. The harbour comprises a tidal outer harbour that is used by ships and commercial vessels, and a smaller inner harbour that is popular with yachtsmen. This inner harbour is a half tide dock that uses a &quot;gate-flap&quot; to maintain water levels on an ebbing tide, so that the yachts within stay afloat at all stages of the tide.

===Railway===
From 1899 until 1967, Padstow railway station was the westernmost point of the former Southern Railway. The railway station was the terminus of an extension from Wadebridge of the former Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway and North Cornwall Railway. These lines were part of the London &amp; South Western Railway (LSWR), then incorporated into the Southern Railway in 1923 and British Railways in 1948, but were proposed for closure as part of the Beeching cuts of the 1960s.

The LSWR (and Southern Railway) promoted Padstow as a holiday resort; these companies were rivals to the Great Western Railway (which was the larger railway in the West of England). Until 1964, Padstow was served by the &quot;Atlantic Coast Express&quot;, a direct train service to/from London Waterloo, but the station was closed in 1967. The old railway line is now the Camel Trail, a footpath and cycle path which is popular owing to its picturesque route beside the River Camel. One of the railway mileposts is now embedded outside the Shipwright&#x27;s Arms public house on the Harbour Front.

Today, the nearest railway station is at , three miles southeast of Bodmin. Go Cornwall Bus operates buses to the station.

===Buses===

Padstow is served by bus services 56 from Newquay and 11/11A from Plymouth which also serves Bodmin Parkway as noted above. Both are operated by Go Cornwall Bus and run hourly Monday to Saturday, less frequent on Sundays and Bank Holidays. There is also the Atlantic Coaster from Newquay, run with open top buses and provided by First Kernow.

===Footpaths===
The South West Coast Path runs on both sides of the River Camel estuary and crosses from Padstow to Rock via the Black Tor ferry. The path gives walking access to the coast with Stepper Point and Trevose Head within an easy day&#x27;s walk of Padstow.

The Saints&#x27; Way long-distance footpath runs from Padstow to Fowey on the south coast of Cornwall.

The Camel Trail cycleway follows the course of the former railway (&quot;see above&quot;) from Padstow. It is open to walkers, cyclists and horse riders and suitable for disabled access. The long route leads to Wadebridge and on to Wenford Bridge and Bodmin, and is used by an estimated 400,000 users each year, generating an income of approximately £3 million a year.

==Culture==

===&#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss festival===
The &quot;&#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss&quot; festival is a major tourist attraction. The festival starts at midnight on May Eve when townspeople gather outside the Golden Lion Inn to sing the &quot;Night Song.&quot; By morning, the town has been dressed with greenery and flowers placed around the maypole. The excitement begins with the appearance of one of the &#x27;Obby &#x27;Osses. Male dancers cavort through the town dressed as one of two &#x27;Obby &#x27;Osses, the &quot;Old&quot; and the &quot;Blue Ribbon&quot; &#x27;Obby &#x27;Osses; as the name suggests, they are stylised kinds of horses. Prodded on by acolytes known as &quot;Teasers,&quot; each wears a mask and black frame-hung cape under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. Throughout the day, the two parades, led by the &quot;Mayer&quot; in his top hat and decorated stick, followed by a band of accordions and drums, then the &#x27;Oss and the Teaser, with a host of people – all singing the &quot;Morning Song&quot; – passing along the streets of the town. Finally, late in the evening, the two &#x27;osses meet, at the maypole, before returning to their respective stables where the crowd sings of the &#x27;Obby &#x27;Oss death, until its resurrection the following May Eve.
===Mummers&#x27; or Darkie Day===

On Boxing Day and New Year&#x27;s Day, it is a tradition for some residents to don blackface and parade through the town singing &#x27;minstrel&#x27; songs. This is an ancient midwinter celebration that occurs every year in Padstow and was originally part of the pagan heritage of midwinter celebrations that were regularly celebrated all over Cornwall where people would guise dance and disguise themselves by blackening up their faces or wearing masks. Recently (since 2007), the people of Penzance have revived its midwinter celebration with the Montol Festival which like Padstow at times would have had people darkening or painting their skin to disguise themselves as well as masking.)

Folklorists associate the practice with the widespread British custom of blacking up for mumming and morris dancing, and suggest there is no record of slave ships coming to Padstow. Once an unknown local charity event, the day has recently become controversial, perhaps since a description was published. 
Also some now suggest it is racist for white people to &quot;black up&quot; for any reason. 
Although &quot;outsiders&quot; have linked the day with racism, Padstonians insist that this is not the case and are incredulous at both description and allegations. Long before the controversy Charlie Bate, noted Padstow folk advocate, recounted that in the 1970s the content and conduct of the day were carefully reviewed to avoid potential offence. 
The Devon and Cornwall Constabulary have taken video evidence twice and concluded there were no grounds for prosecution. 
Nonetheless protests resurface annually. The day has now been renamed &quot;Mummers&#x27; Day&quot; in an attempt to avoid offence and identify it more clearly with established Cornish tradition. 
The debate has now been subject to academic scrutiny.

Other similar traditions that use the black-face disguise and are still celebrated within the United Kingdom are the Border Morris dancers, and Molly dancers of the East Midlands and East Anglia.

==Cornish wrestling==
There have been Cornish wrestling tournaments held in Padstow for at least the last 200 years. Tournaments have been held at the Drill Hall, the &quot;Lawn&quot; overlooking the harbour and at the Commercial Hotel.

==Notable people==
*Paul Ainsworth, Michelin starred chef, runs four businesses in Padstow but lives in Palmorla .
* Dr. Humphrey Prideaux, Dean of Norwich, was born in 1648 in Padstow
*Donald Rawe, Cornish publisher, dramatist, novelist, and poet, was born in Padstow. He became a member of Gorseth Kernow in 1970, under the Bardic name of &quot;Scryfer Lanwednoc&quot; (&#x27;Writer of Padstow&#x27;).
*Rick Stein, restaurateur and celebrity chef, owns several restaurants and businesses in the town.
*Enys Tregarthen, author and folklorist.

<text>The Dakar Rally () or simply &quot;The Dakar&quot; (), formerly known as the Paris–Dakar Rally (), is an annual rally raid organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO). The rally is an off-road endurance event. The terrain that the competitors traverse is much tougher than that used in conventional rallying, and the vehicles used are typically true off-road vehicles and motorcycles, rather than modified on-road vehicles. Most of the competitive special sections are off-road, crossing dunes, mud, camel grass, rocks, and erg among others. The distances of each stage covered vary from short distances up to per day. The rough terrain, driver fatigue, and lack of skill usually results in accidents and serious injuries.

The event started at the inception in 1978 of a rally staged from Paris, France, to Dakar, Senegal (hence its name), across several African countries. Between 1992 and 2007 some editions didn&#x27;t start in Paris or didn&#x27;t arrive in Dakar, but the event kept its name. Security threats in Mauritania led to the cancellation of the 2008 rally, and events from 2009 to 2019 were held in South America. Since 2020, the rally has been held in Saudi Arabia. The event is open to amateur and professional entries, professionals typically making up about eighty percent of the participants.

The Mediterranean Rally (also known as Algiers-Cape Town Rally) was a trans-Africa rally run in 5 editions between 1951 and 1961. It evolved from the original mixed road and off-road rally to a fully off-road endurance event, during the pioneer years of trans-Africa rallies.

===Crossing the Sahara===
The race originated in December 1977, a year after Thierry Sabine got lost in the Ténéré desert whilst competing in the 1975 &quot;Rallye Côte-Côte&quot; between Abidjan and Nice and decided that the desert would be a good location for a regular rally, on the lines of the 1974 London–Sahara–Munich World Cup Rally, the first automobile race to cross the Sahara Desert twice.

In 1971, ex-Cream drummer Ginger Baker used the unproven Range Rover to drive from Algeria to Lagos, Nigeria to set up a recording studio and jam with Fela Kuti. Predating the Paris-Dakar Rally the subsequent documentary is replete with such terrain, and documents the vehicle&#x27;s endurance.

===Early growth===
182 vehicles took the start of the inaugural rally in Paris, with 74 surviving the trip to the Senegalese capital of Dakar. Cyril Neveu was the event&#x27;s first winner, riding a Yamaha motorcycle. The event rapidly grew in popularity, with 216 vehicles taking the start in 1980 and 291 in 1981. The privateer spirit of early racers tackling the event with limited resources encouraged such entrants as Thierry de Montcorgé in a Rolls-Royce and Formula 1 driver Jacky Ickx with actor Claude Brasseur in a Citroën CX, in the 1981 race won by two-time winner Hubert Auriol.

In 1982, there were 382 racers, more than double the number that took the start in 1979. Neveu won the event for a third time, this time riding a Honda motorcycle, while victory in the car class went to the Marreau brothers, driving a privately entered Renault 20. Auriol captured his second bikes class victory in 1983, the first year that Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi competed in the rally, beginning an association that would last until 2009.

At the behest of 1983 car class winner Jacky Ickx, Porsche entered the Dakar in 1984, with the total number of entries now at 427. The German marque won the event at their first attempt courtesy of René Metge, who had previously won in the car category in 1981, whilst Ickx finished sixth. Gaston Rahier meanwhile continued BMW&#x27;s success in the motorcycle category with back-to-back wins in 1984 and 1985, the year of Mitsubishi&#x27;s first victory of 12 in the car category, Patrick Zaniroli taking the spoils. The 1986 event, won by Metge and Neveu, was marred by the death of event founder Sabine in a helicopter crash, his father Gilbert taking over organisation of the rally.

===Peugeot and Citroën domination===

The 1987 rally marked the start of an era of increased official factory participation in the car category, as French manufacturer Peugeot arrived and won the event with former World Rally champion Ari Vatanen. The 1987 event was also notable for a ferocious head-to-head duel between Neveu and Auriol in the motorcycle category, the former taking his fifth victory after Auriol was forced to drop out of the rally after breaking both ankles in a fall. The 1988 event reached its zenith in terms of entry numbers, with 603 starters. Vatanen&#x27;s title defence was derailed when his Peugeot was stolen from the service area at Bamako. Though it was later found, Vatanen was subsequently disqualified from the event, victory instead going to compatriot and teammate Juha Kankkunen.

Peugeot and Vatanen returned to winning ways in 1989 and 1990, the latter marking Peugeot&#x27;s final year of rally competition before switching to the World Sportscar Championship. Sister brand Citroën took Peugeot&#x27;s place, Vatanen taking a third consecutive victory in 1991. The 1991 event also saw Stéphane Peterhansel take his first title in the motorcycle category with Yamaha, marking the beginning of an era of domination by the Frenchman.

For the 1992 event, the finish line moved to Cape Town, South Africa in a bid to combat a declining number of competitors, where GPS technology was used for the first time. Auriol became the first person to win in multiple classes after taking Mitsubishi&#x27;s second victory in the car class, while Peterhansel successfully defended his motorcycle category title. The 1993 rally entry list slumped to 153 competitors, around half of the preceding year&#x27;s figure and around a quarter of that of 1988. The event was the last to be organised by Gilbert Sabine and the Amaury Sport Organisation took over the following year. With the finish line now back in its traditional location of Dakar, Bruno Saby won a third title for Mitsubishi and Peterhansel took a third straight success in the motorcycle category.

The 1994 event returned to Paris after reaching Dakar, resulting in a particularly grueling event. Pierre Lartigue took Citroën&#x27;s second win in acrimonious circumstances, as Mitsubishi&#x27;s leading drivers were forced to withdraw from exhaustion after traversing some particularly demanding sand dunes in the Mauritanian desert that the Citroën crews had opted to skip. Peterhansel&#x27;s did not compete due to a disagreement between Yamaha and the race organizers over the regulations. Edi Orioli claimed a third title in the bikes category. The 1995 and 1996 events begin in the Spanish city of Granada, with Lartigue racking up wins for Citroën in both years. Peterhansel returned to take a fourth bikes category win in 1995, but lost to Orioli in 1996 because of refuelling problems.

===Mitsubishi in the ascendancy===

The 1997 rally ran exclusively in Africa for the first time, with the route running from Dakar to Agadez, Niger and back to Dakar. Citroën&#x27;s withdrawal due to a rule change paved the way for Mitsubishi to take a fourth victory. Japan&#x27;s Kenjiro Shinozuka became the first non-European to win the event. Peterhansel equalled Neveu&#x27;s record of five motorcycle category wins in 1997, before going one better in 1998, when the event returned to its traditional Paris-Dakar route. 1998, Dakar veteran Jean-Pierre Fontenay posted another win for Mitsubishi in the car class.

1999 started in Granada and a maiden success for erstwhile Formula One and sports car driver Jean-Louis Schlesser, who had been constructing his own buggies since 1992. With the help of Renault backing, Schlesser overcame the works Mitsubishi and Nissan crews to win, whilst Peterhansel&#x27;s decision to switch to the car category allowed Richard Sainct to take BMW&#x27;s first title in the bikes category since 1985. Schlesser and Sainct both successfully defended their titles in 2000, traversing the route from Dakar to the Egyptian capital of Cairo.

2001 was the final time that the rally used the familiar Paris-Dakar route, and was notable for Mitsubishi&#x27;s Jutta Kleinschmidt, as she was the first woman to win the rally – albeit only after Schlesser was penalised one hour for unsportsmanlike conduct. Fabrizio Meoni took the first Dakar win for Austrian manufacturer KTM, beginning a winning streak that lasted through 2019. The 2002 began in the French town of Arras and long-time Dakar participant Hiroshi Masuoka won the event for Mitsubishi (Masouka had led for much of the previous year&#x27;s rally.) The 2003 rally featured an unorthodox route from Marseille to Sharm El Sheikh. Masuoka defend his title after teammate and long-time leader Peterhansel was plagued by mechanical problems in the penultimate stage. Sainct meanwhile took honours in the motorcycle category, the third title for both him and KTM.

===Mid-2000s===
By 2004, the entry list had increased to 595, up from 358 in 2001, with a record 688 competitors starting in 2005. Alongside Mitsubishi and Nissan, Volkswagen now boasted a full factory effort, while Schlesser&#x27;s Ford-powered buggies and BMWs of the German X-raid team proved thorns in the side of the big budget works teams. The 2004 route was from Clermont-Ferrand to Dakar, and was the year Peterhansel emulated Hubert Auriol&#x27;s feat of winning the rally on both two wheels and four. The Frenchman defended his title in 2005, when the rally began for the first time in Barcelona. In the bikes category, KTM continued their success with Nani Roma in 2004, who switched to the car category the following year, and Cyril Despres in 2005.

The 2006 event moved to Lisbon. Nissan pulled out having failed to provide effective opposition to Mitsubishi, who took a sixth consecutive victory, this time with former skiing champion Luc Alphand after Peterhansel committed a series of errors late in the rally. Peterhansel made amends in 2007, however, taking his third title in the car category for Mitsubishi after a close contest with Alphand after the increasingly competitive Volkswagens retired with mechanical problems. In what would be the final African event of the Dakar, Despres took his second title in the bikes category, having conceded victory in 2006 to Marc Coma after suffering an injury.

===2008 Dakar Rally cancelled===
The 2008 event, due to start in Lisbon, was cancelled on 4 January 2008 amid fears of attacks in Mauritania following the 2007 killing of four French tourists. Chile and Argentina offered to host subsequent events, which were later accepted by the ASO for the 2009 event.

Later in the year the ASO created a new event, the 2008 Central Europe Rally, to fill the void created by the cancellation of 2008 edition of the Dakar. All entries for 2008 Dakar were allowed to participate in this event held in Hungary and Romania. It was intended to be part of a series known as the Dakar Series.

===South America===

The 2009 event, the first held in South America with a respectable 501 competitors, saw Volkswagen take its first win in the Dakar as a works entrant courtesy of Giniel de Villiers. Initially, teammate and former WRC champion Carlos Sainz led the race comfortably until crashing out, but went on to win the event in 2010. After a poor showing in 2009, Mitsubishi withdrew from the competition and left Volkswagen as the sole works entrant. The German marque won the race for a third time in 2011, this time with Nasser Al-Attiyah, before they withdrew to focus on their upcoming WRC entry and leaving the Dakar with no factory participants in the car class. In the bikes, Despres and Coma stretched KTM&#x27;s incredible unbroken run of success. Both tied on three victories apiece after Coma&#x27;s third win in 2011.

In the 2012 rally, the X-raid team came to the fore, now using Minis in lieu of BMWs. Peterhansel had joined the team in 2010 after Mitsubishi&#x27;s departure, but had been unable to challenge the Volkswagen drivers. Following Volkswagen&#x27;s withdrawal, Peterhansel was able to secure his fourth win in the car category and his tenth in total, his main opposition coming from within his own team. Peterhansel successfully defended his title in 2013 as the Damen Jefferies buggies of Sainz and Al-Attiyah failed to last the distance. Despres also racked up a further two wins for KTM in the bikes class in 2012 and 2013, bringing his tally to five, aided by Coma&#x27;s absence due to injury in the latter year. Coma struck back on his return to the Dakar in 2014, taking a comfortable fourth title and a 13th in succession for KTM, whilst Nani Roma emulated Auriol and Peterhansel by taking his maiden title in the cars class a decade on from his victory on two wheels – albeit only after team orders by X-raid slowed Peterhansel.

Peugeot returned for the 2015 event with an all-new, diesel-powered, two-wheel drive contender, but failed to make an impact as X-raid&#x27;s Minis once more dominated. Al-Attiyah won the event in his second year for the team, while Coma racked up a fifth title in the bikes after the defection of long-time rival Despres to the car class and Peugeot. Peugeot did however see success in 2016 with Peterhansel behind the wheel, racking up his 6th win in the car category, and again in 2017 and 2018 until Peugeot decide to officially leave the competition. In 2019, which was the first Dakar Rally to be held in just one country (Peru), Toyota won for the first time with Nasser Al-Attiyah (in his third victory with three different manufacturers). The bike category saw the KTM works team rider, Australian Toby Price, take his first Dakar victory, winning his second title in 2019. Sam Sunderland and Matthias Walkner won the 2017 and 2018 edition also for the team from Mattighofen (18 overall victories as in 2019).

===Saudi Arabia===
Following the ASO&#x27;s increasingly deteriorating relationships with South American governments, which culminated in the controversial 2019 disqualification of Bolivian quad rider Juan Carlos Salvatierra, the rally has been held in Saudi Arabia since 2020.

Further editions were planned to also feature other Middle Eastern countries starting from 2021, as the contract with the country was only exclusive for the first year. However, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic prevented such an expansion from happening.

==Vehicles and classes==
The five competitive groups in the Dakar are the motorcycles, quads, the cars class (which ranges from buggies to small SUVs), UTVs, and the trucks class. Many vehicle manufacturers use the rally&#x27;s harsh environment as both a testing ground and an opportunity to show off their vehicles&#x27; durability even though most vehicles are heavily modified from their production specification or purpose-built.

===Motorbikes===

For the 2005 rally regulations introduced a limit of 450cc for twin cylinder motorbikes. Single cylinder motorbikes were still open class with no capacity limit.

As of 2011, the engine displacement limit for all motorbikes competing in the Dakar Rally is 450cc. Engines may be either single or twin cylinder. Riders are divided into two groups, RallyGP and Rally2.

A subcategory is the &quot;Original by Motul&quot; category (formerly named &quot;Malle Moto&quot; due to the only piece of luggage competitors were allowed to take with them was a &quot;malle&quot;, the French term for a steamer trunk), which refers to motorbikes and quads competing without any kind assistance. The organization provides assistance for this category with 4 people dedicated to the transportation of the competitors&#x27; gear between bivouac sites plus any additional equipment or belongings. This includes: 1 trunk, 1 set of wheels, 1 sleeping tent, 1 travel bag, 1 set of tyres, free use of the generators, compressors and tool-boxes, and easy access to race information. Since these competitors are not allowed to receive any outside support, each rider must service their own vehicle. It is often called the category for the toughest of the tough, and one for the Dakar purists.

KTM has dominated the motorcycle class in recent years, although Honda, Yamaha, Sherco, Husqvarna, and Gas Gas also compete currently. BMW and Cagiva have also enjoyed success in the past.

===Quads===
Prior to 2009, Quads were a subdivision of the motorbike category, but they were granted their own separate classification in 2009 and are designated Group 3 in the current regulations. They are divided into two subgroups – Group 3.1, which features two-wheel drive quads with a single cylinder engine with a maximum displacement of 750cc, and Group 3.2, which permits four-wheel drive quads with a maximum engine displacement of 900cc, in either single or twin cylinder layout.

Yamaha went unbeaten in the Quad category as an official class, with their main opposition coming courtesy of Honda and Can-Am.

Quads were dropped from the Dakar in 2025 due to declining manufacturer support.

===Cars===

The car class is made up of vehicles weighing less than , which are subdivided into several categories. T1 is made up of &quot;Improved Cross-Country Vehicles&quot;, subdivided according to engine type (petrol or diesel) and drive type (two-wheel or four-wheel drive), while T2 is made up of &quot;Cross-Country Series Production Vehicles&quot;, which are subdivided into petrol and diesel categories. There is also an &quot;Open&quot; category catering for vehicles conforming to SCORE International regulations.

Mini have been the most successful marque in the car category in recent years, thanks to the efforts of the non-factory X-raid team, with limited involvement currently coming from Toyota, Ford and Haval. Several constructors also produce bespoke buggies for the event, most notably SMG and Damen Jefferies.

Mitsubishi is historically the most successful manufacturer in the car class, with Volkswagen, Citroën, Peugeot and Porsche having all tasted success in the past with factory teams. Jean-Louis Schlesser has also won the event twice with his Renault-supported buggies. Factory teams from Nissan and SEAT have also won stages, as has BMW, courtesy of the X-raid team.

===Trucks===
The Truck class, first run as a separate category in 1980, is made up of vehicles weighing more than . Trucks participating in the competition are subdivided into &quot;Series Production&quot; trucks (T4.1) and &quot;Modified&quot; trucks (T4.2), whilst Group T4.3 (formerly known as T5) trucks are rally support trucks – meaning they travel from bivouac to bivouac to support the competition vehicles. These were introduced to the rally in 1998. The truck event was not run in 1989 after it was decided the vehicles, by this stage with twin engines generating in excess of 1000 horsepower, were too dangerous following the death of a DAF crew member in an accident during the 1988 rally.

Kamaz has dominated the truck category since the turn of the century, although it has come under increasing pressure from rivals such as Iveco, MAN, Renault, and Tatra, which enjoyed much success in the 1990s. Hino, DAF, Perlini, and Mercedes-Benz have also been among the winners in the past.

===UTVs===

The utility task vehicle (UTV) category was introduced in 2017. Before this, UTVs ran under the car category as the T3 class. The class rapidly gained in popularity, and in 2021 the class was further subdivided into separate T3 light prototypes category, and T4 SSVs, which are based on production vehicles.

===Classics===
A new Dakar Classic class was introduced in 2021 for cars and trucks manufactured before 2000, or new vehicles built to original pre-2000 specification. For the fifth edition in 2025, rules allowed another five years where 2005 became the latest specification year for the class, effectively making the rule 20 years for classification as classics.

These vehicles share the same bivouac and the organization but run in a parallel, yet different route, suitable for historic vehicles. The scoreboard is not based on fastest time, but rather on regularity rally point scoring system. The class feature a reduced entry fee, yet the same rules and fees apply for the assistance.

==Television coverage==
The rally is broadcast on television in more than 190 countries. A live feed of the event and a roundup of each day&#x27;s race progress is made into a 26-minute programme. This has been commentated on by Toby Moody for ten years, and more recently by Neil Cole.

The rally organizers and their television crews provide 20 edit stations along the route for various countries to produce their own programmes about the rally. There are four TV helicopters, six stage cameras, and three bivouac crews to make over 1,000 hours of TV over the two-week period.

A 2006 television documentary &quot;Race to Dakar&quot; described the experiences of a team, including the English actor Charley Boorman, in preparation for and entry into the 2006 Dakar Rally.

==Incidents==

In 1982, Mark Thatcher, son of the then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, along with his French co-driver Anny-Charlotte Verney and their mechanic, disappeared for six days. On 9 January, the trio became separated from a convoy of vehicles after they stopped to make repairs to a faulty steering arm. They were declared missing on 12 January. After a large-scale search was instigated, an Algerian military Lockheed L-100 (a version of the C-130 Hercules) search plane spotted their white Peugeot 504 some off course. Thatcher, Verney, and the mechanic were all unharmed.

The organiser of the rally, Thierry Sabine, was killed when his Ecureuil helicopter (&quot;Squirrel-copter&quot;) crashed at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday 14 January 1986, into a dune at Mali during a sudden sand-storm. Also killed onboard was the singer-songwriter Daniel Balavoine, helicopter pilot François-Xavier Bagnoud, journalist Nathalie Odent, and Jean-Paul Lefur who was a radiophonic engineer for French radio broadcaster RTL (formerly Radio Luxembourg).

Six people were killed during the 1988 race, three participants and three local residents. In one incident, Baye Sibi, a 10-year-old Malian girl, was killed by a racer while she crossed a road. A film crew&#x27;s vehicle killed a mother and daughter in Mauritania on the last day of the race. The race participants killed, in three separate crashes, were a Dutch navigator on the DAF Trucks team, a French privateer, and a French rider. Racers were also blamed for starting a wildfire that caused a panic on a train running between Dakar and Bamako, where three more people were killed.

In 2003, French driver Daniel Nebot both rolled and crashed his Toyota heavily at high speed killing his co-driver Bruno Cauvy.

In 2005, Spanish motorcyclist José Manuel Pérez died in a Spanish hospital on Monday 10 January after crashing the week before on the 7th stage. Italian motorcyclist Fabrizio Meoni, a two-time winner of the event, became the second Dakar Rally rider to die in two days, following Pérez on 11 January on stage 11. Meoni was the 11th motorcyclist and the 45th person overall to die in the history of the race. On 13 January a five-year-old Senegalese girl was hit and killed by a service lorry after wandering onto a main road, bringing the total deaths to five.

In 2006, 41-year-old Australian KTM motorcyclist Andy Caldecott, in his third time in the Dakar, died on 9 January as a result of neck injuries sustained in a crash approximately into stage 9, between Nouakchott and Kiffa, only a few kilometers (miles) from the location where Meoni had his fatal wreck the year before. He won the third stage of the 2006 event between Nador and Er Rachidia only a few days before his death. The death occurred despite efforts by the event organisers to improve competitor safety, including limiting speed, mandatory rest at fuel stops, and reduced fuel tank capacity for the bike classes. On 13 January a 10-year-old boy died while crossing the course after being hit by a car driven by Latvian Māris Saukāns, while on 14 January a 12-year-old boy was killed after being hit by a support lorry.

In 2007, 29-year-old South African motor racer Elmer Symons died of injuries sustained in a crash during the fourth stage of the Rally. Symons crashed with his bike in the desert between Er Rachidia and Ouarzazate, Morocco. Another death occurred on 20 January, the night before the race&#x27;s finish, when 42-year-old motorcyclist Eric Aubijoux died suddenly. The cause of death was initially believed to be a heart attack, but it was later suggested that Aubijoux had died of internal injuries sustained in a crash earlier that day while competing in the 14th stage of the race.

The 2008 Dakar Rally was cancelled due to security concerns after al-Qaeda&#x27;s murder of four French tourists on Christmas Eve in December 2007 in Mauritania (a country in which the rally spent eight days), various accusations against the rally calling it &quot;neo-colonialist&quot;, and al-Qaeda&#x27;s accusations against Mauritania calling it a supporter of &quot;crusaders, apostates and infidels&quot;. The French-based Amaury Sport Organisation in charge of the rally said in a statement that they had been advised by the French government to cancel the race, which had been due to begin on 5 January 2008 from Lisbon. They said direct threats had also been made against the event by al-Qaeda related organisations.

Omar Osama bin Laden, the son of Osama bin Laden, attracted news coverage in 2008 by promoting himself as an &quot;ambassador of peace&quot; and proposing a horse race across North Africa as a replacement to the Dakar Rally, with sponsors&#x27; money going to support child victims of war, saying &quot;I heard the rally was stopped because of al-Qaida. I don&#x27;t think they are going to stop me.&quot;

On 7 January 2009, the body of 49-year-old motorcyclist Pascal Terry from France was found. He had been missing for three days and his body lay on a remote part of the second stage between Santa Rosa de la Pampa and Puerto Madryn.

On 4 January 2010, a woman watching the Dakar Rally was killed when a vehicle taking part in the race veered off the course and hit her during the opening stage.

On 1 January 2012, motorcyclist Jorge Martinez Boero of Argentina died after suffering a cardiac arrest after a fall. He was treated by medical staff within five minutes of the accident, but died on the way to hospital.

On 7 January 2015, motorcycle rider Michal Hernik died in unknown circumstances during Stage 3 of the 2015 rally.

On 12 January 2020, Portuguese motorcycle rider Paulo Gonçalves died after suffering a heart attack due to a crash on the seventh stage.

On 15 January 2021, motorcyclist Pierre Cherpin of France died. The 52-year-old Frenchman fell off his motorcycle on 10 January, and a rescue team in a helicopter found him unconscious in the desert. He was rushed to a hospital in Saudi Arabia where he was treated for his injuries. He sustained serious head injuries and cracked ribs, and one of his lungs also collapsed. Cherpin underwent emergency neurosurgery and was placed in an artificial coma. Doctors were initially optimistic about his recovery path and there were no complications after the surgery. He died during the medical transfer from Jeddah to France.

Overall, 76 people, including 31 competitors, have died in the Dakar Rally.

==Criticism==
When the race was held in Africa, it was subject to criticism from several sources, generally focusing on the race&#x27;s impact on the inhabitants of the African countries through which it passed. Some African residents along the race&#x27;s course in previous years have said they saw limited benefits from the race; that race participants spent little money on the goods and services local residents can offer. The racers produced substantial amounts of dust along the course, and were blamed for hitting and killing livestock, in addition to occasionally injuring or killing people.

After the 1988 race, when three Africans were killed in collisions with vehicles involved in the race, PANA, a Dakar-based news agency, wrote that the deaths were &quot;insignificant for the [race&#x27;s] organisers&quot;. The Vatican City newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; called the race a &quot;vulgar display of power and wealth in places where men continue to die from hunger and thirst.&quot; During a 2002 protest at the race&#x27;s start in Arras, France, a Green Party of France statement described the race as &quot;colonialism that needs to be eradicated&quot;.

The rally was criticised before 2000 for crossing through the disputed territory of Western Sahara, which has been occupied by Morocco since 1975, without the approval of the Polisario Front independence movement, which considers itself the representative of the indigenous Sahrawi people. After the race officials gained formal permission from the Polisario from 2000 onwards this ceased to be an issue.

The environmental impact of the race has been another area of criticism. This criticism of the race is the topic of the song &quot;500 connards sur la ligne de départ&quot; (&quot;500 Arseholes at the Starting Line&quot;), on the 1991 album &quot;Marchand de cailloux&quot; by French singer Renaud. In 2014, the Dakar rally was criticized for damage done to archaeological sites in Chile.

The move to Saudi Arabia for the 2020 Dakar Rally was under heavy criticism because of the situation of human rights in Saudi Arabia and the position of women in that country.

Despite the criticism from human rights organizations against the choice of host country for the 2020 season, the Dakar Rally was organized in Saudi Arabia for another consecutive year. While it was being denounced as an attempt of sportswashing by Saudi Arabia, the organizers defended the decision.

<text>Perception () is the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in order to represent and understand the presented information or environment. All perception involves signals that go through the nervous system, which in turn result from physical or chemical stimulation of the sensory system. Vision involves light striking the retina of the eye; smell is mediated by odor molecules; and hearing involves pressure waves.

Perception is not only the passive receipt of these signals, but it is also shaped by the recipient&#x27;s learning, memory, expectation, and attention. Sensory input is a process that transforms this low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition). The following process connects a person&#x27;s concepts and expectations (or knowledge) with restorative and selective mechanisms, such as attention, that influence perception.

Perception depends on complex functions of the nervous system, but subjectively seems mostly effortless because this processing happens outside conscious awareness. Since the rise of experimental psychology in the 19th century, psychology&#x27;s understanding of perception has progressed by combining a variety of techniques. Psychophysics quantitatively describes the relationships between the physical qualities of the sensory input and perception. Sensory neuroscience studies the neural mechanisms underlying perception. Perceptual systems can also be studied computationally, in terms of the information they process. Perceptual issues in philosophy include the extent to which sensory qualities such as sound, smell or color exist in objective reality rather than in the mind of the perceiver.

Although people traditionally viewed the senses as passive receptors, the study of illusions and ambiguous images has demonstrated that the brain&#x27;s perceptual systems actively and pre-consciously attempt to make sense of their input. There is still active debate about the extent to which perception is an active process of hypothesis testing, analogous to science, or whether realistic sensory information is rich enough to make this process unnecessary.

The perceptual systems of the brain enable individuals to see the world around them as stable, even though the sensory information is typically incomplete and rapidly varying. Human and other animal brains are structured in a modular way, with different areas processing different kinds of sensory information. Some of these modules take the form of sensory maps, mapping some aspect of the world across part of the brain&#x27;s surface. These different modules are interconnected and influence each other. For instance, taste is strongly influenced by smell.

== Process and terminology ==
The process of perception begins with an object in the real world, known as the &quot;distal stimulus&quot; or &quot;distal object&quot;. By means of light, sound, or another physical process, the object stimulates the body&#x27;s sensory organs. These sensory organs transform the input energy into neural activity—a process called &quot;transduction&quot;. This raw pattern of neural activity is called the &quot;proximal stimulus&quot;. These neural signals are then transmitted to the brain and processed. The resulting mental re-creation of the distal stimulus is the &quot;percept&quot;.

To explain the process of perception, an example could be an ordinary shoe. The shoe itself is the distal stimulus. When light from the shoe enters a person&#x27;s eye and stimulates the retina, that stimulation is the proximal stimulus. The image of the shoe reconstructed by the brain of the person is the percept. Another example could be a ringing telephone. The ringing of the phone is the distal stimulus. The sound stimulating a person&#x27;s auditory receptors is the proximal stimulus. The brain&#x27;s interpretation of this as the &quot;ringing of a telephone&quot; is the percept.

The different kinds of sensation (such as warmth, sound, and taste) are called &quot;sensory modalities&quot; or &quot;stimulus modalities&quot;.

=== Bruner&#x27;s model of the perceptual process ===

Psychologist Jerome Bruner developed a model of perception, in which people put &quot;together the information contained in&quot; a target and a situation to form &quot;perceptions of ourselves and others based on social categories.&quot; This model is composed of three states:

# When people encounter an unfamiliar target, they are very open to the informational cues contained in the target and the situation surrounding it.
# The first stage does not give people enough information on which to base perceptions of the target, so they will actively seek out cues to resolve this ambiguity. Gradually, people collect some familiar cues that enable them to make a rough categorization of the target.
# The cues become less open and selective. People try to search for more cues that confirm the categorization of the target. They actively ignore and distort cues that violate their initial perceptions. Their perception becomes more selective and they finally paint a consistent picture of the target.

=== Saks and John&#x27;s three components to perception ===
According to Alan Saks and Gary Johns, there are three components to perception:

# The Perceiver: a person whose awareness is focused on the stimulus, and thus begins to perceive it. There are many factors that may influence the perceptions of the perceiver, while the three major ones include (1) motivational state, (2) emotional state, and (3) experience. All of these factors, especially the first two, greatly contribute to how the person perceives a situation. Oftentimes, the perceiver may employ what is called a &quot;perceptual defense&quot;, where the person will only see what they want to see.
# The Target: the &quot;object&quot; of perception; something or someone who is being perceived. The amount of information gathered by the sensory organs of the perceiver affects the interpretation and understanding about the target.
# The Situation: the &quot;environmental&quot; factors, timing, and degree of stimulation that affect the process of perception. These factors may render a single stimulus to be left as merely a stimulus, not a percept that is subject for brain interpretation.

==== Multistable perception ====
Stimuli are not necessarily translated into a percept and rarely does a single stimulus translate into a percept. An ambiguous stimulus may sometimes be transduced into one or more percepts, experienced randomly, one at a time, in a process termed &quot;multistable perception&quot;. The same stimuli, or absence of them, may result in different percepts depending on subject&#x27;s culture and previous experiences.

Ambiguous figures demonstrate that a single stimulus can result in more than one percept. For example, the Rubin vase can be interpreted either as a vase or as two faces. The percept can bind sensations from multiple senses into a whole. A picture of a talking person on a television screen, for example, is bound to the sound of speech from speakers to form a percept of a talking person.

== Types of perception ==
=== Vision ===

In many ways, vision is the primary human sense. Light is taken in through each eye and focused in a way which sorts it on the retina according to direction of origin. A dense surface of photosensitive cells, including rods, cones, and intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells captures information about the intensity, color, and position of incoming light. Some processing of texture and movement occurs within the neurons on the retina before the information is sent to the brain. In total, about 15 differing types of information are then forwarded to the brain proper via the optic nerve.

The timing of perception of a visual event, at points along the visual circuit, have been measured. A sudden alteration of light at a spot in the environment first alters photoreceptor cells in the retina, which send a signal to the retina bipolar cell layer which, in turn, can activate a retinal ganglion neuron cell. A retinal ganglion cell is a bridging neuron that connects visual retinal input to the visual processing centers within the central nervous system. Light-altered neuron activation occurs within about 5–20 milliseconds in a rabbit retinal ganglion, although in a mouse retinal ganglion cell the initial spike takes between 40 and 240 milliseconds before the initial activation. The initial activation can be detected by an action potential spike, a sudden spike in neuron membrane electric voltage.

A perceptual visual event measured in humans was the presentation to individuals of an anomalous word. If these individuals are shown a sentence, presented as a sequence of single words on a computer screen, with a puzzling word out of place in the sequence, the perception of the puzzling word can register on an electroencephalogram (EEG). In an experiment, human readers wore an elastic cap with 64 embedded electrodes distributed over their scalp surface. Within 230 milliseconds of encountering the anomalous word, the human readers generated an event-related electrical potential alteration of their EEG at the left occipital-temporal channel, over the left occipital lobe and temporal lobe.

=== Sound ===

Hearing (or &quot;audition&quot;) is the ability to perceive sound by detecting vibrations (i.e., &quot;sonic&quot; detection). Frequencies capable of being heard by humans are called &quot;audio&quot; or &quot;audible&quot; &quot;frequencies&quot;, the range of which is typically considered to be between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz. Frequencies higher than audio are referred to as &quot;ultrasonic&quot;, while frequencies below audio are referred to as &quot;infrasonic&quot;.

The auditory system includes the outer ears, which collect and filter sound waves; the middle ear, which transforms the sound pressure (impedance matching); and the inner ear, which produces neural signals in response to the sound. By the ascending auditory pathway these are led to the primary auditory cortex within the temporal lobe of the human brain, from where the auditory information then goes to the cerebral cortex for further processing.

Sound does not usually come from a single source: in real situations, sounds from multiple sources and directions are as they arrive at the ears. Hearing involves the computationally complex task of separating out sources of interest, identifying them and often estimating their distance and direction.

=== Touch ===
The process of recognizing objects through touch is known as &quot;haptic perception&quot;. It involves a combination of somatosensory perception of patterns on the skin surface (e.g., edges, curvature, and texture) and proprioception of hand position and conformation. People can rapidly and accurately identify three-dimensional objects by touch. This involves exploratory procedures, such as moving the fingers over the outer surface of the object or holding the entire object in the hand. Haptic perception relies on the forces experienced during touch.

Professor Gibson defined the haptic system as &quot;the sensibility of the individual to the world adjacent to his body by use of his body.&quot; Gibson and others emphasized the close link between body movement and haptic perception, where the latter is &quot;active exploration&quot;.

The concept of haptic perception is related to the concept of extended physiological proprioception according to which, when using a tool such as a stick, perceptual experience is transparently transferred to the end of the tool.

=== Taste ===
Taste (formally known as &quot;gustation&quot;) is the ability to perceive the flavor of substances, including, but not limited to, food. Humans receive tastes through sensory organs concentrated on the upper surface of the tongue, called &quot;taste buds&quot; or &quot;gustatory calyculi&quot;. The human tongue has 100 to 150 taste receptor cells on each of its roughly-ten thousand taste buds.

Traditionally, there have been four primary tastes: sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and saltiness. The recognition and awareness of umami, which is considered the fifth primary taste, is a relatively recent development in Western cuisine. Other tastes can be mimicked by combining these basic tastes, all of which contribute only partially to the sensation and flavor of food in the mouth. Other factors include smell, which is detected by the olfactory epithelium of the nose; texture, which is detected through a variety of mechanoreceptors, muscle nerves, etc.; and temperature, which is detected by thermoreceptors. All basic tastes are classified as either &quot;appetitive&quot; or &quot;aversive&quot;, depending upon whether the things they sense are harmful or beneficial.

=== Smell ===

Smell is the process of absorbing molecules through olfactory organs, which are absorbed by humans through the nose. These molecules diffuse through a thick layer of mucus; come into contact with one of thousands of cilia that are projected from sensory neurons; and are then absorbed into a receptor (one of 347 or so). It is this process that causes humans to understand the concept of smell from a physical standpoint.

Smell is also a very interactive sense as scientists have begun to observe that olfaction comes into contact with the other sense in unexpected ways. It is also the most primal of the senses, as it is known to be the first indicator of safety or danger, therefore being the sense that drives the most basic of human survival skills. As such, it can be a catalyst for human behavior on a subconscious and instinctive level.

=== Social ===
Social perception is the part of perception that allows people to understand the individuals and groups of their social world. Thus, it is an element of social cognition.

==== Speech ====

&quot;Speech perception&quot; is the process by which spoken language is heard, interpreted and understood. Research in this field seeks to understand how human listeners recognize the sound of speech (or &quot;phonetics&quot;) and use such information to understand spoken language.

Listeners manage to perceive words across a wide range of conditions, as the sound of a word can vary widely according to words that surround it and the tempo of the speech, as well as the physical characteristics, accent, tone, and mood of the speaker. Reverberation, signifying the persistence of sound after the sound is produced, can also have a considerable impact on perception. Experiments have shown that people automatically compensate for this effect when hearing speech.

The process of perceiving speech begins at the level of the sound within the auditory signal and the process of audition. The initial auditory signal is compared with visual information—primarily lip movement—to extract acoustic cues and phonetic information. It is possible other sensory modalities are integrated at this stage as well. This speech information can then be used for higher-level language processes, such as word recognition.

Speech perception is not necessarily uni-directional. Higher-level language processes connected with morphology, syntax, and/or semantics may also interact with basic speech perception processes to aid in recognition of speech sounds. It may be the case that it is not necessary (maybe not even possible) for a listener to recognize phonemes before recognizing higher units, such as words. In an experiment, professor Richard M. Warren replaced one phoneme of a word with a cough-like sound. His subjects restored the missing speech sound perceptually without any difficulty. Moreover, they were not able to accurately identify which phoneme had even been disturbed.

==== Faces ====
&quot;Facial perception&quot; refers to cognitive processes specialized in handling human faces (including perceiving the identity of an individual) and facial expressions (such as emotional cues.)

==== Social touch ====
The &quot;somatosensory cortex&quot; is a part of the brain that receives and encodes sensory information from receptors of the entire body.

Affective touch is a type of sensory information that elicits an emotional reaction and is usually social in nature. Such information is actually coded differently than other sensory information. Though the intensity of affective touch is still encoded in the primary somatosensory cortex, the feeling of pleasantness associated with affective touch is activated more in the anterior cingulate cortex. Increased blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) contrast imaging, identified during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), shows that signals in the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the prefrontal cortex, are highly correlated with pleasantness scores of affective touch. Inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary somatosensory cortex inhibits the perception of affective touch intensity, but not affective touch pleasantness. Therefore, the S1 is not directly involved in processing socially affective touch pleasantness, but still plays a role in discriminating touch location and intensity.

=== Multi-modal perception ===
Multi-modal perception refers to concurrent stimulation in more than one sensory modality and the effect such has on the perception of events and objects in the world.

==== Time (chronoception) ====

Chronoception refers to how the passage of time is perceived and experienced. Although the sense of time is not associated with a specific sensory system, the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do have a system governing the perception of time, composed of a highly distributed system involving the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. One particular component of the brain, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is responsible for the circadian rhythm (commonly known as one&#x27;s &quot;internal clock&quot;), while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range timekeeping, known as an &quot;ultradian rhythm&quot;.

One or more dopaminergic pathways in the central nervous system appear to have a strong modulatory influence on mental chronometry, particularly interval timing.

==== Agency ====
&quot;Sense of agency&quot; refers to the subjective feeling of having chosen a particular action. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia, can cause a loss of this sense, which may lead a person into delusions, such as feeling like a machine or like an outside source is controlling them. An opposite extreme can also occur, where people experience everything in their environment as though they had decided that it would happen.

Even in non-pathological cases, there is a measurable difference between the making of a decision and the feeling of agency. Through methods such as the Libet experiment, a gap of half a second or more can be detected from the time when there are detectable neurological signs of a decision having been made to the time when the subject actually becomes conscious of the decision.

There are also experiments in which an illusion of agency is induced in psychologically normal subjects. In 1999, psychologists Wegner and Wheatley gave subjects instructions to move a mouse around a scene and point to an image about once every thirty seconds. However, a second person—acting as a test subject but actually a confederate—had their hand on the mouse at the same time, and controlled some of the movement. Experimenters were able to arrange for subjects to perceive certain &quot;forced stops&quot; as if they were their own choice.

==== Familiarity ====

Recognition memory is sometimes divided into two functions by neuroscientists: &quot;familiarity&quot; and &quot;recollection&quot;. A strong sense of familiarity can occur without any recollection, for example in cases of deja vu.

The temporal lobe (specifically the perirhinal cortex) responds differently to stimuli that feel novel compared to stimuli that feel familiar. Firing rates in the perirhinal cortex are connected with the sense of familiarity in humans and other mammals. In tests, stimulating this area at 10–15 Hz caused animals to treat even novel images as familiar, and stimulation at 30–40 Hz caused novel images to be partially treated as familiar. In particular, stimulation at 30–40 Hz led to animals looking at a familiar image for longer periods, as they would for an unfamiliar one, though it did not lead to the same exploration behavior normally associated with novelty.

Recent studies on lesions in the area concluded that rats with a damaged perirhinal cortex were still more interested in exploring when novel objects were present, but seemed unable to tell novel objects from familiar ones—they examined both equally. Thus, other brain regions are involved with noticing unfamiliarity, while the perirhinal cortex is needed to associate the feeling with a specific source.

==== Sexual stimulation ====
Sexual stimulation is any stimulus (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances, and maintains sexual arousal, possibly even leading to orgasm. Distinct from the general sense of touch, sexual stimulation is strongly tied to hormonal activity and chemical triggers in the body. Although sexual arousal may arise without physical stimulation, achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation (stimulation of the Krause-Finger corpuscles found in erogenous zones of the body.)

=== Other senses ===
Other senses enable perception of body balance (vestibular sense); acceleration, including gravity; position of body parts (proprioception sense). They can also enable perception of internal senses (interoception sense), such as temperature, pain, suffocation, gag reflex, abdominal distension, fullness of rectum and urinary bladder, and sensations felt in the throat and lungs.

== Reality ==
In the case of visual perception, some people can see the percept shift in their mind&#x27;s eye. Others, who are not picture thinkers, may not necessarily perceive the &#x27;shape-shifting&#x27; as their world changes. This esemplastic nature has been demonstrated by an experiment that showed that ambiguous images have multiple interpretations on the perceptual level.

The confusing ambiguity of perception is exploited in human technologies such as camouflage and biological mimicry. For example, the wings of European peacock butterflies bear eyespots that birds respond to as though they were the eyes of a dangerous predator.

There is also evidence that the brain in some ways operates on a slight &quot;delay&quot; in order to allow nerve impulses from distant parts of the body to be integrated into simultaneous signals.

Perception is one of the oldest fields in psychology. The oldest quantitative laws in psychology are Weber&#x27;s law, which states that the smallest noticeable difference in stimulus intensity is proportional to the intensity of the reference; and Fechner&#x27;s law, which quantifies the relationship between the intensity of the physical stimulus and its perceptual counterpart (e.g., testing how much darker a computer screen can get before the viewer actually notices). The study of perception gave rise to the Gestalt School of Psychology, with an emphasis on a holistic approach.

== Physiology ==
A &quot;sensory system&quot; is a part of the nervous system responsible for processing sensory information. A sensory system consists of sensory receptors, neural pathways, and parts of the brain involved in sensory perception. Commonly recognized sensory systems are those for vision, hearing, somatic sensation (touch), taste and olfaction (smell), as listed above. It has been suggested that the immune system is an overlooked sensory modality. In short, senses are transducers from the physical world to the realm of the mind.

The receptive field is the specific part of the world to which a receptor organ and receptor cells respond. For instance, the part of the world an eye can see, is its receptive field; the light that each rod or cone can see, is its receptive field. Receptive fields have been identified for the visual system, auditory system and somatosensory system, so far. Research attention is currently focused not only on external perception processes, but also to &quot;interoception&quot;, considered as the process of receiving, accessing and appraising internal bodily signals. Maintaining desired physiological states is critical for an organism&#x27;s well-being and survival. Interoception is an iterative process, requiring the interplay between perception of body states and awareness of these states to generate proper self-regulation. Afferent sensory signals continuously interact with higher order cognitive representations of goals, history, and environment, shaping emotional experience and motivating regulatory behavior.

== Features ==

=== Constancy ===
&quot;Perceptual constancy&quot; is the ability of perceptual systems to recognize the same object from widely varying sensory inputs. For example, individual people can be recognized from views, such as frontal and profile, which form very different shapes on the retina. A coin looked at face-on makes a circular image on the retina, but when held at angle it makes an elliptical image. In normal perception these are recognized as a single three-dimensional object. Without this correction process, an animal approaching from the distance would appear to gain in size. One kind of perceptual constancy is &quot;color constancy&quot;: for example, a white piece of paper can be recognized as such under different colors and intensities of light. Another example is &quot;roughness constancy&quot;: when a hand is drawn quickly across a surface, the touch nerves are stimulated more intensely. The brain compensates for this, so the speed of contact does not affect the perceived roughness. Other constancies include melody, odor, brightness and words. These constancies are not always total, but the variation in the percept is much less than the variation in the physical stimulus. The perceptual systems of the brain achieve perceptual constancy in a variety of ways, each specialized for the kind of information being processed, with phonemic restoration as a notable example from hearing.

=== Grouping (Gestalt) ===

The &quot;principles of grouping&quot; (or &quot;Gestalt laws of grouping&quot;) are a set of principles in psychology, first proposed by Gestalt psychologists, to explain how humans naturally perceive objects with patterns and objects. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into six categories:

# Proximity: the principle of &quot;proximity&quot; states that, all else being equal, perception tends to group stimuli that are close together as part of the same object, and stimuli that are far apart as two separate objects.
# Similarity: the principle of &quot;similarity&quot; states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object and that are different as part of a separate object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their visual texture and resemblance.
# Closure: the principle of &quot;closure&quot; refers to the mind&#x27;s tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape&#x27;s border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps.
# Good Continuation: the principle of &quot;good continuation&quot; makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object.
# Common Fate: the principle of &quot;common fate&quot; groups stimuli together on the basis of their movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured.
# The principle of &quot;good form&quot; refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, color, etc.

Later research has identified additional grouping principles.

=== Contrast effects ===
A common finding across many different kinds of perception is that the perceived qualities of an object can be affected by the qualities of context. If one object is extreme on some dimension, then neighboring objects are perceived as further away from that extreme.

&quot;Simultaneous contrast effect&quot; is the term used when stimuli are presented at the same time, whereas &quot;successive contrast&quot; applies when stimuli are presented one after another.

The contrast effect was noted by the 17th Century philosopher John Locke, who observed that lukewarm water can feel hot or cold depending on whether the hand touching it was previously in hot or cold water. In the early 20th Century, Wilhelm Wundt identified contrast as a fundamental principle of perception, and since then the effect has been confirmed in many different areas. These effects shape not only visual qualities like color and brightness, but other kinds of perception, including how heavy an object feels. One experiment found that thinking of the name &quot;Hitler&quot; led to subjects rating a person as more hostile. Whether a piece of music is perceived as good or bad can depend on whether the music heard before it was pleasant or unpleasant. For the effect to work, the objects being compared need to be similar to each other: a television reporter can seem smaller when interviewing a tall basketball player, but not when standing next to a tall building. In the brain, brightness contrast exerts effects on both neuronal firing rates and neuronal synchrony.

== Theories ==
=== Perception as direct perception (Gibson) ===
Cognitive theories of perception assume there is a poverty of the stimulus. This is the claim that , by themselves, are unable to provide a unique description of the world. Sensations require &#x27;enriching&#x27;, which is the role of the mental model.

The perceptual ecology approach was introduced by professor James J. Gibson, who rejected the assumption of a poverty of stimulus and the idea that perception is based upon sensations. Instead, Gibson investigated what information is actually presented to the perceptual systems. His theory &quot;assumes the existence of stable, unbounded, and permanent stimulus-information in the ambient optic array. And it supposes that the visual system can explore and detect this information. The theory is information-based, not sensation-based.&quot; He and the psychologists who work within this paradigm detailed how the world could be specified to a mobile, exploring organism via the lawful projection of information about the world into energy arrays. &quot;Specification&quot; would be a 1:1 mapping of some aspect of the world into a perceptual array. Given such a mapping, no enrichment is required and perception is direct.

=== Perception-in-action ===
From Gibson&#x27;s early work derived an ecological understanding of perception known as &quot;perception-in-action,&quot; which argues that perception is a requisite property of animate action. It posits that, without perception, action would be unguided, and without action, perception would serve no purpose. Animate actions require both perception and motion, which can be described as &quot;two sides of the same coin, the coin is action.&quot; Gibson works from the assumption that singular entities, which he calls &quot;invariants,&quot; already exist in the real world and that all that the perception process does is home in upon them.

The constructivist view, held by such philosophers as Ernst von Glasersfeld, regards the continual adjustment of perception and action to the external input as precisely what constitutes the &quot;entity,&quot; which is therefore far from being invariant. Glasersfeld considers an &quot;invariant&quot; as a target to be homed in upon, and a pragmatic necessity to allow an initial measure of understanding to be established prior to the updating that a statement aims to achieve. The invariant does not, and need not, represent an actuality. Glasersfeld describes it as extremely unlikely that what is desired or feared by an organism will never suffer change as time goes on. This social constructionist theory thus allows for a needful evolutionary adjustment.

A mathematical theory of perception-in-action has been devised and investigated in many forms of controlled movement, and has been described in many different species of organism using the General Tau Theory. According to this theory, &quot;tau information&quot;, or time-to-goal information is the fundamental &quot;percept&quot; in perception.

=== Evolutionary psychology ===
Many philosophers, such as Jerry Fodor, write that the purpose of perception is knowledge. However, evolutionary psychologists hold that the primary purpose of perception is to guide action. They give the example of depth perception, which seems to have evolved not to aid in knowing the distances to other objects but rather to aid movement. Evolutionary psychologists argue that animals ranging from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge. Neuropsychologists showed that perception systems evolved along the specifics of animals&#x27; activities. This explains why bats and worms can perceive different frequency of auditory and visual systems than, for example, humans.

Building and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive. More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one&#x27;s metabolic resources. Thus, such organs evolve only when they provide exceptional benefits to an organism&#x27;s fitness.

Scientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations. Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world. Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects. Sound waves provide useful information about the sources of and distances to objects, with larger animals making and hearing lower-frequency sounds and smaller animals making and hearing higher-frequency sounds. Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that were significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness. The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain. Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive. An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation. For example, one&#x27;s eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light. Sensory abilities of different organisms often co-evolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.

Evolutionary psychologists claim that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks. For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain are not able to recognize faces (&quot;prosopagnosia&quot;). Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.

=== Closed-loop perception ===
The theory of closed-loop perception proposes dynamic motor-sensory closed-loop process in which information flows through the environment and the brain in continuous loops. Closed-loop perception appears consistent with anatomy and with the fact that perception is typically an incremental process. Repeated encounters with an object, whether conscious or not, enable an animal to refine its impressions of that object. This can be achieved more easily with a circular closed-loop system than with a linear open-loop one. Closed-loop perception can explain many of the phenomena that open-loop perception struggles to account for. This is largely because closed-loop perception considers motion to be an integral part of perception, and not an interfering component that must be corrected for. Furthermore, an environment perceived via sensor motion, and not despite sensor motion, need not be further stabilized by internal processes.

=== Feature integration theory ===

Anne Treisman&#x27;s feature integration theory (FIT) attempts to explain how characteristics of a stimulus such as physical location in space, motion, color, and shape are merged to form one percept despite each of these characteristics activating separate areas of the cortex. FIT explains this through a two part system of perception involving the preattentive and focused attention stages.

The preattentive stage of perception is largely unconscious, and analyzes an object by breaking it down into its basic features, such as the specific color, geometric shape, motion, depth, individual lines, and many others. Studies have shown that, when small groups of objects with different features (e.g., red triangle, blue circle) are briefly flashed in front of human participants, many individuals later report seeing shapes made up of the combined features of two different stimuli, thereby referred to as illusory conjunctions.

The unconnected features described in the preattentive stage are combined into the objects one normally sees during the focused attention stage. The focused attention stage is based heavily around the idea of attention in perception and &#x27;binds&#x27; the features together onto specific objects at specific spatial locations (see the binding problem).

=== Shared Intentionality theory ===

A fundamentally different approach to understanding the perception of objects relies upon the essential role of Shared intentionality. Cognitive psychologist professor Michael Tomasello hypothesized that social bonds between children and caregivers would gradually increase through the essential motive force of shared intentionality beginning from birth. The notion of shared intentionality, introduced by Michael Tomasello, was developed by later researchers, who tended to explain this collaborative interaction from different perspectives, e.g., psychophysiology, and neurobiology. The Shared intentionality approach considers perception occurrence at an earlier stage of organisms&#x27; development than other theories, even before the emergence of Intentionality. Because many theories build their knowledge about perception based on its main features of the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information to represent the holistic picture of the environment, Intentionality is the central issue in perception development. Nowadays, only one hypothesis attempts to explain Shared intentionality in all its integral complexity from the level of interpersonal dynamics to interaction at the neuronal level. Introduced by Latvian professor Igor Val Danilov, the hypothesis of neurobiological processes occurring during Shared intentionality highlights that, at the beginning of cognition, very young organisms cannot distinguish relevant sensory stimuli independently. Because the environment is the cacophony of stimuli (electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations), their sensation is too limited by the noise to solve the cue problem. The relevant stimulus cannot overcome the noise magnitude if it passes through the senses. Therefore, Intentionality is a difficult problem for them since it needs the representation of the environment already categorized into objects (see also binding problem). The perception of objects is also problematic since it cannot appear without Intentionality. From the perspective of this hypothesis, Shared intentionality is collaborative interactions in which participants share the essential sensory stimulus of the actual cognitive problem. This social bond enables ecological training of the young immature organism, starting at the reflexes stage of development, for processing the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information in developing perception. From this account perception emerges due to Shared intentionality in the embryonic stage of development, i.e., even before birth.

== Effects on perception ==

=== Effect of experience ===
With experience, organisms can learn to make finer perceptual distinctions, and learn new kinds of categorization. Wine-tasting, the reading of X-ray images and music appreciation are applications of this process in the human sphere. Research has focused on the relation of this to other kinds of learning, and whether it takes place in peripheral sensory systems or in the brain&#x27;s processing of sense information. Empirical research show that specific practices (such as yoga, mindfulness, Tai Chi, meditation, Daoshi and other mind-body disciplines) can modify human perceptual modality. Specifically, these practices enable perception skills to switch from the external (exteroceptive field) towards a higher ability to focus on internal signals (&quot;proprioception&quot;). Also, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent yoga practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Increasing self-transcendence may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.

Past actions and events that transpire right before an encounter or any form of stimulation have a strong degree of influence on how sensory stimuli are processed and perceived. On a basic level, the information our senses receive is often ambiguous and incomplete. However, they are grouped together in order for us to be able to understand the physical world around us. But it is these various forms of stimulation, combined with our previous knowledge and experience that allows us to create our overall perception. For example, when engaging in conversation, we attempt to understand their message and words by not only paying attention to what we hear through our ears but also from the previous shapes we have seen our mouths make. Another example would be if we had a similar topic come up in another conversation, we would use our previous knowledge to guess the direction the conversation is headed in.

=== Effect of motivation and expectation ===
A &quot;perceptual set&quot; (also called &quot;perceptual expectancy&quot; or simply &quot;set&quot;) is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. It is an example of how perception can be shaped by &quot;top-down&quot; processes such as drives and expectations. Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses. They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one&#x27;s own name in a crowded room, or short-term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food. A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as &quot;sael&quot;. Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as &quot;seal&quot;, but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as &quot;sail&quot;.

Sets can be created by motivation and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous figures so that they see what they want to see. For instance, how someone perceives what unfolds during a sports game can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams. In one experiment, students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer. They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13.

Perceptual set has been demonstrated in many social contexts. When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience is more likely to find them amusing. Individual&#x27;s perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations. In general, perceptual speed as a mental ability is positively correlated with personality traits such as conscientiousness, emotional stability, and agreeableness suggesting its evolutionary role in preserving homeostasis.

One classic psychological experiment showed slower reaction times and less accurate answers when a deck of playing cards reversed the color of the suit symbol for some cards (e.g. red spades and black hearts).

Philosopher Andy Clark explains that perception, although it occurs quickly, is not simply a bottom-up process (where minute details are put together to form larger wholes). Instead, our brains use what he calls &quot;predictive coding&quot;. It starts with very broad constraints and expectations for the state of the world, and as expectations are met, it makes more detailed predictions (errors lead to new predictions, or &quot;learning processes)&quot;. Clark says this research has various implications; not only can there be no completely &quot;unbiased, unfiltered&quot; perception, but this means that there is a great deal of feedback between perception and expectation (perceptual experiences often shape our beliefs, but those perceptions were based on existing beliefs). Indeed, predictive coding provides an account where this type of feedback assists in stabilizing our inference-making process about the physical world, such as with perceptual constancy examples.

Embodied cognition challenges the idea of perception as internal representations resulting from a passive reception of (incomplete) sensory inputs coming from the outside world. According to O&#x27;Regan (1992), the major issue with this perspective is that it leaves the subjective character of perception unexplained. Thus, perception is understood as an active process conducted by perceiving and engaged agents (perceivers). Furthermore, perception is influenced by agents&#x27; motives and expectations, their bodily states, and the interaction between the agent&#x27;s body and the environment around it.

== Philosophy ==

Perception is an important part of the theories of many philosophers it has been famously addressed by Rene Descartes, George Berkeley, and Immanuel Kant to name a few. In his work The Meditations Descartes begins by doubting all of his perceptions proving his existence with the famous phrase &quot;I think therefore I am&quot;, and then works to the conclusion that perceptions are God-given. George Berkely took the stance that all things that we see have a reality to them and that our perceptions were sufficient to know and understand that thing because our perceptions are capable of responding to a true reality. Kant almost meets the rationalists and the empiricists half way. His theory utilizes the reality of a noumenon, the actual objects that cannot be understood, and then a phenomenon which is human understanding through the mind lens interpreting that noumenon.

<text>The pitch of a brass instrument corresponds to the lowest playable resonance frequency of the open instrument. The combined resonances resemble a harmonic series. The fundamental frequency of the harmonic series can be varied by adjusting the length of the tubing using the instrument&#x27;s valve, slide, key or crook system, while the player&#x27;s embouchure, lip tension and air flow serve to select a specific harmonic from the available series for playing. The fundamental is essentially missing from the resonances and is impractical to play on most brass instruments, but the overtones account for most pitches.

The following table provides the pitch of the second harmonic (the lowest playable resonance on most brass instruments, an octave above the fundamental frequency) and length for some common brass instruments in descending order of pitch. This pitch is notated transpositionally as middle C for many of these brass instruments.

==Range==
The normal playing range of most three-valved brass instruments extends from three whole tones below the 2nd harmonic of the instrument to the 10th harmonic. Skilled players can produce tones outside this range. For many transposing brass instruments, this range is written as extending from F♯ below middle C to E two octaves and a third above middle C.

The orchestral horn is an exception as it was classically assigned a range beginning at its fourth harmonic.

===Whole tube vs half tube===
The ease with which a player produces the fundamental note of each harmonic series for each tubing length of a modern brass instrument varies with the instrument&#x27;s design. As bore width increases relative to length, it becomes easier for the player to resist the instrument&#x27;s tendency to jump to the second harmonic instead of producing the fundamental frequency. Brass instruments with sufficient bore to play fundamentals with relative ease and accuracy are called &quot;whole-tube&quot; instruments, while instruments that are limited to the second harmonic as a lowest note in practical use are called &quot;half-tube&quot; instruments. These terms stem from a comparison to organ pipes, which produce the same pitch as the pedal tone (fundamental) of a brass instrument of equal length.

Certain low brass instruments such as trombone, tuba, euphonium, and alto horn are whole-tube and can play the fundamental tone of each harmonic series with relative ease. Furthermore, the low brass often use extra valves to extend their range uniformly, since the fundamental is chromatically discontinuous with the lowest 2nd harmonic reachable on a three-valve instrument or via the seven-position slide on a trombone. Trombone and tuba in particular are often called upon to play pedal tones and &quot;false tones&quot; or &quot;privileged tones&quot; which have a pitch between the normal range and the fundamental.

===Horn===
The modern standard orchestral horn is a double B/F horn. The player can switch between the two modes using a thumb-operated fourth valve. The fundamental pitch of the F horn is near that of the tuba. Horn notation is a complex subject beyond the scope of this article, but what is written as middle C for the horn is the fourth harmonic of the unlengthened instrument, not the second. Horn music makes greater use of the higher range of the harmonic series than do most other modern brass instruments.

===Bass trombone===
The modern bass trombone is the same length as a tenor trombone, but typically has two valves, pitched in F and G♭. When combined, these valves put the instrument into D. The modern contrabass trombone is usually constructed in F and fitted with two valves in either D and B♭ combining to give A♭, or in C and D♭ combining to give A. The less common double slide contrabass in low B♭ is often fitted with a valve in F. All these instruments are notated in bass clef at concert pitch.

===Tuba===

The bass tuba is commonly available in F and E, while contrabass tubas are available in C and B.

<text>Sus () is the genus of domestic and wild pigs, within the even-toed ungulate family Suidae. &quot;Sus&quot; include domestic pigs (&quot;Sus domesticus&quot;) and their ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;), along with various other species. &quot;Sus&quot; species, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents, ranging from Europe to the Pacific islands.

Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs live in complex social groups and are considered one of the more intelligent mammals, as reflected in their ability to learn.

With around 1 billion of this species alive at any time, the domestic pig is among the most populous large mammals in the world. Pigs are omnivores and can consume a wide range of food. Pigs are biologically similar to humans and are thus frequently used for human medical research.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; provides anecdotal evidence as well as linguistic, saying that the term derives

probably from Old English , found in compounds, ultimate origin unknown. Originally &quot;young pig&quot; (the word for adults was &quot;swine&quot;). Apparently related to Low German , Dutch (&quot;but the phonology is difficult&quot; -- &quot;OED&quot;). ... Another Old English word for &quot;pig&quot; was , related to &quot;&quot; &quot;furrow,&quot; from PIE *&quot;perk&quot;- &quot;dig, furrow&quot; (source also of Latin &quot;pig,&quot; see &quot;pork&quot;). &quot;This reflects a widespread IE tendency to name animals from typical attributes or activities&quot; [Roger Lass]. Synonyms &quot;grunter&quot;, &quot;oinker&quot; are from sailors&#x27; and fishermen&#x27;s euphemistic avoidance of uttering the word pig at sea, a superstition perhaps based on the fate of the Gadarene swine, who drowned.

The &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; also traces the evolution of sow, the term for a female pig, through various historical languages:

Old English &#x27;, &#x27; &quot;female of the swine,&quot; from Proto-Germanic *&quot;su&quot;- (cognates: Old Saxon, Old High German &quot;su&quot;, German , Dutch , Old Norse &#x27;), from PIE root *&quot;su&quot;- (cognates: Sanskrit &quot;wild boar, swine;&quot; Avestan &quot;hu&quot; &quot;wild boar;&quot; Greek &quot;hys&quot; &quot;swine;&quot; Latin &quot;swine&quot;, &quot;pertaining to swine&quot;; Old Church Slavonic &#x27; &quot;swine;&quot; Lettish &quot;sivens&quot; &quot;young pig;&quot; Welsh &#x27;, Irish &#x27; &quot;swine; Old Irish &quot;&quot; &quot;snout, plowshare&quot;), possibly imitative of pig noise; note that Sanskrit &quot;sukharah&quot; means &quot;maker of (the sound) &quot;su&quot;&quot;.

An adjectival form is &quot;porcine&quot;. Another adjectival form (technically for the subfamily rather than genus name) is &quot;suine&quot; (comparable to &quot;bovine&quot;, &quot;canine&quot;, etc.); for the family, it is &quot;suid&quot; (as with &quot;bovid&quot;, &quot;canid&quot;).

==Description and behaviour==

A typical pig has a large head with a long snout that is strengthened by a special prenasal bone and by a disk of cartilage at the tip. The snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ. Each foot has four hooves with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, and the outer two also being used in soft ground.

The dental formula of adult pigs is , giving a total of 44 teeth. The rear teeth are adapted for crushing. In the male, the canine teeth form tusks, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.

Occasionally, captive mother pigs may savage their own piglets, often if they become severely stressed. Some attacks on newborn piglets are non-fatal. Others may kill the piglets and sometimes, the mother may eat them. An estimated 50% of piglet fatalities are due to the mother attacking, or unintentionally crushing, the newborn pre-weaned animals.

==Distribution and evolution==
With around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.

The ancestor of the domestic pig is the wild boar, which is one of the most numerous and widespread large mammals. Its many subspecies are native to all but the harshest climates of continental Eurasia and its islands and Africa as well, from Ireland and India to Japan and north to Siberia.

Long isolated from other pigs on the many islands of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, pigs have evolved into many different species, including wild boar, bearded pigs, and warty pigs. Humans have introduced pigs into Australia, North and South America, and numerous islands, either accidentally as escaped domestic pigs which have gone feral, or as wild boar.

==Habitat and reproduction==
The wild boar (&quot;Sus scrofa&quot;) can take advantage of any forage resources. Therefore, they can live in virtually any productive habitat that can provide enough water to sustain large mammals such as pigs. Pigs are famously fecund; when well-fed, a sow can birth twelve or more piglets in her annual litter. If there is increased foraging by wild boars in certain areas, they can cause a nutritional shortage which can cause the pig population to decrease. If the nutritional state returns to normal, the pig population will most likely rise due to the pigs&#x27; naturally-increased reproduction rate.

==Diet and foraging==
Pigs are omnivores, which means that they consume both plants and animals. In the wild, they are foragers, searching through their habitat for food (which, for pigs, often includes digging with their snouts). Wild pigs eat roots, tubers, leaves, fruits, mushrooms, and flowers, in addition to some insects (especially insect grubs) and fish. Pigs are famously fond of truffle mushrooms, which grow underground; pigs find them by scent and unearth them with their snouts. In Europe, trained &quot;truffle pigs&quot; find these valuable fungi for humans. Pigs do not hunt, but will readily eat carrion, eggs, and other animal foods that they can find. As livestock, pigs were once fed all manner of mixed household food scraps (called &quot;slops&quot;), but on large modern farms are now fed mostly corn and soybean meal with a mixture of vitamins and minerals added. Traditionally, pigs were raised on dairy farms and fed any excess milk and the whey left over from cheese and butter making. Pigs brought so much extra income to these farms that they earned the nickname &quot;mortgage lifters&quot;. Older pigs will consume three to five gallons of water per day. When kept as pets, the optimal healthy diet consists mainly of a balanced diet of raw vegetables, although some may give their pigs commercial mini pig pellet feed.

==Relationship with humans==

Most pigs today are domesticated pigs raised for meat (known as pork). Miniature breeds are commonly kept as pets. Because of their foraging abilities and excellent sense of smell, people in many European countries use them to find truffles. Both wild and feral pigs are commonly hunted.

Apart from meat, pig skin is turned into leather, and their hairs are used to make brushes. The relatively short, stiff, coarse pig hairs are called bristles, and were once so commonly used in paintbrushes that in 1946 the Australian Government launched Operation Pig Bristle. In May 1946, in response to a shortage of pig bristles for paintbrushes to paint houses in the post-World War II construction boom, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flew in 28 short tons of pig bristles from China, their only commercially available source at the time.

===Use in human healthcare===

Human skin is very similar to pig skin, therefore many preclinical studies employ pig skin. In addition to providing use in biomedical research and for drug testing, genetic advances in human healthcare have provided a pathway for domestic pigs to become xenotransplantation candidates for humans.

==Species==
The genus &quot;Sus&quot; is currently thought to contain nine living species. Several extinct species (†) are known from fossils.

==Domestication==

Pigs have been domesticated since ancient times in the Old World. Pigs were domesticated on each end of Eurasia, and possibly several times. It is now thought that pigs were attracted to human settlements for the food scraps, and that the process of domestication began as a commensal relationship. Archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern New Guineans from wild boar as early as 13,000–12,700 BP in the Near East in the Tigris Basin, Çayönü, Cafer Höyük, Nevalı Çori. Remains of pigs have been dated to earlier than 11,400 BP in Cyprus that must have been introduced from the mainland which suggests domestication in the adjacent mainland by then.

Pigs were also domesticated in China, potentially more than once. In some parts of China pigs were kept in pens from early times, separating them from wild populations and allowing farmers to create breeds that were fatter and bred more quickly. Early Modern Europeans brought these breeds back home and crossed them with their own pigs, which was the origins of most modern pig breeds.

In India, pigs have been domesticated for a long time mostly in Goa and some rural areas for pig toilets. This practice also occurred in China. Though ecologically logical as well as economical, pig toilets are waning in popularity as use of septic tanks and/or sewerage systems is increasing in rural areas.

Hernando de Soto and other early Spanish explorers brought pigs to southeastern North America from Europe. As in medieval Europe, pigs are valued on certain oceanic islands for their self-sufficiency, which allows them to be turned loose, although the practice does have drawbacks (see environmental impact).

The domestic pig (&quot;Sus domesticus&quot;) is usually given the scientific name &quot;Sus scrofa domesticus&quot;, although some taxonomists, including the American Society of Mammalogists, call it &quot;S. domesticus&quot;, reserving &quot;S. scrofa&quot; for the wild boar. It was domesticated approximately 5,000 to 7,000 years ago. The upper canines form sharp distinctive tusks that curve outward and upward. Compared to other artiodactyles, their head is relatively long, pointed, and free of warts. Their head and body length ranges from and they can weigh between .

In November 2012, scientists managed to sequence the genome of the domestic pig. The similarities between the pig and human genomes mean that the new data may have wide applications in the study and treatment of human genetic diseases.

In August 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. The process of domestication was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. The study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. The study indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in Western Asia and China, with Western Asian pigs introduced into Europe where they crossed with wild boar. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at DNA loci that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.

==In culture==
Pigs have been important in culture across the world since neolithic times. They appear in art, literature, and religion. In Asia the wild boar is one of 12 animal images comprising the Chinese zodiac, while in Europe the boar represents a standard charge in heraldry. In Islam and Judaism pigs and those who handle them are viewed negatively, and the consumption of pork is forbidden. Pigs are alluded to in animal epithets and proverbs. 
The pig has been celebrated throughout Europe since ancient times in its carnivals, the name coming from the Italian &quot;carne levare&quot;, the lifting of meat.

Pigs have been brought into literature for varying reasons, ranging from the pleasures of eating, as in Charles Lamb&#x27;s &quot;A Dissertation upon Roast Pig&quot;, to William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (with the fat character &quot;Piggy&quot;), where the rotting boar&#x27;s head on a stick represents Beelzebub, &quot;lord of the flies&quot; being the direct translation of the Hebrew , and George Orwell&#x27;s allegorical novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, where the central characters, representing Soviet leaders, are all pigs.

==Environmental damage==

Domestic pigs that have escaped from urban areas or were allowed to forage in the wild, and in some cases wild boars which were introduced as prey for hunting, have given rise to large populations of feral pigs in North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii, and other areas where pigs are not native. Accidental or deliberate releases of pigs into countries or environments where they are an alien species have caused extensive environmental change. Their omnivorous diet, aggressive behaviour, and their feeding method of rooting in the ground all combine to severely alter ecosystems unused to pigs. Pigs will even eat small animals and destroy nests of ground nesting birds. The Invasive Species Specialist Group lists feral pigs on the list of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive species and says:

==Health problems==

Because of their biological similarities, pigs can harbour a range of parasites and diseases that can be transmitted to humans. Examples of such zoonoses include trichinosis, &quot;Taenia solium&quot;, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs also host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tracts.

Some strains of influenza are endemic in pigs, the most significant of which are H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2, the first of which has caused several outbreaks among humans, including the Spanish flu, 1977 Russian flu pandemic, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic. Pigs also can acquire human influenza.

<text>In digital radio, packet radio is the application of packet switching techniques to digital radio communications. Packet radio uses a packet switching protocol as opposed to circuit switching or message switching protocols to transmit digital data via a radio communication link.

Packet radio is frequently used by amateur radio operators. The AX.25 (Amateur X.25) protocol was derived from the X.25 data link layer protocol and adapted for amateur radio use. Every AX.25 packet includes the sender&#x27;s amateur radio callsign, which satisfies the US FCC requirements for amateur radio station identification. AX.25 allows other stations to automatically repeat packets to extend the range of transmissions. It is possible for any packet station to act as a digipeater, linking distant stations with each other through ad hoc networks. This makes packet radio especially useful for emergency communications.

Packet radio can be used in mobile communications. Some mobile packet radio stations transmit their location periodically using the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). If the APRS packet is received by an &quot;i-gate&quot; station, position reports and other messages can be routed to an internet server, and made accessible on a public web page. This allows amateur radio operators to track the locations of vehicles, hikers, high-altitude balloons, etc., along with telemetry and other messages around the world.

Some packet radio implementations also use dedicated point-to-point links such as TARPN. In cases such as this, new protocols have emerged such as Improved Layer 2 Protocol (IL2P) supporting forward error correction for noisy and weak signal links.

== History ==

Earlier digital radio communications modes were telegraphy (using Morse code), teleprinter (using Baudot code) and facsimile.

=== Aloha and PRNET ===

Since radio circuits inherently possess a broadcast network topology (i.e., many or all nodes are connected to the network simultaneously), one of the first technical challenges faced in the implementation of packet radio networks was a means to control access to a shared communication channel to avoid collisions of signals. Professor Norman Abramson of the University of Hawaii led development of a packet radio network known as ALOHAnet and performed a number of experiments beginning in the 1970s to develop methods to arbitrate access to a shared radio channel by network nodes. This system operated on UHF frequencies at 9,600 baud. From this work the Aloha multiple access protocol was derived. Subsequent enhancements in channel access techniques made by Leonard Kleinrock &quot;et al.&quot; in 1975 would lead Robert Metcalfe to use carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocols in the design of the now commonplace Ethernet local area network (LAN) technology.

Over 1973–76, DARPA created a packet radio network called PRNET in the San Francisco Bay area and conducted a series of experiments with SRI to verify the use of ARPANET (a precursor to the Internet) communications protocols (later known as IP) over packet radio links between mobile and fixed network nodes. This system was quite advanced, as it made use of direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) modulation and forward error correction (FEC) techniques to provide 100 kbit/s and 400 kbit/s data channels. These experiments were generally considered to be successful, and also marked the first demonstration of Internetworking, as in these experiments data was routed between the ARPANET, PRNET, and SATNET (a satellite packet radio network) networks. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, DARPA operated a number of terrestrial and satellite packet radio networks connected to the ARPANET at various military and government installations.

=== Amateur Packet Radio and the AMPRNet ===
Amateur radio operators began experimenting with packet radio in 1978, when—after obtaining authorization from the Canadian government—Robert Rouleau, VE2PY; Bram Frank, VE2BFH; Norm Pearl, VE2BQS; and Jacques Orsali, VE2EHP of the Montreal Amateur Radio Club Montreal, Quebec, began experimenting with transmitting ASCII encoded data over VHF amateur radio frequencies using homebuilt equipment. In 1980, Doug Lockhart VE7APU, and the Vancouver Area Digital Communications Group (VADCG) in Vancouver, British Columbia began producing standardized equipment (Terminal Node Controllers) in quantity for use in amateur packet radio networks. In 2003, Rouleau was inducted into CQ Amateur Radio magazine&#x27;s hall of fame for his work on the Montreal Protocol in 1978.

Not long after this activity began in Canada, amateurs in the US became interested in packet radio. In 1980, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted authorization for United States amateurs to transmit ASCII codes via amateur radio. Repeaters may be designed for amateur packet radio, these are dubbed &quot;digipeaters&quot;. The first known amateur packet radio activity in the US occurred in San Francisco during December 1980, when a packet repeater was put into operation on 2 meters by Hank Magnuski KA6M, and the Pacific Packet Radio Society (PPRS). In keeping with the dominance of DARPA and ARPANET at the time, the nascent amateur packet radio network was dubbed the AMPRNet in DARPA style. Magnuski obtained IP address allocations in the network for amateur radio use worldwide.

Many groups of amateur radio operators interested in packet radio soon formed throughout the country including the Pacific Packet Radio Society (PPRS) in California, the Tucson Amateur Packet Radio Corporation (TAPR) in Arizona and the Amateur Radio Research and Development Corporation (AMRAD) in Washington, D.C.

By 1983, TAPR was offering the first TNC available in kit form. Packet radio started becoming more and more popular across North America and by 1984 the first packet-based bulletin board systems began to appear. Packet radio proved its value for emergency operations following the crash of an Aeromexico airliner in a neighborhood in Cerritos, California, in August 1986. Volunteers linked several key sites to pass text traffic via packet radio which kept voice frequencies clear.

For an objective description of early developments in amateur packet radio, refer to the article &quot;Packet Radio in the Amateur Service&quot;.

== Concepts ==
Packet radio can be differentiated from other digital radio switching schemes by the following attributes:

* Transmitted data is broken into packets, each of which contains a destination (and typically the source) address
* A transmitted message may be broken into a sequence of packets before transmission, which are then re-assembled into the original message upon reception
* Packets for multiple destinations can be transmitted on the same radio link in an asynchronous fashion
* A packet may be addressed to all possible recipients rather than a specific one (broadcast)
* A packet may be stored and subsequently forwarded towards its destination by a network node

This is very similar to how packets of data are transferred between nodes on the Internet.

One of the first challenges faced by amateurs implementing packet radio is that almost all amateur radio equipment (and most surplus commercial/military equipment) has historically been designed to transmit voice, not data. Like any other digital communications system that uses analog media, packet radio systems require a modem. Since the radio equipment to be used with the modem was intended for voice, early amateur packet systems used AFSK modems that followed telephone standards (notably the Bell 202 standard). While this approach worked, it was not optimal, because it used a 25 kHz FM channel to transmit at 1,200 baud. When using a direct FSK modulation like G3RUH&#x27;s packet radio modem, a 9,600 baud transmission is easily made in the same channel. In addition, the baseband characteristics of the audio channel provided by voice radios are often quite different from those of telephone audio channels. This led to the need in some cases to enable or disable pre-emphasis or de-emphasis circuits in the radios and/or modems.

Another problem faced by early &quot;packeteers&quot; was the issue of asynchronous versus synchronous data transfer. At the time, most personal computers had asynchronous RS-232 serial ports for data communications between the computer and devices such as modems. The RS-232 standard specifies an asynchronous, start-stop mode of data transmission where data is sent in groups (characters) of 7 or 8 bits. Unfortunately, the simple AFSK modems typically used provide no timing signal to indicate the start of a packet frame. That led to the need for a mechanism to enable the receiver to know when to start assembling each packet frame. The method used is called asynchronous framing. The receiver looks for the &quot;frame boundary octet,&quot; then begins decoding the packet data that follows it. Another frame boundary octet marks the end of the packet frame.

A number of data &quot;conversations&quot; are possible on a single radio channel over a finite period.

A basic packet radio station consists of a computer or dumb terminal, a modem, and a transceiver with an antenna. Traditionally, the computer and modem are combined in one unit, the terminal node controller (TNC), with a dumb terminal (or terminal emulator) used to input and display data. Increasingly, personal computers are taking over the functions of the TNC, with the modem either a standalone unit or implemented entirely in software. Alternatively, multiple manufacturers (including Kenwood and Alinco) now market handheld or mobile radios with built-in TNCs, allowing connection directly to the serial port of a computer or terminal with no other equipment required. The computer is responsible for managing network connections, formatting data as AX.25 packets, and controlling the radio channel. Frequently it provides other functionality as well, such as a simple bulletin board system to accept messages while the operator is away.

== Layers ==

Following the OSI model, packet radio networks can be described in terms of the physical, data link, and network layer protocols on which they rely.

=== Physical ===
Modems used for packet radio vary in throughput and modulation technique, and are normally selected to match the capabilities of the radio equipment in use.
Most commonly used method is one using audio frequency-shift keying (AFSK) within the radio equipment&#x27;s existing speech bandwidth.
The first amateur packet radio stations were constructed using surplus Bell 202 1,200 bit/s modems, and despite its low data rate, Bell 202 modulation has remained the standard for VHF operation in most areas. More recently, 9,600 bit/s has become a popular, although more technically demanding, alternative. At HF frequencies, Bell 103 modulation is used, at a rate of 300 bit/s.

Due to historical reasons, all commonly used modulations are based on an idea of minimal modification to the radio itself, usually just connecting the computer&#x27;s audio output directly to the transmitter&#x27;s microphone input and receiver&#x27;s audio output directly to the computer&#x27;s microphone input. Upon adding a &quot;turn the transmitter on&quot; output signal (&quot;PTT&quot;) for transmitter control, one has made a &quot;radio modem&quot;.
Due to this simplicity, and just having suitable microchips at hand, the &quot;Bell 202&quot; modulation became standard way to send the packet radio data over the radio as two distinct tones. The tones are 1,200 Hz for Mark and 2,200 Hz for space (1,000 Hz shift). In the case of &quot;Bell 103&quot; modulation, a 200 Hz shift is used. The data is differentially encoded with a NRZI pattern, where a data zero bit is encoded by a change in tones and a data one bit is encoded by no change in tones.

Ways to achieve higher speeds than 1,200 bits/s, include using telephone modem chips via the microphone and audio out connectors. This has been proven to work at speeds up to 4,800 bit/s using fax V.27 modems in half-duplex mode. These modems use phase-shift keying which works fine when there is no amplitude-shift keying, but at faster speeds such as 9,600 bit/s, signal levels become critical and they are extremely sensitive to group delay in the radio. These systems were pioneered by Simon Taylor (G1NTX) and Jerry Sandys (G8DXZ) in the 1980s. Other systems which involved small modification of the radio were developed by James Miller (G3RUH) and operated at 9,600 bit/s.

1,200 bit/s AFSK node controllers on 2 meters (144–148 MHz) are the most commonly found packet radio. For 1,200/2,400 bit/s UHF/VHF packet radio, amateurs use commonly available narrow band FM voice radios. For HF packet, 300 bit/s data is used over single sideband (SSB) modulation. For high speed packet (9,600 bit/s upwards), special radios or modified FM radios must be used.

Custom modems have been developed which allow throughput rates of 19.2 kbit/s, 56 kbit/s, and even 1.2 Mbit/s over amateur radio links on FCC permitted frequencies of 440 MHz and above. However, special radio equipment is needed to carry data at these speeds. The interface between the &quot;modem&quot; and the &quot;radio&quot; is at the &quot;intermediate frequency&quot; part of the radio as opposed to the audio section used for 1,200 bit/s operation. The adoption of these high-speed links has been limited.

In many commercial data radio applications, audio baseband modulation is not used. Data is transmitted by altering the transmitter output frequency between two distinct frequencies (in the case of FSK modulation, other alternates exist).

The 2.4 GHz &quot;Wi-Fi&quot; band partially overlaps an amateur radio band, so commercial Wi-Fi hardware can be adapted and used by licensed amateur radio operators at higher power levels, although restrictions on amateur radio limit the appeal of using packet radio to connect to the internet. US FCC regulations do not allow amateur radio communications to be encrypted or private, in addition to other content restrictions.

=== Data link ===

Packet radio networks rely on the AX.25 data link layer protocol, derived from the X.25 protocol suite and intended specifically for amateur radio use. Despite its name, AX.25 defines both the physical and data link layers of the OSI model. (It also defines a network layer protocol, though this is seldom used.)

=== Network ===

Packet radio has most often been used for direct, keyboard-to-keyboard connections between stations, either between two live operators or between an operator and a bulletin board system. No network services above the data link layer are required for these applications.

To provide automated routing of data between stations (important for the delivery of electronic mail), several network layer protocols have been developed for use with AX.25. Most prominent among these network layer protocols are NET/ROM &amp; TheNET, ROSE, FlexNet and TexNet.

In principle, any network layer protocol may be used, including the ubiquitous Internet Protocol.

== Implementations ==

Many commercial operations, particularly those that make use of vehicle dispatch (e.g. taxis, tow trucks, police) were quick to note the value of packet radio systems to provide simple mobile data systems. This led to the rapid development of a number of commercial packet radio systems:

* MDI (1979)
* DCS (1984)

<text>Pizza cheese encompasses several varieties and types of cheeses and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese, such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular cheeses used in the preparation of pizza are mozzarella (accounting for about 30%), provolone, cheddar and Parmesan. Emmental, &quot;pecorino romano&quot; and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.

Processed pizza cheese is manufactured to produce optimal qualities in browning, melting, stretchiness and fat and moisture content. Several studies and experiments have analyzed the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes to create ideal and economical pizza cheeses. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese products was 2 billion pounds in the United States and 200 million pounds in Europe, and in 2000 demand for the product in Europe was increasing by 8% per year. The trend of steadily-increasing production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese continued into the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.

==Varieties and types==

The &quot;International Dictionary of Food and Cooking&quot; defines pizza cheese as &quot;a soft spun-curd cheese similar to Mozzarella made from cow&#x27;s milk...&quot; that is &quot;...used particularly for pizzas and contains somewhat less water than real Mozzarella...&quot; Most are at least 95 percent mozzarella, with different moisture and fat densities. Cheese for frozen pizzas may be comminuted, in which the cheese is processed into minute granules or fragments. Low-moisture mozzarella can be formulated specifically for pizza. Cheese may be processed into blocks, from which the product can be grated, made into granules or sliced for use on pizza or other foods. Pizza cheese frequently consists of a blend of two or more cheeses, such as low-moisture mozzarella or provolone. Low-moisture mozzarella was first manufactured in dairy factories in the Midwestern United States, and was originally called &quot;pizza cheese&quot;. Compared to standard mozzarella, low-moisture mozzarella has a firmer texture, is easier to grate, has better browning and melting characteristics, and is less perishable.

Globally, mozzarella is the most popular pizza cheese. However, it has been estimated that in the United States only 30% of all pizza cheese used is actual mozzarella. Provolone is the second most popular one. Cheddar may be mixed with mozzarella to preserve chewiness. Grated Parmesan may be added to the top of a pizza, and typically does not melt well when cooked. A diverse variety of processed pizza cheeses are produced, including analogue cheese. Provel is one example. Other pizza cheeses include Emmental and &quot;pecorino romano&quot;; Detroit-style pizza is noted for its use of Wisconsin brick cheese. Ricotta is used for calzones or as a topping.

Several cheeses may be mixed together in its formulation, and each has individual browning and blistering characteristics. For example, a combination of mozzarella and Cheddar may blister less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while mozzarella and provolone may brown less compared to other combinations.

===Processed pizza cheeses===
Pasteurized and processed cheese-like products for pizza that are quicker and cheaper to produce than real cheese and designed to melt well and remain chewy are used on many mass-produced pizzas in North America and the United Kingdom. These products are referred to as &quot;analogue&quot; (or &quot;analog&quot;) &quot;pizza cheese&quot;; in the UK the term &quot;cheese analogue&quot; is used, making clear that it is not actually cheese. In the book &quot;Technology of Cheesemaking&quot;, editors Law and Tamimethat state that analogue pizza cheese appears to be the leading type of cheese analogue produced globally. Each year in the United States, 700 million frozen pizzas are sold, three-quarters of which contain cheese substitutes.

Analogue pizza cheeses may be formulated for processing with less sophisticated cheese-making equipment than is required for Mozzarella cheese, such as using simple mixing and molding. They tend to have a soft texture and once melted, may have a slightly &quot;stringy&quot; quality when pulled or bitten into. They may lack fusion, i.e. shredded pieces might not flow together when they melt. New stabilizer systems have been developed that have helped to enable the creation of analogue pizza cheeses.

An example of a processed pizza cheese is Provel, which uses Cheddar, Swiss, and provolone cheeses as flavorants. Some analogue types are made with casein, a by-product of milk, and vegetable oil, rather than milk fat. Casein-based Mozzarella-like imitation processed cheeses prepared using rennet are also used as a Mozzarella substitute on frozen pizzas.

In some instances, the production of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to the production of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it will flow when hot but solidifies as it cools. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur via the Maillard reaction.

==Research and development==
Manufacturers and academics have conducted studies and experiments in an effort to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and water retention of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.

Manufacturers aim for a moisture content of 50–52% and a fat-in-dry-matter content of 35–40%. A study published in the &quot;International Journal of Food &amp; Science Technology&quot; found that a 12.5:87.5 blend of vetch milk and cow milk improved stretchiness and melting characteristics. Vetch is a legume that has seeds which are similar to lentils. An experiment published in the &quot;International Journal of Dairy Technology&quot; suggested that the level of galactose, a monosaccharide sugar that is less sweet than glucose and fructose, can be reduced using different culture techniques. An article in the &quot;International Journal of Food Engineering&quot; found that trisodium citrate, a food additive used to preserve and add flavor to foods, slightly improved the preferred qualities of pizza cheese. Research published in &quot;Dairy Industries International&quot; suggested that denatured whey proteins increased moisture retention, but that the improvements were very slight and not economically worthwhile relative to the minor improvements.

Some consumers prefer pizza cheese with less browning, which can be achieved using low-moisture part-skim Mozzarella with a low galactose content. Some varieties derived from skim mozzarella variants were designed not to require aging or the use of fermentation starter. Others can be produced through the direct acidification of milk, which may be used in place of bacterial fermentation.

==Production and business==
In the United States, the production and consumption of mozzarella and pizza cheese steadily increased in the mid-20th century, and this trend has continued into the first decade of the 21st century. In the U.S., several hundred million pounds of pizza cheese is consumed annually. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of the product was 1 million tons (2 billion pounds) in the United States and 100,000 tonnes (98,000 long tons; 110,000 short tons, 220,460,000 pounds) in Europe. It has been estimated that 30% of all pizza cheese used in the United States is mozzarella. As of 2000, demand for the product was growing in Europe by 8 percent per year.

Mass-produced pizza cheese is used by the foodservice industry, quick service restaurants, and other industries and businesses. The world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of pizza cheese, Leprino Foods Company, processes 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons, 1,322,760,000 pounds) a year. Leprino Foods holds patents for some specialized mozzarella production processes that enable the quick manufacture of the product. One such product is a frozen shredded cheese used for pizza that is created in a few hours from milk. Other U.S. companies also mass-produce pizza cheese, which is shipped in a frozen state. As of 2000, Glanbia is the largest producer of pizza cheese in Europe. Some retail and commercially mass-produced frozen pizzas have cheese stuffed into the pizza crust.

==Use by region==
Significant amounts of pizza cheese are used in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Whole milk mozzarella is popular in pizzas in the East and Southwest regions of the U.S., while one survey showed that provolone was more popular on the east and west coast. Cheddar may be used more in the Eastern and Southern regions of the U.S. Provel cheese is typically used in the preparation of St. Louis-style pizza in the U.S.

<text>Norma Deloris Egstrom (May 26, 1920 – January 21, 2002), known professionally as Peggy Lee, was an American jazz and popular music singer, songwriter, and actress whose career spanned seven decades. From her beginning as a vocalist on local radio to singing with Benny Goodman&#x27;s big band, Lee created a sophisticated persona, writing music for films, acting, and recording conceptual record albums combining poetry and music. Called the &quot;Queen of American pop music&quot;, Lee recorded more than 1,100 masters and co-wrote over 270 songs.

==Early life==
Lee was born Norma Deloris Egstrom in Jamestown, North Dakota, United States, on May 26, 1920, the seventh of the eight children of Selma Emele (née Anderson) Egstrom and Marvin Olaf Egstrom, a station agent for the Midland Continental Railroad. Her family were Lutherans. Her father was Swedish-American and her mother was Norwegian-American. After her mother died when Lee was four, her father married Minnie Schaumberg Wiese. His family&#x27;s original name was Ekström.

Lee and her family lived in several towns along the Midland Continental Railroad (Jamestown, Nortonville and Wimbledon). She graduated from Wimbledon High School in 1937.

Lee began singing from a young age. In Wimbledon, Lee was the female singer for a six-piece college dance band with leader Lyle &quot;Doc&quot; Haines. She traveled to various locations with Haines&#x27;s quintet on Fridays after school and on weekends.

Lee first sang professionally over KOVC radio in Valley City, North Dakota, in 1936. She later had her own 15-minute Saturday radio show sponsored by a local restaurant that paid her salary in food. Both during and after her high-school years, Lee sang for small sums on local radio stations.

In October 1937, radio personality Ken Kennedy, of WDAY in Fargo (the most widely heard station in North Dakota), auditioned her and put her on the air that day, but not before he changed her name to Peggy Lee.

Lee left home and traveled to Hollywood, California, at the age of 17 in March 1938. Her first job was seasonal work on Balboa Island, Newport Beach, as a short order cook and waitress at Harry&#x27;s Cafe. When the job ended after Easter, she was hired to work as a carnival barker at the Balboa Fun Zone. She wrote about this experience in the song, &quot;The Nickel Ride&quot;, which she composed with Dave Grusin for the 1974 film of the same name.

Later in 1938, Lee returned to Hollywood to audition for the MC at The Jade. Her employment was cut short when she fainted onstage due to overwork and an inadequate diet. After she was taken to the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center she was told she needed a tonsillectomy. Lee returned to North Dakota for the operation.

The following year, remaining in North Dakota, she was hired to perform regularly at The Powers Hotel in Fargo, and toured with both the Sev Olson and the Will Osborne Orchestras. In 1939 she was also again broadcasting at WDAY.

When Lee returned to California in 1940, she took a job singing at The Doll House in Palm Springs. Here, she developed her trademark sultry purr, having decided to compete with the noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume.


While performing at The Doll House, Lee met Frank Bering, the owner of the Ambassador East and West in Chicago. He offered her a gig at the Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel West. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee:

She joined his band in August 1941 and made her first recording, singing &quot;Elmer&#x27;s Tune&quot;. Lee stayed with the Benny Goodman Orchestra for two years.

==Recording career==
In 1942, Lee had her first top ten hit, &quot;Somebody Else Is Taking My Place&quot;, followed in 1943 by &quot;Why Don&#x27;t You Do Right?&quot;, which sold more than one million copies and made her famous. She sang with Goodman&#x27;s orchestra in two 1943 films, &quot;Stage Door Canteen&quot; and &quot;The Powers Girl&quot;.

In March 1943, Lee married Dave Barbour, a guitarist in Goodman&#x27;s band. Lee said:


She drifted back to songwriting and occasional recording sessions for Capitol Records in 1944, for whom she recorded a long string of hits, many of them with lyrics and music by Lee and Barbour, including &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know Enough About You&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Day&quot;. Her recording of &quot;Golden Earrings&quot;, the title song of a 1947 movie, was a hit throughout 1947–1948. &quot;Mañana&quot;, written by Lee and Barbour, was her eleventh solo hit recording, and remained on the charts for twenty-one weeks, nine of which were in the number one position. The song sold more than a million copies, and earned the Top Disc Jockey Record of the Year award from &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. From 1946 to 1949, Lee also recorded for Capitol&#x27;s library of electrical transcriptions for radio stations. An advertisement for Capitol Transcriptions in a trade magazine noted that the transcriptions included &quot;special voice introductions by Peggy&quot;.

In 1948, Lee joined vocalists Perry Como and Jo Stafford as a host of the NBC Radio musical program &quot;The Chesterfield Supper Club&quot;. She was a regular on &quot;The Jimmy Durante Show&quot; and appeared frequently on Bing Crosby&#x27;s radio shows during the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Her relationship with Capitol spanned almost three decades aside from a brief detour (1952–1956) at Decca. For that label, she recorded &quot;Black Coffee&quot; and had hit singles such as &quot;Lover&quot; and &quot;Mister Wonderful&quot;.

In 1958, she recorded her own version of &quot;Fever&quot; by Little Willie John, written by Eddie Cooley and Otis Blackwell. Lee created a new arrangement for the song, and added lyrics (&quot;Romeo loved Juliet&quot;, &quot;Captain Smith and Pocahontas&quot;), which she neglected to copyright. Her new version of &quot;Fever&quot; was a hit, and was nominated in three categories at the First Annual Grammy Awards in 1959, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.

While Lee was in London for a 1970 engagement at Royal Albert Hall, she invited Paul and Linda McCartney to dinner at The Dorchester. At the dinner, the couple gifted Lee with a song they had written entitled, &quot;Let&#x27;s Love&quot;. In July 1974, with Paul McCartney producing, Lee recorded the song at the Record Plant in Los Angeles, and it became the title track for her 40th album, her only one on Atlantic Records.

==Acting career==

Lee starred opposite Danny Thomas in &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1952), a remake of the Al Jolson film, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927). She played an alcoholic blues singer in &quot;Pete Kelly&#x27;s Blues&quot; (1955), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Lee provided speaking and singing voices for several characters in the Disney movie &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), playing the human Darling, the dog Peg, and the two Siamese cats, Si and Am. She also co-wrote, with Sonny Burke, all of the original songs for the film, including &quot;He&#x27;s A Tramp&quot;, &quot;Bella Notte&quot;, &quot;La La Lu&quot;, &quot;The Siamese Cat Song&quot;, and &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;. In 1987, when &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; was released on VHS, Lee sought performance and song royalties on the video sales. When the Disney company refused to pay, she filed a lawsuit in 1988. After a prolonged legal battle, in 1992, Lee was awarded $2.3 million for breach of contract, plus $500,000 for unjust enrichment, $600,000 for illegal use of Lee&#x27;s voice and $400,000 for the use of her name.

Peggy Lee also wrote the lyrics for &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (with music composer Victor Young), the title track of the 1954 film, &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot;, which she sings partially at the end of the movie.

During her career, Lee appeared in hundreds of variety shows, and several TV movies and specials.

==Personal life==
Lee was married four times: to guitarist and composer Dave Barbour (1943–1951), actor Brad Dexter (1953), actor Dewey Martin (1956–1958), and percussionist Jack Del Rio (1964). All the marriages ended in divorce.

On November 11, 1943, Lee gave birth to her only child, daughter Nicki Lee Foster (who died in 2014), in her marriage to Barbour.

Lee learned Transcendental Meditation and said she was taught &quot;by the Maharishi personally and that was a great honor.&quot;

==Death==

Lee continued to perform into the 1990s, sometimes using a wheelchair. After years of poor health, she died of complications from diabetes and a heart attack on January 21, 2002, at the age of 81. She was cremated and her ashes were buried with a bench-style monument in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Awards and honors==
Lee was nominated for 13 Grammy Awards. In 1969, her hit &quot;Is That All There Is?&quot; won her the Grammy for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance. In 1995, she was given the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

She received the Rough Rider Award from the state of North Dakota in 1975, the Pied Piper Award from the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1990, the Ella Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Society of Singers in 1994, the Living Legacy Award from the Women&#x27;s International Center in 1994, and the Presidents Award from the Songwriters Guild of America in 1999. Other honors include induction into the Big Band Jazz Hall of Fame in 1992, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Songbook Hall of Fame from the Great American Songbook Foundation in 2020.

==Tributes and legacy==
Lee is often cited as the inspiration for the Margarita cocktail. In 1948, after a trip to Mexico, she and her husband ventured into the Balinese Room in Galveston, Texas. She requested a drink similar to one she had had in Mexico, and the head bartender, Santos Cruz, created the Margarita, and named it after the Spanish version of Peggy&#x27;s name.

Lee was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Recording in 1960. The star is located at 6319 Hollywood Boulevard in California.

Baseball&#x27;s Tug McGraw, whose career with both the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies ranged from 1965 to 1984, named one of his pitches the Peggy Lee. He explained to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;: &quot;That&#x27;s the one where the hitter is out in front of it and says, &#x27;Is that all there is?

In 1971, Lee sang the Lord&#x27;s Prayer at the funeral of Louis Armstrong.

The designer of the Miss Piggy Muppet, Bonnie Erickson, who grew up in Lee&#x27;s home state of North Dakota, used the singer as inspiration for the Miss Piggy character in 1974. Originally called Miss Piggy Lee, her name was shortened to Miss Piggy when the Muppet gained fame.

In 1975, Lee received an honorary doctorate in music from North Dakota State University, and in 2000, she received another from Jamestown University.

In 1983, Lee had a hybrid tea rose named in her honor that was pink with a touch of peach. The Peggy Lee Rose was the 1983 American Beauty Rose of the Year.

In 2003, &quot;There&#x27;ll Be Another Spring: A Tribute to Miss Peggy Lee&quot; was held at Carnegie Hall. Produced by recording artist Richard Barone, the sold-out event included performances by Cy Coleman, Debbie Harry, Nancy Sinatra, Rita Moreno, Marian McPartland, Chris Connor, Petula Clark, Maria Muldaur, Dee Dee Bridgewater, Quincy Jones, Shirley Horn, and others. In 2004, Barone brought the event to a sold-out Hollywood Bowl, and then to Chicago&#x27;s Ravinia Festival, with expanded casts including Maureen McGovern, Jack Jones, and Bea Arthur. The Carnegie Hall concert was broadcast on NPR&#x27;s &quot;JazzSet&quot;.

The Wimbledon depot building, where she and her family lived and worked, became the Midland Continental Depot Transportation Museum, featuring The Peggy Lee Exhibit, in 2012. The upper floor of the museum, where the Egstrom family once lived, features exhibits that trace Lee&#x27;s career and her regional and state connection.

On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Lee&#x27;s birth, May 26, 2020, The Grammy Museum hosted an online panel discussion featuring musicians Billie Eilish, k.d. lang, Eric Burton (The Black Pumas), as well as Lee&#x27;s granddaughter, Holly Foster Wells, and the author of &quot;Peggy Lee: A Century of Song&quot;, Dr. Tish Oney.

Lee has been noted as a musical influence on other artists such as Paul McCartney, Madonna, Beyoncé, k.d. lang, Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Dusty Springfield, Rita Coolidge, Rita Moreno, and Billie Eilish.

In 2020, the ASCAP Foundation, along with Lee&#x27;s family, established the annual Peggy Lee Songwriter Award. The inaugural award went to Michael Blum and Jenna Lotti for their song, &quot;Fake ID&quot;.

==Songwriting==
Lee wrote or co-wrote more than 270 songs. In addition to her own material to sing, she was hired to score and compose songs for movies. For the Disney movie &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, she co-composed all of the original songs with Burke, and supplied the singing and speaking voices of four characters.

Over the years, her songwriting collaborators included David Barbour, Laurindo Almeida, Harold Arlen, Sonny Burke, Cy Coleman, Duke Ellington, Dave Grusin, Quincy Jones, Francis Lai, Jack Marshall, Johnny Mandel, Marian McPartland, Willard Robison, Lalo Schifrin, and Victor Young.

Lee&#x27;s first published song was in 1941, &quot;Little Fool&quot;. &quot;What More Can a Woman Do?&quot; was recorded by Sarah Vaughan with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. &quot;Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me)&quot; was number one on the Billboard singles chart for nine weeks in 1948, from the week of March 13 to May 8.

Lee was a mainstay of Capitol Records when rock and roll came onto the American music scene. She was among the first of the &quot;old guard&quot; to recognize this new genre, as seen by her recording music from the Beatles, Randy Newman, Carole King, James Taylor, and other up-and-coming songwriters. From 1957 until her final disc for the company in 1972, she produced a steady stream of two or three albums per year that usually included standards (often arranged quite differently from the original), her own compositions, and material from young artists.

Many of her compositions have become standards, performed by singers such as Tony Bennett, Nat King Cole, Natalie Cole, Bing Crosby, Doris Day, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Diana Krall, Queen Latifah, Barry Manilow, Bette Midler, Janelle Monae, Nina Simone, Regina Spektor, Sarah Vaughan and others.

<text>Pinuccio Sciola (15 March 1942 – 13 May 2016) was an Italian sculptor and muralist from San Sperate, Sardinia. His work has been mentioned as a major attraction of the nearby town of Assemini and Alghero.

In 1973 Sciola travelled to Mexico City to work with David Alfaro Siqueiros. He then focused primarily on sculpture. Among his most well-known pieces are the &quot;pietre sonore&quot; (&quot;sounding stones&quot;) – large sculptures made of limestones or basalts that alter their appearance at human contact.

Sciola&#x27;s work was exhibited at the 37th Venice Biennale (1976), the 10th Rome Quadriennale (1985) and Expo 2000 in Hannover. Public commissions include the Rotonda della Besana in Milan (1984); The Grand Trianon in Versailles (1996); and Renzo Piano&#x27;s Auditorium City of Music Park in Rome (2003). 

In 1996 his sound-stones were played by the percussionist Pierre Favre at the Time in Jazz Festival in Berchidda.

<text>Paolo Fresu (; born 10 February 1961) is an Italian jazz trumpet and flugelhorn player, as well as a composer and arranger of music. His unique trumpet sound is recognized as one of the most distinctive in the contemporary jazz scene.

Fresu plays four distinct instruments: trumpet, flugelhorn, muted trumpet, and electronics. He selectively uses a t.c. electronic effects unit and &quot;one from the past&quot; by DigiTech, through this equipment, he see it as a way to go back in time. Fresu demonstrates his versatile trumpet skills through his rendition of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Si dolce è il tormento&quot; and Handel&#x27;s aria &quot;Lascia chi&#x27;s Pianga.&quot;

== Early Life ==
Fresu began studying the trumpet at age 11 in the &quot;Bernardo De Muro&quot; music band of Berchidda. At a young age, Fresu joined &quot;Banda&quot; a local marching band, where a member gave him a cassette of &quot;Miles Davis in Europe,&quot; with &quot;Autumn Leave.&quot;

Fresu professionally started in 1982, where he recorded with RAI, an Italian public broadcasting corporation, under the direction of Bruno Tommaso.

In the early 80s, Paolo Fresu had attended the Siena Summer Jazz Seminars and impressed Enrico Rava with his performance. It was over the next 10 years did Fresu become a major player in the Italian scene. He started with his quintet, which is currently going, and then began to branched out through a variety of projects.

==Career==
Born in Berchidda, Sardinia, he picked up the trumpet at the age of 11, and played in the band Bernardo de Muro in his home town Berchidda. Fresu graduated from the Conservatory of Cagliari in 1984, in trumpet studies under Enzo Morandini, and attended the University of Bologna School of music and performing arts in Bologna. He made his debut in 1985, with the release of his first album &quot;Ostinato.&quot;

He has collaborated with leading Italian musicians like Franesco D&#x27;Andrea, Gianluigi Trovesi, Giorgio Gaslini, Enrico Rava, Bruno Tommaso, Giovanni Tommaso, Enrico Pieranunzi, Tiziana Ghiglioni. To European and Americans like Kenny Wheeler, John Taylor, Dave Liebman, Dave Holland, Phil Woods, Riccardo Del Frà, Gerry Mulligan, Bob Brookmayer, John Zorn, John Abercrombie, Helen Merril, Richard Galliano, etc. 

One of Paolo Fresu known collabaration is with Omar Sosa, a cuban born pianist.

He has taught at the Siena Jazz National Seminars, as well as jazz university courses in Terni, and is the director of Nuoro Jazz Seminars in Nuoro, Italy. He has led the Jazz Seminars in Nuoro for 25 years.

Fresu composes music for theatre, poem, dance, radio, television, and film.

In 2007, he recorded and toured with Carla Bley&#x27;s quartet, the Lost Chords.

In 2011, he released &quot;Mistico Mediterraneo&quot;, which featured him, Daniele di Bonaventura and five other members playing bandoneons in A Filetta style.

In 2012, his quintet performed at the Sirifort Auditorium, New Delhi, India, to celebrate 10 years of the Italian culture center there.

In 2015, Fresu was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.

Paolo Fresu is the artistic director of the Berchidda Festival Time In Jazz. 

=== Tûk Music ===
Paolo Fresu has worked as a producer under his own label, Tǔk Music, where he not only produces his own albums, but artists like Dino Rubino and Marco Bardoscia who he has collaborated with by recording a Chet Baker tribute album &quot;Tiempo di Chet&quot; (2018). Fresu has also formed a trio with Bardoscia and Rubino, where they play music inspired by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti. His label Tûk Music was created in 2010 with his colleague Luca Devito, who previously had experience being a production coordinator. With the creation of the label, Fresu and Devito sought to venture off the traditional jazz path and more into the electronic and ethnic sounds, to give incentive to young musicians. While they did create the label to go towards a jazz electronic path, Fresu is not against or preventing the label from working within the tradition jazz path, as they want to be inclusive to everyone. 

The labels projects, including Fresu&#x27;s is based on the digital-related path as Dresu sees it is vital to be present and aware of the new media, ways for building creativity and music. Therefore, Fresu sees digital media as a powerful tool to make music be in the ears of people.

<doc id="25160" wikidata="Q704930" url="?curid=25160" title="Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy">
<text>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and often fatal viral disease characterized by progressive damage (&quot;-pathy&quot;) or inflammation of the white matter (&quot;leuko-&quot;) of the brain (&quot;-encephalo-&quot;) at multiple locations (&quot;multifocal&quot;). It is caused by the JC virus, which is normally present and kept under control by the immune system. The JC virus is harmless except in cases of weakened immune systems. In general, PML has a mortality rate of 30–50% in the first few months, and those who survive can be left with varying degrees of neurological disabilities.

PML occurs almost exclusively in patients with severe immune deficiency, most commonly among patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), but people on chronic immunosuppressive medications including chemotherapy are also at increased risk of PML, such as patients with transplants, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms can develop over several weeks to months, and they depend on location of damage in the brain and the degree of damage. The most prominent symptoms are &quot;clumsiness, progressive weakness, and visual, speech, and sometimes personality changes&quot;.
The lesions affecting the parietal and occipital lobes of the brain can lead to a phenomenon known as alien hand syndrome.

==Cause==

===JC virus infection===
The cause of PML is a type of polyomavirus called the JC virus (JCV), after the initials of the person (John Cunningham) from whose tissue the virus was first successfully cultured. Publications indicate 39 to 58% of the general population are seropositive for antibodies to JCV, indicating current or previous infection with the virus. Other publications put the percentage at 70 to 90% of the general population. JCV causes persistent asymptomatic infection in about one-third of the adult population, based on viral shedding into the urine from the site of asymptomatic infection in the kidney. The virus causes disease only when the immune system has been severely weakened.

===Immunosuppression===
PML is most common in people with HIV1 infection; prior to the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy, as many as 5% of people with AIDS eventually developed PML. Why PML occurs more frequently in people with AIDS than in other immunosuppressive conditions is unclear; some research suggests the effects of HIV on brain tissue, or on JCV itself, make JCV more likely to become active in the brain and increase its damaging inflammatory effects.

PML can still occur in people on immunosuppressive therapy, such as efalizumab, belatacept, and various transplant drugs, which are meant to weaken the immune system.

===Multiple sclerosis medications===
Natalizumab (Tysabri) was approved in 2004 by the FDA for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It supposedly works by preventing white blood cells from entering the brain. It was subsequently withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of PML. All three initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review, the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program. As of May 2011, over 130 cases of PML had been reported in MS patients, all in patients who had taken natalizumab for more than a year. While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between three- and four-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML in MS is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, and most of the rest are very disabled. One case study describes an MS patient who, during a 4-year course of dimethyl fumarate, developed PML and died.

Fingolimod (Gilenya) was approved in 2010 by the FDA for MS. In 2015, the first case of PML and a case of &quot;probable PML&quot; were reported by two Gilenya users that could not be tied to previous immunosuppressant therapies. These new cases are now being added to the drug information sheet included with every prescription (i.e. the &quot;drug label&quot;).

==Pathogenesis==
PML is a demyelinating disease, in which the myelin sheath covering the axons of nerve cells is gradually destroyed, impairing the transmission of nerve impulses. It affects the subcortical white matter, particularly that of the parietal and occipital lobes. PML destroys oligodendrocytes and produces intranuclear inclusions. It is similar to another demyelinating disease, MS, but progresses much more quickly. The breakdown of myelin is proportional to the degree of immunocompromise.

==Diagnosis==
PML is diagnosed in a patient with a progressive course of the disease, finding JC virus DNA in spinal fluid together with consistent white-matter lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); alternatively, a brain biopsy is diagnostic when the typical histopathology of demyelination, bizarre astrocytes, and enlarged oligodendroglial nuclei are present, coupled with techniques showing the presence of JC virus.

Characteristic evidence of PML on brain CT scan images are multifocal, noncontrast enhancing hypodense lesions without mass effect, but MRI is far more sensitive than CT. The most common area of involvement is the cortical white matter of frontal and parieto occipital lobes, but lesions may occur anywhere in the brain, such as the basal ganglia, external capsule, and posterior cranial fossa structures such as the brain stem and cerebellum.
Although typically multifocal, natalizumab-associated PML is often monofocal, predominantly in the frontal lobe.

==Treatment==
No drugs effectively inhibit or cure the virus infection without toxicity. Therefore, treatment aims at reversing the immune deficiency to slow or stop the disease progress. In patients on immunosuppression, this means stopping the drugs or using plasma exchange to accelerate the removal of the biologic agent that put the person at risk for PML.

In HIV-infected people, this may mean starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). AIDS patients starting HAART after being diagnosed with PML tend to have a slightly longer survival time than patients who were already on HAART and then develop PML. Some AIDS patients with PML have been able to survive for several years, with HAART. A rare complication of effective HAART is immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), in which increased immune system activity actually increases the damage caused by the JCV infection; although IRIS can often be managed with medication, it is extremely dangerous in PML.

Cidofovir was studied as possible treatment for PML and has been used on a case-by-case basis, working in some, but not others.

Cytarabine (also known as ARA-C), a chemotherapy drug used to treat certain cancers, has been prescribed on an experimental basis for a small number of non-AIDS PML patients, and stabilized the neurological condition of a minority of these patients. One patient regained some cognitive function lost as a result of PML.

In June 2010, the first case report appeared of a PML patient being successfully treated with the antimalarial drug mefloquine with activity against the JC virus. The patient cleared the virus and had no further neurological deterioration. Two case reports of using interleukin-2 successfully have been published. Some success have been reported with mirtazapine, but this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.
A number of drugs work against JC virus in cell culture, but no proven, effective therapy is known in humans.
For example, Brincidofovir (1-O-hexadecyloxypropyl-cidofovir /CMX001) available as Tembexa, suppresses JCV, but has been found to have toxicity at therapeutic dosage.
Infusion of donor T cells specific to the related BK polyomavirus has shown possible effect in treating PML in one small study by Katy Rezvani&#x27;s group, but needs further study.
In December 2021, Cellevolve announced it is launching a clinical trial for the treatment of PML utilizing BK virus specific T-cells (VSTs).

==Prognosis==
One-third to one-half of people with PML die in the first few months following diagnosis, depending on the severity of their underlying disease. Survivors can be left with variable degrees of neurological disability.

<doc id="25161" wikidata="Q741208" url="?curid=25161" title="Idiopathic intracranial hypertension">
<text>Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), previously known as pseudotumor cerebri and benign intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.
This condition is idiopathic, meaning there is no known cause. Risk factors include being overweight or a recent increase in weight. Tetracycline may also trigger the condition. The diagnosis is based on symptoms and a high opening pressure found during a lumbar puncture with no specific cause found on a brain scan.
Treatment includes a healthy diet, salt restriction, and exercise. The medication acetazolamide may also be used along with the above measures. A small percentage of people may require surgery to relieve the pressure.
About 2 per 100,000 people are newly affected per year. The condition most commonly affects women aged 20–50. Women are affected about 20 times more often than men. The condition was first described in 1897.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most common symptom of IIH is severe headache, which occurs in almost all (92–94%) cases. It is characteristically worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It may be associated with nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile tinnitus, a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, pain and/or numbness in one or both sides of the face, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.

The increased pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, a group of nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both play a role in eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally – the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.

The increased pressure leads to papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc, the spot where the optic nerve enters the eyeball. This occurs in practically all cases of IIH, but not everyone experiences symptoms from this. Those who do experience symptoms typically report &quot;transient visual obscurations&quot;, episodes of difficulty seeing that occur in both eyes but not necessarily at the same time. Long-term untreated papilledema leads to visual loss, initially in the periphery but progressively towards the center of vision.

Physical examination of the nervous system is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on examination of the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination in the form of a squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.

==Causes==
&quot;Idiopathic&quot; means of unknown cause. Therefore, IIH can only be diagnosed if there is no alternative explanation for the symptoms. Intracranial pressure may be increased due to medications such as high-dose vitamin A derivatives (e.g., isotretinoin for acne), long-term tetracycline antibiotics (for a variety of skin conditions). Hormonal contraceptives, particularly the oral contraceptive pill (OCP), are not associated with IIH. A systematic review published in 2020 suggests the use of the term &quot;drug-induced intracranial hypertension (DIIH)&quot; after having applied a &#x27;strict drug-causality algorithm&#x27; in determining IIH cases likely caused by the drugs they evaluated.

There are numerous other diseases, mostly rare conditions, that may lead to intracranial hypertension. If there is an underlying cause, the condition is termed &quot;secondary intracranial hypertension&quot;. Common causes of secondary intracranial hypertension include obstructive sleep apnea (a sleep-related breathing disorder), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), chronic kidney disease, and Behçet&#x27;s disease.

On July 1, 2022, the FDA issued an update that gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, drugs that are approved for treating precocious puberty, may be a risk factor for developing pseudotumor cerebri.

==Mechanism==
The cause of IIH is not known. The Monro–Kellie rule states that the intracranial pressure is determined by the amount of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood inside the bony cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the veins that drain blood from the brain.

The first theory, that of increased production of cerebrospinal fluid, was proposed in early descriptions of the disease. However, there is no experimental data that supports a role for this process in IIH.

The second theory posits that either increased blood flow to the brain or increase in the brain tissue itself may result in the raised pressure. Little evidence has accumulated to support the suggestion that increased blood flow plays a role, but recently Bateman et al. in phase contrast MRA studies have quantified cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo and suggests that CBF is abnormally elevated in many people with IIH. Both biopsy samples and various types of brain scans have shown an increased water content of the brain tissue. It remains unclear why this might be the case.

The third theory suggests that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many people with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It is not clear whether this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.

==Diagnosis==

The diagnosis may be suspected on the basis of the history and examination. To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the person is more likely to have an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women who are not overweight.

===Investigations===
Neuroimaging, usually with computed tomography (CT/CAT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is used to exclude any mass lesions. In IIH these scans typically appear to be normal, although small or slit-like ventricles, dilatation and buckling of the optic nerve sheaths and &quot;empty sella sign&quot; (flattening of the pituitary gland due to increased pressure) and enlargement of Meckel&#x27;s caves may be seen.

An MR venogram is also performed in most cases to exclude the possibility of venous sinus stenosis/obstruction or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. A contrast-enhanced MRV (ATECO) scan has a high detection rate for abnormal transverse sinus stenoses. These stenoses can be more adequately identified and assessed with catheter cerebral venography and manometry. Buckling of the bilateral optic nerves with increased perineural fluid is also often noted on MRI imaging.

Lumbar puncture is performed to measure the opening pressure, as well as to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be attributable to the fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate over the course of the normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.

===Classification===
The original criteria for IIH were described by Dandy in 1937.

They were modified by Smith in 1985 to become the &quot;modified Dandy criteria&quot;. Smith included the use of more advanced imaging: Dandy had required ventriculography, but Smith replaced this with computed tomography. In a 2001 paper, Digre and Corbett amended Dandy&#x27;s criteria further. They added the requirement that the person is awake and alert, as coma precludes adequate neurological assessment, and require exclusion of venous sinus thrombosis as an underlying cause. Furthermore, they added the requirement that no other cause for the raised ICP is found.

In a 2002 review, Friedman and Jacobson propose an alternative set of criteria, derived from Smith&#x27;s. These require the absence of symptoms that could not be explained by a diagnosis of IIH, but do not require the actual presence of any symptoms (such as headache) attributable to IIH. These criteria also require that the lumbar puncture is performed with the person lying sideways, as a lumbar puncture performed in the upright sitting position can lead to artificially high pressure measurements. Friedman and Jacobson also do not insist on MR venography for every person; rather, this is only required in atypical cases (see &quot;diagnosis&quot; above).

==Treatment==
The primary goal in treatment of IIH is the prevention of visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control. IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and IIH may resolve after initial treatment, may go into spontaneous remission (although it can still relapse at a later stage), or may continue chronically. There are three main treatment approaches: weight loss, different medications and surgical interventions. Remission is seen for most patients that achieve a weight loss of around 6–10%. Bariatric surgery can be an option for those patients that don&#x27;t achieve weight loss with lifestyle changes and diet.

===Lumbar puncture===

The first step in symptom control is drainage of cerebrospinal fluid by lumbar puncture. If necessary, this may be performed at the same time as a diagnostic LP (such as done in search of a CSF infection). In some cases, this is sufficient to control the symptoms, and no further treatment is needed.

The procedure can be repeated if necessary, but this is generally taken as a clue that additional treatments may be required to control the symptoms and preserve vision. Repeated lumbar punctures are regarded as unpleasant by people, and they present a danger of introducing spinal infections if done too often. Repeated lumbar punctures are sometimes needed to control the ICP urgently if the person&#x27;s vision deteriorates rapidly.

===Medication===
The best-studied medical treatment for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It can cause the symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since it has been shown to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.

Various analgesics (painkillers) may be used in controlling the headaches of intracranial hypertension. In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol, a low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.

The use of steroids in the attempt to reduce the ICP is controversial. These may be used in severe papilledema, but otherwise their use is discouraged.

===Venous sinus stenting===
Venous sinus stenoses leading to venous hypertension appear to play a significant part in relation to raised ICP, and stenting of a transverse sinus may resolve venous hypertension, leading to improved CSF resorption, decreased ICP, cure of papilledema and other symptoms of IIH.

A self-expanding metal stent is permanently deployed within the dominant transverse sinus across the stenosis under general anaesthesia. In general, people are discharged the next day. People require double antiplatelet therapy for a period of up to 3 months after the procedure and aspirin therapy for up to 1 year.

In a systematic analysis of 19 studies with 207 cases, there was an 87% improvement in overall symptom rate and 90% cure rate for treatment of papilledema. Major complications only occurred in 3/207 people (1.4%). In the largest single series of transverse sinus stenting there was an 11% rate of recurrence after one stent, requiring further stenting.

Due to the permanence of the stent and small but definite risk of complications, most experts will recommend that person with IIH must have papilledema and have failed medical therapy or are intolerant to medication before stenting is undertaken.

===Surgery===
Two main surgical procedures are used for the treatment of IIH: &quot;optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration&quot; and cerebral shunting. Surgery would normally only be offered if medical therapy is either unsuccessful or not tolerated. The choice between these two procedures depends on the predominant problem in IIH. Neither procedure is perfect: both may cause significant complications, and both may eventually fail in controlling the symptoms. There are no randomized controlled trials to guide the decision as to which procedure is best.

Optic nerve sheath fenestration is an operation that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, but it may be the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, and those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.

Shunt surgery, usually performed by neurosurgeons, involves the creation of a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. A pressure valve is usually included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the person is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion, usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a &quot;ventriculoatrial&quot; or &quot;ventriculoperitoneal shunt&quot; may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is possible that this procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.

It has been shown that in obese people, bariatric surgery (and especially gastric bypass surgery) can lead to resolution of the condition in over 95%.

==Prognosis==
It is not known what percentage of people with IIH will remit spontaneously, and what percentage will develop chronic disease.

IIH does not normally affect life expectancy. The major complications from IIH arise from untreated or treatment-resistant papilledema. In various case series, the long-term risk of one&#x27;s vision being significantly affected by IIH is reported to lie anywhere between 10 and 25%.

==Epidemiology==
On average, IIH occurs in about one per 100,000 people, and can occur in children and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are four to eight times more likely than men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.

Despite several reports of IIH in families, there is no known genetic cause for IIH. People from all ethnicities may develop IIH. In children, there is no difference in incidence between males and females.

From national hospital admission databases it appears that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath fenestration.

==History==
The first report of IIH was by the German physician Heinrich Quincke, who described it in 1893 under the name serous meningitis. The term &quot;pseudotumor cerebri&quot; was introduced in 1904 by his compatriot Max Nonne. Numerous other cases appeared in the literature subsequently; in many cases, the raised intracranial pressure may actually have resulted from underlying conditions. For instance, the otitic hydrocephalus reported by London neurologist Sir Charles Symonds may have resulted from venous sinus thrombosis caused by middle ear infection. Diagnostic criteria for IIH were developed in 1937 by the Baltimore neurosurgeon Walter Dandy; Dandy also introduced subtemporal decompressive surgery in the treatment of the condition.

The terms &quot;benign&quot; and &quot;pseudotumor&quot; derive from the fact that increased intracranial pressure may be associated with brain tumors. Those people in whom no tumour was found were therefore diagnosed with &quot;pseudotumor cerebri&quot; (a disease mimicking a brain tumor). The disease was renamed benign intracranial hypertension in 1955 to distinguish it from intracranial hypertension due to life-threatening diseases (such as cancer); however, this was also felt to be misleading because any disease that can blind someone should not be thought of as benign, and the name was therefore revised in 1989 to &quot;idiopathic (of no identifiable cause) intracranial hypertension&quot;.

Shunt surgery was introduced in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal shunts were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting. Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve fenestration (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.

<text>Plymouth Hoe, referred to locally as the Hoe, is a large south-facing open public space in the English coastal city of Plymouth. The Hoe is adjacent to and above the low limestone cliffs that form the seafront and it commands views of Plymouth Sound, Drake&#x27;s Island, and across the Hamoaze to Mount Edgcumbe in Cornwall. The name derives from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;hoh&quot;, a sloping ridge shaped like an inverted foot and heel (a term that survives in a few other placenames, notably Sutton Hoo).

==History==
 Until the early 17th century large outline images of the giants Gog and Magog (or Goemagot and Corineus) had for a long time been cut into the turf of the Hoe exposing the white limestone beneath. These figures were periodically re-cut and cleaned. No trace of them remains today, but this likely commemorates the Cornish foundation myth, being the point – &quot;Lam Goemagot&quot;, – from which the Giant was cast into the sea by the hero Corineus.

Plymouth Hoe is perhaps best known for the probably apocryphal story that Sir Francis Drake played his famous game of bowls here in 1588 while waiting for the tide to change before sailing out with the English fleet to engage with the Spanish Armada. The British Library holds a 1591 Spry map of Plimmouth from this era.

A Tudor fortress guarded the neck of water between the eastern Hoe and Mount Batten and some sheer granite and limestone cannon points remain, however in the late 1660s, following The Restoration, a massive star-shaped stone fortress known as the Royal Citadel, was constructed to replace it. Its purpose was to protect the port and probably also to intimidate the townsfolk who had leaned towards Parliament during the Civil War. It remains occupied by the military.
From 1880 there was a popular bandstand on the Hoe. It was removed for scrap metal during the Second World War and never rebuilt. A three tier belvedere built in 1891 survives; it was built on the site of a camera obscura, probably built in the 1830s, which showed views of the harbour. Below this site was the Bull Ring (now a memorial garden), and a grand pleasure pier, started in 1880, which provided a dance hall, refreshment, promenading and a landing place for boat trips. The pier was destroyed by German bombing in World War II.

There is an imposing series of Victorian terraces to the west of the naval memorial which previously continued to the Grand Hotel and, until it was destroyed by bombing, the grand clubhouse of the Royal Western Yacht Club. The club then merged with the Royal Southern and occupied that club&#x27;s older premises which it had created from the regency public steam baths by the basin at West Hoe before the rejuvenated club moved in the late 1980s to Queen Anne Battery.

A prominent landmark on the Hoe is Smeaton&#x27;s Tower. This is the upper portion of John Smeaton&#x27;s Eddystone Lighthouse, which was originally built on the Eddystone Rocks, located to the south, in 1759. It was dismantled in 1877 and moved, stone by stone, to the Hoe where it was re-erected.

Smeaton&#x27;s Tower overlooks Tinside Lido, a 1930s outdoor pool or lido which sits upon the limestone shoreline at the base of the cliff. Most of the works to create the swimming areas and Madeira Road were carried out to make work for the local unemployed during the Depression.

A statue of Sir Francis Drake by Joseph Boehm (a copy of the original in his home town of Tavistock) was placed here in 1884 to commemorate him. There are also several war memorials along the northern side of the Hoe. The largest commemorates the Royal Naval dead of the two world wars; its central obelisk is by Robert Lorimer and was unveiled in 1924, while the surrounding sunken garden was added by Edward Maufe in 1954. The Armada Memorial was opened in 1888 to celebrate the tercentenary of the Spanish Armada.

The Hoe also includes a long broad tarmacked promenade (currently a disabled motorists car park) which serves as a spectacular military parade ground and which is often used for displays by Plymouth-based Royal Navy, Royal Marines, the Army garrison, as well as for travelling funfairs and open-air concerts.

Set into the shape of the southern sea facing fortifications of the Royal Citadel is the Citadel Hill Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association of the UK, which also houses the Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science. Below and to the east, perched on the rocky foreshore is the clubhouse of the Royal Plymouth Corinthian Yacht Club.

==Tourism==

The Hoe is a popular area for Plymothians and visitors. There is always a great deal of activity on the water, including frequent warship movements, ferries going and coming from France and Spain, fishing trawlers and a swarm of larger and smaller sailing boats. The Fastnet yacht race ends here. The annual two-day British Firework Championships attracts tens of thousands of spectators.

For forty years, there has been controversy about development on the edges of the Hoe green space. The erection of two discount hotel chain buildings, at the southern end of Armada Way and the other at the Sound end of Leigham Street, contrast with their Victorian surroundings. The former Grand Hotel has been converted into apartments and the long derelict yacht club site has now been filled by a modern block of flats.

The Plymouth Dome, a turreted and domed building, built into a small old quarry site above Tinside as an historical theme tourist attraction, failed to obtain sufficient funding and closed in 2006, despite having been visited by 2.3 million people. Between 2013 and 2016 it was a restaurant owned by celebrity chef Gary Rhodes.
==Tombstoning==
In the early 21st century Plymouth Hoe became notorious for the practice of , which involves leaping feet-first into the sea from any accessible high point. This caused a number of serious injuries and deaths, leading to the dismantling of seafront diving boards and closure of parts of the waterfront to discourage the activity.

<text>Plymouth Sound, or locally just The Sound, is a deep inlet or sound in the English Channel near Plymouth in England.

== Description ==
Its southwest and southeast corners are Penlee Point in Cornwall and Wembury Point in Devon, a distance of about 3 nautical miles (6 km). Its northern limit is Plymouth Hoe giving a north–south distance of nearly 3 nautical miles (6 km).

The Sound has three water entrances. The marine entrance is from the English Channel to the south, with a deep-water channel to the west of the Plymouth Breakwater. There are two freshwater inlets: one, from the northwest, is from the River Tamar via the Hamoaze and Devonport Dockyard, the largest naval dockyard in western Europe. The other, at northeast, is from the River Plym disgorging into its narrow estuary, Cattewater harbour between Mount Batten and the Royal Citadel.

In the centre of the Sound, midway between Bovisand Bay and Cawsand Bay, is Plymouth Breakwater, which creates a harbour protecting anchored ships from the frequent south-western storms. The breakwater is around long, stands in around 11 metres / 36 feet of water and was built by John Rennie and Joseph Whidbey starting in 1812. The breakwater has a lighthouse on its western end and a beacon with a spherical cage on top at the eastern end. It is said that the cage is a lifesaving device designed to keep wrecked sailors from drowning in the huge waves of a storm on the low-lying breakwater.

Drake&#x27;s Island is 400 metres long and around 100 metres wide and situated at the north of the Sound. It was fortified to defend Drake&#x27;s Channel, the only deep-water route to Devonport. The &quot;Bridge&quot; is a shallow reef that links Drake&#x27;s Island and the Cornish mainland. At low water the depth of the Bridge can be less than one metre but at high water it can rise to 5 metres. In World War I this natural barrier was supplemented by other obstructions to prevent submarines and small ships attacking the naval base.

== Usage ==
In addition to ships of the Royal Navy, large commercial vessels, including ferries to France and Spain use the Sound from Millbay Docks. Fishing vessels use it from Sutton Harbour beside the old town of Plymouth, called the Barbican. There are marinas at Sutton Harbour, Mount Wise in the Hamoaze and at Turnchapel. Waterborne traffic in the Sound is controlled by the King’s Harbour Master for Plymouth.

== History ==

Mount Batten, a former Royal Air Force flying boat and search and rescue base, is located at the northeast corner of the Sound. T. E. Lawrence was stationed here as Aircraftman Shaw.

Over the years, the Sound has been defended by Drake&#x27;s Island, Picklecombe Fort, Cawsand Fort, the Breakwater Fort, Fort Bovisand, Staddon Fort and Stamford Fort.

A harbour and reservoir were built at Bovisand before the fort existed to supply men-o-war anchored in the Sound with fresh water. Joseph Whidbey supervised the building of the Breakwater from Bovisand Lodge, from which there is a view down the full length of the breakwater.

The &quot;Titanic&quot; was due to have docked here briefly on its return voyage to Britain, and the ship had a painting of Plymouth Sound on board.

As of 2019, there is a campaign to create the first National Marine Park in Britain off Plymouth Sound.

=== Notable events ===
* The English Fleet assembled in 1355: by Edward of Woodstock, the Black Prince, Duke of Cornwall, departed to the Battle of Poitiers
* The &quot;Pelican&quot; 15 November 1577: departed on Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s circumnavigation
* The &quot;Mayflower&quot; 1620, bearing the Pilgrim Fathers

* The ill-fated Cádiz expedition of 1625 and siege of Saint-Martin-de-Ré of 1627. Returning servicemen brought disease and looting to Plymouth reducing its population by over 20%
* The first recorded submarine fatality in history occurred in the Sound in June 1774, when a carpenter named John Day perished north of Drake&#x27;s Island while testing a wooden diving chamber attached to the sloop &quot;Maria&quot;.
* Following his surrender to Captain Frederick Maitland of off Rochefort in 1815, Napoleon was taken to Plymouth Sound where he remained on board, 26 July – 4 August, while his future was decided. This event caused a local and national sensation as thousands took to the water; several paintings in London&#x27;s National Maritime Museum document the event, such as the one shown here.
* On 27 December 1831, set off from anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe on the west side of Plymouth Sound, on her second survey voyage, captained by Robert FitzRoy with Charles Darwin on board.
* Departing on 27 August 1966 and arriving on 28 May 1967, Francis Chichester became the first person to sail single-handed around the world by the clipper route.

The Sound has been the site of a number of aircraft crashes and shipwrecks:
* &quot;Die Fraumetta Catharina von Flensburg&quot;, a 53-ton brigantine, sank near Drake&#x27;s Island in December 1786.
* P&amp;O ship &quot;Nepaul&quot; sank on the Shagstone in December 1890.
* A Short Sunderland flying boat crashed while landing in bad weather on 15 October 1939, killing four of the eleven passengers and crew. 
* A Short Sunderland flying boat crashed in March 1942 between the Breakwater Fort and the breakwater lighthouse killing five passengers.
* In February 1943, a Lancaster bomber hit the cable of a barrage balloon and crashed without survivors on the return from a raid on the U-boat pens at Lorient.
* In 1970, the &quot;Glen Strathallan&quot; luxury steam yacht was scuttled near the Shagstone as a site for scuba diving. This ship&#x27;s triple expansion steam engine is now on display in the Science Museum, London.

<text>Quentin Jerome Tarantino (; born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker, actor, and author. His films are characterized by stylized violence, extended dialogue often featuring much profanity, and references to popular culture. His work has earned a cult following alongside critical and commercial success; he has been named by some as the single most influential director of his generation and has received numerous awards and nominations, including two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards.

Tarantino began his career with the independent crime drama film &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (1992). His second film, the crime drama &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994), was a major success and won numerous awards, including the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He next wrote and starred in the action horror film &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; (1996). His third film as director, the crime drama &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997), paid homage to blaxploitation films.

Tarantino wrote and directed the martial arts films &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; (2003) and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; (2004), with both volumes combined regarded as a single film. He then made the exploitation-slasher film &quot;Death Proof&quot; (2007), which was part of a double feature with &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; director Robert Rodriguez, released under the collective title &quot;Grindhouse&quot;. His next film, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; (2009), followed an alternate account of World War II. He followed this with &quot;Django Unchained&quot; (2012), a slave revenge Spaghetti Western which won him his second Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. His eighth film, &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; (2015), was a revisionist Western thriller and opened to audiences with a roadshow release.

Tarantino&#x27;s most recent film, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; (2019), was a comedy-drama set in the late 1960s about the transition of Old Hollywood to New Hollywood; his debut novel, a novelization of the film, was published in 2021. He has said that, though it is not definite, his current plan is for his next film to be his last before he retires.

== Early life ==
Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, on March 27, 1963, the only child of Connie McHugh and aspiring actor Tony Tarantino, who left the family before his son&#x27;s birth. He has claimed to have Cherokee ancestry through his mother, who was also of Irish descent, while his father was Italian-American. He was named in part after Quint Asper, Burt Reynolds&#x27;s character in the TV series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;. Tarantino&#x27;s mother met his father during a trip to Los Angeles; after a brief marriage and divorce, she left Los Angeles and moved to Knoxville, where her parents lived, and returned to Los Angeles with her son in 1966.

Tarantino&#x27;s mother married musician Curtis Zastoupil soon after arriving in Los Angeles, and the family moved to nearby Torrance, California. Zastoupil accompanied Tarantino to numerous film screenings while his mother allowed him to see more mature movies, such as &quot;Carnal Knowledge&quot; (1971) and &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972). After his mother divorced Zastoupil in 1973 and received a misdiagnosis of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, Tarantino was again sent to live with his grandparents in Knoxville. Less than a year later, he returned to Torrance.

At the age of 14, Tarantino wrote one of his earliest works, a screenplay called &quot;Captain Peachfuzz and the Anchovy Bandit&quot; that was based on the 1977 film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;. He later revealed that his mother had ridiculed his writing skills when he was younger, and he subsequently vowed never to share any of his future wealth with her. As a 15-year-old, he was grounded by his mother for shoplifting Elmore Leonard&#x27;s novel &quot;The Switch&quot; from a Kmart. He was allowed to leave only to attend the Torrance Community Theater, where he participated in such plays as &quot;Two Plus Two Makes Sex&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The same year, he dropped out of Narbonne High School in Harbor City.

== Career ==
===1980–1989: Early jobs and screenplays===
Through the 1980s, Tarantino had a number of jobs. After lying about his age, he worked as an usher at an adult movie theater in Torrance, called the Pussycat Theater. He spent time as a recruiter in the aerospace industry, and for five years he worked at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California. He was well known in the local community for his film knowledge and video recommendations; Tarantino stated, &quot;When people ask me if I went to film school, I tell them, &#x27;No, I went to films.&quot; In 1986, Tarantino was employed in his first Hollywood job, working with Video Archives colleague Roger Avary, as production assistants on Dolph Lundgren&#x27;s exercise video, &quot;Maximum Potential&quot;.

Before working at Video Archives, Tarantino co-wrote &quot;Love Birds In Bondage&quot; with Scott Magill. Tarantino would go on to produce and direct the short film. Magill committed suicide in 1987, after which all film shot was destroyed. Later, Tarantino attended acting classes at the James Best Theatre Company, where he met several of his eventual collaborators for his next film. In 1987, Tarantino co-wrote and directed &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Birthday&quot; (1987). It was left uncompleted, but some of its dialogue was included in &quot;True Romance&quot;.

The following year, he played an Elvis impersonator in &quot;Sophia&#x27;s Wedding: Part 1&quot;, an episode in the fourth season of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, which was broadcast on November 19, 1988. Tarantino recalled that the pay he received for the part helped support him during the preproduction of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;; he estimated he was initially paid about $650 but went on to receive about $3,000 in residuals over three years because the episode was frequently rerun due to it being on a &quot;best of...&quot; lineup.

=== 1990–1999: Breakthrough and acclaim ===

After meeting Lawrence Bender at a friend&#x27;s barbecue, Tarantino discussed with him about an unwritten dialogue-driven heist film. Bender encouraged Tarantino to write the screenplay, which he wrote in three and a half weeks and presented to Bender unformatted. Impressed with the script, Bender managed to forward it through contacts to director Monte Hellman. Hellman cleaned up the screenplay and helped secure funding from Richard N. Gladstein at Live Entertainment (which later became Artisan, now known as Lionsgate). Harvey Keitel read the script and also contributed to the budget, taking a role as co-producer and also playing a major part in the picture. In January 1992, it was released as Tarantino&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;—which he wrote, directed, and acted in as Mr. Brown—and screened at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was an immediate hit, receiving a positive response from critics.

Tarantino&#x27;s screenplay &quot;True Romance&quot; was optioned and the film was eventually released in 1993. The second script that Tarantino sold was for the film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;, which was revised by Dave Veloz, Richard Rutowski and director Oliver Stone. Tarantino was given story credit and stated in an interview that he wished the film well, but later disowned the final film. Tarantino also did an uncredited rewrite on &quot;It&#x27;s Pat&quot; (1994). Other films where he was an uncredited screenwriter include &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Rock&quot; (1996).

Following the success of &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, Tarantino was approached by major film studios and offered projects that included &quot;Speed&quot; (1994) and &quot;Men in Black&quot; (1997), but he instead retreated to Amsterdam to work on his script for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Tarantino wrote, directed, and acted in the dark comedy crime film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in 1994, maintaining the stylized violence from his earlier film and also non-linear storylines. Tarantino received the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, which he shared with Roger Avary, who contributed to the story. He also received a nomination in the Best Director category. The film received another five nominations, including for Best Picture. Tarantino also won the for the film at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. The film grossed over $200 million and earned positive reviews.

In 1995, Tarantino participated in the anthology film &quot;Four Rooms&quot;, a collaboration that also included directors Robert Rodriguez, Allison Anders and Alexandre Rockwell. Tarantino directed and acted in the fourth segment of &quot;The Man from Hollywood&quot;, a tribute to the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; episode &quot;Man from the South&quot;. He joined Rodriguez again later in the year with a supporting role in &quot;Desperado&quot;. One of Tarantino&#x27;s first paid writing assignments was for &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot;, which Rodriguez directed later in 1996, re-teaming with Tarantino in another acting role, alongside Harvey Keitel, George Clooney and Juliette Lewis. His third feature film was &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; (1997), an adaptation of Elmore Leonard&#x27;s novel &quot;Rum Punch&quot;. A homage to blaxploitation films, it starred Pam Grier, who starred in many of the films of that genre in the 1970s. It received positive reviews and was called a &quot;comeback&quot; for Grier and co-star Robert Forster. Leonard considered &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; to be his favorite of the 26 different screen adaptations of his novels and short stories.

In the 1990s, Tarantino had a number of other minor acting roles, including in &quot;Eddie Presley&quot; (1992), &quot;The Coriolis Effect&quot; (1994), &quot;Sleep With Me&quot; (1994), &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; (1994), &quot;All-American Girl&quot; (1995), &quot;Destiny Turns on the Radio&quot; (1995), and &quot;Girl 6&quot; (1996). Also in 1996, he starred in &quot;Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Chair&quot;, a simulation video game that uses pre-generated film clips. In 1998, Tarantino made his major Broadway stage debut as an amoral psycho killer in a revival of the 1966 play &quot;Wait Until Dark&quot;, which received unfavorable reviews for his performance from critics.

=== 2000–2009: Subsequent success ===

Tarantino went on to write and direct &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, a highly stylized &quot;revenge flick&quot; in the cinematic traditions of Chinese martial arts films, Japanese period dramas, Spaghetti Westerns, and Italian horror. It was based on a character called The Bride and a plot that he and &quot;Kill Bill&quot;″s lead actress Uma Thurman had developed during the making of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. It was originally set for a single theatrical release, but its four-hour running time prompted Tarantino to divide it into two movies. Tarantino says he still considers it a single film in his overall filmography. &quot;Volume 1&quot; was released in 2003 and &quot;Volume 2&quot; was released in 2004.

From 2002 to 2004, Tarantino portrayed villain McKenas Cole in the ABC television series &quot;Alias&quot;. In 2004, Tarantino attended the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, where he served as president of the jury. &quot;Volume 2&quot; of &quot;Kill Bill&quot; had a screening there, but was not in competition. Tarantino then contributed to Robert Rodriguez&#x27;s 2005 neo-noir film &quot;Sin City&quot;, and was credited as &quot;Special Guest Director&quot; for his work directing the car sequence featuring Clive Owen and Benicio del Toro. In May 2005, Tarantino co-wrote and directed &quot;Grave Danger&quot;, the finale of &quot;&quot;. For this episode, Tarantino was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards.
In 2007, Tarantino directed the exploitation slasher film &quot;Death Proof&quot;. Released as a take on 1970s double features, under the banner &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, it was co-directed with Rodriguez who did the other feature which was the body horror film &quot;Planet Terror&quot;. Box-office sales were low but the film garnered mostly positive reviews.

Tarantino&#x27;s film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;, released in 2009, is the story of a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers in Nazi-occupied France in an alternate history of World War II. He had planned to start work on the film after &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; but postponed this to make &quot;Kill Bill&quot; after a meeting with Uma Thurman. Filming began on &quot;Inglorious Bastards&quot;, as it was provisionally titled, in October 2008. The film opened in August 2009 to positive reviews with the highest box office gross in the US and Canada for the weekend on release. For the film, Tarantino received his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

=== 2010–present: Established auteur ===

In 2011, production began on &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, a film about the revenge of a former slave in the Southern United States in 1858. The film stemmed from Tarantino&#x27;s desire to produce a Spaghetti Western set in America&#x27;s Deep South during the Antebellum Period. Tarantino called the proposed style &quot;a southern&quot;, stating that he wanted &quot;to do movies that deal with America&#x27;s horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they&#x27;re genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it&#x27;s ashamed of it, and other countries don&#x27;t really deal with because they don&#x27;t feel they have the right to&quot;. It was released in December 2012 and became his highest grossing film to date. He also received his second Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

In November 2013, Tarantino said he was working on a new film and that it would be another Western, though not a sequel to &quot;Django Unchained&quot;. On January 11, 2014, it was revealed that the film would be titled &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. The script was then leaked in January 2014. Aggrieved by the breach of confidence, Tarantino considered abandoning the production which was due to start the next winter and publish it as a novel instead. He stated that he had given the script to a few trusted colleagues, including Bruce Dern, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen.
On April 19, 2014, Tarantino directed a live reading of the leaked script at the United Artists Theater in the Ace Hotel Los Angeles for the &quot;Live Read&quot; series. Tarantino explained that they would read the first draft of the script, and added that he was writing two new drafts with a different ending. Filming went ahead as planned with the new draft in January 2015. &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot; was released on December 25, 2015, as a roadshow presentation in 70 mm film-format theaters, before being released in digital theaters on December 30, 2015. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics.
In July 2017, it was reported that Tarantino&#x27;s next project would be a film about the Manson Family murders. In February 2018, it was announced that the film&#x27;s title would be &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,&quot; and that Leonardo DiCaprio would play Rick Dalton, a fictional star of television Westerns, with Brad Pitt as Dalton&#x27;s longtime stunt double Cliff Booth; Margot Robbie would be playing real life actress Sharon Tate, portrayed as Dalton&#x27;s next-door neighbor. Filming took place in the summer of 2018. In wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Tarantino severed ties to The Weinstein Company and Miramax and sought a new distributor after working with Weinstein for his entire career. 

The film officially premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where it was in competition for the . Sony Pictures eventually distributed the film, which was theatrically released in July 2019. It received critical acclaim Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; declared, &quot;Tarantino&#x27;s all-star fantasia links Hollywood and Manson-era violence into the best and most explosive cinema we&#x27;ve seen all year.&quot; The film earned 10 Oscar nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards including three for Tarantino for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.

In November 2022, Tarantino revealed plans to shoot an eight-episode television series in 2023. No further details were provided. 

==== Tenth and final film ====
In 2009, Tarantino said that he planned to retire from filmmaking when he is 60 to focus on writing novels and film literature. He is skeptical of the film industry going digital, saying, &quot;If it actually gets to the place where you can&#x27;t show 35 mm film in theaters anymore and everything is digital projection, I won&#x27;t even make it to 60.&quot; He said though &quot;not etched in stone&quot; he intends to retire after making his tenth movie: &quot;If I get to the 10th, do a good job and don&#x27;t screw it up, well that sounds like a good way to end the old career.&quot; In January 2025, at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival, Tarantino said he was in &quot;no hurry&quot; to make his final film, preferring to wait at least a year, prioritizing to instead write a stage play.

=== As a producer ===
Tarantino has used his Hollywood power to give smaller and foreign films more attention. These films are often labeled &quot;Presented by Quentin Tarantino&quot; or &quot;Quentin Tarantino Presents&quot;. In 1995, Tarantino formed Rolling Thunder Pictures with Miramax to release or re-release several independent and foreign features. By 1997, Miramax had shut down the company due to poor sales. The following films were released by Rolling Thunder Pictures: &quot;Chungking Express&quot; (1994, dir. Wong Kar-wai), &quot;Switchblade Sisters&quot; (1975, dir. Jack Hill), &quot;Sonatine&quot; (1993, dir. Takeshi Kitano), &quot;Hard Core Logo&quot; (1996, dir. Bruce McDonald), &quot;The Mighty Peking Man&quot; (1977, dir. Ho Meng Hua), &quot;Detroit 9000&quot; (1973, dir. Arthur Marks), &quot;The Beyond&quot; (1981, dir. Lucio Fulci), and &quot;Curdled&quot; (1996, dir. Reb Braddock). 

In 2001, he produced the US release of the Hong Kong martial arts film &quot;Iron Monkey&quot;, which made over $14 million worldwide. In 2004, he brought the Chinese martial arts film &quot;Hero&quot; to the US. It opened at number-one at the box office and eventually earning $53.5 million. 

While Tarantino was in negotiations with Lucy Liu for &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, the two helped produce the Hungarian sports documentary &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Fury&quot;, which was released in 2006. When he was approached about a documentary about the Blood in the Water match, a water polo match between Hungary and the USSR at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, Tarantino said &quot;This is the best story I&#x27;ve ever been told. I&#x27;d love to be involved&quot;.

In 2006, another &quot;Quentin Tarantino presents&quot; production, &quot;Hostel&quot;, opened at number-one at the box office with a $20.1 million opening weekend. He presented 2006&#x27;s &quot;The Protector&quot;, and is a producer of the 2007 film &quot;&quot;. In 2008, he produced the Larry Bishop-helmed &quot;Hell Ride&quot;, a revenge biker film.

=== As a film exhibitor ===
In February 2010, Tarantino bought the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles. Tarantino allowed the previous owners to continue operating the theater, but stated he would make occasional programming suggestions. He was quoted as saying: &quot;As long as I&#x27;m alive, and as long as I&#x27;m rich, the New Beverly will be there, showing films shot on 35 mm.&quot; Starting in 2014, Tarantino took a more active role in programming film screenings at the New Beverly, showing his own films as well as prints from his personal collection. In 2021, Tarantino announced that he had also purchased the Vista Theatre in Los Angeles, stating that he intends to keep it a first-run theatre, and that like The New Beverly it will only show movies on film.

== Film criticism ==
In June 2020, Tarantino became an officially recognized critic on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes where his reviews are part of the &quot;Tomatometer&quot; rating. He has since published over 30 film reviews, including director essays, on his New Beverly Cinema website.&lt;ref name=&quot;archive.org/web/thenewbev&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarantino reappraises films that go against the views of mainstream film criticism, for example, he considers the 1983 film &quot;Psycho II&quot; to be superior to the original 1960 film &quot;Psycho&quot;. He is also among a few notable directors, including Martin Scorsese and Edgar Wright, who appreciate Elaine May&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Ishtar&quot;, despite its reputation as being a notorious box-office flop and one of the worst films ever made.

Tarantino has opined that Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; is &quot;the greatest movie of all time. Maybe not the best film, but the best movie ever made&quot;. He commented further that his &quot;favourite Spielberg-directed movie, again with &quot;Jaws&quot; carved out on its own Mount Rushmore, is &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; ... He pushes the envelope, he creates PG-13; a movie so fucking badass it created a new level in the MPAA.&quot;

== Filmmaking style and influence ==
=== Early influences ===

In the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; directors&#x27; poll, Tarantino listed his 12 favorite films: &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;, &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Pretty Maids All in a Row&quot;, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;, &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;.

Sergio Leone&#x27;s Spaghetti Western films were a profound influence including &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;. He is an admirer of the 1981 film &quot;Blow Out&quot;, directed by Brian De Palma, which led to his casting of John Travolta in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Similarly, Tarantino was captivated with Jim McBride&#x27;s 1983 remake of &quot;Breathless&quot; and with Richard Gere&#x27;s unlikable but charismatic protagonist. The film&#x27;s popular culture references, in particular the comic book Silver Surfer, inspired him to have the character&#x27;s poster on Mr. Orange&#x27;s apartment wall in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. Tarantino has also labeled &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; as one of his influences. He listed the Australian suspense film &quot;Roadgames&quot; (1981) as another favorite film.

Other films he cited as formative influences include Hong Kong martial arts films (such as &quot;Five Fingers of Death&quot; and &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;), John Woo action films (&quot;A Better Tomorrow II&quot; and &quot;The Killer&quot;), John Carpenter films (&quot;Assault on Precinct 13&quot; and &quot;The Thing&quot;), blaxploitation films (including &quot;The Mack&quot; and &quot;Foxy Brown&quot;), Jean-Luc Godard films (&quot;Bande à Part&quot; and the 1960 version of &quot;Breathless&quot;), and Sonny Chiba&#x27;s work (&quot;The Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Shadow Warriors&quot;).

In August 2007, while teaching in a four-hour film course during the 9th Cinemanila International Film Festival in Manila, Tarantino cited Filipino directors Cirio H. Santiago, Eddie Romero and Gerardo de León as personal icons from the 1970s. He referred to De Leon&#x27;s &quot;soul-shattering, life-extinguishing&quot; movies on vampires and female bondage, citing in particular &quot;Women in Cages&quot;; &quot;It is just harsh, harsh, harsh&quot;, he said, and described the final shot as one of &quot;devastating despair&quot;. Upon his arrival in the Philippines, Tarantino was quoted in the local newspaper as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a big fan of RP [Republic of the Philippines] cinema.&quot;

=== Style ===
Tarantino&#x27;s films often feature graphic violence, a tendency which has sometimes been criticized. &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; was initially denied United Kingdom certification because of his use of torture as entertainment. Tarantino has frequently defended his use of violence, saying that &quot;violence is so good. It affects audiences in a big way&quot;. When questioned in an interview for &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; why his movies contained so much graphic violence, he responded, &quot;Because it&#x27;s so much fun!&quot; The number of expletives and deaths in Tarantino&#x27;s films were measured by analytics website FiveThirtyEight. In the examples given by the site, &quot;&quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; features &#x27;just&#x27; 10 on-screen deaths, but 421 profanities. &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, on the other hand, has &#x27;just&#x27; 262 profanities but 47 deaths.&quot; He often blends aesthetic elements, in tribute to his favorite films and filmmakers. In &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, he melds comic strip formulas and visuals within a live action film sequence, in some cases by the literal use of cartoon or anime images.

Tarantino has also occasionally used a non-linear story structure in his films, most notably with &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; He has also used the style in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, &quot;Kill Bill&quot;, and &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. Tarantino&#x27;s script for &quot;True Romance&quot; was originally told in a non-linear style, before director Tony Scott decided to use a more linear approach. Critics have since referred to the use of this shifting timeline in films as the &quot;Tarantino Effect&quot;. Actor Steve Buscemi has described Tarantino&#x27;s novel style of filmmaking as &quot;bursting with energy&quot; and &quot;focused&quot;. According to Tarantino, a hallmark of all his movies is that there is a different sense of humor in each one, which prompts the viewer to laugh at scenes that are not funny. However, he insists that his films are dramas, not comedies.

Tarantino&#x27;s use of dialogue is noted for its mundane conversations with popular culture references. For example, when Jules and Vincent in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; are driving to a hit, they talk about Vincent&#x27;s trip to Europe, discussing the differences in countries such as a McDonald&#x27;s &quot;Quarter Pounder with Cheese&quot; being called a &quot;Royale with Cheese&quot; in France because of the metric system. In the opening scene to &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, Mr. Brown (played by Tarantino) interprets the meaning of Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;. In &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, Jackie and Max chat over a cup of coffee while listening to a vinyl record by the Delfonics&#x27; &quot;Didn&#x27;t I (Blow Your Mind This Time)&quot;.

Tarantino has said that his films take place in one of two cinematic universes, one being the more realistically grounded world of films like &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, and the other being a meta-fictional narrative which Tarantino says represents the kind of films the characters in his main cinematic universe would watch, which separates films such as &quot;From Dusk till Dawn&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill&quot; from Tarantino&#x27;s primary narrative. He also creates his own products and brands that he uses in his films to varying degrees. His own fictional brands, including &quot;Acuña Boys Tex-Mex Food&quot;, &quot;Big Kahuna Burger&quot;, &quot;G.O. Juice&quot;, &quot;Jack Rabbit Slim&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;K-Billy&quot;, &quot;Red Apple cigarettes&quot;, &quot;Tenku Brand Beer&quot; and &quot;Teriyaki Donut&quot;, replace the use of product placement, sometimes to a humorous extent. Tarantino is also known for his choice of music in his films, including soundtracks that often use songs from the 1960s and 70s. In 2011, he was recognized at the 16th Critics&#x27; Choice Awards with the inaugural Music+Film Award.

A recurring image in his films are scenes where women&#x27;s bare feet feature prominently. When asked about foot fetishism, Tarantino responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t take it seriously. There&#x27;s a lot of feet in a lot of good directors&#x27; movies. That&#x27;s just good direction. Like, before me, the person foot fetishism was defined by was Luis Buñuel, another film director. And Alfred Hitchcock was accused of it and Sofia Coppola has been accused of it.&quot;

Tarantino has stated in many interviews that his writing process is like writing a novel before formatting it into a script, saying that this creates the blueprint of the film and makes the film feel like literature. About his writing process he told website The Talks, &quot;My head is a sponge. I listen to what everyone says, I watch little idiosyncratic behavior, people tell me a joke and I remember it. People tell me an interesting story in their life and I remember it. ... when I go and write my new characters, my pen is like an antenna, it gets that information, and all of a sudden these characters come out more or less fully formed. I don&#x27;t write their dialogue, I get them talking to each other.&quot;

=== Collaborators ===
Tarantino has built up an informal &quot;repertory company&quot; of actors who have appeared in many roles in his films. Most notable of these is Samuel L. Jackson, who has appeared in five films directed by Tarantino and a sixth written by him, &quot;True Romance&quot;. Other frequent collaborators include Uma Thurman, who has been featured in three films and whom Tarantino has described as his &quot;muse&quot;; Zoë Bell, who has acted or performed stunts in seven Tarantino films; Michael Madsen, James Parks and Tim Roth, who respectively appear in five, four and three films. In addition, Roth appeared in &quot;Four Rooms&quot;, an anthology film where Tarantino directed the final segment, and filmed a scene for &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; before it was cut for time.

Other actors who have appeared in several films by Tarantino include Michael Bacall, Michael Bowen, Bruce Dern, Harvey Keitel, Michael Parks, Kurt Russell, and Craig Stark, who have appeared in three films each.

Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt have each appeared in two Tarantino films, the second of which, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, they appear in together. Like Jackson, Pitt also appeared in the Tarantino-penned &quot;True Romance&quot;. Christoph Waltz appeared in two Tarantino films, &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; and &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, winning a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for each role. Waltz had been working as an actor since the 1970s in numerous German movies and TV shows but was a relative unknown in America when he was cast as Hans Landa in his first film for Tarantino.

Editor Sally Menke, who worked on all Tarantino films until her death in 2010, was described by Tarantino in 2007 as &quot;hands down my number one collaborator&quot;.
== Controversies ==

=== Spike Lee criticisms ===
In 1997, Spike Lee questioned Tarantino&#x27;s use of racial slurs in his films, especially the N-word, particularly in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;. In a &quot;Variety&quot; interview discussing &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, Lee said, &quot;I&#x27;m not against the word ... And some people speak that way, but Quentin is infatuated with that word... I want Quentin to know that all African Americans do not think that word is trendy or slick.&quot; Tarantino responded on &quot;The Charlie Rose Show&quot;:

Tarantino said on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that Lee would have to &quot;stand on a chair to kiss [his] ass&quot;. Samuel L. Jackson, who has appeared in both directors&#x27; films, defended Tarantino. At the Berlin Film Festival, where &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; was screened, Jackson said: &quot;I don&#x27;t think the word is offensive in the context of this film ... Black artists think they are the only ones allowed to use the word. Well, that&#x27;s bull. &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; is a wonderful homage to black exploitation films. This is a good film, and Spike hasn&#x27;t made one of those in a few years.&quot; Tarantino argued that black audiences appreciated his blaxploitation-influenced films more than some of his critics, and that &quot;Jackie Brown&quot; was primarily made for black audiences.

&quot;Django Unchained&quot; was the subject of controversy because of its use of racial slurs and depiction of slavery. Reviewers defended the use of the language by pointing out the historic context of race and slavery in America. Lee, in an interview with &quot;Vibe&quot;, said that he would not see the film: &quot;All I&#x27;m going to say is that it&#x27;s disrespectful to my ancestors. That&#x27;s just me ... I&#x27;m not speaking on behalf of anybody else.&quot; Lee later tweeted: &quot;American slavery was not a Sergio Leone spaghetti western. It was a holocaust. My ancestors are slaves. Stolen from Africa. I will honor them.&quot;

=== Roman Polanski and Harvey Weinstein ===
In a 2003 Howard Stern interview, Tarantino defended the director Roman Polanski against charges that Polanski had raped then-13-year-old Samantha Geimer in 1977. He said that Polanski&#x27;s actions were &quot;not rape&quot; and Geimer &quot;...wanted to have it&quot;. The interview resurfaced in 2018 and drew criticism, including from Geimer, who stated in an interview, &quot;He was wrong. I bet he knows it... I hope he doesn&#x27;t make an ass of himself and keep talking that way.&quot; Within days of the interview resurfacing, Tarantino issued an apology, stating &quot;Fifteen years later, I realize how wrong I was... I incorrectly played devil&#x27;s advocate in the debate for the sake of being provocative.&quot;

On October 18, 2017, Tarantino gave an interview discussing sexual harassment and assault allegations against producer Harvey Weinstein. Tarantino said his then-girlfriend Mira Sorvino told him in the mid-1990s about her experience with Weinstein. Tarantino confronted Weinstein at the time and received an apology. Tarantino said: &quot;What I did was marginalize the incidents. I knew enough to do more than I did.&quot;

On February 3, 2018, in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Kill Bill&quot; actress Uma Thurman said Weinstein had sexually assaulted her, and that she had reported this to Tarantino. Tarantino said he confronted Weinstein, as he had previously when Weinstein made advances on his former partner, demanding he apologize. He banned him from contact with Thurman for the remainder of the film&#x27;s production. In a June 2021 interview on the &quot;Joe Rogan Experience&quot; podcast, Tarantino said he regretted not pressing Weinstein further, saying he did not know the extent of his misconduct before the 2017 scandal. He remarked on his &quot;sad&quot; view of his past relationship with Weinstein, saying he once looked up to him for fostering his career and describing him as &quot;a fucked up father figure&quot;.

=== Altercations with industry peers ===
In 1993, Tarantino sold his script for &quot;Natural Born Killers,&quot; which was rewritten, giving him only a story credit. He later disowned the film, which caused enmity and resulted in the publication of a &quot;tell-all&quot; book titled &quot;Killer Instinct&quot; by Jane Hamsher—who, with Don Murphy, had an original option on the screenplay and produced the film—calling Tarantino a &quot;one-trick pony&quot; and becoming &quot;famous for being famous.&quot; Tarantino physically assaulted Murphy in the AGO restaurant in West Hollywood, California in October 1997. Murphy subsequently filed a $5 million lawsuit against Tarantino; the case ended with the judge ordering Tarantino to pay Murphy $450.

In 1994, Tarantino had an on-set feud with Denzel Washington during the filming of &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; over what was described as &quot;Tarantino&#x27;s racist dialogue added to the script&quot;. A few years later Washington apologized to Tarantino saying he &quot;buried that hatchet&quot;.

In 1997, during the Oscars ceremony, Tarantino was accompanying Mira Sorvino when the then-MTV News host, Chris Connelly, called over to Sorvino from the media scrum. Before she could talk to Connelly, Tarantino grabbed Sorvino telling her, &quot;He&#x27;s the editor of &quot;Premiere&quot; and he did a story on my Dad,&quot; and pulled her away. Connelly, a former &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine editor-in-chief said, &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t.&quot; As they walked off, Tarantino gave the journalist the finger saying &quot;Fuck you!&quot; and spat at him. The article that angered Tarantino included a 1995 interview from a biography by Jami Bernard with his biological father, Tony Tarantino, someone he had never met, which he considered &quot;pretty tasteless&quot;.

In 2009, Tarantino was set to appear on the talk show &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to promote &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. A few years prior to this event, David Letterman had interviewed a former &quot;unnamed&quot; girlfriend of Tarantino on his show. Letterman joked about the relationship questioning why a &quot;glorious movie star&quot; would date a &quot;little squirrelly guy&quot;. A couple of days later, Tarantino phoned Letterman, screaming angrily, &quot;I&#x27;m going to beat you to death! I&#x27;m going to kill you! I&#x27;m coming to New York, and I&#x27;m gonna beat the crap out of you! How can you say that about me?!&quot; Letterman offered to pay for Tarantino&#x27;s flight and let him choose the method of fighting, which Tarantino determined would be &quot;bats&quot;. However, Letterman never heard from Tarantino again, until years later, when he came on the show to promote the new film. The host approached Tarantino in the make-up room, just before the show went live, and demanded an apology. Tarantino was not forthcoming, but at his publicist&#x27;s urging, he begrudgingly conceded.

In 2013, during an interview with Krishnan Guru-Murthy on &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; while promoting &quot;Django Unchained&quot; in the UK, Tarantino reacted angrily when he was questioned about whether there was a link between movie violence and real-life violence. He informed Guru-Murthy that he had commented on the subject many times before and did not need to explain again, therefore was &quot;shutting [his] butt down&quot;. Tarantino further defied the journalist, saying: &quot;I refuse your question. I&#x27;m not your slave and you&#x27;re not my master. You can&#x27;t make me dance to your tune. I&#x27;m not a monkey.&quot;

In 2019, during the Cannes Film Festival, at the &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; press conference, a journalist asked why Margot Robbie had so few lines in the film. Tarantino responded indignantly &quot;I just reject your hypothesis&quot;, with no further comment.

==Other work==

=== Books === 
In 2020, Tarantino signed a two-book deal with HarperCollins.&quot;&quot; He published his first novel in June 2021, a novelization of &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;. It received positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The second book titled &quot;Cinema Speculation&quot;, about films of the New Hollywood era, inspired by film critic Pauline Kael was published on November 1, 2022.

=== Podcast ===
In June 2021, Tarantino announced plans to start a podcast with Roger Avary. The podcast is named after Video Archives, a video rental store that both directors had worked at prior to their film careers, and will feature the directors, and a guest, examining a film which could have been offered for rental at the store. The podcast premiered on July 19, 2022.

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships and marriage ===
In the early 1990s, Tarantino dated comedians Margaret Cho and Kathy Griffin. From 1995 to 1998 he dated actress Mira Sorvino. He was her date at the 68th Oscars ceremony where she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In March 1998 they separated, with Sorvino releasing a statement that &quot;[We] still love each other very much&quot; but had reached a &quot;mutual decision to go their separate ways.&quot; From 2003 to 2005, Tarantino was in a romantic relationship with filmmaker Sofia Coppola. The two have remained friends since their breakup.

On June 30, 2017, Tarantino became engaged to Israeli singer Daniella Pick, daughter of musician Zvika Pick. They met in 2009 when Tarantino was in Israel to promote &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;. They married on November 28, 2018, in a Reform Jewish ceremony in their Beverly Hills Home. As of January 2020, they were splitting their time between the Ramat Aviv Gimel neighborhood of Tel Aviv and Los Angeles. As a result, he is trying to learn Hebrew. On February 22, 2020, their son was born in Israel. On July 3, 2022, their second child, a daughter, was also born in Israel.

=== Political views ===
In 2015, Tarantino said that Barack Obama is his favorite president and voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement.
In response to the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Tarantino visited a military base in southern Israel to &quot;boost the morale&quot; of Israeli troops.

In August 2024, Tarantino expressed his intention to vote for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election on Bill Maher&#x27;s podcast &quot;Club Random&quot;.

=== Faith and religious views ===
As a youth, Tarantino attended an Evangelical church, describing himself as &quot;baptized, born again and everything in between&quot;. Tarantino said this was an act of rebellion against his Catholic mother as she had encouraged what might usually be considered more conventional forms of rebellion, such as his interests in comic books and horror films. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Tarantino was evasive about his religious beliefs but said he believed in God, whom he credited with giving him his writing ability.

In the 2010s, Tarantino continued ascribing his talents to gifts from God but expressed uncertainty regarding God&#x27;s existence. &quot;I think I was born Catholic, but I was never practiced,&quot; said Tarantino. &quot;As time has gone on, as I&#x27;ve become a man and made my way further as an adult, I&#x27;m not sure how much any of that I believe in. I don&#x27;t really know if I believe in God, especially not in this Santa Claus character that people seemed to have conjured up.&quot; In June 2021, Tarantino said he was an atheist.

=== Views on gun violence and police brutality ===
Tarantino has said he does not believe that violence in film inspires real acts of violence. In an interview with Terry Gross, Tarantino expressed &quot;annoyance&quot; at the suggestion that there is a link between the two, saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s disrespectful to [the] memory of those who died to talk about movies ... Obviously the issue is gun control and mental health.&quot;

In October 2015, Tarantino attended a rally held in New York protesting police brutality. The event aimed to call attention to &quot;police brutality and its victims&quot;. At the event Tarantino made a speech, &quot;I&#x27;m a human being with a conscience ... And when I see murder I cannot stand by. And I have to call the murdered the murdered and I have to call the murderers the murderers.&quot;

As a response to Tarantino&#x27;s comments police unions across the United States called for a boycott of his upcoming film at the time, &quot;The Hateful Eight&quot;. Patrick J. Lynch, union president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, said, &quot;It&#x27;s no surprise that someone who makes a living glorifying crime and violence is a cop-hater, too. The police officers that Quentin Tarantino calls &#x27;murderers&#x27; aren&#x27;t living in one of his depraved big screen fantasies — they&#x27;re risking and sometimes sacrificing their lives to protect communities from real crime and mayhem.&quot; The Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said Tarantino &quot;doesn&#x27;t understand the nature of the violence. Mr. Tarantino lives in a fantasy world. That&#x27;s how he makes his living. His movies are extremely violent, but he doesn&#x27;t understand violence. … Unfortunately, he mistakes lawful use of force for murder, and it&#x27;s not.&quot;

Tarantino&#x27;s response to this criticism was, &quot;All cops are not murderers ... I never said that. I never even implied that.&quot; In an MSNBC interview with Chris Hayes, he said, &quot;Just because I was at an anti-police brutality protest doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m anti-police.&quot; He clarified his protest comments, &quot;We were at a rally where unarmed people – mostly black and brown – who have been shot and killed or beaten or strangled by the police, and I was obviously referring to the people in those types of situations. I was referring to Eric Garner, I was referring to Sam DuBose, I was referring to Antonio Guzman Lopez, I was referring to Tamir Rice ... In those cases in particular that we&#x27;re talking about, I actually do believe that they were murder.&quot;

== Filmography ==
Tarantino has stated that he plans to make a total of just ten films before retiring as a director, as a means of ensuring an overall high quality within his filmography. He believes &quot;most directors have horrible last movies,&quot; that ending on a &quot;decent movie is rare,&quot; and that ending on a &quot;good movie is kind of phenomenal.&quot; Tarantino considers &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot; to be a single movie.

== Awards, honors and recognition ==

Tarantino and his films have received numerous nominations for major awards, including Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, Golden Globe Awards, Directors Guild of America Awards, and Saturn Awards. He has won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay twice, for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and &quot;Django Unchained&quot;. He has been nominated four times for the at the Cannes Film Festival, winning once for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in 1994. In addition to his recognition for writing and directing films, Tarantino has received five Grammy Award nominations and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

In 2005, Tarantino was awarded the honorary Icon of the Decade at the 10th Empire Awards. He has received lifetime achievement awards from two organizations, Cinemanila, and from the Rome Film Festival in 2012. In 2011, Tarantino was given an Honorary César by the .

For his work on &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, Tarantino became the first director to ever sweep &quot;The Big Four&quot; critics awards (LA, NBR, NY, NSFC) and the first of the five directors (including Curtis Hanson, Steven Soderbergh, David Fincher, and Barry Jenkins) to do so as of 2025.
=== Recognition ===
During his career, Tarantino&#x27;s films have garnered a cult following, as well as critical and commercial success. In 2005, he was included on the annual &quot;Time&quot; 100 list of the most influential people in the world. He was also on &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; list of &quot;Top 100 Living Geniuses&quot; in 2007. Filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich has called him &quot;the single most influential director of his generation&quot;. Tarantino has received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the film industry.

In 2013, a survey of seven academics was carried out to discover which filmmakers had been referenced the most in essays and dissertations on film that had been marked in the previous five years. It revealed that Tarantino was the most-studied director in the United Kingdom, ahead of Alfred Hitchcock, Christopher Nolan, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg.

<doc id="25170" wikidata="Q2786686" url="?curid=25170" title="Quartile">
<text>In statistics, quartiles are a type of quantiles which divide the number of data points into four parts, or &quot;quarters&quot;, of more-or-less equal size. The data must be ordered from smallest to largest to compute quartiles; as such, quartiles are a form of order statistic. The three quartiles, resulting in four data divisions, are as follows:
* The first quartile (&quot;Q&quot;1) is defined as the 25th percentile where lowest 25% data is below this point. It is also known as the &quot;lower&quot; quartile.
* The second quartile (&quot;Q&quot;2) is the median of a data set; thus 50% of the data lies below this point.
* The third quartile (&quot;Q&quot;3) is the 75th percentile where lowest 75% data is below this point. It is known as the &quot;upper&quot; quartile, as 75% of the data lies below this point.
Along with the minimum and maximum of the data (which are also quartiles), the three quartiles described above provide a five-number summary of the data. This summary is important in statistics because it provides information about both the center and the spread of the data. Knowing the lower and upper quartile provides information on how big the spread is and if the dataset is skewed toward one side. Since quartiles divide the number of data points evenly, the range is generally not the same between adjacent quartiles (i.e. usually (&quot;Q&quot;3 - &quot;Q&quot;2) ≠ (&quot;Q&quot;2 - &quot;Q&quot;1)). Interquartile range (IQR) is defined as the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles or &quot;Q&quot;3 - &quot;Q&quot;1. While the maximum and minimum also show the spread of the data, the upper and lower quartiles can provide more detailed information on the location of specific data points, the presence of outliers in the data, and the difference in spread between the middle 50% of the data and the outer data points.

=== Discrete distributions ===
For discrete distributions, there is no universal agreement on selecting the quartile values.

==== Method 1 ====

# Use the median to divide the ordered data set into two halves. The median becomes the second quartile.
#* If there are an odd number of data points in the original ordered data set, do not include the median (the central value in the ordered list) in either half.
#* If there are an even number of data points in the original ordered data set, split this data set exactly in half.
# The lower quartile value is the median of the lower half of the data. The upper quartile value is the median of the upper half of the data.
This rule is employed by the TI-83 calculator boxplot and &quot;1-Var Stats&quot; functions.

==== Method 2 ====

# Use the median to divide the ordered data set into two halves. The median becomes the second quartile.
#* If there are an odd number of data points in the original ordered data set, include the median (the central value in the ordered list) in both halves.
#* If there are an even number of data points in the original ordered data set, split this data set exactly in half.
# The lower quartile value is the median of the lower half of the data. The upper quartile value is the median of the upper half of the data.
The values found by this method are also known as &quot;Tukey&#x27;s hinges&quot;; see also midhinge.

==== Method 3 ====

# Use the median to divide the ordered data set into two halves. The median becomes the second quartile.
#* If there are odd numbers of data points, then go to the next step.
#* If there are even numbers of data points, then the Method 3 starts off the same as the Method 1 or the Method 2 above and you can choose to include or not include the median as a new datapoint. If you choose to include the median as the new datapoint, then proceed to the step 2 or 3 below because you now have an odd number of datapoints. If you do not choose the median as the new data point, then continue the Method 1 or 2 where you have started. 
# If there are (4&quot;n&quot;+1) data points, then the lower quartile is 25% of the &quot;n&quot;th data value plus 75% of the (&quot;n&quot;+1)th data value; the upper quartile is 75% of the (3&quot;n&quot;+1)th data point plus 25% of the (3&quot;n&quot;+2)th data point.
# If there are (4&quot;n&quot;+3) data points, then the lower quartile is 75% of the (&quot;n&quot;+1)th data value plus 25% of the (&quot;n&quot;+2)th data value; the upper quartile is 25% of the (3&quot;n&quot;+2)th data point plus 75% of the (3&quot;n&quot;+3)th data point.

==== Method 4 ====
If we have an ordered dataset formula_1, then we can interpolate between data points to find the formula_2th empirical quantile if formula_3 is in the formula_4 quantile. If we denote the integer part of a number formula_5 by formula_6, then the empirical quantile function is given by,

formula_7,

formula_8 is the last data point in quartile &quot;p&quot;, and formula_9 is the first data point in quartile &quot;p&quot;+1.

formula_10 measures where the quartile falls between formula_8 and formula_9. If formula_10 = 0 then the quartile falls exactly on formula_8. If formula_10 = 0.5 then the quartile falls exactly half way between formula_8 and formula_9. 

formula_7,

where formula_19 and formula_20.

To find the first, second, and third quartiles of the dataset we would evaluate formula_21, formula_22, and formula_23 respectively.

==== Example 1 ====
Ordered Data Set (of an odd number of data points): 6, 7, 15, 36, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 47, 49.

The bold number (40) is the median splitting the data set into two halves with equal number of data points.
==== Example 2 ====
Ordered Data Set (of an even number of data points): 7, 15, 36, 39, 40, 41.

The bold numbers (36, 39) are used to calculate the median as their average. As there are an even number of data points, the first three methods all give the same results. (The Method 3 is executed such that the median is not chosen as a new data point and the Method 1 started.)
=== Continuous probability distributions ===

If we define a continuous probability distributions as formula_24 where formula_25 is a real valued random variable, its cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given by

formula_26.

The CDF gives the probability that the random variable formula_25 is less than or equal to the value formula_28. Therefore, the first quartile is the value of formula_28 when formula_30, the second quartile is formula_28 when formula_32, and the third quartile is formula_28 when formula_34. The values of formula_28 can be found with the quantile function formula_36 where formula_37 for the first quartile, formula_38 for the second quartile, and formula_39 for the third quartile. The quantile function is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function if the cumulative distribution function is monotonically increasing because the one-to-one correspondence between the input and output of the cumulative distribution function holds.

== Outliers ==
There are methods by which to check for outliers in the discipline of statistics and statistical analysis. Outliers could be a result from a shift in the location (mean) or in the scale (variability) of the process of interest. Outliers could also be evidence of a sample population that has a non-normal distribution or of a contaminated population data set. Consequently, as is the basic idea of descriptive statistics, when encountering an outlier, we have to explain this value by further analysis of the cause or origin of the outlier. In cases of extreme observations, which are not an infrequent occurrence, the typical values must be analyzed. The Interquartile Range (IQR), defined as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles (formula_40), may be used to characterize the data when there may be extremities that skew the data; the interquartile range is a relatively robust statistic (also sometimes called &quot;resistance&quot;) compared to the range and standard deviation. There is also a mathematical method to check for outliers and determining &quot;fences&quot;, upper and lower limits from which to check for outliers.

After determining the first (lower) and third (upper) quartiles (formula_41 and formula_42 respectively) and the interquartile range (formula_43) as outlined above, then fences are calculated using the following formula:

: formula_44
: formula_45

The lower fence is the &quot;lower limit&quot; and the upper fence is the &quot;upper limit&quot; of data, and any data lying outside these defined bounds can be considered an outlier. The fences provide a guideline by which to define an outlier, which may be defined in other ways. The fences define a &quot;range&quot; outside which an outlier exists; a way to picture this is a boundary of a fence. It is common for the lower and upper fences along with the outliers to be represented by a boxplot. For the boxplot shown on the right, only the vertical heights correspond to the visualized data set while horizontal width of the box is irrelevant. Outliers located outside the fences in a boxplot can be marked as any choice of symbol, such as an &quot;x&quot; or &quot;o&quot;. The fences are sometimes also referred to as &quot;whiskers&quot; while the entire plot visual is called a &quot;box-and-whisker&quot; plot.

When spotting an outlier in the data set by calculating the interquartile ranges and boxplot features, it might be easy to mistakenly view it as evidence that the population is non-normal or that the sample is contaminated. However, this method should not take place of a hypothesis test for determining normality of the population. The significance of the outliers varies depending on the sample size. If the sample is small, then it is more probable to get interquartile ranges that are unrepresentatively small, leading to narrower fences. Therefore, it would be more likely to find data that are marked as outliers.

== Computer software for quartiles ==
=== Excel ===
The Excel function &quot;QUARTILE.INC(array, quart)&quot; provides the desired quartile value for a given array of data, using Method 3 from above. The &quot;QUARTILE&quot; function is a legacy function from Excel 2007 or earlier, giving the same output of the function &quot;QUARTILE.INC&quot;. In the function, &quot;array&quot; is the dataset of numbers that is being analyzed and &quot;quart&quot; is any of the following 5 values depending on which quartile is being calculated. 
=== MATLAB ===
In order to calculate quartiles in Matlab, the function &quot;quantile&quot;(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;p&quot;) can be used. Where &quot;A&quot; is the vector of data being analyzed and &quot;p&quot; is the percentage that relates to the quartiles as stated below.

<doc id="25175" wikidata="Q41299" url="?curid=25175" title="Quadratic equation">
<text>In mathematics, a quadratic equation () is an equation that can be rearranged in standard form as
formula_1
where the variable represents an unknown number, and , , and represent known numbers, where . (If and then the equation is linear, not quadratic.) The numbers , , and are the &quot;coefficients&quot; of the equation and may be distinguished by respectively calling them, the &quot;quadratic coefficient&quot;, the &quot;linear coefficient&quot; and the &quot;constant coefficient&quot; or &quot;free term&quot;.

The values of that satisfy the equation are called &quot;solutions&quot; of the equation, and &quot;roots&quot; or &quot;zeros&quot; of the quadratic function on its left-hand side. A quadratic equation has at most two solutions. If there is only one solution, one says that it is a double root. If all the coefficients are real numbers, there are either two real solutions, or a single real double root, or two complex solutions that are complex conjugates of each other. A quadratic equation always has two roots, if complex roots are included and a double root is counted for two. A quadratic equation can be factored into an equivalent equation 
formula_2
where and are the solutions for . 

The quadratic formula
formula_3
expresses the solutions in terms of , , and . Completing the square is one of several ways for deriving the formula.

Solutions to problems that can be expressed in terms of quadratic equations were known as early as 2000 BC.

Because the quadratic equation involves only one unknown, it is called &quot;univariate&quot;. The quadratic equation contains only powers of that are non-negative integers, and therefore it is a polynomial equation. In particular, it is a second-degree polynomial equation, since the greatest power is two.

==Solving the quadratic equation==

A quadratic equation whose coefficients are real numbers can have either zero, one, or two distinct real-valued solutions, also called &quot;roots&quot;. When there is only one distinct root, it can be interpreted as two roots with the same value, called a double root. When there are no real roots, the coefficients can be considered as complex numbers with zero imaginary part, and the quadratic equation still has two complex-valued roots, complex conjugates of each-other with a non-zero imaginary part. A quadratic equation whose coefficients are arbitrary complex numbers always has two complex-valued roots which may or may not be distinct.

The solutions of a quadratic equation can be found by several alternative methods.

===Factoring by inspection===
It may be possible to express a quadratic equation as a product . In some cases, it is possible, by simple inspection, to determine values of &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r,&quot; and &quot;s&quot; that make the two forms equivalent to one another. If the quadratic equation is written in the second form, then the &quot;Zero Factor Property&quot; states that the quadratic equation is satisfied if or . Solving these two linear equations provides the roots of the quadratic.

For most students, factoring by inspection is the first method of solving quadratic equations to which they are exposed. If one is given a quadratic equation in the form , the sought factorization has the form , and one has to find two numbers and that add up to and whose product is (this is sometimes called &quot;Vieta&#x27;s rule&quot; and is related to Vieta&#x27;s formulas). As an example, factors as . The more general case where does not equal can require a considerable effort in trial and error guess-and-check, assuming that it can be factored at all by inspection.

Except for special cases such as where or , factoring by inspection only works for quadratic equations that have rational roots. This means that the great majority of quadratic equations that arise in practical applications cannot be solved by factoring by inspection.

===Completing the square===
The process of completing the square makes use of the algebraic identity
formula_4
which represents a well-defined algorithm that can be used to solve any quadratic equation. Starting with a quadratic equation in standard form, 
#Divide each side by , the coefficient of the squared term.
#Subtract the constant term from both sides.
#Add the square of one-half of , the coefficient of , to both sides. This &quot;completes the square&quot;, converting the left side into a perfect square.
#Write the left side as a square and simplify the right side if necessary.
#Produce two linear equations by equating the square root of the left side with the positive and negative square roots of the right side.
#Solve each of the two linear equations.

We illustrate use of this algorithm by solving 
formula_5
formula_6
formula_7
formula_8
formula_9
formula_10
formula_11

The plus–minus symbol &quot;±&quot; indicates that both formula_12 and formula_13 are solutions of the quadratic equation.

=== Quadratic formula and its derivation ===

Completing the square can be used to derive a general formula for solving quadratic equations, called the quadratic formula. The mathematical proof will now be briefly summarized. It can easily be seen, by polynomial expansion, that the following equation is equivalent to the quadratic equation:
formula_14
Taking the square root of both sides, and isolating , gives:
formula_15

Some sources, particularly older ones, use alternative parameterizations of the quadratic equation such as or  , where has a magnitude one half of the more common one, possibly with opposite sign. These result in slightly different forms for the solution, but are otherwise equivalent.

A number of alternative derivations can be found in the literature. These proofs are simpler than the standard completing the square method, represent interesting applications of other frequently used techniques in algebra, or offer insight into other areas of mathematics.

A lesser known quadratic formula, as used in Muller&#x27;s method, provides the same roots via the equation
formula_16 
This can be deduced from the standard quadratic formula by Vieta&#x27;s formulas, which assert that the product of the roots is . It also follows from dividing the quadratic equation by formula_17 giving formula_18 solving this for formula_19 and then inverting.

One property of this form is that it yields one valid root when , while the other root contains division by zero, because when , the quadratic equation becomes a linear equation, which has one root. By contrast, in this case, the more common formula has a division by zero for one root and an indeterminate form for the other root. On the other hand, when , the more common formula yields two correct roots whereas this form yields the zero root and an indeterminate form .

When neither nor is zero, the equality between the standard quadratic formula and Muller&#x27;s method,
formula_20
can be verified by cross multiplication, and similarly for the other choice of signs.

===Reduced quadratic equation===
It is sometimes convenient to reduce a quadratic equation so that its leading coefficient is one. This is done by dividing both sides by , which is always possible since is non-zero. This produces the &quot;reduced quadratic equation&quot;:

formula_21

where and . This monic polynomial equation has the same solutions as the original.

The quadratic formula for the solutions of the reduced quadratic equation, written in terms of its coefficients, is
formula_22

===Discriminant===

In the quadratic formula, the expression underneath the square root sign is called the &quot;discriminant&quot; of the quadratic equation, and is often represented using an upper case or an upper case Greek delta:
formula_23
A quadratic equation with &quot;real&quot; coefficients can have either one or two distinct real roots, or two distinct complex roots. In this case the discriminant determines the number and nature of the roots. There are three cases:

*If the discriminant is positive, then there are two distinct roots formula_24 both of which are real numbers. For quadratic equations with rational coefficients, if the discriminant is a square number, then the roots are rational—in other cases they may be quadratic irrationals.
*If the discriminant is zero, then there is exactly one real root formula_25 sometimes called a repeated or double root or two equal roots.
*If the discriminant is negative, then there are no real roots. Rather, there are two distinct (non-real) complex rootsformula_26 which are complex conjugates of each other. In these expressions is the imaginary unit.

Thus the roots are distinct if and only if the discriminant is non-zero, and the roots are real if and only if the discriminant is non-negative.

===Geometric interpretation===

The function is a quadratic function. The graph of any quadratic function has the same general shape, which is called a parabola. The location and size of the parabola, and how it opens, depend on the values of , , and . If , the parabola has a minimum point and opens upward. If , the parabola has a maximum point and opens downward. The extreme point of the parabola, whether minimum or maximum, corresponds to its vertex. The &quot;-coordinate&quot; of the vertex will be located at formula_27, and the &quot;-coordinate&quot; of the vertex may be found by substituting this &quot;-value&quot; into the function. The &quot;-intercept&quot; is located at the point .

The solutions of the quadratic equation correspond to the roots of the function , since they are the values of for which . If , , and are real numbers and the domain of is the set of real numbers, then the roots of are exactly the -coordinates of the points where the graph touches the -axis. If the discriminant is positive, the graph touches the -axis at two points; if zero, the graph touches at one point; and if negative, the graph does not touch the -axis.

===Quadratic factorization===
The term
formula_28
is a factor of the polynomial
formula_29
if and only if is a root of the quadratic equation
formula_30
It follows from the quadratic formula that
formula_31
In the special case where the quadratic has only one distinct root (&quot;i.e.&quot; the discriminant is zero), the quadratic polynomial can be factored as
formula_32

===Graphical solution===

The solutions of the quadratic equation 
formula_33
may be deduced from the graph of the quadratic function
formula_34
which is a parabola.

If the parabola intersects the -axis in two points, there are two real roots, which are the -coordinates of these two points (also called -intercept).

If the parabola is tangent to the -axis, there is a double root, which is the -coordinate of the contact point between the graph and parabola.

If the parabola does not intersect the -axis, there are two complex conjugate roots. Although these roots cannot be visualized on the graph, their real and imaginary parts can be.

Let and be respectively the -coordinate and the -coordinate of the vertex of the parabola (that is the point with maximal or minimal -coordinate. The quadratic function may be rewritten
formula_35
Let be the distance between the point of -coordinate on the axis of the parabola, and a point on the parabola with the same -coordinate (see the figure; there are two such points, which give the same distance, because of the symmetry of the parabola). Then the real part of the roots is , and their imaginary part are . That is, the roots are 
formula_36
or in the case of the example of the figure
formula_37

===Avoiding loss of significance===
Although the quadratic formula provides an exact solution, the result is not exact if real numbers are approximated during the computation, as usual in numerical analysis, where real numbers are approximated by floating point numbers (called &quot;reals&quot; in many programming languages). In this context, the quadratic formula is not completely stable.

This occurs when the roots have different order of magnitude, or, equivalently, when and are close in magnitude. In this case, the subtraction of two nearly equal numbers will cause loss of significance or catastrophic cancellation in the smaller root. To avoid this, the root that is smaller in magnitude, , can be computed as formula_38 where is the root that is bigger in magnitude. This is equivalent to using the formula

formula_39

using the plus sign if formula_40 and the minus sign if formula_41

A second form of cancellation can occur between the terms and of the discriminant, that is when the two roots are very close. This can lead to loss of up to half of correct significant figures in the roots.

==Examples and applications==

The golden ratio is found as the positive solution of the quadratic equation formula_42

The equations of the circle and the other conic sections—ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas—are quadratic equations in two variables.

Given the cosine or sine of an angle, finding the cosine or sine of the angle that is half as large involves solving a quadratic equation.

The process of simplifying expressions involving the square root of an expression involving the square root of another expression involves finding the two solutions of a quadratic equation.

Descartes&#x27; theorem states that for every four kissing (mutually tangent) circles, their radii satisfy a particular quadratic equation.

The equation given by Fuss&#x27; theorem, giving the relation among the radius of a bicentric quadrilateral&#x27;s inscribed circle, the radius of its circumscribed circle, and the distance between the centers of those circles, can be expressed as a quadratic equation for which the distance between the two circles&#x27; centers in terms of their radii is one of the solutions. The other solution of the same equation in terms of the relevant radii gives the distance between the circumscribed circle&#x27;s center and the center of the excircle of an ex-tangential quadrilateral.

Critical points of a cubic function and inflection points of a quartic function are found by solving a quadratic equation.

In physics, for motion with constant acceleration formula_43, the displacement or position formula_44 of a moving body can be expressed as a quadratic function of time formula_45 given the initial position formula_46 and initial velocity formula_47: formula_48.

In chemistry, the pH of a solution of weak acid can be calculated from the negative base-10 logarithm of the positive root of a quadratic equation in terms of the acidity constant and the analytical concentration of the acid.

==History==
Babylonian mathematicians, as early as 2000 BC (displayed on Old Babylonian clay tablets) could solve problems relating the areas and sides of rectangles. There is evidence dating this algorithm as far back as the Third Dynasty of Ur. In modern notation, the problems typically involved solving a pair of simultaneous equations of the form:
formula_49
which is equivalent to the statement that and are the roots of the equation:
formula_50

The steps given by Babylonian scribes for solving the above rectangle problem, in terms of and , were as follows:
#Compute half of &quot;p&quot;.
#Square the result.
#Subtract &quot;q&quot;.
#Find the (positive) square root using a table of squares.
#Add together the results of steps (1) and (4) to give .
In modern notation this means calculating formula_51, which is equivalent to the modern day quadratic formula for the larger real root (if any) formula_52 with , , and .

Geometric methods were used to solve quadratic equations in Babylonia, Egypt, Greece, China, and India. The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, dating back to the Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation. Babylonian mathematicians from circa 400 BC and Chinese mathematicians from circa 200 BC used geometric methods of dissection to solve quadratic equations with positive roots. Rules for quadratic equations were given in &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot;, a Chinese treatise on mathematics. These early geometric methods do not appear to have had a general formula. Euclid, the Greek mathematician, produced a more abstract geometrical method around 300 BC. With a purely geometric approach Pythagoras and Euclid created a general procedure to find solutions of the quadratic equation. In his work &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, the Greek mathematician Diophantus solved the quadratic equation, but giving only one root, even when both roots were positive.

In 628 AD, Brahmagupta, an Indian mathematician, gave in his book &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; the first explicit (although still not completely general) solution of the quadratic equation as follows: &quot;To the absolute number multiplied by four times the [coefficient of the] square, add the square of the [coefficient of the] middle term; the square root of the same, less the [coefficient of the] middle term, being divided by twice the [coefficient of the] square is the value.&quot; This is equivalent to
formula_53
The &quot;Bakhshali Manuscript&quot; written in India in the 7th century AD contained an algebraic formula for solving quadratic equations, as well as linear indeterminate equations (originally of type ). Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (9th century) developed a set of formulas that worked for positive solutions. Al-Khwarizmi goes further in providing a full solution to the general quadratic equation, accepting one or two numerical answers for every quadratic equation, while providing geometric proofs in the process. He also described the method of completing the square and recognized that the discriminant must be positive, which was proven by his contemporary &#x27;Abd al-Hamīd ibn Turk (Central Asia, 9th century) who gave geometric figures to prove that if the discriminant is negative, a quadratic equation has no solution. While al-Khwarizmi himself did not accept negative solutions, later Islamic mathematicians that succeeded him accepted negative solutions, as well as irrational numbers as solutions. Abū Kāmil Shujā ibn Aslam (Egypt, 10th century) in particular was the first to accept irrational numbers (often in the form of a square root, cube root or fourth root) as solutions to quadratic equations or as coefficients in an equation. The 9th century Indian mathematician Sridhara wrote down rules for solving quadratic equations.

The Jewish mathematician Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi (12th century, Spain) authored the first European book to include the full solution to the general quadratic equation. His solution was largely based on Al-Khwarizmi&#x27;s work. The writing of the Chinese mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298 AD) is the first known one in which quadratic equations with negative coefficients of &#x27;x&#x27; appear, although he attributes this to the earlier Liu Yi. By 1545 Gerolamo Cardano compiled the works related to the quadratic equations. The quadratic formula covering all cases was first obtained by Simon Stevin in 1594. In 1637 René Descartes published &quot;La Géométrie&quot; containing the quadratic formula in the form we know today.

===Alternative methods of root calculation===

====Vieta&#x27;s formulas====
&quot;Vieta&#x27;s formulas&quot; (named after François Viète) are the relations
formula_54 
between the roots of a quadratic polynomial and its coefficients. They result from comparing term by term the relation
formula_55
with the equation
formula_56

The first Vieta&#x27;s formula is useful for graphing a quadratic function. Since the graph is symmetric with respect to a vertical line through the vertex, the vertex&#x27;s -coordinate is located at the average of the roots (or intercepts). Thus the -coordinate of the vertex is
formula_57
The -coordinate can be obtained by substituting the above result into the given quadratic equation, giving
formula_58
Also, these formulas for the vertex can be deduced directly from the formula (see Completing the square)
formula_59

For numerical computation, Vieta&#x27;s formulas provide a useful method for finding the roots of a quadratic equation in the case where one root is much smaller than the other. If , then , and we have the estimate:
formula_60
The second Vieta&#x27;s formula then provides:
formula_61
These formulas are much easier to evaluate than the quadratic formula under the condition of one large and one small root, because the quadratic formula evaluates the small root as the difference of two very nearly equal numbers (the case of large ), which causes round-off error in a numerical evaluation. The figure shows the difference between (i) a direct evaluation using the quadratic formula (accurate when the roots are near each other in value) and (ii) an evaluation based upon the above approximation of Vieta&#x27;s formulas (accurate when the roots are widely spaced). As the linear coefficient increases, initially the quadratic formula is accurate, and the approximate formula improves in accuracy, leading to a smaller difference between the methods as increases. However, at some point the quadratic formula begins to lose accuracy because of round off error, while the approximate method continues to improve. Consequently, the difference between the methods begins to increase as the quadratic formula becomes worse and worse.

This situation arises commonly in amplifier design, where widely separated roots are desired to ensure a stable operation (see Step response).

====Trigonometric solution====
In the days before calculators, people would use mathematical tables—lists of numbers showing the results of calculation with varying arguments—to simplify and speed up computation. Tables of logarithms and trigonometric functions were common in math and science textbooks. Specialized tables were published for applications such as astronomy, celestial navigation and statistics. Methods of numerical approximation existed, called prosthaphaeresis, that offered shortcuts around time-consuming operations such as multiplication and taking powers and roots. Astronomers, especially, were concerned with methods that could speed up the long series of computations involved in celestial mechanics calculations.

It is within this context that we may understand the development of means of solving quadratic equations by the aid of trigonometric substitution. Consider the following alternate form of the quadratic equation,

where the sign of the ± symbol is chosen so that and may both be positive. By substituting

 \tan\theta &lt;/math&gt;|}}

and then multiplying through by , we obtain

 \sin\theta \cos\theta \pm \cos^2\theta = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;|}}

Introducing functions of and rearranging, we obtain

{b} ,&lt;/math&gt;|}}

{b} ,&lt;/math&gt;|}}

where the subscripts and correspond, respectively, to the use of a negative or positive sign in equation . Substituting the two values of or found from equations or into gives the required roots of . Complex roots occur in the solution based on equation if the absolute value of exceeds unity. The amount of effort involved in solving quadratic equations using this mixed trigonometric and logarithmic table look-up strategy was two-thirds the effort using logarithmic tables alone. Calculating complex roots would require using a different trigonometric form.

To illustrate, let us assume we had available seven-place logarithm and trigonometric tables, and wished to solve the following to six-significant-figure accuracy:
formula_62
#A seven-place lookup table might have only 100,000 entries, and computing intermediate results to seven places would generally require interpolation between adjacent entries. 
#formula_63
#formula_64
#formula_65
#formula_66
#formula_67
#formula_68 (rounded to six significant figures) formula_69

====Solution for complex roots in polar coordinates====

If the quadratic equation formula_70 with real coefficients has two complex roots—the case where formula_71 requiring &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot; to have the same sign as each other—then the solutions for the roots can be expressed in polar form as

formula_72

where formula_73 and formula_74

====Geometric solution====
The quadratic equation may be solved geometrically in a number of ways. One way is via Lill&#x27;s method. The three coefficients , , are drawn with right angles between them as in SA, AB, and BC in Figure 6. A circle is drawn with the start and end point SC as a diameter. If this cuts the middle line AB of the three then the equation has a solution, and the solutions are given by negative of the distance along this line from A divided by the first coefficient or SA. If is the coefficients may be read off directly. Thus the solutions in the diagram are −AX1/SA and −AX2/SA.
The Carlyle circle, named after Thomas Carlyle, has the property that the solutions of the quadratic equation are the horizontal coordinates of the intersections of the circle with the horizontal axis. Carlyle circles have been used to develop ruler-and-compass constructions of regular polygons.

===Generalization of quadratic equation===
The formula and its derivation remain correct if the coefficients , and are complex numbers, or more generally members of any field whose characteristic is not . (In a field of characteristic 2, the element is zero and it is impossible to divide by it.)

The symbol
formula_75
in the formula should be understood as &quot;either of the two elements whose square is , if such elements exist&quot;. In some fields, some elements have no square roots and some have two; only zero has just one square root, except in fields of characteristic . Even if a field does not contain a square root of some number, there is always a quadratic extension field which does, so the quadratic formula will always make sense as a formula in that extension field.

====Characteristic 2====
In a field of characteristic , the quadratic formula, which relies on being a unit, does not hold. Consider the monic quadratic polynomial
formula_76
over a field of characteristic . If , then the solution reduces to extracting a square root, so the solution is
formula_77
and there is only one root since
formula_78
In summary,
formula_79
See quadratic residue for more information about extracting square roots in finite fields.

In the case that , there are two distinct roots, but if the polynomial is irreducible, they cannot be expressed in terms of square roots of numbers in the coefficient field. Instead, define the 2-root of to be a root of the polynomial , an element of the splitting field of that polynomial. One verifies that is also a root. In terms of the 2-root operation, the two roots of the (non-monic) quadratic are
formula_80
and
formula_81

For example, let denote a multiplicative generator of the group of units of , the Galois field of order four (thus and are roots of over . Because , is the unique solution of the quadratic equation . On the other hand, the polynomial is irreducible over , but it splits over , where it has the two roots and , where is a root of in .

This is a special case of Artin–Schreier theory.

<text>Quantum physics is a branch of modern physics in which energy and matter are described at their most fundamental level, that of energy quanta, elementary particles, and quantum fields. Quantum physics encompasses any discipline concerned with systems that exhibit notable quantum-mechanical effects, where waves have properties of particles, and particles behave like waves. Applications of quantum mechanics include explaining phenomena found in nature as well as developing technologies that rely upon quantum effects, like integrated circuits and lasers.

Quantum mechanics is also critically important for understanding how individual atoms are joined by covalent bonds to form molecules. The application of quantum mechanics to chemistry is known as quantum chemistry. Quantum mechanics can also provide quantitative insight into ionic and covalent bonding processes by explicitly showing which molecules are energetically favorable to which others and the magnitudes of the energies involved. 

Historically, the first applications of quantum mechanics to physical systems were the algebraic determination of the hydrogen spectrum by Wolfgang Pauli and the treatment of diatomic molecules by Lucy Mensing.

In many aspects modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant. Important applications of quantum theory include quantum chemistry, quantum optics, quantum computing, superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes, the optical amplifier and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy. Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA.

==Electronics==
Many modern electronic devices are designed using quantum mechanics. Examples include lasers, electron microscopes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices and the components used in computing hardware. The study of semiconductors led to the invention of the diode and the transistor, which are indispensable parts of modern electronics systems, computer and telecommunications devices. Another application is for making laser diodes and light-emitting diodes, which are a high-efficiency source of light. The global positioning system (GPS) makes use of atomic clocks to measure precise time differences and therefore determine a user&#x27;s location.

Many electronic devices operate using the effect of quantum tunneling. Flash memory chips found in USB drives use quantum tunneling to erase their memory cells. Some negative differential resistance devices also utilize the quantum tunneling effect, such as resonant tunneling diodes. Unlike classical diodes, its current is carried by resonant tunneling through two or more potential barriers (see figure at right). Its negative resistance behavior can only be understood with quantum mechanics: As the confined state moves close to Fermi level, tunnel current increases. As it moves away, the current decreases. Quantum mechanics is necessary to understand and design such electronic devices.

==Cryptography==

Many scientists are currently seeking robust methods of directly manipulating quantum states. Efforts are being made to more fully develop quantum cryptography, which will theoretically allow guaranteed secure transmission of information.

An inherent advantage yielded by quantum cryptography when compared to classical cryptography is the detection of passive eavesdropping. This is a natural result of the behavior of quantum bits; due to the observer effect, if a bit in a superposition state were to be observed, the superposition state would collapse into an eigenstate. Because the intended recipient was expecting to receive the bit in a superposition state, the intended recipient would know there was an attack, because the bit&#x27;s state would no longer be in a superposition.

==Quantum computing==
Another goal is the development of quantum computers, which are expected to perform certain computational tasks exponentially faster than classical computers. Instead of using classical bits, quantum computers use qubits, which can be in superpositions of states. Quantum programmers are able to manipulate the superposition of qubits in order to solve problems that classical computing cannot do effectively, such as searching unsorted databases or integer factorization. IBM claims that the advent of quantum computing may progress the fields of medicine, logistics, financial services, artificial intelligence and cloud security.

Another active research topic is quantum teleportation, which deals with techniques to transmit quantum information over arbitrary distances.

==Macroscale quantum effects==

While quantum mechanics primarily applies to the smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale. Superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of an electron gas in a conducting material (an electric current) at sufficiently low temperatures. The fractional quantum Hall effect is a topological ordered state which corresponds to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement. States with different topological orders (or different patterns of long range entanglements) cannot change into each other without a phase transition.

==Other phenomena==
Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena, such as black-body radiation and the stability of the orbitals of electrons in atoms. It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems, including smell receptors and protein structures. Recent work on photosynthesis has provided evidence that quantum correlations play an essential role in this fundamental process of plants and many other organisms. Even so, classical physics can often provide good approximations to results otherwise obtained by quantum physics, typically in circumstances with large numbers of particles or large quantum numbers. Since classical formulas are much simpler and easier to compute than quantum formulas, classical approximations are used and preferred when the system is large enough to render the effects of quantum mechanics insignificant.

<text>A quark () is a type of elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. All commonly observable matter is composed of up quarks, down quarks and electrons. Owing to a phenomenon known as &quot;color confinement&quot;, quarks are never found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, which include baryons (such as protons and neutrons) and mesons, or in quark–gluon plasmas. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of hadrons.

Quarks have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge, and spin. They are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as &quot;fundamental forces&quot; (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction), as well as the only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge.

There are six types, known as &quot;flavors&quot;, of quarks: up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks have the lowest masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties (such as the electric charge) have equal magnitude but opposite sign.

The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in 1968. Accelerator program experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. The top quark, first observed at Fermilab in 1995, was the last to be discovered.

== Classification ==
The Standard Model is the theoretical framework describing all the known elementary particles. This model contains six flavors of quarks (), named up (), down (), strange (), charm (), bottom (), and top (). Antiparticles of quarks are called &quot;antiquarks&quot;, and are denoted by a bar over the symbol for the corresponding quark, such as for an up antiquark. As with antimatter in general, antiquarks have the same mass, mean lifetime, and spin as their respective quarks, but the electric charge and other charges have the opposite sign.

Quarks are spin- particles, which means they are fermions according to the spin–statistics theorem. They are subject to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can simultaneously occupy the same quantum state. This is in contrast to bosons (particles with integer spin), of which any number can be in the same state. Unlike leptons, quarks possess color charge, which causes them to engage in the strong interaction. The resulting attraction between different quarks causes the formation of composite particles known as &quot;hadrons&quot; (see &quot;&quot; below).

The quarks that determine the quantum numbers of hadrons are called &quot;valence quarks&quot;; apart from these, any hadron may contain an indefinite number of virtual &quot;sea&quot; quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, which do not influence its quantum numbers. There are two families of hadrons: baryons, with three valence quarks, and mesons, with a valence quark and an antiquark. The most common baryons are the proton and the neutron, the building blocks of the atomic nucleus. A great number of hadrons are known (see list of baryons and list of mesons), most of them differentiated by their quark content and the properties these constituent quarks confer. The existence of &quot;exotic&quot; hadrons with more valence quarks, such as tetraquarks () and pentaquarks (), was conjectured from the beginnings of the quark model but not discovered until the early 21st century.

Elementary fermions are grouped into three generations, each comprising two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes up and down quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, and the third bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong indirect evidence that no more than three generations exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (up and down) quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), and decay quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in particle accelerators.

Having electric charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are the only known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.

See the table of properties below for a more complete overview of the six quark flavors&#x27; properties.

== History ==


The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig in 1964. The proposal came shortly after Gell-Mann&#x27;s 1961 formulation of a particle classification system known as the &quot;Eightfold Way&quot; – or, in more technical terms, SU(3) flavor symmetry, streamlining its structure. Physicist Yuval Ne&#x27;eman had independently developed a scheme similar to the Eightfold Way in the same year. An early attempt at constituent organization was available in the Sakata model.

At the time of the quark theory&#x27;s inception, the &quot;particle zoo&quot; included a multitude of hadrons, among other particles. Gell-Mann and Zweig posited that they were not elementary particles, but were instead composed of combinations of quarks and antiquarks. Their model involved three flavors of quarks, up, down, and strange, to which they ascribed properties such as spin and electric charge. The initial reaction of the physics community to the proposal was mixed. There was particular contention about whether the quark was a physical entity or a mere abstraction used to explain concepts that were not fully understood at the time.

In less than a year, extensions to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Glashow and James Bjorken predicted the existence of a fourth flavor of quark, which they called &quot;charm&quot;. The addition was proposed because it allowed for a better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.

Deep inelastic scattering experiments conducted in 1968 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) and published on October 20, 1969, showed that the proton contained much smaller, point-like objects and was therefore not an elementary particle. Physicists were reluctant to firmly identify these objects with quarks at the time, instead calling them &quot;partons&quot; – a term coined by Richard Feynman. The objects that were observed at SLAC would later be identified as up and down quarks as the other flavors were discovered. Nevertheless, &quot;parton&quot; remains in use as a collective term for the constituents of hadrons (quarks, antiquarks, and gluons). Richard Taylor, Henry Kendall and Jerome Friedman received the 1990 Nobel Prize in physics for their work at SLAC.

The strange quark&#x27;s existence was indirectly validated by SLAC&#x27;s scattering experiments: not only was it a necessary component of Gell-Mann and Zweig&#x27;s three-quark model, but it provided an explanation for the kaon () and pion () hadrons discovered in cosmic rays in 1947.

In a 1970 paper, Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani presented the GIM mechanism (named from their initials) to explain the experimental non-observation of flavor-changing neutral currents. This theoretical model required the existence of the as-yet undiscovered charm quark. The number of supposed quark flavors grew to the current six in 1973, when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there were another pair of quarks.

Charm quarks were produced almost simultaneously by two teams in November 1974 (see November Revolution) – one at SLAC under Burton Richter, and one at Brookhaven National Laboratory under Samuel Ting. The charm quarks were observed bound with charm antiquarks in mesons. The two parties had assigned the discovered meson two different symbols, and ; thus, it became formally known as the meson. The discovery finally convinced the physics community of the quark model&#x27;s validity.

In the following years a number of suggestions appeared for extending the quark model to six quarks. Of these, the 1975 paper by Haim Harari was the first to coin the terms &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; for the additional quarks.

In 1977, the bottom quark was observed by a team at Fermilab led by Leon Lederman. This was a strong indicator of the top quark&#x27;s existence: without the top quark, the bottom quark would have been without a partner. It was not until 1995 that the top quark was finally observed, also by the CDF and DØ teams at Fermilab. It had a mass much larger than expected, almost as large as that of a gold atom.
== Etymology ==
For some time, Gell-Mann was undecided on an actual spelling for the term he intended to coin, until he found the word &quot;quark&quot; in James Joyce&#x27;s 1939 book &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;:
The word &quot;quark&quot; is an outdated English word meaning &quot;to croak&quot; and the above-quoted lines are about a bird choir mocking king Mark of Cornwall in the legend of Tristan and Iseult. Especially in the German-speaking parts of the world there is a widespread legend, however, that Joyce had taken it from the word , a German word of Slavic origin which denotes a curd cheese, but is also a colloquial term for &quot;trivial nonsense&quot;. In the legend it is said that he had heard it on a journey to Germany at a farmers&#x27; market in Freiburg.
Some authors, however, defend a possible German origin of Joyce&#x27;s word &quot;quark&quot;. Gell-Mann went into further detail regarding the name of the quark in his 1994 book &quot;The Quark and the Jaguar&quot;:
Zweig preferred the name &quot;ace&quot; for the particle he had theorized, but Gell-Mann&#x27;s terminology came to prominence once the quark model had been commonly accepted.

The quark flavors were given their names for several reasons. The up and down quarks are named after the up and down components of isospin, which they carry. Strange quarks were given their name because they were discovered to be components of the strange particles discovered in cosmic rays years before the quark model was proposed; these particles were deemed &quot;strange&quot; because they had unusually long lifetimes. Glashow, who co-proposed the charm quark with Bjorken, is quoted as saying, &quot;We called our construct the &#x27;charmed quark&#x27;, for we were fascinated and pleased by the symmetry it brought to the subnuclear world.&quot; The names &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;top&quot;, coined by Harari, were chosen because they are &quot;logical partners for up and down quarks&quot;. Alternative names for bottom and top quarks are &quot;beauty&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; respectively, but these names have somewhat fallen out of use. While &quot;truth&quot; never did catch on, accelerator complexes devoted to massive production of bottom quarks are sometimes called &quot;beauty factories&quot;.

== Properties ==

=== Electric charge ===

Quarks have fractional electric charge values – either (−) or (+) times the elementary charge (e), depending on flavor. Up, charm, and top quarks (collectively referred to as &quot;up-type quarks&quot;) have a charge of + e; down, strange, and bottom quarks (&quot;down-type quarks&quot;) have a charge of − e. Antiquarks have the opposite charge to their corresponding quarks; up-type antiquarks have charges of − e and down-type antiquarks have charges of + e. Since the electric charge of a hadron is the sum of the charges of the constituent quarks, all hadrons have integer charges: the combination of three quarks (baryons), three antiquarks (antibaryons), or a quark and an antiquark (mesons) always results in integer charges. For example, the hadron constituents of atomic nuclei, neutrons and protons, have charges of 0 e and +1 e respectively; the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark, and the proton of two up quarks and one down quark.

=== Spin ===

Spin is an intrinsic property of elementary particles, and its direction is an important degree of freedom. It is sometimes visualized as the rotation of an object around its own axis (hence the name &quot;&quot;), though this notion is somewhat misguided at subatomic scales because elementary particles are believed to be point-like.

Spin can be represented by a vector whose length is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant &quot;ħ&quot; (pronounced &quot;h bar&quot;). For quarks, a measurement of the spin vector component along any axis can only yield the values + or −; for this reason quarks are classified as spin- particles. The component of spin along a given axis – by convention the &quot;z&quot; axis – is often denoted by an up arrow ↑ for the value + and down arrow ↓ for the value −, placed after the symbol for flavor. For example, an up quark with a spin of + along the &quot;z&quot; axis is denoted by u↑.

=== Weak interaction ===
A quark of one flavor can transform into a quark of another flavor only through the weak interaction, one of the four fundamental interactions in particle physics. By absorbing or emitting a W boson, any up-type quark (up, charm, and top quarks) can change into any down-type quark (down, strange, and bottom quarks) and vice versa. This flavor transformation mechanism causes the radioactive process of beta decay, in which a neutron () &quot;splits&quot; into a proton (), an electron () and an electron antineutrino () (see picture). This occurs when one of the down quarks in the neutron () decays into an up quark by emitting a virtual boson, transforming the neutron into a proton (). The boson then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino.

Both beta decay and the inverse process of &quot;inverse beta decay&quot; are routinely used in medical applications such as positron emission tomography (PET) and in experiments involving neutrino detection.
While the process of flavor transformation is the same for all quarks, each quark has a preference to transform into the quark of its own generation. The relative tendencies of all flavor transformations are described by a mathematical table, called the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix (CKM matrix). Enforcing unitarity, the approximate magnitudes of the entries of the CKM matrix are:
: formula_1
where &quot;V&quot;&quot;ij&quot; represents the tendency of a quark of flavor &quot;i&quot; to change into a quark of flavor &quot;j&quot; (or vice versa).

There exists an equivalent weak interaction matrix for leptons (right side of the W boson on the above beta decay diagram), called the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix (PMNS matrix). Together, the CKM and PMNS matrices describe all flavor transformations, but the links between the two are not yet clear.
=== Strong interaction and color charge ===

According to quantum chromodynamics (QCD), quarks possess a property called &quot;color charge&quot;. There are three types of color charge, arbitrarily labeled &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, and &quot;red&quot;. Each of them is complemented by an anticolor – &quot;antiblue&quot;, &quot;antigreen&quot;, and &quot;antired&quot;. Every quark carries a color, while every antiquark carries an anticolor.

The system of attraction and repulsion between quarks charged with different combinations of the three colors is called strong interaction, which is mediated by force carrying particles known as &quot;gluons&quot;; this is discussed at length below. The theory that describes strong interactions is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge &quot;ξ&quot; plus an antiquark with color charge −&quot;ξ&quot; will result in a color charge of 0 (or &quot;white&quot; color) and the formation of a meson. This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics. Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with different anticolor charges, will result in the same &quot;white&quot; color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon.

In modern particle physics, gauge symmetries – a kind of symmetry group – relate interactions between particles (see gauge theories). Color SU(3) (commonly abbreviated to SU(3)c) is the gauge symmetry that relates the color charge in quarks and is the defining symmetry for quantum chromodynamics. Just as the laws of physics are independent of which directions in space are designated &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot;, and remain unchanged if the coordinate axes are rotated to a new orientation, the physics of quantum chromodynamics is independent of which directions in three-dimensional color space are identified as blue, red, and green. SU(3)c color transformations correspond to &quot;rotations&quot; in color space (which, mathematically speaking, is a complex space). Every quark flavor &quot;f&quot;, each with subtypes &quot;f&quot;B, &quot;f&quot;G, &quot;f&quot;R corresponding to the quark colors, forms a triplet: a three-component quantum field that transforms under the fundamental representation of SU(3)c. The requirement that SU(3)c should be local – that is, that its transformations be allowed to vary with space and time – determines the properties of the strong interaction. In particular, it implies the existence of eight gluon types to act as its force carriers.

=== Mass ===
Two terms are used in referring to a quark&#x27;s mass: &quot;current quark mass&quot; refers to the mass of a quark by itself, while &quot;constituent quark mass&quot; refers to the current quark mass plus the mass of the gluon particle field surrounding the quark. These masses typically have very different values. Most of a hadron&#x27;s mass comes from the gluons that bind the constituent quarks together, rather than from the quarks themselves. While gluons are inherently massless, they possess energy – more specifically, quantum chromodynamics binding energy (QCBE) – and it is this that contributes so greatly to the overall mass of the hadron (see mass in special relativity). For example, a proton has a mass of approximately , of which the rest mass of its three valence quarks only contributes about ; much of the remainder can be attributed to the field energy of the gluons (see chiral symmetry breaking). The Standard Model posits that elementary particles derive their masses from the Higgs mechanism, which is associated to the Higgs boson. It is hoped that further research into the reasons for the top quark&#x27;s large mass of ~, almost the mass of a gold atom, might reveal more about the origin of the mass of quarks and other elementary particles.

=== Size ===

In QCD, quarks are considered to be point-like entities, with zero size. As of 2014, experimental evidence indicates they are no bigger than 10−4 times the size of a proton, i.e. less than 10−19 metres.

=== Table of properties ===

The following table summarizes the key properties of the six quarks. Flavor quantum numbers (isospin (&quot;I&quot;3), charm (&quot;C&quot;), strangeness (&quot;S&quot;, not to be confused with spin), topness (&quot;T&quot;), and bottomness (&quot;B&quot;′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The baryon number (&quot;B&quot;) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (&quot;Q&quot;) and all flavor quantum numbers (&quot;B&quot;, &quot;I&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;B&quot;′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (&quot;J&quot;; equal to spin for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.


== Interacting quarks ==
As described by quantum chromodynamics, the strong interaction between quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part of a more general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark&#x27;s color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.

Since gluons carry color charge, they themselves are able to emit and absorb other gluons. This causes &quot;asymptotic freedom&quot;: as quarks come closer to each other, the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens. Conversely, as the distance between quarks increases, the binding force strengthens. The color field becomes stressed, much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched, and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field. Above a certain energy threshold, pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created. These pairs bind with the quarks being separated, causing new hadrons to form. This phenomenon is known as &quot;color confinement&quot;: quarks never appear in isolation. This process of hadronization occurs before quarks formed in a high energy collision are able to interact in any other way. The only exception is the top quark, which may decay before it hadronizes.

=== Sea quarks ===

Hadrons contain, along with the &quot;valence quarks&quot; () that contribute to their quantum numbers, virtual quark–antiquark () pairs known as &quot;sea quarks&quot; (). Sea quarks form when a gluon of the hadron&#x27;s color field splits; this process also works in reverse in that the annihilation of two sea quarks produces a gluon. The result is a constant flux of gluon splits and creations colloquially known as &quot;the sea&quot;. Sea quarks are much less stable than their valence counterparts, and they typically annihilate each other within the interior of the hadron. Despite this, sea quarks can hadronize into baryonic or mesonic particles under certain circumstances.

=== Other phases of quark matter ===

Under sufficiently extreme conditions, quarks may become &quot;deconfined&quot; out of bound states and propagate as thermalized &quot;free&quot; excitations in the larger medium. In the course of asymptotic freedom, the strong interaction becomes weaker at increasing temperatures. Eventually, color confinement would be effectively lost in an extremely hot plasma of freely moving quarks and gluons. This theoretical phase of matter is called quark–gluon plasma.

The exact conditions needed to give rise to this state are unknown and have been the subject of a great deal of speculation and experimentation. An estimate puts the needed temperature at kelvin. While a state of entirely free quarks and gluons has never been achieved (despite numerous attempts by CERN in the 1980s and 1990s), recent experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have yielded evidence for liquid-like quark matter exhibiting &quot;nearly perfect&quot; fluid motion.

The quark–gluon plasma would be characterized by a great increase in the number of heavier quark pairs in relation to the number of up and down quark pairs. It is believed that in the period prior to 10−6 seconds after the Big Bang (the quark epoch), the universe was filled with quark–gluon plasma, as the temperature was too high for hadrons to be stable.

Given sufficiently high baryon densities and relatively low temperatures – possibly comparable to those found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.

<doc id="25182" wikidata="Q636027" url="?curid=25182" title="Quantization (physics)">
<text>Quantization (in British English quantisation) is the systematic transition procedure from a classical understanding of physical phenomena to a newer understanding known as quantum mechanics. It is a procedure for constructing quantum mechanics from classical mechanics. A generalization involving infinite degrees of freedom is [[Quantization (physics)|field quantization]], as in the &quot;quantization of the electromagnetic field&quot;, referring to photons as field &quot;quanta&quot; (for instance as light quanta). This procedure is basic to theories of atomic physics, chemistry, particle physics, nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum optics.

== Historical overview == 
In 1901, when Max Planck was developing the distribution function of statistical mechanics to solve the ultraviolet catastrophe problem, he realized that the properties of blackbody radiation can be explained by the assumption that the amount of energy must be in countable fundamental units, i.e. amount of energy is not continuous but discrete. That is, a minimum unit of energy exists and the following relationship holds formula_1
for the frequency formula_2. Here, formula_3 is called the Planck constant, which represents the amount of the quantum mechanical effect. It means a fundamental change of mathematical model of physical quantities.

In 1905, Albert Einstein published a paper, &quot;On a heuristic viewpoint concerning the emission and transformation of light&quot;, which explained the photoelectric effect on quantized electromagnetic waves. The &quot;energy quantum&quot; referred to in this paper was later called &quot;photon&quot;.  In July 1913, Niels Bohr used quantization to describe the spectrum of a hydrogen atom in his paper &quot;On the constitution of atoms and molecules&quot;. 

The preceding theories have been successful, but they are very phenomenological theories.  However, the French mathematician Henri Poincaré first gave a systematic and rigorous definition of what quantization is in his 1912 paper &quot;Sur la théorie des quanta&quot;. 

The term &quot;quantum physics&quot; was first used in Johnston&#x27;s &quot;Planck&#x27;s Universe in Light of Modern Physics&quot;.  (1931).

== Canonical quantization ==
Canonical quantization develops quantum mechanics from classical mechanics. One introduces a commutation relation among canonical coordinates. Technically, one converts coordinates to operators, through combinations of creation and annihilation operators. The operators act on quantum states of the theory. The lowest energy state is called the vacuum state.

== Quantization schemes ==
Even within the setting of canonical quantization, there is difficulty associated to quantizing arbitrary observables on the classical phase space. This is the ordering ambiguity: classically, the position and momentum variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot; commute, but their quantum mechanical operator counterparts do not. Various &quot;quantization schemes&quot; have been proposed to resolve this ambiguity, of which the most popular is the Weyl quantization scheme. Nevertheless, the &quot;Groenewold–van Hove theorem&quot; dictates that no perfect quantization scheme exists. Specifically, if the quantizations of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are taken to be the usual position and momentum operators, then no quantization scheme can perfectly reproduce the Poisson bracket relations among the classical observables. See Groenewold&#x27;s theorem for one version of this result.

== Covariant canonical quantization ==

There is a way to perform a canonical quantization without having to resort to the non covariant approach of foliating spacetime and choosing a Hamiltonian. This method is based upon a classical action, but is different from the functional integral approach.

The method does not apply to all possible actions (for instance, actions with a noncausal structure or actions with gauge &quot;flows&quot;). It starts with the classical algebra of all (smooth) functionals over the configuration space. This algebra is quotiented over by the ideal generated by the Euler–Lagrange equations. Then, this quotient algebra is converted into a Poisson algebra by introducing a Poisson bracket derivable from the action, called the Peierls bracket. This Poisson algebra is then ℏ -deformed in the same way as in canonical quantization.

In quantum field theory, there is also a way to quantize actions with gauge &quot;flows&quot;. It involves the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism, an extension of the BRST formalism.

== Deformation quantization ==

One of the earliest attempts at a natural quantization was Weyl quantization, proposed by Hermann Weyl in 1927. Here, an attempt is made to associate a quantum-mechanical observable (a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space) with a real-valued function on classical phase space. The position and momentum in this phase space are mapped to the generators of the Heisenberg group, and the Hilbert space appears as a group representation of the Heisenberg group. In 1946, H. J. Groenewold considered the product of a pair of such observables and asked what the corresponding function would be on the classical phase space. This led him to discover the phase-space star-product of a pair of functions.
More generally, this technique leads to deformation quantization, where the ★-product is taken to be a deformation of the algebra of functions on a symplectic manifold or Poisson manifold. However, as a natural quantization scheme (a functor), Weyl&#x27;s map is not satisfactory. 

For example, the Weyl map of the classical angular-momentum-squared is not just the quantum angular momentum squared operator, but it further contains a constant term . (This extra term offset is pedagogically significant, since it accounts for the nonvanishing angular momentum of the ground-state Bohr orbit in the hydrogen atom, even though the standard QM ground state of the atom has vanishing .)

As a mere &quot;representation change&quot;, however, Weyl&#x27;s map is useful and important, as it underlies the alternate &quot;equivalent&quot; phase space formulation of conventional quantum mechanics.

== Geometric quantization ==
In mathematical physics, geometric quantization is a mathematical approach to defining a quantum theory corresponding to a given classical theory. It attempts to carry out quantization, for which there is in general no exact recipe, in such a way that certain analogies between the classical theory and the quantum theory remain manifest. For example, the similarity between the Heisenberg equation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics and the Hamilton equation in classical physics should be built in.

A more geometric approach to quantization, in which the classical phase space can be a general symplectic manifold, was developed in the 1970s by Bertram Kostant and Jean-Marie Souriau. The method proceeds in two stages. First, once constructs a &quot;prequantum Hilbert space&quot; consisting of square-integrable functions (or, more properly, sections of a line bundle) over the phase space. Here one can construct operators satisfying commutation relations corresponding exactly to the classical Poisson-bracket relations. On the other hand, this prequantum Hilbert space is too big to be physically meaningful. One then restricts to functions (or sections) depending on half the variables on the phase space, yielding the quantum Hilbert space.

== Path integral quantization ==
A classical mechanical theory is given by an action with the permissible configurations being the ones which are extremal with respect to functional variations of the action. A quantum-mechanical description of the classical system can also be constructed from the action of the system by means of the path integral formulation.

<doc id="25184" wikidata="Q578714" url="?curid=25184" title="Quantile">
<text>In statistics and probability, quantiles are cut points dividing the range of a probability distribution into continuous intervals with equal probabilities, or dividing the observations in a sample in the same way. There is one fewer quantile than the number of groups created. Common quantiles have special names, such as &quot;quartiles&quot; (four groups), &quot;deciles&quot; (ten groups), and &quot;percentiles&quot; (100 groups). The groups created are termed halves, thirds, quarters, etc., though sometimes the terms for the quantile are used for the groups created, rather than for the cut points.

-quantiles are values that partition a finite set of values into subsets of (nearly) equal sizes. There are partitions of the -quantiles, one for each integer satisfying . In some cases the value of a quantile may not be uniquely determined, as can be the case for the median (2-quantile) of a uniform probability distribution on a set of even size. Quantiles can also be applied to continuous distributions, providing a way to generalize rank statistics to continuous variables (see percentile rank). When the cumulative distribution function of a random variable is known, the -quantiles are the application of the&quot; quantile function&quot; (the inverse function of the cumulative distribution function) to the values }.

== Quantiles of a population ==
As in the computation of, for example, standard deviation, the estimation of a quantile depends upon whether one is operating with a statistical population or with a sample drawn from it. For a population, of discrete values or for a continuous population density, the -th -quantile is the data value where the cumulative distribution function crosses . That is, is a -th -quantile for a variable if
: or, equivalently, 
and

For a finite population of equally probable values indexed from lowest to highest, the -th -quantile of this population can equivalently be computed via the value of . If is not an integer, then round up to the next integer to get the appropriate index; the corresponding data value is the -th -quantile. On the other hand, if is an integer then any number from the data value at that index to the data value of the next index can be taken as the quantile, and it is conventional (though arbitrary) to take the average of those two values (see Estimating quantiles from a sample).

If, instead of using integers and , the &quot;-quantile&quot; is based on a real number with then replaces in the above formulas. This broader terminology is used when quantiles are used to parameterize continuous probability distributions. Moreover, some software programs (including Microsoft Excel) regard the minimum and maximum as the 0th and 100th percentile, respectively. However, this broader terminology is an extension beyond traditional statistics definitions.

=== Examples ===

The following two examples use the Nearest Rank definition of quantile with rounding. For an explanation of this definition, see percentiles.

==== Even-sized population ====

Consider an ordered population of 10 data values [3, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20]. What are the 4-quantiles (the &quot;quartiles&quot;) of this dataset?

So the first, second and third 4-quantiles (the &quot;quartiles&quot;) of the dataset [3, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20] are [7, 9, 15]. If also required, the zeroth quartile is 3 and the fourth quartile is 20.

==== Odd-sized population ====

Consider an ordered population of 11 data values [3, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20]. What are the 4-quantiles (the &quot;quartiles&quot;) of this dataset?

So the first, second and third 4-quantiles (the &quot;quartiles&quot;) of the dataset [3, 6, 7, 8, 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 16, 20] are [7, 9, 15]. If also required, the zeroth quartile is 3 and the fourth quartile is 20.

=== Relationship to the mean ===
For any population probability distribution on finitely many values, and generally for any probability distribution with a mean and variance, it is the case that
formula_1
where is the value of the -quantile for (or equivalently is the -th -quantile for ), where is the distribution&#x27;s arithmetic mean, and where is the distribution&#x27;s standard deviation. In particular, the median is never more than one standard deviation from the mean.

The above formula can be used to bound the value in terms of quantiles.
When , the value that is standard deviations above the mean has a lower bound
formula_2
For example, the value that is standard deviation above the mean is always greater than or equal to , the median, and the value that is standard deviations above the mean is always greater than or equal to , the fourth quintile.

When , there is instead an upper bound
formula_3
For example, the value for will never exceed , the first decile.

==Estimating quantiles from a sample==
One problem which frequently arises is estimating a quantile of a (very large or infinite) population based on a finite sample of size .

Modern statistical packages rely on a number of techniques to estimate the quantiles.

Hyndman and Fan compiled a taxonomy of nine algorithms used by various software packages. 
All methods compute , the estimate for the -quantile (the -th -quantile, where ) from a sample of size by computing a real valued index . When is an integer, the -th smallest of the values, , is the quantile estimate. Otherwise a rounding or interpolation scheme is used to compute the quantile estimate from , , and . (For notation, see floor and ceiling functions).

The first three are piecewise constant, changing abruptly at each data point, while the last six use linear interpolation between data points, and differ only in how the index used to choose the point along the piecewise linear interpolation curve, is chosen.

Mathematica, Matlab, R and GNU Octave programming languages support all nine sample quantile methods. SAS includes five sample quantile methods, SciPy and Maple both include eight, EViews and Julia include the six piecewise linear functions, Stata includes two, Python includes two, and Microsoft Excel includes two. Mathematica, SciPy and Julia support arbitrary parameters for methods which allow for other, non-standard, methods.

The estimate types and interpolation schemes used include:

Notes:
*R‑1 through R‑3 are piecewise constant, with discontinuities.
*R‑4 and following are piecewise linear, without discontinuities, but differ in how is computed.
*R‑3 and R‑4 are not symmetric in that they do not give when .
*Excel&#x27;s PERCENTILE.EXC and Python&#x27;s default &quot;exclusive&quot; method are equivalent to R‑6.
*Excel&#x27;s PERCENTILE and PERCENTILE.INC and Python&#x27;s optional &quot;inclusive&quot; method are equivalent to R‑7. This is R&#x27;s and Julia&#x27;s default method.
*Packages differ in how they estimate quantiles beyond the lowest and highest values in the sample, i.e. and . Choices include returning an error value, computing linear extrapolation, or assuming a constant value.

Of the techniques, Hyndman and Fan recommend R-8, but most statistical software packages have chosen R-6 or R-7 as the default.

The standard error of a quantile estimate can in general be estimated via the bootstrap. The Maritz–Jarrett method can also be used.

==The asymptotic distribution of the sample median==
The sample median is the most examined one amongst quantiles, being an alternative to estimate a location parameter, when the expected value of the distribution does not exist, and hence the sample mean is not a meaningful estimator of a population characteristic. Moreover, the sample median is a more robust estimator than the sample mean.

One peculiarity of the sample median is its asymptotic distribution: when the sample comes from a continuous distribution, then the sample median has the anticipated Normal asymptotic distribution,

: formula_4

This extends to the other quantiles,

: formula_5

where is the value of the distribution density at the -th population quantile (formula_6). 

But when the distribution is discrete, then the distribution of the sample median and the other quantiles fails to be Normal (see examples in https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/86638/28746).

A solution to this problem is to use an alternative definition of sample quantiles through the concept of the &quot;mid-distribution&quot; function, which is defined as 

: formula_7

The definition of sample quantiles through the concept of mid-distribution function can be seen as a generalization that can cover as special cases the continuous distributions. For discrete distributions the sample median as defined through this concept has an asymptotically Normal distribution, see Ma, Y., Genton, M. G., &amp; Parzen, E. (2011). Asymptotic properties of sample quantiles of discrete distributions. Annals of the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 63(2), 227–243.

==Approximate quantiles from a stream==
Computing approximate quantiles from data arriving from a stream can be done efficiently using compressed data structures. The most popular methods are t-digest and KLL. These methods read a stream of values in a continuous fashion and can, at any time, be queried about the approximate value of a specified quantile.

Both algorithms are based on a similar idea: compressing the stream of values by summarizing identical or similar values with a weight. If the stream is made of a repetition of 100 times v1 and 100 times v2, there is no reason to keep a sorted list of 200 elements, it is enough to keep two elements and two counts to be able to recover the quantiles. With more values, these algorithms maintain a trade-off between the number of unique values stored and the precision of the resulting quantiles. Some values may be discarded from the stream and contribute to the weight of a nearby value without changing the quantile results too much. The t-digest maintains a data structure of bounded size using an approach motivated by &quot;k&quot;-means clustering to group similar values. The KLL algorithm uses a more sophisticated &quot;compactor&quot; method that leads to better control of the error bounds at the cost of requiring an unbounded size if errors must be bounded relative to .

Both methods belong to the family of &quot;data sketches&quot; that are subsets of Streaming Algorithms with useful properties: t-digest or KLL sketches can be combined. Computing the sketch for a very large vector of values can be split into trivially parallel processes where sketches are computed for partitions of the vector in parallel and merged later.

The algorithms described so far directly approximate the empirical quantiles without any particular assumptions on the data, in essence the data are simply numbers or more generally, a set of items that can be ordered. These algorithms are computer science derived methods. Another class of algorithms exist which assume that the data are realizations of a random process. These are statistics derived methods, sequential nonparametric estimation algorithms in particular. There are a number of such algorithms such as those based on stochastic approximation or Hermite series estimators. 

These statistics based algorithms typically have constant update time and space complexity, but have different error bound guarantees compared to computer science type methods and make more assumptions. The statistics based algorithms do present certain advantages however, particularly in the non-stationary streaming setting i.e. time-varying data. The algorithms of both classes, along with some respective advantages and disadvantages have been recently surveyed.

== Discussion ==
Standardized test results are commonly reported as a student scoring &quot;in the 80th percentile&quot;, for example. This uses an alternative meaning of the word percentile as the &quot;interval&quot; between (in this case) the 80th and the 81st scalar percentile. This separate meaning of percentile is also used in peer-reviewed scientific research articles. The meaning used can be derived from its context.

If a distribution is symmetric, then the median is the mean (so long as the latter exists). But, in general, the median and the mean can differ. For instance, with a random variable that has an exponential distribution, any particular sample of this random variable will have roughly a 63% chance of being less than the mean. This is because the exponential distribution has a long tail for positive values but is zero for negative numbers.

Quantiles are useful measures because they are less susceptible than means to long-tailed distributions and outliers. Empirically, if the data being analyzed are not actually distributed according to an assumed distribution, or if there are other potential sources for outliers that are far removed from the mean, then quantiles may be more useful descriptive statistics than means and other moment-related statistics.

Closely related is the subject of least absolute deviations, a method of regression that is more robust to outliers than is least squares, in which the sum of the absolute value of the observed errors is used in place of the squared error. The connection is that the mean is the single estimate of a distribution that minimizes expected squared error while the median minimizes expected absolute error. Least absolute deviations shares the ability to be relatively insensitive to large deviations in outlying observations, although even better methods of robust regression are available.

The quantiles of a random variable are preserved under increasing transformations, in the sense that, for example, if is the median of a random variable , then is the median of , unless an arbitrary choice has been made from a range of values to specify a particular quantile. (See quantile estimation, above, for examples of such interpolation.) Quantiles can also be used in cases where only ordinal data are available.

== Other quantifications ==
Values that divide sorted data into equal subsets other than four have different names.
*The only 2-quantile is called the median
*The 3-quantiles are called s or s → T
*The 4-quantiles are called quartiles → Q; the difference between upper and lower quartiles is also called the interquartile range, midspread or middle fifty → IQR = .
*The 5-quantiles are called s or s → QU
*The 6-quantiles are called s → S
*The 7-quantiles are called s → SP
*The 8-quantiles are called s → O
*The 10-quantiles are called deciles → D
*The 12-quantiles are called duo-deciles or dodeciles → DD
*The 16-quantiles are called s → H
*The 20-quantiles are called s, s, or demi-deciles → V
*The 100-quantiles are called percentiles or centiles → P
* The 1000-quantiles have been called permilles or milliles, but these are rare and largely obsolete

<text>Q, or q, is the seventeenth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is pronounced , most commonly spelled &quot;cue&quot;, but also &quot;kew&quot;, &quot;kue&quot;, and &quot;que&quot;.

==History==
The Semitic sound value of Qôp was (voiceless uvular stop), and the form of the letter could have been based on the eye of a needle, a knot, or even a monkey with its tail hanging down. is a sound common to Semitic languages, but not found in many European languages. In common with other glyphs derived from the Proto-Sinaitic script, the letter has been suggested to have its roots in Egyptian hieroglyphs.

In an early form of Ancient Greek, qoppa (Ϙ) probably came to represent several labialized velar stops, among them and . As a result of later sound shifts, these sounds in Greek changed to and respectively. Therefore, qoppa was transformed into two letters: qoppa, which stood for the number 90, and phi (Φ), which stood for the aspirated sound that came to be pronounced in Modern Greek.

The Etruscans used Q in conjunction with V to represent , and this usage was copied by the Romans with the rest of their alphabet. In the earliest Latin inscriptions, the letters C, K and Q were all used to represent the two sounds and , which were not differentiated in writing. Of these, Q was used before a rounded vowel (e.g. &#x27;ego&#x27;), K before /a/ (e.g. &#x27;calendis&#x27;), and C elsewhere. Later, the use of C (and its variant G) replaced most usages of K and Q: Q survived only to represent /k/ when immediately followed by a /w/ sound.

In Turkey between 1928 and 2013 the use of the letter Q, alongside X and W, was banned from official government documents, such as street signs and brochures. The letter forms part of the Kurdish alphabet but is not present in Turkish.

=== Typographic variants ===

==== Uppercase &quot;Q&quot; ====
Depending on the typeface used to typeset the letter Q, the letter&#x27;s tail may either bisect its bowl as in Helvetica, meet the bowl as in Univers, or lie completely outside the bowl as in PT Sans. In writing block letters, bisecting tails are the fastest to write, as they require less precision. All three styles are considered equally valid, with most serif typefaces having a Q with a tail that meets the circle, while sans-serif typefaces are more equally split between those with bisecting tails and those without. Typefaces with a disconnected Q tail, while uncommon, have existed since at least 1529. A common method among type designers to create the shape of the Q is by simply adding a tail to the letter O.

Old-style serif fonts, such as Garamond, may contain two uppercase Qs: one with a short tail to be used in short words, and another with a long tail to be used in long words. Some early metal type fonts included up to 3 different Qs: a short-tailed Q, a long-tailed Q, and a long-tailed Q-u ligature. This print tradition was alive and well until the 19th century, when long-tailed Qs fell out of favor; even recreations of classic typefaces such as Caslon began being distributed with only short Q tails. American typographer D. B. Updike, who was known to disapprove of the long-tailed Q, celebrated their demise in his 1922 book &quot;Printing Types&quot;, claiming that Renaissance printers made their Q tails longer and longer simply to &quot;outdo each other&quot;. Latin-language words, which are much more likely than English words to contain &quot;Q&quot; as their first letter, have also been cited as the reason for their existence. The long-tailed Q had fallen out of use with the advent of early digital typography, as many early digital fonts could not choose different glyphs based on the word that the glyph was in, but it has seen something of a comeback with the advent of OpenType fonts and LaTeX, both of which can automatically typeset the long-tailed Q when it is called for and the short-tailed Q when it is not.

Owing to the allowable variation between letters, Q, like , is often cited as a letter that gives type designers a greater opportunity for self-expression. Identifont is an automatic typeface identification service that identifies typefaces by asking questions about their appearance and later asks about the Q tail if the &quot;sans-serif&quot; option is chosen. In the Identifont database, the distribution of Q tails is:

Some type designers prefer one &quot;Q&quot; design over another: Adrian Frutiger, famous for the airport typeface that bears his name, remarked that most of his typefaces feature a Q tail that meets the bowl and then extends horizontally. Frutiger considered such Qs to make for more &quot;harmonious&quot; and &quot;gentle&quot; typefaces. &quot;Q&quot; often makes the list of their favorite letters; for example, Sophie Elinor Brown, designer of Strato, has listed &quot;Q&quot; as being her favorite letter.

==== Lowercase &quot;q&quot; ====

The lowercase &quot;q&quot; is usually seen as a lowercase &quot;o&quot; or &quot;c&quot; with a descender (i.e., downward vertical tail) extending from the right side of the bowl, with or without a swash (i.e., flourish), or even a reversed lowercase p. The &quot;q&quot;&#x27;s descender is usually typed without a swash due to the major style difference typically seen between the descenders of the &quot;g&quot; (a loop) and &quot;q&quot; (vertical). When handwritten, or as part of a handwriting font, the descender of the &quot;q&quot; sometimes finishes with a rightward swash to distinguish it from the letter &quot;g&quot; (or, particularly in mathematics, from the digit &quot;9&quot;).

==Use in writing systems==
===English===
In English, the digraph most often denotes the cluster ; however, in borrowings from French, it represents , as in &#x27;plaque&#x27;. See the list of English words containing Q not followed by U. Q is the second least frequently used letter in the English language (after Z), with a frequency of just 0.1% in words. Q has the fourth fewest English words where it is the first letter, after X, Z, and Y.

<text>The history of Qatar spans from its first duration of human occupation to its formation as a modern state. Human occupation of Qatar dates back 50,000 years, and Stone Age encampments and tools have been unearthed in the Arabian Peninsula. Mesopotamia was the first civilization to have a presence in the area during the Neolithic period, evidenced by the discovery of potsherds originating from the Ubaid period near coastal encampments.

The peninsula fell under the domain of several different empires during its early years of settlement, including the Seleucid, the Parthians and the Sasanians. In 628 AD, the population was introduced to Islam after Muhammad sent an envoy to Munzir ibn Sawa who was the Sasanid governor of Eastern Arabia. It became a pearl trading center by the 8th century. The Abbasid era saw the rise of several settlements. After the Bani Utbah and other Arab tribes conquered Bahrain in 1783, the Al Khalifa imposed their authority over Bahrain and mainland Qatar. Over the following centuries, Qatar was a site of contention between the Wahhabi of Najd and the Al Khalifa. The Ottomans expanded their empire into Eastern Arabia in 1871, withdrawing from the area in 1915 after the beginning of World War I.

In 1916, Qatar became a British protectorate and Abdullah Al Thani signed a treaty stipulating that he could only cede territory to the British in return for protection from all aggression by sea and support in case of a land attack. A 1934 treaty granted more extensive protection. In 1935, a 75-year oil concession was granted to QatarEnergy and high-quality oil was discovered in 1940 in Dukhan.

During the 1950s and 1960s, increasing oil revenues brought prosperity, rapid immigration, substantial social progress, and the beginnings of the country&#x27;s modern history. After Britain announced a policy of ending the treaty relationships with the Persian Gulf sheikdoms in 1968, Qatar joined the other eight states then under British protection in a plan to form a federation of Arab emirates. By mid-1971, as the termination date of the British treaty relationship approached, the nine still had not agreed on terms of union. Accordingly, Qatar declared its independence on September 3, 1971. In June 1995, deputy emir Hamad bin Khalifa became the new emir after his father Khalifa bin Hamad in a bloodless coup. The Emir permitted more liberal press and municipal elections as a precursor to parliamentary elections. A new constitution was approved via public referendum in April 2003 and came into effect in June 2004.

==Prehistory==
===Paleolithic Age===
In 1961, a Danish archaeological expedition carried out on the peninsula uncovered approximately 30,000 stone implements from 122 Paleolithic sites. Most of the sites were situated along the coastline, and were divided into four separate cultural groups based on flint typology. Macrolithic tools such as scrapers, arrowheads and hand axes dating to the Lower and Middle Paleolithic periods were among the discoveries.

The flooding of the Persian Gulf roughly 8,000 years ago, resulted in the displacement of Persian Gulf inhabitants, the formation of the Qatari Peninsula and the occupation of Qatar to capitalize on its coastal resources. From this time onward, Qatar was regularly used as rangeland for nomadic tribes from the Najd and al-Hasa regions in Saudi Arabia, and a number of seasonal encampments were constructed around sources of water.

===Neolithic period (8000–3800 BC)===
Al Da&#x27;asa, a settlement located on the western coast of Qatar, is the most extensive Ubaid site in the country. It was excavated by the 1961 Danish team. The site is theorized to have accommodated a small seasonal encampment, possibly a lodging for a hunting-fishing-gathering group who made recurrent visits. This is evidenced by the discovery of nearly sixty fire pits at the site, which may have been used to cure and dry fish, in addition to flint tools such as scrapers, cutters, blades and arrowheads. Furthermore, many painted Ubaid potsherds and a carnelian bead were found in the fire pits, suggesting overseas connections.

In an excavation done in Al Khor in 1977–78, several Ubaid-period graves were uncovered in what is considered the earliest recorded burial site in the country. One grave contained the cremated remains of a young woman with no grave goods. Eight other graves contained grave goods, including beads made of shell, carnelian, and obsidian. The obsidian most likely originated from Najran in southwest Arabia.

===Bronze Age (2100–1155 BC)===
The Qatari Peninsula was close enough to the Dilmun civilization in Bahrain to have felt its influence. Barbar pottery was excavated in two sites by the Qatar Archaeology Project, suggesting Qatar&#x27;s involvement in Dilmun&#x27;s trade network. When the people of Dilmun began engaging in maritime activities around 2100 to 1700 BC, the inhabitants of Qatar started diving for pearls in the Persian Gulf. The Qataris were engaged in the trading of pearls and date palms during this era.

It has been argued that the remains of Dilmun settlements found in Qatar do not represent major evidence of long-term human habitation. Qatar remained largely uninhabited during this period due to regular migration by nomadic Arab tribes searching for untapped food and water sources. The settlements dating to the Dilmun period, particularly in Al Khor Island, may have been established to expedite trade journeys between Bahrain to the closest significant settlement in the Persian Gulf, Tell Abraq. Another scenario entails that the encampments were created by visiting fishermen or pearl fishers from Dilmun. It has also been suggested that the presence of pottery is indicative of trade between the inhabitants of Qatar and the Dilmun civilization, though this is considered unlikely due to the scarce population of the peninsula during this period.

Kassite Babylonian-influenced materials dating back to the second millennium BC, which were found in Al Khor Island, are evidence of trade relations between the inhabitants of Qatar and the Kassite. Among the findings were 3,000,000 crushed snail shells and Kassite potsherds. It has been asserted that Qatar was the site of the earliest known production of shellfish dye owing to a purple dye industry operated by the Kassite which existed on the island. The dye was obtained from the murex snail and was known as &quot;Tyrian purple&quot;. Dye production may have been supervised by the Kassite administration in Bahrain to export the dye to Mesopotamia.

==Antiquity==

===Iron Age and Babylonian–Persian control (680–325 BC)===
Assyrian king Esarhaddon led a successful campaign against &quot;Bazu&quot;, an area which encompassed Dilmun and Qatar, in . To date, no archaeological evidence of early Iron Age settlements has been discovered in the peninsula. This is likely due to adverse climatic changes rendering Qatar less inhabitable during this period.

In the 5th century BC, Greek historian Herodotus published the earliest known description of the population of Qatar, describing its inhabitants as &#x27;sea-faring Canaanites&#x27;.

===Hellenistic period (325–250 BC)===

Around 325 BC, Alexander the Great sent his top admiral, Androsthenes of Thasos, to survey the entire Persian Gulf. The requested charts arrived shortly after Alexander died in 323 BC. Seleucus I Nicator was awarded the eastern part of the Ancient Greek Empire after Alexander&#x27;s death. Starting from 312 BC, he expanded the Seleucid Empire eastward of Babylon, purportedly encompassing parts of Eastern Arabia. Archaeological evidence of Greek-influenced materials has been discovered in Qatar. Excavations north of Dukhan uncovered potsherds of Seleucid characteristics, and a cairnfield consisting of 100 burial mounds dating to the era was discovered in Ras Abrouq. The relatively large number of cairns suggest a sizeable sea-faring community prevailed in the area.

After losing most of their territories in the Persian Gulf, Seleucid influence ceased in the area by .

===Persian control (250 BC–642 AD)===

Following the eviction of the Seleucid by the Parthian Empire in , the latter gained dominion over the Persian Gulf and Arabian coast. As the Parthians were dependent on trade routes through the Persian Gulf, they established garrisons along the coast. Pottery recovered from expeditions in Qatar has demonstrated links to the Parthian Empire.

Ras Abrouq, a coastal city north of Dukhan, housed a fishing station which foreign vessels used to dry fish in 140 BC. Several stone structures and large quantities of fish bones were recovered from the site.

Pliny the Elder, a Roman author, wrote an account of the peninsula&#x27;s inhabitants around the mid-first century AD. He referred to them as the &quot;Catharrei&quot; and described them as nomads who constantly roamed in search of water and food. Around the second century, Ptolemy produced the first known map to depict the landmass, referring to it as &quot;Catura&quot;.

In 224 AD, the Sasanian Empire gained control over the territories surrounding the Persian Gulf. Qatar played a role in the commercial activity of the Sasanids, contributing to at least two commodities: precious pearls and purple dye. Sasanid pottery and glassware were found in Mezru&#x27;ah, a city north-west of Doha, and fragments of glassware and pottery were discovered in a settlement in Umm al-Ma&#x27;a.
Under the Sasanid reign, many of the inhabitants in Eastern Arabia were introduced to Christianity after the religion was dispersed eastward by Mesopotamian Christians. Monasteries were constructed in Qatar during this era, and further settlements were founded. During the latter part of the Christian era, Qatar was known by the Syriac name &#x27;Beth Qatraye&#x27; (ܒܝܬ ܩܛܪܝܐ; &quot;region of the Qataris&quot;). A variant of this was &#x27;Beth Catara&#x27;. The region also included Bahrain, Tarout Island, Al-Khatt, and Al-Hasa. The dioceses of Beth Qatraye did not form an ecclesiastical province, except for a short period during the mid-to-late seventh century. They were instead subject to the Metropolitan of Fars.

Muhammad sent Al-Ala&#x27;a Al-Hadrami, a Muslim envoy, to a Persian ruler in Eastern Arabia named Munzir ibn Sawa Al Tamimi in 628 and requested that he and his people accept Islam. Munzir obliged his request, and most Arab tribes in Qatar converted to Islam. It has been proposed by historian Habibur Rahman that Munzir ibn Sawa&#x27;s seat of administration existed in the Murwab or Umm al-Ma&#x27;a area of Qatar. This theory is supported by an archaeological find of approximately 100 small stone-built Islamic-period houses and fortified palaces of a tribal leader in Murwab, which are thought to have originated from the early Islamic period. After the adoption of Islam, the Arabs led the Muslim conquest of Persia which resulted in the fall of the Sasanian Empire.

It is likely that some settled populations in Qatar did not immediately convert to Islam. Isaac of Nineveh, a 7th-century Syriac Christian bishop regarded as a saint in some churches, was born in Beth Qatraye. Other notable Christian scholars dating to this period who hailed from Beth Qatraye include Dadisho Qatraya, Gabriel of Qatar, Gabriel Arya and Ahob of Qatar. In 674, the bishops of Beth Qatraye stopped attending synods.

==Caliphate rule==

===Umayyad period (661–750)===
Qatar was described as a famous horse and camel breeding centre during the Umayyad period. It began benefiting from its commercially strategic position in the Persian Gulf during the 8th century, going on to become a center of pearl trading.

During the Second Fitna, a renowned Khariji commander named Qatari ibn al-Fuja&#x27;a, who was described as the most popular, admired and powerful Khariji leader, led the Azariqa, a sub-sect of the Khawarij, into numerous battles. He held the title of Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin and ruled over the radical Azariqa movement for more than 10 years. Born in Al Khuwayr in Qatar, he also minted the first known Kharjite coins, the earliest of which dated to 688 or 689.

The Umayyad Caliphate brought about much political and religious change in Western Asia starting from the late seventh century. As a result, there were many revolts against the Umayyad at the end of the seventh century, particularly in Qatar and Bahrain. Ibn al-Fuja&#x27;a led an uprising against the Umayyad caliphs for more than twenty years.

In 750, discontent in the caliphate had reached a critical level due to the treatment of non-Arab citizens in the Empire. The Abbasid Revolution resulted in the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate, ushering in the Abbasid period.

===Abbasid period (750–1253)===
Several settlements, including Murwab, were developed during the Abbasid period. Over 100 stone-built houses, two mosques, and an Abbasid fort were constructed in Murwab during this era. Murwab fort is the oldest intact fort in the country and was built over the ruins of a previous fort which was destroyed by fire. The town was the site of the first sizable settlement established off the coastal area of Qatar. A similar site, containing T&#x27;ang stoneware and dating to the 9th and 10th centuries, was discovered in Al Naman (north of Zubarah).
Substantial development in the pearling industry around the Qatari Peninsula occurred during the Abbasid era. Ships from Basra en route to India and China would make stops in the port of Qatar during this period. Chinese porcelain, West African coins and pieces from Thailand have been discovered in Qatar. Archaeological remains from the 9th century suggest that Qatar&#x27;s inhabitants used greater wealth, perhaps from the pearl trade, to construct higher quality homes and public buildings. However, when the caliphate&#x27;s prosperity declined in Iraq, so too did it in Qatar.

Most of Eastern Arabia, particularly Bahrain and the Qatari Peninsula, were sites of revolt against the Abbasid Caliphate around 868. Mohammed ibn Ali, a revolutionary, roused the people of Bahrain and Qatar into a rebellion, but the rebellion was unsuccessful, and he relocated to Basra. He was later successful in instigating the Zanj Rebellion.

A radical Isma&#x27;ili group called the Qarmatians established a utopian republic in Eastern Arabia in 899. They considered the pilgrimage to Mecca a superstition and once in control of the Bahraini state they launched raids along the pilgrim routes crossing the Arabian Peninsula. In 906, they ambushed the pilgrim caravan returning from Mecca and massacred 20,000 pilgrims.

Qatar is mentioned in 13th-century Muslim scholar Yaqut al-Hamawi&#x27;s book, &quot;Mu&#x27;jam Al-Buldan (Dictionary of Countries)&quot;, which alludes to the Qataris&#x27; fine striped woven cloaks and their skills in improvement and finishing of spears, known as khattiyah spears. The spears acquired their name as an homage to the region of Al-Khatt which encompassed present-day Qatif, Uqair and Qatar.

==Post-Islamic Golden Age==

===Usfurids and Ormus control (1253–1515)===

Much of Eastern Arabia was controlled by the Usfurids in 1253, but control of the region was later seized by the prince of Ormus in 1320. Qatar&#x27;s pearls provided the kingdom with one of its main sources of income. The Portuguese defeated the Ormus by 1507 following the destruction of their fleet by Afonso de Albuquerque&#x27;s forces. However, Albuquerque&#x27;s captains grew rebellious, and he was compelled to abandon the Ormus island. Ultimately, in 1515, King Manuel I killed Sultan Saifuddin&#x27;s vizier Reis Hamed, pressuring the Sultan to become a vassal of King Manuel.

===Portuguese and Ottoman control (1521–1670)===
Bahrain and mainland Qatar had been seized by the Portuguese in 1521. After the Portuguese claimed control, they constructed a series of fortresses along the Arabian Coast. However, there have been limited findings of Portuguese ruins in Qatar. One possible contender for a Portuguese presence is the 16th-century fort built in Portuguese architectural style in the ruined town of Ruwayda. A map dating to 1563 created by Portuguese cartographer Lázaro Luís depicts &quot;Sidade de Catar&quot;, making it the earliest depiction of any specific settlement in Qatar. Some historians believe that it refers to Ruwayda, though there remains much ambiguity as to the location&#x27;s true identity.

Gasparo Balbi, a Venetian merchant and traveler, made the first mention of Qatar in a print book in the West. The book, titled &quot;Viaggio dell’Indie Orientali Balbi&quot;, detailed Balbi&#x27;s travels to the Far East from 1579 to 1588. In it, he mentions a place called &#x27;Barechator&#x27;, thought to be a corruption of &quot;Bar Qatar&quot;, or mainland Qatar.

The Portuguese focused on creating a commercial empire in Eastern Arabia, and exported gold, silver, silks, cloves, amber, horses and pearls. The population of Al-Hasa submitted voluntarily to the rule of the Ottomans in 1550, preferring them to the Portuguese. After the Portuguese were expelled from the area in 1602 by the Dutch and British, the Ottomans saw little need to maintain a military presence in the Al-Hasa region. As a result, the Ottomans were expelled by the Bani Khalid in 1670.

===Rule of Bani Khalid (1670–1783)===

Having expelled the Ottomans, the Bani Khalid held jurisdiction over Qatar from 1670 onward. In 1766, the Utub clans of Al Jalahma and Al Khalifa migrated from Kuwait to Zubarah in Qatar. By the time of their arrival in Zubarah, the Bani Khalid exercised weak power over Qatar, though the largest village was ruled by a distant relative of the Bani Khalid. After the Persian occupation of Basra in 1777 many merchants and families moved from Basra and Kuwait to Zubarah. The town became a thriving center of trade and pearling in the Persian Gulf region after this movement.

The Al Khalifa claimed Qatar and Bahrain by 1783, whereas Bani Khalid control of neighboring Al-Hasa officially came to an end in 1795.

==Al Khalifa and Saudi control (1783–1868)==
Following Persian aggression towards Zubarah, the Utub and other Arab tribes drove the Persians from Bahrain in 1783. Al Jalahma seceded from the Utub alliance sometime before the Utub annexed Bahrain in 1783 and returned to Zubarah. This left the Al Khalifa tribe in undisputed possession of Bahrain, who then transferred their power base from Zubarah to Manama. They continued to exert authority over the mainland and paid tribute to the Wahhabi to ward off challenges on Qatar. However, Qatar did not develop a centralized authority because the Al Khalifa sheikhs were primarily concerned with the affairs of Bahrain. As a result, Qatar went through many periods of &#x27;transitory sheikhs&#x27;, including Rahmah ibn Jabir al-Jalhami. By 1790, Zubarah was described as a safe haven for merchants who enjoyed complete protection and no customs duties.
The town came under threat by the Wahhabi from 1780 onward due to the intermittent raids launched on the Bani Khalid strongholds in Al-Hasa. The Wahhabi thought the population of Zubarah would conspire against their regime with the help of the Bani Khalid. They also believed that its residents practiced teachings contrary to the Wahhabi doctrine and regarded the town as an important gateway to the Persian Gulf. Saudi general Sulaiman ibn Ufaysan led a raid against the town in 1787. Five years later, a massive Wahhabi force conquered Al Hasa, forcing many refugees to flee to Zubarah. Wahhabi forces besieged Zubarah and several neighboring settlements in 1794 as punishment for accommodating asylum seekers. The local chieftains were allowed to continue carrying out administrative tasks but were required to pay a tax.

After defeating the Bani Khalid in 1795, the Wahhabi were attacked on two fronts. The Ottomans and Egyptians assaulted the western front, while the Al Khalifa in Bahrain and the Omanis launched an attack against the eastern front. The Wahhabi allied themselves with the Al Jalahmah tribe in Qatar, who engaged the Al Khalifa and Omanis on the eastern frontier.

In 1811, upon being made aware of advancements by the Egyptians on the western frontier, the Wahhabi amir reduced his garrisons in Bahrain and Zubarah to re-position his troops. Said bin Sultan of Muscat capitalized on this and attacked the Wahhabi garrisons in Bahrain and Zubarah. The fort in Zubarah was set ablaze, and the Al Khalifa were effectively restored to power.

===British involvement===

Britain&#x27;s desire for secure passage for East India Company ships led it to impose its own order in the Persian Gulf. An agreement known as the General Maritime Treaty was signed between the East India Company and the sheikhs of the coastal area (later known as the Trucial Coast) in 1820. It acknowledged British authority in the Persian Gulf and sought to end piracy and the slave trade. Bahrain became a party to the treaty, and it was assumed that Qatar, as a dependency, was also a party to it.

A report compiled by Major Colebrook in 1820 gives the first descriptions of the major towns in Qatar. All of the coastal cities mentioned in his report were situated near the Persian Gulf pearl banks and had been practicing pearl fishing for millenniums. Until the late eighteenth century, all of the principal towns of Qatar, including Al Huwaila, Fuwayrit, Al Bidda and Doha were situated on the east coast. Doha developed around the largest of these, Al Bidda. The population consisted of nomadic and settled Arabs and a significant proportion of slaves brought from East Africa. As punishment for piracy committed by the inhabitants of Doha, an East India Company vessel bombarded the town in 1821. They razed the town, forcing between 300 and 400 natives to flee.

A survey carried out by the British in 1825 notes that Qatar did not have a central authority and was governed by local sheikhs. Doha was ruled by the Al-Buainain tribe. In 1828, a member of the Al-Buainain murdered a native of Bahrain, prompting the Bahraini sheikh to imprison the offender. The Al-Buainain tribe revolted, provoking the Al Khalifa to destroy their fort and expel them from Doha. The expulsion of the Al-Buainain granted the Al Khalifa greater jurisdiction over Doha.

===Bahraini–Saudi contention===

Desiring to keep surveillance over the proceedings of the Wahhabis, Bahrain stationed a government official named Abdullah bin Ahmad Al-Khalifa on the coast of Qatar as early as 1833. Turning against the Bahrainis, he instigated the people of Al Huwailah to revolt against the Al Khalifa and open up a correspondence with the Wahhabis in 1835. Shortly after the revolt, a peace agreement was signed by both parties under the mediation of the son of the Sultan of Muscat. As part of the stipulations, Al Huwailah was demolished and its residents were moved to Bahrain. However, nephews of Abdullah bin Ahmed almost immediately violated the agreement when they incited members of the Al Kuwari tribe to attack Al Huwailah.

Residents of the peninsula were susceptible to skirmishes between the forces of the sheikh of Bahrain and the Egyptian military commander of Al-Hasa. At the end of 1839 or the beginning of 1840, the governor of Al-Hasa dispatched troops to lay waste to Qatar following the refusal of the Na&#x27;im tribe of Zubarah to pay the demanded tribute. The assassination of a governor in Hofuf prematurely ended the expedition before the forces could reach the country.

In 1847, Abdullah bin Ahmed Al Khalifa and a Qatari chief named Isa bin Tarif formed a coalition against Muhammad bin Khalifa, the ruler of Bahrain. In November, bin Khalifa landed in Al Khor with 500 troops and military support from the governors of Qatif and Al-Hasa. The opposition forces numbered 600 troops and were led by bin Tarif. On 17 November, a decisive battle, which came to be known as the Battle of Fuwayrit, took place between the coalition forces and the Bahraini forces. The coalition forces were defeated after bin Tarif and eighty of his men were killed. After he defeated the resistance troop, bin Khalifa demolished Al Bidda and moved its inhabitants to Bahrain. He sent his brother, Ali bin Khalifa, as an envoy to Al Bidda. However, he did not exercise any administrative powers, and local tribal leaders remained responsible for the internal affairs of Qatar.

Mohammed bin Thani and his tribe migrated from Fuwayrit to Al Bidda in 1848. Prior to this migration, each tribe and settlement had its independent leader, and there was no documented instance of their unification in battle. The concept of a unified land or nation was not present. However, with Mohammed bin Thani&#x27;s arrival, Qatar began to gain significant economic and political weight.

In 1851, Qatar served as a flashpoint for a conflict between Faisal bin Turki, Imam of the Emirate of Najd, and Muhammad bin Khalifa. Faisal had long sought to gain control of Bahrain and had previously attempted, and failed, to invade the island. In May 1851, Faisal launched his third attempt to capture Bahrain, ordering his forces to proceed towards Al Bidda, Qatar, which was intended to be used as a staging area for an invasion of Bahrain. In response, Ali bin Khalifa, the Bahraini representative in Qatar, called on all men of fighting age to defend Al Bidda, as well as sending for help from Saeed bin Tahnun Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi. Mohammed bin Thani served as one of the leaders of the Qatari forces.

From 2 June to 4 June 1851, the Battle of Mesaimeer was fought between Qatari-Bahraini and Wahhabi forces. On the first day, a skirmish of gunfire ensued between the Qatari-Bahraini forces and those of Faisal ibn Turki without any close combat. According to British and oral reports, the Wahhabis were routed by the allied forces on this day. On the second day, Qatari forces, led by Mohammed bin Thani&#x27;s son Jassim, engaged Faisal&#x27;s troops in a fierce battle while the Bahraini forces retreated to their ships, observing from the sea. On the third day, Faisal&#x27;s forces retreated to their camp at Mesaimeer. Mohammed bin Thani advised Ali bin Khalifa to make peace with Faisal, fearing a renewed attack once they regrouped. This suggestion was rebuffed by Ali bin Khalifa, who perceived it as betrayal.

Shortly after the battle ended, Mohammed bin Thani negotiated a separate peace agreement with Faisal in which he agreed to be under Wahhabi governance provided that he remains chief of Al Bidda. Faisal obliged his request, leading to Muhammad bin Khalifa imposing a blockade of Al Bidda after receiving news of this. On 8 June, Qatari forces under the leadership of Mohammed bin Thani assumed control of Burj Al-Maah, a watchtower guarding Doha&#x27;s main water source, close to Al Bidda Fort where the allied forces of Ali bin Khalifa and Saeed bin Tahnoun were stationed. Upon hearing the news, they fled to Bahrain without incident, much to the dismay of Faisal who admonished Mohammed bin Thani for not capturing them.

On 25 July, 1851, Saeed bin Tahnun negotiated a treaty between the Bahrainis and Wahhabis, in which the Bahrainis would pay an annual zakat to Faisal in exchange for his renouncement of any claims to Qatar and return of Al Bidda to the chieftainship of Ali bin Khalifa. Mohammed bin Thani, as party to this agreement, agreed to relinquish his position. This agreement led to Faisal&#x27;s departure for Al-Hasa on 26 July, 1851. Despite the peace agreement being signed earlier, Al Bidda&#x27;s blockade was only lifted on 2 August, 1851.

===Economic repercussions===
In a move which angered Mohammed bin Khalifa, Faisal bin Turki provided a safe haven for Abdullah bin Ahmed&#x27;s sons in Dammam in 1852. Consequently, the Bahrainis attempted to drive away residents of Al Bidda and Doha who were suspected of being loyal to the Wahhabi by imposing an economic blockade on the inhabitants, which prevented them from engaging in pearl hunting. The blockade continued until the end of the year. In February 1853, the Wahhabi began marching from Al-Hasa to Al Khor. After Bahrain received assurance from Qatar that they would not cooperate with the Wahhabi forces if they crossed their borders, they sent Ali bin Khalifa to the mainland to act as a collaborator with the local resistance. A British-mediated peace agreement was reached between the two parties in 1853.

Hostilities were provoked again after the Bahraini sheikh, in response to the harboring of Bahraini fugitives in Dammam, stopped paying tribute to the Wahhabi amir in 1859 and proceeded to instigate Qatari tribes to attack its subjects. Following threats made by Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud to attack Bahrain, the British navy dispatched a ship off the coast of Dammam to prevent any attacks. The situation escalated in May 1860 when Abdullah threatened to occupy the coast of Qatar until the annual tribute was paid. In May 1861, Bahrain signed a treaty with the British government in which the latter agreed to offer protection and recognize Qatar as a dependent of Bahrain. In February 1862, the treaty was ratified by the Indian government.

Following the involvement of the British, the sway that the Al Khalifa tribe held over Qatar&#x27;s affairs began declining. Mohammed bin Thani was described by Gifford Palgrave as the acknowledged governor of the Qatar Peninsula in 1863. Some of Al Wakrah&#x27;s inhabitants were forced to vacate the town by the Bahraini sheikh in April 1863 due to alleged links with the Wahhabi. The town&#x27;s chief, Mohammed Bu Kuwara, was taken into custody on a similar charge. In 1866, a report by the British revealed that Qatar was paying an annual zakat of 4,000 German krones to the Wahhabi, in encroachment of the 1861 British treaty. The report also contended that the Al Khalifa were taxing the people of Qatar for the same annual payment.

===Qatari–Bahraini War===

In June 1867, Ali bin Khalifa, the Bahraini representative in Qatar and brother of Muhammad bin Khalifa, seized a Bedouin from Al Wakrah and deported him to Bahrain. Mohammed bin Thani demanded his release, but Ali bin Khalifa refused. This prompted Mohammed bin Thani to expel him from Al Wakrah. Upon receiving news of this, Muhammad bin Khalifa released the Bedouin prisoner and expressed his desire for renewed peace talks. Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, the son of Mohammed bin Thani, traveled to Bahrain to negotiate on his behalf. He was imprisoned upon arrival, and a large number of ships and troops were soon sent to punish the people of Al Wakrah and Al Bidda. Abu Dhabi joined on Bahrain&#x27;s behalf due to the conception that Al Wakrah served as a refuge for fugitives from Oman. Later that year, the combined forces sacked the two aforementioned Qatari cities with 2,000 men in what would come to be known as the Qatari–Bahraini War. A British record later stated: 

In either late 1867 or June 1868, the Qataris attempted to launch a counterattack against the Bahrainis, however, they were defeated in the Battle of Damsah. An account of the battle written in 1933 by C.U. Aitchison, under-secretary of the British Raj, is as follows:
Contemporary sources state the 1868 attack was particularly violent, in some 1,000 were killed and 60 ships were destroyed.

The aftermath of the Battle of Damsah saw the Qatari forces execute a strategic withdrawal, prompting a pursuit by Bahraini troops to the settlement of Al Wakrah. At this location, the Qatari contingent mounted a defense, successfully encircling the Bahraini forces and capturing two of their commanders. The engagement concluded with a negotiated exchange of prisoners, following which Jassim bin Mohammed returned to his seat of power in Doha.

The joint Bahraini-Abu Dhabi incursion and Qatari counterattack prompted the British political agent, Colonel Lewis Pelly, to impose a settlement in 1868. Pelly&#x27;s mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the peace treaty that resulted were milestones in Qatar&#x27;s history. It implicitly recognized the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani as an important representative of the Peninsula&#x27;s tribes.

==Ottoman control (1871–1913)==

The Ottoman Empire expanded into Eastern Arabia in 1871. After establishing themselves on Al-Hasa coast, they advanced towards Qatar. Al Bidda soon came to serve as a base of operations for Bedouins harassing the Ottomans in the south, and Abdullah II Al-Sabah of Kuwait was sent to the town to secure a landing for the Ottoman troops. He brought with him four Ottoman flags for the most influential personages in Qatar. Mohammed bin Thani received and accepted one of the flags but sent it to Al Wakrah and continued hoisting the local flag above his house. Jassim bin Mohammed accepted a flag and flew it above his house. A third flag was given to Ali bin Abdul Aziz, the ruler of Al Khor.

The British reacted negatively to the Ottoman&#x27;s advancements as they felt their interests were at stake. Receiving no response to their objections, the British gunboat Hugh Rose arrived in Qatar on 19 July 1871. After inspecting the situation, Sidney Smith, the assistant political resident in the Persian Gulf, discovered that Qatar flew the flags willingly. To further add to their apprehension, Jassim bin Mohammed, who assumed his father&#x27;s role during this period, authorized the Ottomans to send 100 troops and equipment to Al Bidda in December 1871. By January 1872, the Ottomans incorporated Qatar into their dominion. It was designated a province in Najd under the control of the sanjak of Najd. Jassim bin Mohammed was appointed as the Kaymakam (sub-governor) of the district, and most other Qataris were allowed to keep their positions in the new government.
Charles Grant, the assistant political resident, falsely reported that the Ottomans sent a contingent of 100 troops from Qatif to Zubarah under the command of Hossein Effendi in August 1873. The sheikh of Bahrain reacted negatively to this because the Na&#x27;im tribe, which resided in Zubarah, had signed a treaty agreeing to be his subjects. Upon being confronted by the sheikh, Grant referred him to political resident Edward Ross. Ross informed the sheikh that he believed he had no right to protect tribes residing in Qatar. In September, the sheikh reiterated his sovereignty over the town and tribe. Grant replied by arguing that there was no special mention of the Na&#x27;im or Zubarah in any treaties signed with Bahrain. A British government official concurred with his views, stating that the sheikh of Bahrain &quot;should, as far as practicable abstain from interfering in complications on the mainland.&quot;

Another chance arose for the Al Khalifa to renew their claim on Zubarah in 1874 after an opposition leader named Nasir bin Mubarak moved to Qatar. They believed that Mubarak, with the assistance of Jassim bin Mohammed, would target the Na&#x27;im living in Zubarah as a prelude to an invasion. As a result, a contingent of Bahraini reinforcements was sent to Zubarah, much to the disapproval of the British, who suggested that the sheikh was involving himself in complications. Edward Ross made it apparent that a government council decision advised the sheikh that he should not interfere in the affairs of Qatar. The Al Khalifa remained in consistent contact with the Na&#x27;im, drafting 100 members of the tribe in their army and offering financial assistance. Jassim bin Mohammed expelled some members of the tribe after they attacked ships near Al Bidda in 1878.

Despite the opposition of many prominent Qatari tribes, Jassim bin Mohammed continued to show support for the Ottomans. However, there were no signs of improvement in the partnership between the two parties, and relations further deteriorated when the Ottomans refused to aid Jassim in his expedition of Abu Dhabi-occupied Khor Al Adaid in 1882. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab, who attempted to supplant Jassim bin Mohammed in 1888.

===Qatari–Abu Dhabi War===

During the period of Ottoman influence, Qatar was involved in a protracted conflict known as the Qatari–Abu Dhabi War. This series of territorial disputes and military conflicts occurred between Qatar, led by Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, under Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, from 1881 to 1893. The conflict was rooted in longstanding territorial disputes over poorly defined borders, competition for control of resources such as grazing lands and pearl banks, and the secession of the Qubaisat tribe from Abu Dhabi to Qatar in 1869. It was further complicated by allegations of piracy in disputed territories and the broader imperial rivalry between the Ottoman Empire and Britain in the Gulf region.

The war began with early skirmishes in 1881, including the battles of Baynunah, Suwaihan, and Al-Marsaf. Tensions escalated over the following years, with both sides engaging in raids and counter-raids. A significant incident, commonly known as the Second Destruction of Doha, occurred in August 1888 when Abu Dhabi forces attacked Doha, resulting in numerous casualties including the death of Jassim&#x27;s son, Ali bin Jassim.

The conflict reached its climax with the Battle of Khannour from January to February 1889. Jassim, with limited Ottoman support, mobilized a coalition of tribal forces to capture the fort of Khannour in Abu Dhabi territory after a 20-day siege. Following this, Qatari forces conducted extensive raids across Abu Dhabi territory, reaching as far as Al Ain and Al Buraimi.

After years of hostilities and diplomatic maneuvering, the conflict was finally resolved in 1893 through an agreement jointly brokered by the British and Ottomans. This war marked an important phase in Qatar&#x27;s transition towards independence and its emergence as a distinct political entity in the Gulf region, even while nominally under Ottoman rule. The conflict also reinforced British dominance in the region while exposing the limits of Ottoman influence.

=== Battle of Al Wajbah ===
In February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in Qatar to seek unpaid taxes and accost Jassim bin Mohammed&#x27;s opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim bin Mohammed moved to Al Wajbah (10 miles west of Doha); he was accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed demanded that he disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans. However, Jassim bin Mohammed remained adamant in his refusal to comply with Ottoman authority. In March 1893, Mehmed imprisoned his brother, Ahmed bin Mohammed Al Thani, in addition to 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman corvette &quot;Merrikh&quot;. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of ten thousand liras, he ordered a column of approximately 200 Ottoman troops to advance towards Jassim bin Mohammed&#x27;s fortress in Al Wajbah under the command of Yusuf Effendi.

Shortly after arriving to Al Wajbah, Effendi&#x27;s troops came under heavy gunfire by Qatari infantry and cavalry troops, which totaled 3,000 to 4,000 men. They retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they once again sustained casualties from a Qatari incursion. After they retreated to the fortress of Al Bidda, Jassim bin Mohammed&#x27;s advancing column besieged the fortress and cut off the neighborhood&#x27;s water supply. The Ottomans conceded defeat and agreed to relinquish the Qatari captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha&#x27;s cavalry to Hofuf by land. Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the Ottoman Empire, the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar emerging as an autonomous separate country within the empire.

===Later Ottoman presence===
On the cusp of Ottoman withdrawal from the Peninsula in 1915, the British government wrote the following description of the Ottoman presence in Qatar:
==British protectorate (1916–1971)==

The Ottomans officially renounced sovereignty over Qatar in 1913, and in 1916, the new ruler Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani signed a treaty with Britain, thereby instating the area under the trucial system. This meant that Qatar relinquished its autonomy in foreign affairs, such as the power to cede territory, and other affairs, in exchange for Britain&#x27;s military protection from external threats. The treaty also had provisions suppressing slavery, piracy, and gunrunning, but the British were not strict about enforcing those provisions.
Despite Qatar coming under British protection, Abdullah bin Jassim&#x27;s position was insecure. Recalcitrant tribes refused to pay tribute; disgruntled family members intrigued against him; and he felt vulnerable to the designs of Bahrain and the Wahhabi. The Al Thani were merchant princes, reliant on trade and especially the pearl trade, and dependent on other tribes to do their fighting for them, primarily the Bani Hajer who owed their allegiance to Ibn Saud, amir of the Najd and Al-Hasa. Despite numerous requests by Abdullah bin Jassim for strong military support, weapons, and a loan, the British were reluctant to become involved in inland affairs. This changed in the 1930s when competition for oil concessions in the region intensified.

===Oil drilling===

The scramble for oil raised the stakes in regional territorial disputes and signified the need to establish territorial borders. The first move came in 1922 at a boundary conference in Uqair when prospector Major Frank Holmes attempted to include Qatar in an oil concession he was discussing with Ibn Saud. Sir Percy Cox, the British representative, saw through the ploy and drew a line on the map separating the Qatar Peninsula from the mainland. The first oil survey took place in 1926 under the direction of George Martin Lees, a geologist contracted to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but no oil was found. The oil issue rose again in 1933 after an oil strike in Bahrain. Lees had already noted that, in such an eventuality, Qatar should be investigated again. After lengthy negotiations on 17 May 1935, Abdullah bin Jassim signed a concession agreement with Anglo-Persian representatives for a period of 75 years in return for 400,000 rupees on signature and 150,000 rupees per annum with royalties. As part of the agreement, Great Britain made more specific promises of assistance than they had in earlier treaties. Anglo-Persian transferred the concession to the IPC subsidiary company Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd. to meet its obligations under the Red Line Agreement.
Bahrain claimed rule over a group of islands encompassing the two countries in 1936. The largest island was Hawar Islands, situated off the west coast of Qatar, where the Bahrainis had established a small military garrison. Britain accepted the Bahraini claim over Abdullah bin Jassim&#x27;s objections, largely because the Bahraini sheikh&#x27;s personal British adviser was able to phrase their case in a legal manner familiar to British officials. In 1937, the Bahrainis again laid claim to the deserted town of Zubarah after being involved in a dispute between Abdullah bin Jassim and the Na&#x27;im tribe. Abdullah bin Jassim sent a large, heavily armed force and defeated the Na&#x27;im. The British political resident in Bahrain supported Qatar&#x27;s claim and warned Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa, the ruler of Bahrain, not to intervene militarily. Indignant over the loss of Zubarah, Hamad ibn Isa imposed a crushing embargo on trade and travel to Qatar.

Drilling of the first oil well began in Dukhan in October 1938, and over a year later, the well struck oil in the Upper Jurassic limestone. Unlike the Bahraini strike, this was similar to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Dammam field discovered three years before. Production was halted between 1942 and 1947 because of World War II and its aftermath. The disruption of food supplies caused by the war prolonged a period of economic hardship in Qatar, which began in the 1920s with the collapse of the pearl trade and was exacerbated in the early 1930s with the onsets of the Great Depression and the Bahraini embargo. As was the case in previous times of privation, entire families and tribes moved to other parts of the Persian Gulf, leaving many Qatari villages deserted. Abdullah bin Jassim went into debt and groomed his favored second son, Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, to be his successor in preparation for his retirement. However, Hamad bin Abdullah&#x27;s death in 1948 led to a succession crisis in which the main candidates were Abdullah bin Jassim&#x27;s eldest son, Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani, and Hamad bin Abdullah&#x27;s teenage son, Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani.
Oil exports and payments for offshore rights began in 1949 and marked a turning point in Qatar. The oil revenues would dramatically transform the economy and society and would also provide the focus for domestic disputes and foreign relations. This became apparent to Abdullah bin Jassim when several of his relatives threatened armed opposition if they did not receive increases in their allowances. Aged and anxious, Abdullah bin Jassim turned to the British. He promised to abdicate and agreed to an official British presence in Qatar in exchange for recognition and support of Ali bin Abdullah as ruler in 1949.

Under British tutelage, the 1950s witnessed the development of government structures and public services. Ali bin Abdullah was at first reluctant to share power, which had centered in his household, with an infant bureaucracy run and staffed mainly by outsiders. Ali bin Abdullah&#x27;s increasing financial difficulties and inability to control striking oil workers and obstreperous sheikhs led him to succumb to British pressure. The first official budget was drawn up by a British adviser in 1953. By 1954, there were forty-two Qatari government employees.

===Protests and reforms===
Large numbers of protests against the British and the ruling family occurred during the 1950s. One of the largest protests took place in 1956; it drew 2,000 participants, most of whom were high-ranking Qataris allied with Arab nationalists and dissatisfied oil workers. During another protest which took place in August 1956, the participants waved Egyptian flags and chanted anti-colonialism slogans. In October 1956, protesters tried to sabotage oil pipelines in the Persian Gulf by destroying the pipelines with a bulldozer. These were major impetuses to the development of the British-run police force which was established by the British in 1949. The demonstrations led Ali bin Abdullah to invest the police with his personal authority and support. This was a significant reversal of his previous reliance on his retainers and Bedouin fighters.

Public services developed slowly during the 1950s. The first telephone exchange opened in 1953, the first desalination plant in 1954, and the first power plant in 1957. Also built in this period were a dock, a customs warehouse, an airstrip, and a police headquarters. In the 1950s, 150 adult males of the ruling family received grants from the government. Sheikhs also received land and government positions. This mollified them as long as oil revenues increased. However, when revenues declined in the late 1950s, Ali bin Abdullah could not handle the family pressures this engendered. Discontent was fueled by his residence in Switzerland, extravagant spending, and hunting trips in Pakistan, especially among those who were excluded from the regime&#x27;s largesse (non-Al Thani Qataris) and among other branches of Al Thani who desired more privileges. Seniority and proximity to the sheikh determined the size of allowances.

Succumbing to family pressures and poor health, Ali bin Abdullah abdicated in 1960. Instead of handing power over to Khalifa bin Hamad, who had been named heir apparent in 1948, he made his son, Ahmad bin Ali, ruler. Nonetheless, Khalifa bin Hamad gained considerable power as heir apparent and deputy ruler, in large part because Ahmad bin Ali spent much time outside the country. One of his first acts was to increase funding for the sheikhs at the expense of development projects and social services. In addition to allowances, adult male Al Thani were given government positions. This added to the anti-regime resentment already felt by, among others, oil workers, low-ranking Al Thani, dissident sheikhs, and some leading government officials. These individuals formed the National Unity Front in response to a fatal shooting of a protester on 19 April 1963 by one of Sheikh Ahmad bin Ali&#x27;s nephews. While the Saudi monarch was at the ruler&#x27;s palace on 20 April 1963, a demonstration occurred in front of the building. Police fired and killed three demonstrators, prompting the National Unity Front to organize a general strike on 21 April. The strike lasted around two weeks, and most public services were affected.

The group made a statement that week where it listed 35 of its demands to the government entailing less authority for the ruling family; protection for oil workers; recognition of trade unions; voting rights for citizens and the Arabization of the leadership. Ahmed bin Ali rejected most of these demands and moved to arrest and detain fifty of the most prominent National Unity Front members and sympathizers without trial in early May. The government also instituted some reforms in response to the movements. This included the provision of land and loans to poor farmers, instituting a policy of preferential hiring of Qatari citizens, and the election of a municipal council.

The infrastructure, foreign labor force, and bureaucracy continued to grow in the 1960s, largely under the instruction of Khalifa bin Hamad. There were also some early attempts at diversifying Qatar&#x27;s economic base, most notably with the establishment of a cement factory, a national fishing company, and small-scale agriculture. An official gazette was first published in 1961, and in 1962, a nationality law was introduced. No cabinets existed during this period, however, British and Egyptian advisers helped establish a number of governmental departments, such as the Department of Agriculture and a Department of Labor and Social Affairs.

===Federation of nine Emirates===

In 1968, Britain announced its plans to withdraw its military commitments east of Suez (including those in force with Qatar) in the following three years. Because of the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms&#x27; vulnerability and small size, the rulers of Bahrain, Qatar and the Trucial Coast contemplated forming a federation after the British withdrawal. The federation was first proposed in February 1968, when the rulers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai announced their intention to form a coalition, extending an invitation to other Gulf states to join. Later that month, in a summit meeting attended by the rulers of Bahrain, Qatar, and the Trucial Coast, the government of Qatar proposed the formation of a federation of Arab Emirates to be governed by a higher council composed of nine rulers. This proposal was accepted and a declaration of union was approved. There were, however, several disagreements between the rulers on matters such as the location of the capital, the drafting of the constitution, and the distribution of ministries.
The rulers remained divided on multiple issues despite Khalifa bin Hamad&#x27;s election as chairman of the Temporary Federal Council in July 1968 and the establishment of numerous ministries. Two opposing blocs surfaced soon after the initial proposal, with Qatar and Dubai aligning together to oppose the inclinations of Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. Bahrain, being backed by Abu Dhabi, made efforts to marginalize the other rulers&#x27; roles in the union in an attempt to assume a leadership role and thus gain political leverage over their long-standing territorial disputes with Iran. The last meeting occurred in October 1969 when Zayed Al Nahyan and Khalifa bin Hamad were elected the first president and prime minister of the federation, respectively. There were stalemates on numerous issues during the meeting, including the position of vice president, the defense of the federation, and whether a constitution was required. Shortly after the meeting, the Political Agent in Abu Dhabi revealed the British government&#x27;s interests in the outcome of the session, prompting Qatar and Ras al-Khaimah to withdraw from the federation over perceived foreign interference in internal affairs. The federation was consequently disbanded despite efforts by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Britain to reinvigorate discussions.

Ahmad bin Ali subsequently promulgated a provisional constitution in April 1970, which declared Qatar an independent Arab Islamic state with the Sharia as its basic law. Khalifa bin Hamad was appointed prime minister in May. The first Council of Ministers was sworn in on 1 January 1970; seven of its ten members were Al Thani. Khalifa bin Hamad&#x27;s argument prevailed with regard to the federation proposal.

==Independence (1971–present)==

Qatar declared its independence on 1 September 1971 and became an independent state on 3 September. When Ahmad bin Ali issued the formal announcement from his Swiss villa instead of from his palace in Doha, many Qataris were convinced that it was time for a change in leadership. On 22 February 1972, Khalifa bin Hamad deposed Ahmad bin Ali when he was on a hunting trip in Iran. Khalifa bin Hamad had the tacit support of Al Thani and Britain, as well as the political, financial, and military support of Saudi Arabia.

In contrast to his predecessor&#x27;s policies, Khalifa bin Hamad cut family allowances and increased spending on social programs, including housing, health, education, and pensions. In addition, he filled many top government posts with close relatives. In 1993, Khalifa bin Hamad remained the Emir, but his son, Hamad bin Khalifa, the heir apparent and minister of defense, had taken over much of the day-to-day running of the country. The two consulted with each other on all matters of importance.

In 1991, Qatar played a significant role in the Gulf War, particularly during the Battle of Khafji in which Qatari tanks rolled through the streets of the town and provided fire support for Saudi Arabian National Guard units which were engaging Iraqi Army troops. Qatar allowed coalition troops from Canada to use the country as an airbase to launch aircraft on CAP duty and also permitted air forces from the United States and France to operate in its territories.
On 27 June 1995, Deputy Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa deposed his father, Khalifa, in a bloodless coup. An unsuccessful counter-coup was staged in 1996. The emir and his father are now reconciled, although some supporters of the counter-coup remain in prison. The emir announced his intention for Qatar to move toward democracy and permitted more liberal press and municipal elections as a precursor to expected parliamentary elections. A new constitution was approved via public referendum in April 2003 and enacted in June 2005. Economic, social, and democratic reforms occurred in the following years. In 2003, a woman was appointed to the cabinet as minister of education.

Qatar and Bahrain have had disputes over the ownership of Hawar Islands since the mid-20th century. In 2001, the International Court of Justice awarded Bahrain sovereignty over Hawar Islands while allotting Qatar sovereignty over smaller disputed islands and the Zubarah region in mainland Qatar. During the trial, Qatar provided the court with 82 forged documents to substantiate their claims of sovereignty over the territories in question. These claims were withdrawn at a later stage after Bahrain discovered the forgeries.

In 2003, Qatar served as the US Central Command headquarters and one of the main launching sites of the invasion of Iraq. In March 2005, a suicide bombing killed a British teacher at the Doha Players Theatre, shocking the country, which had not previously experienced acts of terrorism. The bombing was carried out by Omar Ahmed Abdullah Ali, an Egyptian resident in Qatar who had suspected ties to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In June 2013, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa stepped down as emir and transferred leadership to his son and heir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

As a means to manage the revenue gained from LNG sales, the Qatar Investment Authority was established in 2005. In 2008, the government launched Qatar National Vision 2030, which provides a framework for Qatar&#x27;s long-term development as well as identifying threats and solutions.

===Arab Spring and military involvements (2010–)===
Qatar played a role in the revolutionary wave of demonstrations, protests, and civil wars in the Arab world collectively known as the Arab Spring. Having shifted from its traditional diplomatic role as a mediator, Qatar moved to support several transitional states and upheavals in the Middle East and North Africa.

During the initial months of the Arab Spring, the country&#x27;s most extensive media network, Al Jazeera, helped mobilize Arab support and shaped the narratives of protests and demonstrations. Qatar sent hundreds of ground troops to support the National Transitional Council during the 2011 Libyan Civil War. The troops were primarily military advisers, and were sometimes labelled as &quot;mercenaries&quot; by the media. Qatar also participated in the aerial campaign alongside several other coalition members.

Qatar has taken a proactive role in the Syrian Civil War, which began in the Spring of 2011. In 2012, Qatar announced they would begin arming and bankrolling the opposition. It was further reported that Qatar had funded the Syrian rebellion by &quot;as much as $3 billion&quot; over the first two years of the civil war.

Beginning in 2015, Qatar has participated in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and forces loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the aftermath of the Arab Spring uprisings.
====Diplomatic crises (2014–2021)====

In March 2014, in protest of Qatar&#x27;s alleged involvement in financing factions and political parties in ongoing Middle Eastern conflicts, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors to Qatar. The three countries returned their ambassadors in November of that year after an agreement was reached.

On 5 June 2017, several countries led by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt (collectively referred to as the &#x27;Quartet&#x27;) severed ties with Qatar and enacted several punitive measures, such as closing air, land and sea borders to Qatar. Saudi Arabia also halted Qatari involvement in the ongoing war in Yemen. The Quartet justified their actions by alluding to alleged Qatari ties to &#x27;terrorist groups&#x27; in the region. On 5 January 2021, almost four years after the beginning of the incident, it was announced that the two parties reached an agreement in a deal brokered by Kuwait and the United States.

<text>Qatar is a peninsula in the east of Arabia, bordering the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia in a strategic location near major petroleum and natural gas deposits. The State of Qatar occupies on a peninsula that extends about north into the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula.

Varying in width between , the land is mainly flat (the highest point is ) and rocky. Notable features include coastal salt pans, elevated limestone formations (the Dukhan anticline) along the west coast under which lies the Dukhan oil field, and massive sand dunes surrounding Khor Al Adaid, an inlet of the Persian Gulf in the southeast known to local English speakers as the Inland Sea.

==Area and boundaries==
Qatar has one land border. The country borders Saudi Arabia to the south. The boundary with Saudi Arabia was settled in 1965 but never demarcated. This terrestrial sector extends from the head of the Gulf of Salwah at Abu Samra to Khor Al Adaid, spanning a linear distance of approximately .

Qatar presents as a peninsula encompassed by the tepid waters of the Persian Gulf on its eastern and northern flanks. The western margin is delineated by the Gulf of Salwah, a concave formation which effectively severs Qatar&#x27;s terrestrial connection with the Al-Ahsa coast and Bahrain.

Qatar&#x27;s northwest coast is fewer than from the main islands of Bahrain, while the small Hawar Islands of Bahrain are only off the coast. The largest islet of the Hawar Islands is located off Qatari mainland. The peninsula&#x27;s northernmost point is Ras Rakan.

===Maritime claims===
Qatar&#x27;s maritime boundaries include a contiguous zone of , an exclusive economic zone of as determined by bilateral agreements, and of territorial sea. Maritime boundaries were ratified in April 1992 with Decree No. 40. The exclusive economic zone was declared in 1974.

Situated on the western shore of the Persian Gulf, the Qatari promontory extends longitudinally into the waters, affording it a strategic position for the interception of rain-bearing winds and the regulation of maritime currents in the south-western basin of the Persian Gulf. The extended coastline facilitates the exploitation of pearl banks and piscatorial resources while also providing access to subaqueous petroleum deposits. Aside from hosting large numbers of pearl beds yielding high quality pearls, Qatari waters also host 48% of the coral reefs in the Persian Gulf.

The Qatari coast is further distinguished by its manifold indentations, comprising both convex protrusions of land into the sea, such as Ras Laffan, and concave incursions of water into the terrestrial mass. Moreover, the littoral serves as a natural harbour and transit point for numerous vessels plying the waters of the Persian Gulf.

===Islands===

Of the islands belonging to Qatar, Halul is the most important. Lying about east of Doha, it serves as a storage area and loading terminal for oil from the surrounding offshore fields. Hawar and the adjacent islands immediately off the west coast are the subject of a territorial dispute between Qatar and Bahrain.

==Climate==
The long summer (June through September) is characterized by intense heat and alternating dryness and humidity, with temperatures exceeding . Temperatures are moderate from November to March, ranging from as high as in April to as low as in January. Rainfall averages per year, confined to the winter months, and falling in brief storms which are occasionally heavy enough to flood the small ravines and the usually dry wadis.

Sudden, violent dust storms occasionally descend on the peninsula, blotting out the sun, causing wind damage, and temporarily disrupting transport and other services.

The scarcity of rainfall and the limited underground water, most of which has such a high mineral content that it is unsuitable for drinking or irrigation, severely restricted the population and the extent of agricultural and industrial development the country could support until desalination projects began. Although water continues to be provided from underground sources, most is obtained by desalination of seawater.

==Topography and natural regions==

The peninsula of Qatar is low-lying. Its shape is the surface expression of the anticlinal Qatar Arch, formed during the Precambrian Amar Collision about . It is enveloped by loose sand and pebbles broken off the outcropping limestone. Smooth plains covered by fine-grained dust are found in the east, while the south and south-west portions of the peninsula mainly comprise sand dunes and salt flats (locally known as sabkhas), particularly near Mesaieed and Khor Al Adaid. Sakbahs can also be found in western Qatar, near Dukhan and Sawda Natheel. Hill ranges (jebels) can be found in western Qatar near Dukhan and at Jebel Fuwayrit on the northeast coast. For purposes of categorization, the country is divided into five principal regions: coastal plain, interior plain, central belt, Dukhan region, and southern desert.

===Coastal plain===
The littoral of Qatar, extending some from Abu Samra to Khor Al Adaid via Ar Ru&#x27;ays, is emergent and characterized by recent geological formations. The western coast from Abu Samra to Ras Dukhan is relatively straight, while northward to Ar Ru&#x27;ays is indented with circular and oblong water incursions. The eastern coast is broader, with elevations increasing eastward from Dohah Al Husain. Many flat, low-lying offshore islands are located near the coast and are accompanied by coral reefs. As a result of salt water coming into contact with the low-lying land, many salt flats (known locally as sabkhas) have formed near the coast.

===Interior plain===

Commencing at the inland margins of the coastal strip, this region is demarcated in the north by the Al Mafjar-Abu Dhalouf line. It broadens considerably southward, with its northern sector spanning between Al-ʽAdhbah and Ar Rakiyat, while its southern base between Umm Al Qahab and Al Suwaihliya measures . The surface is studded with eleven closed basins. The northern sector is relatively flat, while the central sector, between Fuwayrit and Rawdat Al Faras, exhibits more complex topography with elevations ranging from to .

===Central belt=== 
This zone aligns with Qatar&#x27;s primary north-south oriented dome. It is distinguished by its topographical diversity, with elevations ranging from to above sea level. The surface is uneven, with circular or rectangular hills along the western borders reaching heights of to . Fourteen closed basins are scattered throughout, smaller in the east within the Rus Formation and larger in the west within the Dammam Formation. The highest points are found in the hills southeast of Al Jemailiya and to the west of the Al Jemailiya-Ash-Shahaniyah road.

===Dukhan region=== 

Occupying the greater part of Qatar&#x27;s western flank, this area extends from Ras Abrouq in the north to An Nakhsh in the south. It is characterized by complex structural units, with elevations reaching at Khashm An-Nakhsh and depressions as low as below sea level in the Dukhan Sabkha. This sabkha, the largest inland salt flat in the Persian Gulf, runs for approximately , occupies an area of , and accommodates the lowest point of Qatar at below sea level. Jebel Nakhsh, a notable mountain ridge south of Dukhan, contains substantial deposits of gypsum.

===Southern desert=== 

This region occupies 34.7% of Qatar&#x27;s total area, south of Doha&#x27;s latitude. It bears topographical similitude to the desert areas of Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, with undulating sand dunes interspersed with rocky hamada surfaces. It is divided into four sub-regions:
#Al Urayq: A triangular area in the extreme west, with its apex at Abu Samra. Its northern side aligns with the southern extremity of the Doha-Abu Samra road, and its southern side follows the border line from Abu Samra towards the southeast.
#Miocene-Tiwar: Characterized by isolated hills amidst a rocky plain. The hills reach a maximum of and include Qatar&#x27;s highest point, Qurayn Abu al Bawl. This sub-region is concentrated in the southwestern part of the Qatar Peninsula, including areas like Mukaynis, Al Kharrara, and Wadi Jallal.
#Rocky surfaces: Consisting of expanses of exposed bedrock, often weathered into flat, stony plains known as desert pavements. The surface may be covered by a mosaic of closely packed pebbles and rock fragments, or in some places by a thin layer of indurated mineral deposits forming a hard crust. This sub-region is divided into two units: one shaped like a trapezoid bounded by the water pipeline passing through Abu Nakhla to Mesaieed, and another extending from Umm Jawlaq southeastward through Al Khubayb, Al Fulayhah, and Umm Al Hayran to Khor Al Adaid.
#Sand dunes: Occupying 1.6% of Qatar&#x27;s area, with dunes reaching heights of to . Interspersed among the dunes are numerous closed basins with floors varying in elevation from to metres above sea level, resulting in an undulating topography. The northern boundary of this sub-region aligns with the latitude of Umm Owaina.

==Landforms==

===Sakbhas===
The peninsula is notable for its sabkhas, or salt flats, of which the two distinct varieties are coastal and inland. The coastal sabkhas, more prevalent on the eastern seaboard, encompass an area of approximately . These coastal formations rarely exceed an elevation of to metres above sea level, with some portions lying below the waterline. Consequently, during exceptionally high tides, often exacerbated by strong easterly winds, seawater may inundate these low-lying areas.

Inland sabkhas, while less common, are of significant geological interest. A prominent example, Dukhan Sabkha, lies 3 kilometres east of Jebel Dukhan and south of the Bay of Zekreet. This depression, covering , is largely situated below sea level and contains the lowest point in Qatar at below the sea&#x27;s surface. It stretches 24 kilometres from north to south and from east to west. A second notable inland sabkha complex straddles the borders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. This formation comprises three discrete areas: Sawda Natheel to the south, Jawa Salama to the west, and Al Khufus to the east. These sabkhas, mostly subsea in elevation, collectively span an area of .

===Depressions===

The surface of the Qatar Peninsula is punctuated by numerous small depressions, referred to as &quot;rawda&quot; or the plural &quot;riyadh&quot;. These formations present as enclosed basins, save for those in the south-central region which may be open on one or more sides. The morphology of these depressions is diverse, ranging from circular to elongated forms, with some exhibiting irregular platforms. The scale of these depressions also varies widely. The most extensive, such as the Almajdah Depression, stretch for several kilometres, while the smallest span mere tens of metres. Their formation is primarily attributed to the dissolution of surface limestone by rainwater runoff, a process that has been active across much of the peninsula.

===Valleys===
Dry valleys, known as wadis, are featured most prominently in Qatar&#x27;s northern region and the vicinity of Jebel Dukhan. They are characterised by their internal drainage systems, which terminate in shallow depressions rarely exceeding 2 to 3 metres in depth. While they may extend for several kilometres in length, they maintain a remarkably narrow profile, with a width invariably less than 100 metres.

===Hills===

The peninsula features several low hills scattered throughout its western and southern regions. Notable among these is Jebel Dukhan, a series of convex hillocks extending north-south along the west coast. The peninsula&#x27;s terrain also features distinctive flat-topped hills, formed by horizontal strata capped with relatively hard rock. These formations exhibit steep, often concave or stepped slopes, shaped by varying degrees of rock resistance.

Topographical features range from small, conical hills—where the resistant rock cap has eroded—to more extensive mesa-like formations. Elevation varies considerably; in the Zekreet Peninsula and near Al Khor, the hills are to above sea level. The southern hills are much taller, with Qatar&#x27;s highest point, Qurayn Abu al Bawl (also known as Tuwayyir Al Hamir) being over above sea level.

==Wildlife==

===Flora===
Although most of the country consists of sand deserts, a small part of the country houses different vegetation zones, where trees, reeds and shrubs like tamarind, phragmites, and mace can grow. These regions are mostly to the east, near the coast. The inherent limiting factor for vegetation growth is water availability. Certain geographical features partially alleviate this water scarcity, such as rawdas, which are large depressions found on the soil surface and which help recharge the aquifers. As these sites constitute the most easily obtainable sources of shallow groundwater, they are also among the areas most abundant in wild vegetation.

In the south, where groundwater is exceedingly scarce, vegetation can found growing in wadis (dry river valleys) fed by run-off from nearby hills and in rawdas.

===Fauna===
There are 21 species of mammals that have been recorded in Qatar. Larger terrestrial mammals such as the Arabian oryx and Arabian gazelle are protected animals and are held in nature reserves. The Arabian gazelle is the only native gazelle species to Qatar and is locally referred to as &#x27;rheem&#x27;. 

Qatar&#x27;s territorial waters in the Persian Gulf are rich in marine life. Sea turtles nest en masse on the coastline from Fuwayrit to Ras Laffan. The Ministry of Environment (MME) carries out routine patrols of nesting areas to ensure their conservation. Dugongs are known to congregate off the country&#x27;s coasts. In the course of a study being carried out in 1986 and 1999 on the Persian Gulf, the largest-ever group sightings were made of more than 600 individuals to the west of Qatar.

==Geology and mineral deposits==


Most of Qatar&#x27;s surface lies on Cenozoic strata. These strata have an abundance of mineral resources, most of which have not yet been exploited, such as limestone and clay. The Upper Dammam Formation in the Middle Eocene period is the most predominant surface layer. It is constituted by limestone and Dolomite. The northern zone of Qatar, which comprises the most significant source of fresh groundwater in the peninsula, primarily draws its water from the Umm Err Radhuma Formation and Rus Formation dating to the Paleocene and Lower Eocene periods, respectively. The Mesozoic strata are the most important layers as they contain petroleum. The first substantial deposit of crude oil was discovered in 1940 in the Jurassic period Arab Formation.

==Resources and land use==
Based on 2011 estimates, 5.6% of the land is agricultural. Arable land comprises 1.1%, permanent crops 0.2% and permanent pasture 4.6%. 94.4% of the land was used for other uses. In 2003, of land was irrigated.

Severe conditions, such as extremely high temperatures and lack of water and fertile soil, hinder increased agricultural production. Orthents, the predominant soil type in the peninsula, accounting for approximately 1,020,000 ha, are unfavorable for crop cultivation because of their extreme shallowness. The limited groundwater that permits agriculture in some areas is being depleted so rapidly that saltwater is encroaching and making the soil inhospitable to all but the most salt-resistant crops.

==Political and human geography==

The capital, Doha, is located on the central east coast on a sweeping (if shallow) harbor. Other ports include Umm Said, Al Khawr, and Al Wakrah. Only Doha and Umm Said are capable of handling commercial shipping, although a large port and a terminal for loading natural gas are planned at Ras Laffan Industrial City, north of Al Khawr. Coral reefs and shallow coastal waters make navigation difficult in areas where channels have not been dredged.

Doha is the capital of the country and the major administrative, commercial, and population center. In 1993 it was linked to other towns and development sites by a system of about of paved roads. Doha&#x27;s international airport has an approximately main runway, capable of receiving all kinds of aircraft.

Historically, settlement distribution in Qatar has mainly been dictated by the presence of obtainable fresh groundwater. Rawdas, which are depressions with shallow groundwater, have typically been the most popular sites of settlement throughout the peninsula. In Qatar&#x27;s south, where groundwater is exceedingly difficult to obtain, settlement formation was mostly limited to wadis (dry river valleys) fed by run-off from nearby hills and rawdas.

==Environmental agreements==
Qatar is currently party to the following international environmental agreements:
*Biodiversity
*Climate Change
*Desertification
*Hazardous Wastes
*Law of the Sea
*Ozone Layer Protection

<text>Natives of the Arabian Peninsula, many Qataris () are descended from a number of migratory Arab tribes that came to Qatar in the 18th century from mainly the neighboring areas of Nejd and Al-Hasa. Some are descended from Omani tribes. Qatar has about 2.6 million inhabitants as of early 2017, the vast majority of whom (about 92%) live in Doha, the capital. Foreign workers amount to around 88% of the population, the largest of which comprise South Asians, with those from India alone estimated to be around 700,000. Egyptians and Filipinos are the largest non-South Asian migrant group in Qatar. However the International Labour Organization published report in November 2022 that contained multiple reforms by Qatar for its migrant workers. The reforms included the establishment of the minimum wage, wage protection regulations, improved access for workers to justice, etc. It included data from last 4 years of progress in workers conditions of Qatar. The report also revealed that the freedom to change jobs was initiated, implementation of Occupational safety and health &amp; labor inspection, and also the required effort from the nation&#x27;s side.

Islam is the official religion, and Islamic jurisprudence is the basis of Qatar&#x27;s legal system. A significant minority religion is Hindu due to the large number of Qatar&#x27;s migrant workers coming from India.

Arabic is the official language and English is the lingua franca of business. Hindi-Urdu and Malayalam are among the most widely spoken languages by the foreign workers. Education in Qatar is compulsory and free for all citizens 6–16 years old. The country has an increasingly high literacy rate.

==Population==


==Foreigners==

Foreigners constitute 85% to 90% of Qatar&#x27;s population of 2.7 million, with migrant workers making up approximately 95% of the workforce. South Asia and the Philippines are the primary regions which migrants come from. Societal divisions exist depending on the origin of the foreigner, with Europeans, North Americans, and Arabs typically securing better job opportunities and social privileges than sub-Saharan Africans and South Asians. Socialization between foreigners and Qataris faces limitations due to language barriers and different religious and cultural customs.

The human rights of migrant workers is limited by the country&#x27;s Kafala system, which stipulates their requirement of a Qatari sponsor and regulates their entry and exit. Prospective migrant workers from origin countries sometimes face exorbitant recruitment fees, surpassing government-set limits, paid to licensed and unlicensed recruitment entities. These charges, ranging from $600 to $5,000, often force workers into debt and compel them to sell family assets. Government-to-government agreements have emerged in recent years to mitigate opaque recruitment practices and worker exploitation. Many companies in Qatar skirt local laws, resulting in workers facing delayed or non-payment of wages. While some employers deposit wages into bank accounts, most workers are paid in cash without detailed pay slips, hindering evidence of payment and complicating remittances. Additionally, the confiscation of passports by employers is a common practice in Qatar which limits the workers&#x27; freedom of movement and exposes them to potential exploitation.

===By nationality===
A 2011–2014 report by the International Organization for Migration recorded 176,748 Nepali Citizens living in Qatar as migrant workers. In 2012 about 7,000 Turkish nationals lived in Qatar and in 2016 about 1,000 Colombian nationals and descendants lived in Qatar. No official numbers are published of the foreign population broken down by nationality, however a firm provided estimates as of 2019:
Another firm has given estimations from countries&#x27; embassies:

==Qatari people==

Native Qataris can be divided into three ethnic groups: Bedouin Arabs, &quot;hadar&quot;, and Afro-Arab, which can be considered a sub-category of the hadar. Some of the hadar are of Iranian descent. Qatari citizens comprise 11.6% of the country&#x27;s population.

===Citizenship===
Two distinctions exist between Qatari citizens: those whose families migrated to Qatar before 1930, commonly referred to as &quot;native Qataris&quot;, and those whose families arrived after. Previously, the 1961 citizenship law defined Qatari citizens as only those families who have been in the country since the 1930s, though this was repealed in the 2005 citizenship law. In 2021, a law was signed by Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani restricting the rights to vote in local elections for those whose families&#x27; arrival post-date the 1930s, leading to minor demonstrations and public disapproval. This led Al Thani to later announce that he would amend the law to allow all citizens to vote in future elections. 

Children of Qatari mothers and foreign fathers are not granted Qatari citizenship; however, as of 2018, they are granted permanent residency status, which entitles them to similar state benefits as Qatari citizens. Nonetheless, the government limits the number of permanency residency visas it issues each year. The 2005 citizenship law allows for revocation of citizenship without appeal, which has been used on a number of families with dual citizenship.

===Ethnic groups===
Qatar&#x27;s population has been historically diverse due to its role as a trading center, a refuge for nomadic tribes, and a hub for the pearling industry. Ethnic groups and the differences among them are considered sensitive topics in Qatari society and are rarely discussed in official contexts.

Bedouins, though constituting approximately 10 percent of the population, hold an outsized role in local culture. Many Qataris descend from tribes that migrated from Najd and Al-Hasa in the 18th century. Commonly called the &quot;bedu&quot;, they maintain ties, homes, and even passports in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. In the early 20th century, bedu migrated from the Arabian interior, with some traveling intermittently between Qatar and Bahrain. During the mid-20th century economic boom, many found work in the oil industry, police, army, and security services. The government settled Bedu families in the 1960s, discouraging the nomadic lifestyle. Today, many live in urban areas but return to the desert to stay connected to their roots. Many Bedu see themselves as noble and &quot;pure&quot; Arabs, often looking down on the settled population (hadar) as influenced by urban and Persian elements. Intermarriage between these groups is rare.

The &quot;hadar&quot;, a diverse group of settled Qatari citizens, includes Baharna, Huwala, Ajam (Iranians), and Afro-Arabs. Baharna Arabs, a group native to Qatar and often practicing Shia Muslims, sometimes face discrimination from the Sunni majority. Huwala Arabs, who are Sunni Muslims, migrated through the Persian Gulf to Persia and back to Qatar. Historically wealthier and better educated due to trade and pearling, their advantage has diminished as education became more accessible. The Ajam, ethnic Shia Persians, were active in boat building and still speak Persian. Qatar’s Afro-Arab population descends from slaves brought from East Africa for the pearling industry. While some Arabs may view this group as &quot;less&quot; Qatari, most consider them full citizens. Despite occasional tensions, these groups are well integrated into Qatari society. Intermarriage is increasing, and Persian and African influences are evident in local culture.

=== Genetic Studies ===
A 2023 study focusing on the Y-chromosome, which is passed down paternally, analyzed DNA samples from 379 unrelated Qatari men to investigate their genetic heritage and connections to other populations in the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, and Africa. This research utilized 23 Y-STR markers, highly variable segments of DNA, to create genetic profiles and assess diversity within the Qatari male population.

The study revealed a high level of genetic diversity within the Qatari male population, with the marker DYS458 showing the most variation. Analysis of these genetic markers allowed for the prediction of Y-chromosome haplogroups, which are branches on the human Y-chromosome phylogenetic tree. The most prevalent haplogroup found in the Qatari sample was J1, accounting for approximately 49% of the individuals tested. This haplogroup is known to be common in the Arabian Peninsula and is associated with populations of Semitic origin, particularly Arabic speakers. The prominence of J1 in Qatar, forming a &quot;star-like expansion cluster&quot; in genetic networks, suggests a significant ancestral component linked to the broader Arabian region and potentially a more recent population expansion. Other haplogroups found in notable frequencies included J2, R1a, E1b1b, E1b1a, T, and L.

To understand Qatar&#x27;s genetic placement within the region, the study compared Qatari Y-STR data with that of 38 other Middle Eastern populations. This analysis revealed that Qataris are genetically closest to Iraqi Arabs, followed by Saudi Arabian populations. Conversely, they showed the greatest genetic distance from groups like Kurdish Iraqis, Turkish populations from Dogukoy, and Palestinian Christian Arabs. These relationships were visualized using multidimensional scaling (MDS) plots, which graphically represent genetic distances between populations. The MDS analysis placed Qatar within a cluster of populations from the upper Arabian Peninsula, including Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine, suggesting shared genetic affinities within this broad geographical area. Further analysis using phylogenetic trees and population structure analysis (STRUCTURE) corroborated these findings, consistently grouping Qatar with Iraqi Arabs and highlighting its distinctiveness from other Arabian Peninsula populations in some analyses, while also showing broader connections within the Middle East.

The study also investigated gene flow, or migration patterns, using Bayesian statistical methods. The analysis suggested that the primary migration route influencing the Qatari population was from Yemen to Kuwait, passing through Qatar. This finding aligns with a model of coastal migration within the Arabian Peninsula. While there was evidence of bidirectional migration between Qatar and neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and the UAE, the strongest signal pointed towards this Yemen-Kuwait axis. This genetic evidence supports historical understandings of tribal movements and trade routes along the Arabian Gulf coast.

==Religions==

Qatar is an Islamic state with multi-religious minorities like most of the Persian Gulf countries with waves of migration over the last 30 years. The official state religion is Sunni Islam. The community is made up of Sunni and Shi’a Muslims, Christians, Hindus, and small groups of Buddhists and Baha’is. Muslims form 65.5% of the Qatari population, followed by Christians at 15.4%, Hindus at 14.2%, Buddhists at 3.3% and the rest 1.9% of the population follow other religions or are unaffiliated. Qatar is also home to numerous other religions mostly from the Middle East and Asia.

==Languages==
===Arabic===

Arabic is the official language of Qatar according to Article 1 of the Constitution. Arabic in Qatar not only serves as a symbol of national identity but is also the medium of official communication, legislation, and education. The government has instituted policies to reinforce the use of Arabic, including the Arabic Language Protection Law enacted in 2019, which mandates the use of Arabic in governmental and public functions and penalizes non-compliance. Arabic speakers constitute a minority of the 2.8 million population, at around 11%.

Qatari Arabic, a dialect of Gulf Arabic, is the primary dialect spoken. As the prestige dialect within the nation, Qatari Arabic not only functions in everyday communication but also plays a significant role in maintaining cultural identity and social cohesion among the Qatari people. The vocabulary of Qatari Arabic incorporates a plethora of loanwords from Aramaic, Persian, Turkish, and more recently, English. Phonetically, it conserves many classical Arabic features such as emphatic consonants and interdental sounds, which distinguish it from other Arabic dialects that have simplified these elements. Syntactically, Qatari Arabic exhibits structures that align with other Gulf dialects but with unique adaptations, such as specific verb forms and negation patterns.

In Qatari Arabic, like many Arabic dialects, there is a significant phonological distinction between long and short vowels. This distinction is crucial for both pronunciation and meaning. Long vowels in Qatari Arabic are generally held for approximately twice the duration of their short counterparts. This length distinction can affect the meaning of words, making vowel length phonemically significant. Qatari Arabic typically includes five long vowels: /ā/, /ē/, /ī/, /ō/, and /ū/. These long vowels are analogous to the long vowels found in Classical Arabic and are integral to maintaining the clarity and meaning of words. For example, the word for &#x27;dog&#x27; in Arabic is /kalb/ with a short vowel, but with a long vowel, it becomes /kālib/, meaning &#x27;heart&#x27;. Short vowels in Qatari Arabic are /a/, /i/, and /u/. These vowels are shorter in duration and can be less emphasized in casual speech. In some dialectical variations, short vowels may even be dropped entirely in certain environments, a process known as vowel reduction. This feature is common in rapid, informal speech and can lead to significant variations in pronunciation from the standard forms of the language. The distinction between long and short vowels in Qatari Arabic not only affects pronunciation but also plays a role in the grammatical structure of words, influencing verb conjugations, noun cases, and the definiteness of nouns through the use of the definite article /al-/.

As English is considered the prestige lingua franca in Qatar, bilingual locals have incorporated elements of English into Qatari Arabic when communicating on an informal level. This mixture of English terms and phrases in Qatari Arabic speech is colloquially known as &quot;Qatarese&quot;. The practice of interchanging English and Arabic words is known as code-switching and is mostly seen in urban areas and among the younger generation.

As a result of mass migration, a South Asian pidgin form of Qatari Arabic has emerged in modern times.

===English===
English is the de facto second language of Qatar, and is very commonly used in business. Because of Qatar&#x27;s varied ethnic landscape, English has been recognized as the most convenient medium for people of different backgrounds to communicate with each other. The history of English use in the country dates back to the mid-19th and early 20th centuries when the British Empire would frequently draft treaties and agreements with the emirates of the Persian Gulf. One such treaty was the 1916 protectorate treaty signed between Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani and the British representative Percy Cox, under which Qatar would be placed under British administration in exchange for protection. Another agreement drafted in English came in 1932 and was signed between the Qatarian government and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. These agreements were mainly facilitated by foreign interpreters due to neither party possessing the required language skills for such complex arrangements. For instance, a translator and native Arabic speaker named A. A. Hilmy interpreted the 1932 agreement for Qatar.

===French===
Despite Qatar&#x27;s population comprising only 1% French speakers, the country was admitted to the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie as an associate member in 2012. It was not required to join as an observer state prior to its full admittance.

===Other languages===
Qatar&#x27;s linguistic diversity is significantly shaped by its large expatriate population from South Asia  and the Philippines. The most common Asian languages among migrants are Hindi, Urdu, Tagalog, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. Hindi and Malayalam are particularly prevalent, with large communities of speakers from India. For example, Malayalam is spoken by a significant portion of the Indian community originating from the southern state of Kerala, who make up the majority of the country&#x27;s Indian diaspora. Similarly, the widespread presence of languages such as Bengali, Tamil, and Urdu is attributed to a large portion of expatriates from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and other parts of India.

In 2015, there were more newspapers printed by the government in Malayalam than in Arabic or English.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Qatar, the importance of these languages was particularly recognized in public health communications. The Qatari government utilized Asian languages extensively in its awareness campaigns to ensure that critical health information reached all population segments, including those who might not speak Arabic or English proficiently. This multilingual approach involved disseminating information through various channels such as radio, printed pamphlets, and digital media.
