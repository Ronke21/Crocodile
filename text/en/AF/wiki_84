<text>Savate (), also known as French Boxing (French: &quot;Boxe Française&quot;) or French Foot Fighting, is a French hybrid martial art and full-contact combat sport that combines principles of western boxing with a wide variety of kicking techniques. Unlike kickboxing styles such as Muay Thai, which allow knee and/or shin strikes in competitive bouts, savate involves kicking exclusively with one&#x27;s feet, but participants can nonetheless target any part of the body. The sport is also notable for requiring footwear to be worn by the competitors, as would be expected from individuals fighting in the streets. A male practitioner of savate is called a &quot;tireur&quot; while a female one is a &quot;tireuse&quot;.

Savate de rue (), the term used to differentiate the original martial art meant for self-defense from the subsequent combat sport, is an overarching hand-to-hand combat discipline that incorporates knee and elbow strikes as well as joint locks, sweeps, throws, headbutts and takedowns, in addition to punches and kicks.

==Etymology==

&quot;Savate&quot; takes its name from the French for &quot;old shoe&quot; or &quot;old boot&quot;, referencing heavy footwear (more specifically the boots worn by French sailors at the time the discipline emerged).

==History==

The modern formalized form is mainly an amalgam of French street fighting techniques from the beginning of the 19th century. Savate was then a type of street fighting common in Paris and northern France.

According to one theory, in the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, his soldiers publicly displayed their &quot;aptitudes&quot; by kicking their prisoners&#x27; behinds. The punishment was known as “Savate”, which can be translated as “old shoe”.

===Origin===

Savate originated in France in the 17th century and was practiced by some sailors in the southern port of Marseille. According to historians, it was developed and learned by sailors on board the ships during their trips to the countries of the Indian Ocean and China Seas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chausson/Savate&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in every bar fight in French ports, it was common to see savate kicks. Sailors called this type of combat &quot;Chausson&quot;, in reference to the slippers normally worn on board. 

Contact with African and Brazilian fighting styles also occurred through interaction between French sailors and martial arts practitioners in the country&#x27;s colonial holdings. French naval ships between 1820 and 1833 travelled from France to ports in Brazil (Capoeira), Martinique (Danmyé) and Madagascar (Moraingy).

===Early history===

In the south, especially in the port of Marseille, sailors developed a fighting style involving high kicks and open-handed slaps. It is conjectured that this kicking style was developed in this way to allow the fighter to use a hand to hold onto something for balance on a rocking ship&#x27;s deck, and that the kicks and slaps were used on land to avoid the legal penalties for using a closed fist, which was considered a deadly weapon under the law. It was known as the &quot;jeu marseillais&quot; (game from Marseille), and was later renamed &quot;chausson&quot; (slipper, after the type of shoes the sailors wore). In contrast, at this time in England (the home of boxing and the Queensberry rules), kicking was seen as unsportsmanlike.

Traditional savate was a northern French development, especially in Paris&#x27; slums, and always used heavy shoes and boots derived from its potential military origins. Street fighting savate, unlike chausson, kept the kicks low, almost never targeted above the groin, and they were delivered with vicious, bone-breaking intent. Parisian savate also featured open hand blows, in thrusting or smashing palm strikes (la baffe) or in stunning slaps targeted to facial nerves. Techniques of savate or chausson were at this time also developed in the ports of northwest Italy and northeastern Spain—hence one savate kick named the &quot;Italian kick&quot; (&quot;chassé italien&quot;).

=== Reform ===

The two key historical figures in the history of the shift from street fighting to the modern sport of savate are Michel Casseux (also known as &quot;le Pisseux&quot;) (1794–1869) and Charles Lecour (1808–1894). Casseux opened the first establishment in 1825 for practicing and promoting a regulated version of chausson and savate (disallowing head butting, eye gouging, grappling, etc.).

However, the sport had not shaken its reputation as a street-fighting technique. 
Charles Lecour created a modern edition of the martial art by 1830. Charles Lecour incorporated boxing techniques with kicking techniques and showed how to use them together. He was the first to see savate as both a sport and self-defense system. Charles Lecour was the first to add English boxing gloves to the martial art which allowed his students to train their punches without injuring their hands.

Charles Lecour was exposed to the English art of boxing when he witnessed an English boxing match in France between English pugilist Owen Swift and Jack Adams in 1838. Lecour also took part in a friendly sparring match with Swift later in that same year. Lecour felt that he was at a disadvantage, using his hands only to bat his opponent&#x27;s fists away, rather than to punch. He trained in boxing for a time before combining boxing with chausson and savate to create the sport of savate (or &quot;boxe française&quot;, as we know it today). At some point &quot;la canne&quot; and &quot;le baton&quot;, stick fighting, were added, and some form of stick fencing, such as &quot;la canne&quot;, is commonly part of savate training. Those who train purely for competition may omit this. Savate was developed professionally by Lecour&#x27;s student Joseph Charlemont and then his son Charles Charlemont. Charles continued his father&#x27;s work and in 1899 fought an English boxer named Jerry Driscoll. He won the match with a round-kick (&quot;fouetté median&quot;) in the eighth round although the English said that it was a kick to the groin. According to the well known English referee, Bernard John Angle of the National Sporting Club, in his book &quot;My Sporting Memories&quot; (London, 1925), &quot;Driscoll did not know what he was taking on&quot; when he agreed &quot;to meet the Frenchman at his own game&quot;. Angle also said that, &quot;The contest ended in Jerry being counted out to a blow in the groin from the Frenchman&#x27;s knee.&quot; He further alleged that &quot;the timekeeper saved Charlemont several times&quot;. After the fight Driscoll bore no grudges, considering the blow to have been &quot;an accident&quot;. The French claimed victory for their man by stoppage, following a round-kick to Driscoll&#x27;s stomach.

=== Codification ===

Savate was later codified under a Committee National de Boxe Française under Charles Charlemont&#x27;s student Count Pierre Baruzy (dit Barozzi). The Count is seen as the father of modern savate and was 11-time Champion of France and its colonies, his first ring combat and title prior to the First World War. &quot;Savate de Défense&quot;, &quot;Défense Savate&quot; or &quot;Savate de Rue&quot; (&quot;street savate&quot;) is the name given to those methods of fighting excluded from savate competition. The International Savate Federation (FIS) is the official worldwide ruling body of savate.

Perhaps the ultimate recognition of the respectability of savate came in 1924 when it was included as a demonstration sport in the Olympic Games in Paris. In 2008, savate was recognised by the International University Sports Federation (FISU) – this recognition allows savate to hold official University World Championships; the first was held in Nantes, France in 2010. The 25th anniversary of the founding of the International Savate Federation, in March 2010, was celebrated with a visit to Lausanne, to meet with International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge. FISav President Gilles Le Duigou was presented with a memento depicting the Olympic Rings. In April 2010, the International Savate Federation was accepted as a member of SportAccord (previously known as AGFIS) – a big step forward on the road to Olympic recognition.

==Modern practice==
Despite its roots, savate is a relatively safe sport to learn.

Today, savate is practiced all over the world by amateurs from Australia to the U.S. and from Finland to Britain. Many countries (including the United States) have national federations devoted to promoting savate.

Modern codified savate provides for three levels of competition: &quot;assaut&quot;, &quot;pre-combat&quot; and &quot;combat&quot;.

* Assaut requires the competitors to focus on their technique while still making contact; referees assign penalties for the use of excessive force.
* Pre-combat allows for full-strength fighting so long as the fighters wear protective gear such as helmets and shinguards.
* Combat, the most intense level, is the same as pre-combat, but protective gear other than groin protection and mouthguards is prohibited.

Many martial arts provide ranking systems, such as belt colours. Savate uses glove colours to indicate a fighter&#x27;s level of proficiency (unlike arts such as many modern styles of &quot;karate&quot;, which assign new belts at each promotion, moving to a higher colour rank in savate does not necessarily entail a change in the colour of one&#x27;s actual gloves, and a given fighter may continue using the same pair of gloves through multiple promotions). Novices begin at no colour.

The qualifications for competition vary depending on the association or commission. In the French Federation a yellow glove can compete, and in Belgium a green glove can compete. In the United States, the competition levels start at novice (6 months). In Russia there is no requirement for a specific glove colour in order to compete.

The ranking of savate: Boxe Française is divided into three roads that a savateur can choose to take.
*Technical road: blue glove, green glove, red glove, white glove, yellow glove, silver glove I, silver glove II and silver glove III (violet glove for those less than 17 years of age). Prior to 1985 silver glove I, II, III did not exist. There was only one technical silver glove Rank (Original GAT) (Combining BF Savate and Canne de combat). After 1985 the silver glove technique (GAT BFS/Canne) was broken into 3 subcategories I, II and III and no longer included Canne de Combat. The &quot;yellow pommel&quot; is the &quot;New GAT (post 1985)&quot; of Canne de Combat.
GAT vs GAT# Patches: Pre and Post 1985 patches distinction: 
*The few remaining pre-1985 Silver Glove Rank (combining GAT1, GAT2, GAT3 and Canne de combat) wear a unique &quot;GAT&quot; rectangular patch rank (without number) on their uniform and are probably over 59 years old. The GAT was required for professorship.
*Post 1985 Silver glove Rank wear a rectangular patch rank with either &quot;GAT1&quot;, &quot;GAT2&quot; and &quot;GAT3&quot;. 
Similarly, the former FFBFSDA Professorship of BF-SAVATE requirements included Canne de Combat. New Savate &quot;instructorships&quot; tests do not have these requirements. Both sports have split although still under a same federation. These sports can be used in combinations together.
*Competition road: bronze glove, silver glove I (GAC1), silver glove II (GAC2), silver glove III (GAC3), silver glove IV and silver glove V.
*Teaching ranks: initiateur (instructor level 1), moniteur (instructor level 2/master) and professeur (rarely given). These ranks require additional knowledge than just savate. Examinations includes anatomy, regulations of savate, education training, first aid certification, savate techniques and other.
*Referee ranking: Juge arbitre stagiaire, Juge arbitre

In some clubs there is also a rank of aide-moniteur, while in other associations there is no rank of initiateur. Eight to twelve years of training on average are necessary for a student to reach professeur level; eight years average depending on skills. In France the professional professeur must have a French state certificate of specialized teaching (CQP AS, BEES 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree, 1st de CCB BPJEPS, DEJEPS, DESJEPS). These diplomas are university level education in sports with specialisation in savate (supervised by the French Federation of BF Savate and associated disciplines (Canne, Self Defense, Lutte, baton) (i.e.:FFBFSDA). The international federation (FIS), however, is still allowed to award professeur to non-French nationals without requiring such rigid system of education. French nationals have to submit and succeed to the rigid system of education and prove themselves in competition as well as being respected by peers, in order to have a slight chance to become a DTD (directeur technique départemental). Like any sport federations in France, the French and International Federation of Savate are under the control of France Ministry of Sport and Youth. This makes these two federations extremely powerful federations on the world scene. These two federations have followed a set of national traditions.

Nowadays, savate is just a term meaning Savate-Boxe Française. In the 1970s the term &quot;savate&quot; was rarely used in France to refer to the formalised sport: people mostly used the term Savate boxe française, Boxe-Française Savate, B.F, B.F.S., S.B.F. or simply boxe française. The term savate remains in use mostly outside France or when speaking a language other than French.

The global distribution of schools (salles) today is best explained through their stylistic approaches:
* La Savate-Boxe Française (1980–present): the technical abilities of both savate&#x27;s major kicking arsenal and English boxing were merged into a definitive sport of combat.
* La Savate Défense (1994–present): was first presented by Professeur Pierre Chainge, then produced into Self-Defense by Eric Quequet in 2000. After the French Federation dismantled Prof. Chainge and placed Michel Leroux in charge of the formations. It is based on La Boxe Française Savate, La Savate of the late 19th century, La Lutte Parisienne and the discipline* of La canne de Combat (stick) *includes also Le Bâton Français (staff), Le Couteau (knife), Le Poignard (dagger), La Chaise (chair) and Le Manteau (overcoat).
* Re-constructed historical savate: some savate has been re-constructed from old textbooks, such as those written in the late 19th or early 20th century. As such, this form of savate would be considered a historical European martial art. Re-construction of these older systems may or may not be performed by practitioners familiar with the modern sport and is not at present likely to be particularly widespread.
* La savate forme (2008): Cardio-kickboxing form of La Boxe Française-Savate.

These are the different stylistic approaches of the French arts of pugilism in the world today.

==In the United States==
In the United States Jean-Noel Eynard brought Savate Boxe-Francaise &amp; Canne de Combat (FFBFSDA) as a pioneer to the east coast. it is said that Daniel Duby brought Savate (FNBF) to the west coast in Southern California. The first real FFBFSDA/ FIS club of Boxe-Francaise Savate was open in 1983 on the east coast in Philadelphia at St Joseph&#x27;s University, under Jean-Noel Eynard, FFBFSDA/ FIS Professeur with the assistance of former FFBFSDA/ FIS DTN Bob Alix. Forward thinking, Jean-Noel Eynard registered a series of written worksheets (1983-1999) titled &quot;Prof. Eynard&#x27;s easy guide to savate&quot; with the U.S. Copyright Office and Library of Congress as copyrighted text, including the word &quot;Savate&quot; as a sport rather than something else. In 1988 the US Registry of Savate was created on the east coast which became the American Registry of Savate Instructors and Clubs in 1994 (ARSIC-International). Meanwhile, on the west coast Savate clubs were spurring from the California Association of Savate. A couple years later, under the collaborative assistance of a steering committee made of Gilles le Duigou (FIS), JN Eynard, ARSIC-International (PA), Armando Basulto (NJ) and Norman Taylor, USSF president(NJ) as well as few other individuals from California, the official name of United States Savate Federation was given to this combined association. The teaching efforts of Dr. Jean-Noel Eynard, Salem Assli and Nicolas Saignac contributed to the further development of Boxe Francaise Savate in the US. Bob Alix and L. Gillot&#x27;s &quot;pedagogie de la Boxe Francaise&quot;Pédagogie de la boxe française : de l&#x27;école au club introduced to the world &quot;Contact / Without being touched&quot; mentality (i.e.«être capable de toucher sans être touché»). This teaching methodology was used by the first instructors (Initiateurs, moniteurs) and Professors of SAVATE in the US who got certified by FFBFSDA. ARSIC-International has been instrumental at promoting savate in the US.

==Dress==
In official competitions, competitors wear an &quot;intégrale&quot; or a vest and savate trousers. They wear boxing gloves (with or without padded palms) and savate boots. Savate is the only kickboxing style besides Combat Hopak to use footwear, although some other combat sports such as Shoot Fighting and some forms of MMA sometimes also wear grappling-type shoes/boots. Savate boots can be used to hit with the sole, the top of the foot, the toe, or the heel. Sometimes a Headgear can be worn, e.g. in junior competitions and in the early rounds of Combat (full contact) bouts.

==Techniques==
In competitive or competition &quot;savate&quot;, which includes Assaut, Pre-Combat, and Combat types, there are only four kinds of kicks allowed along with four kinds of punches allowed:

===Kicks===
#&quot;fouetté&quot; (literally &quot;whip&quot;, roundhouse kick making contact with the toe—hard rubber-toed shoes are worn in practice and bouts), high (figure), medium (médian) or low (bas)
#&quot;chassé&quot; (side (&quot;chassé lateral&quot;) or front (&quot;chassé frontal&quot;) piston-action kick, high (figure), medium (médian) or low (bas)
#&quot;revers&quot;, frontal or lateral (&quot;reverse&quot; or hooking kick) making contact with the sole of the shoe, high (figure), medium (médian), or low (bas)
#&quot;coup de pied bas&quot; (&quot;low kick&quot;, a front or sweep kick to the shin making contact with the inner edge of the shoe, performed with a characteristic backwards lean) low only

===Punches===
#&quot;direct bras avant&quot; (jab, lead hand)
#&quot;direct bras arrière&quot; (cross, rear hand)
#&quot;crochet&quot; (hook, bent arm with either hand)
#&quot;uppercut&quot; (either hand)

==Savate de rue==

Savate did not begin as a sport, but as a martial art for self-defence taught in the streets of Paris and Marseille. This type of savate was known as Savate de Rue (street savate). In addition to kicks and punches, savate de rue incorporates knee and elbow strikes as well as joint locks, sweeps, throws, headbutts and takedowns.

== Events ==
The International Savate Federation holds World Championships in three disciplines: Savate Assaut, Savate Combat and Canne de combat. World Savate Combat Championships are being held for Seniors (over 21 years) and Juniors (18 to 21 years).

In Marvel Comics, the criminal mercenary Batroc the Leaper, an adversary of Captain America and mentor of Gwen Poole, is a master of savate, training the latter. The X-Men character Gambit is trained in savate.

In the issue &quot;Flight 714&quot; of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, Professor Calculus states that he used to be proficient in savate in his younger years. However, when attempting a kick, he ends up falling terribly, prompting stunned reactions from the onlookers. Dazed, Calculus remarks that he is out of practice. In &quot;The Black Island&quot;, Tintin himself kicks a villain and calls it a savate move.

In the 1967 novel &quot;Logan&#x27;s Run&quot;, protagonist Logan 3 often uses savate kicks for self-defense.

In DC Comics, the character Nightwing is a martial arts expert whose many skills include savate.

In the manga series &quot;Kengan Omega&quot;, Nicholas Le Banner uses a martial art he calls &#x27;Sahate&#x27;, created by incorporating techniques from Fencing, Savate, and Karate.

In the manga series One Piece, Sanji uses a martial art consisting exclusively of precise kicks using the toe or heel called the &quot;Black Leg&quot; style. While not textually based on savate, individual techniques have names in French, and the character&#x27;s other interests draw from mainstream French culture (such as cuisine and wine).

Ash Crimson from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; fights in a basic savate style that uses his own green flames. Ash himself is portrayed by SNK as a character with an unknown origin, because his lineage as descendant of Saiki (Those from the Past&#x27;s leader), but it says too that he was raised by the Blanctorche clan, a French family.

Remy from &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot; uses savate in a majority of his kick normals, combined with charge command specials reminiscent of Guile and Charlie Nash. His kick normals have a long reach but are slow and punishable, placing him low among competitive 3rd Strike tier lists.

== Influence on other martial arts ==

Bruce Lee also studied Savate and included many techniques to his own Jeet Kune Do style. Mixed martial arts also had influence in a similar matter, in UFC 1 world-champion savateur Gerard Gordeau participated, reaching the finals where he lost to Royce Gracie, and he went to corner and train many future Dutch MMA fighters. Other savateurs have competed in MMA, such as Bellator Light Heavyweight Champion Christian M&#x27;Pumbu, Karl Amoussou and Cheick Kongo.

<doc id="27903" wikidata="Q317014" url="?curid=27903" title="Sextus Julius Africanus">
<text>Sextus Julius Africanus ( 160 – c. 240; ) was a Christian traveler and historian of the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries. He influenced fellow historian Eusebius, later writers of Church history among the Church Fathers, and the Greek school of chroniclers.

==Descriptions==
The Suda claims Africanus was a &quot;Libyan philosopher,&quot; and Gelzer considers him of Roman and Ethiopian descent. Julius called himself a native of Jerusalem – which some scholars consider his birthplace – and lived at the neighbouring Emmaus. His chronicle indicates his familiarity with the topography of historic Judea.

Little of Africanus&#x27;s life is known, and all dates are uncertain. One tradition places him under the Emperor Gordianus III (238–244), others mention him under Severus Alexander (222–235). He appears to have known Abgar VIII (176–213).

Africanus may have served under Septimius Severus against the Osroenians in 195. He went on an embassy to the emperor Severus Alexander to ask for the restoration of Emmaus, which had fallen into ruins. His mission succeeded, and Emmaus was henceforward known as Nicopolis.

Africanus traveled to Greece and Rome and went to Alexandria to study, attracted by the fame of its catechetical school, possibly about the year 215. He knew Greek (in which language he wrote), Latin, and Hebrew. He was at one time a soldier and had been a pagan; he wrote all his works as a Christian.

Whether Africanus was a layman or a cleric remains controversial. Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont argued from Africanus&#x27;s addressing the priest Origen as &quot;dear brother&quot; that Julius must have been a priest himself but Gelzer points out that such an argument is inconclusive.

==Writings==
Africanus wrote &quot;Chronographiai&quot;, a history of the world in five volumes. The work covers the period from Creation to the year 221 AD. He calculated the period between Creation and Jesus as 5,500 years, placing the Incarnation on the spring equinox in AM 5501 (25 March, 1 BC). While this &quot;implies&quot; a birth in December, Africanus did not specify Jesus&#x27;s birth date. This method of reckoning led to several Creation eras being used in the Greek Eastern Mediterranean, which all placed Creation within one decade of 5500 BC.

The history, which had an apologetic aim, is no longer extant, but copious extracts from it are to be found in the &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Eusebius, who used it extensively in compiling the early episcopal lists. There are also fragments in George Syncellus, Cedrenus and the &quot;Chronicon Paschale.&quot; Eusebius gives some extracts from his letter to one Aristides, reconciling the apparent discrepancy between Matthew and Luke in the genealogy of Christ by a reference to the Jewish law of Levirate marriage, which compelled a man to marry the widow of his deceased brother, if the latter died without issue. His terse and pertinent letter to Origen impugning the authority of the part of the Book of Daniel that tells the story of Susanna, and Origen&#x27;s lengthy answer, are both extant.

The ascription to Africanus of an encyclopaedic work entitled &quot;Kestoi&quot; (Κέστοι &quot;Embroidered&quot;), treating of agriculture, natural history, military science, and other subects, has been disputed on account of its secular and often credulous character. August Neander suggested that it had been written by Africanus before he had devoted himself to religious subjects. A fragment of the &quot;Kestoi&quot; was found in the Oxyrhynchus papyri. According to the &quot;New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge&quot;, the Kestoi &quot;appears to have been intended as a sort of encyclopedia of the material sciences with the cognate mathematical and technical branches, but to have contained a large proportion of merely curious, trifling, or miraculous matters, on which account the authorship of Julius has been questioned. Among the parts published are sections on agriculture, liturgiology, tactics, and medicine (including veterinary practise).&quot;

==Verification of Moses==
The Kestoi survives only in fragments, chiefly those preserved by Eusebius and Georgius Syncellus. In turn Africanus preserves fragments of the work of Polemon of Athens&#x27; Greek History.

* FRAGMENT 13: From Georgius Syncellus, &quot;Chron.&quot;, Third Book. In Euseb., &quot;Præpar.&quot;, X. 40:
** 6. And from Moses, then, to the first Olympiad there are 1020 years, as to the first year of the 55th Olympiad from the same are 1237, in which enumeration the reckoning of the Greeks coincides with us.
:: [...] Polemo, for instance, in the first book of his Greek History, says: In the time of Apis, king of Argos, son of Phoroneus, a division of the army of the Egyptians left Egypt, and settled in the Palestine called Syrian, not far from Arabia: these are evidently those who were with Moses.

<text>Agnes of Rome (21 January 304) is a virgin martyr, venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Churches. She is one of several virgin martyrs commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass, and one of many Christians martyred during the reign of the Roman emperor Diocletian.

Agnes was born in 291 into Roman nobility, and raised as a Christian. She suffered martyrdom on 21 January 304, aged 12 or 13. Her high-ranking suitors, slighted by her resolute devotion to religious purity, sought to persecute her for her beliefs. Her father urged her to deny God, but she refused, and she was dragged naked through the streets to a brothel, then tried and sentenced to death. She was eventually beheaded, after attempts for her to be burnt at the stake failed. A few days after her death, her foster-sister Emerentiana was found praying by her tomb, and was stoned to death. 

An early account of Agnes, stressing her young age, steadfastness and virginity was written by the 4th-century theologian, St Ambrose. Since the Middle Ages, she has traditionally been depicted as a young girl with her long hair with a lamb (the symbol of her virginal innocence and her name), a sword, and a palm branch (an attribute of her martyrdom). Her bones are beneath the high altar of the church built over her tomb in Rome. Her skull is preserved in the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone, Rome.

==Biography==
According to tradition, Agnes was born in 291 into Roman nobility, and raised as a Christian. She suffered martyrdom on 21 January 304, aged 12 or 13, and during the reign of the Roman emperor Diocletian. A beautiful young girl, Agnes had many suitors who were young men of high rank. Slighted by her resolute devotion to religious purity, they submitted her name to the authorities as a follower of Christianity. One of them, a man named Procop, brought Agnes to his father, who was the local governor. He urged Agnes to deny God, but she refused.
The Prefect Sempronius condemned Agnes to be dragged naked through the streets to a brothel. In one account, as she prayed, her hair grew and covered her body. It was also said that all of the men who attempted to rape her were immediately struck blind. The son of the prefect was struck dead but revived after she prayed for him, causing her release. At the start of Agnes&#x27; trial, Sempronius recused himself, and another figure presided. After Agnes was sentenced to death, she was led out and bound to a stake to be burned, but the bundle of wood would not burn, or the flames parted away from her. The officer in charge of the troops drew his sword and beheaded her—or, in other texts, stabbed her in the throat. It is said that when Agnes&#x27; blood poured to the stadium floor, other Christians soaked it up with cloths.
Agnes was buried beside the Via Nomentana in Rome. A few days after her death, her foster-sister, Emerentiana, was found praying by the tomb. Emerentiana claimed to be the daughter of Agnes&#x27; wet nurse. She was stoned to death after refusing to leave the place and reprimanding the people for killing her foster-sister. Emerentiana was also later canonized. The daughter of Constantine I, Constantina, was said to have been cured of leprosy after praying at Agnes&#x27; tomb. She and Emerentiana appear in the scenes from the life of Agnes on the 14th-century Royal Gold Cup in the British Museum in London.

An early account of Agnes&#x27; death, stressing her young age, steadfastness and virginity, but not the legendary features of the tradition, is given by the 4th-century theologian, Ambrose.

The broader social circumstances of her martyrdom are believed to be largely authentic, though the legend cannot be proven true, and many details of the 5th-century &quot;Acts of Saint Agnes&quot; have been challenged. A church was built over her tomb, and her relics venerated.

==Veneration==

Agnes was venerated as a saint at least as early as the time of St Ambrose, based on an existing homily. She is commemorated in the &quot;Depositio Martyrum&quot; of Filocalus (354) and in the early Roman Sacramentaries.

Saint Agnes&#x27; bones are conserved beneath the high altar in the church of in Rome, built over the catacomb that housed her tomb. Her skull is preserved in a separate chapel in the church of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone in Rome&#x27;s Piazza Navona.

Agnes is remembered in the Anglican Communion with a Lesser Festival on 21 January.

St Agnes is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodox Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church, as well as the Anglican Communion and Lutheran Churches.

===Patronage===
Because of the legend around her martyrdom, Saint Agnes is patron saint of those seeking chastity and purity. She is also the patron saint of young girls and girl scouts. Folk custom called for them to practise rituals on Saint Agnes&#x27; Eve (20–21 January) with a view to discovering their future husbands. This superstition has been immortalised in John Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;The Eve of Saint Agnes&quot;.

===Iconography===
Since the Middle Ages, Saint Agnes has traditionally been depicted as a young girl with her long hair down, with a lamb, the symbol of both her virginal innocence and her name, and a sword (together with the palm branch an attribute of her martyrdom). The lamb, which is &quot;agnus&quot; in the Latin language, is also the linguistic link to the traditional blessing of lambs. Saint Agnes has been depicted with a lamb since the 4th century.

=== Blessing of the lambs ===
On the feast of Saint Agnes, two lambs are traditionally brought from the Trappist abbey of Tre Fontane in Rome to be blessed by the Pope. In summer, the lambs are shorn, and the wool is used to weave the pallia, which the Pope gives on the feast of Saint Peter and Paul to the newly appointed metropolitan archbishops as a sign of his jurisdiction and their union with the pope. This tradition of the blessing of the lambs has been known since the 16th century.

<text>Sichuan cuisine or Sichuanese cuisine, alternatively romanized as Szechwan cuisine or Szechuan cuisine (, Standard Mandarin pronunciation: ) is a style of Chinese cuisine originating from Sichuan province and the neighboring Chongqing municipality. Chongqing was formerly a part of Sichuan until 1997; thus, there is a great deal of cultural overlap between the two administrative divisions. There are many regional, local variations of Sichuanese cuisine within Sichuan and Chongqing.

It has bold flavours, particularly the pungency and spiciness resulting from liberal use of garlic and chili peppers, as well as the unique flavour of Sichuan pepper. Some examples are Kung Pao chicken and Yuxiang shredded pork. Four sub-styles of Sichuan cuisine include Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong (known for a genre of dishes called Yanbangcai), and Buddhist vegetarian style.

UNESCO declared Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to be a city of gastronomy in 2011 to recognise the sophistication of its cooking.

==History==
In the Middle Ages, Sichuan welcomed Middle Eastern crops, such as broad beans, sesame and walnuts. Since the 16th century, the list of major crops in Sichuan has even been lengthened by New World newcomers. The characteristic chili pepper originally came from Mexico but probably overland from India or by river from Macau, complementing the traditional Sichuan peppercorn (). Other newcomers from the New World included maize (corn), which largely replaced millet; white potatoes introduced by Catholic missions; and sweet potatoes. The population of Sichuan was cut by perhaps three-quarters in the wars from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. Settlers from the adjacent Hunan Province brought their cooking styles with them.

Sichuan is colloquially known as the &quot;heavenly country&quot; due to its abundance of food and natural resources. One ancient Chinese account declared that the &quot;people of Sichuan uphold good flavour, and they are fond of hot and spicy taste.&quot; Most Sichuan dishes are spicy, although a typical meal includes non-spicy dishes to cool the palate. Sichuan cuisine is composed of seven basic flavours: sweet, sour, numbing-spicy (like in Sichuan pepper), spicy, bitter, fragrant/aromatic, and salty. Sichuan food is divided into five different types: sumptuous banquet, ordinary banquet, popularised food, household-style food and snacks. Milder versions of Sichuan dishes remain a staple of American Chinese cuisine.

The superior natural resources of Sichuan Province provided plenty natural resources for the development of cooking. The flow of the Yangtze river through Sichuan Province provided nutrients for fundamental foods, spices, and a source of water.

== Category ==

Reconstructing the theoretical system of modern Sichuan cuisine under the new normal, including the division of the three schools of Sichuan cuisine, On the basis of the established theory of Shanghe Bang, Xiaohe Bang and Xiahe Bang, the standardized and complete expression is:

Shanghe Gang Sichuan cuisine is Rongpai Sichuan cuisine in Chengdu, Leshan-centered areas in the west of Sichuan. Its characteristics are friendly and peaceful, rich in seasoning, relatively light taste, multi-traditional dishes; Using chilli bean paste and sugar to flavor, it is the most widely circulated Sichuan cuisine. Shanghe Bangchuan cuisine is based on traditional classical recipes. It has a mild taste and a long flavor. At the same time, it concentrates on high-end government dishes such as royal and official dishes. Delicate and delicate, most of them are traditional Sichuan cuisine that has been handed down for a long time, and it has always been the official cuisine of Sichuan Governor and General Yamen. The overall taste of Shanghe Bang cuisine is mild. Hot pot is mainly oil-clearing hot pot and shuttle edge fish hot pot.

Xiaohe Bangchuan cuisine is salt gang cuisine centered on Zigong in southern Sichuan, including Yibin cuisine, Luzhou cuisine and Neijiang cuisine, which are characterized by thick taste, heavy taste and rich taste. Characterized by atmospheric, weird, high-end (the reason is salt merchants). Zigong Yanbang dishes are divided into three branches: salt commercial dishes, salt industrial dishes and hall dishes, with spicy taste, Mala taste and sweet and sour taste as three main categories. Yanbang dishes are characterized by rich, distinctive and rich taste. The most important thing to pay attention to is the taste of the food.

Xiahe Bangchuan cuisine is represented by Dazhou cuisine, Chongqing cuisine and Wanzhou cuisine. Together, they form the three main local flavor schools of Sichuan cuisine, representing the highest artistic level of Sichuan cuisine development.

Therefore, Sichuan cuisine has three characteristics: extensive ingredients, diversified flavoring, and strong adaptability to cuisine. It consists of five major categories: banquet dishes, popular side dishes, home-cooked dishes, SanZhengJiuKou dishes, flavor snacks and so on to form a complete flavor system.

== Theories of origin ==
There are also some different theories about the division of Sichuan cuisine regions, Wang Dayu introduced in the compilation of Sichuan cuisine history strategy by the Committee on Literature and History of the CPPCC in the whole country: Sichuan cuisine can be roughly divided into Chengdu Bang, Chongqing Bang, Dahe Bang, Xiaohe Bang, from the inside, each has its own special background and representative menu. Sichuan cuisine originated in Shu during the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, the beginning of Qin and Han dynasties, and the formation of classical Sichuan cuisine in Han and Jin dynasties. Characterized by Sichuan peppercorn and ginger. In the Tang and Song Dynasties, Sichuan cuisine was developed further, and Sichuan restaurants spread throughout Kaifeng and Lin&#x27;an, and won the favor of many diners for their taste characteristics. During the Song dynasty, Sichuan cuisine became an independent cuisine.

Sichuan is rich in products, and natural crops provide abundant raw materials for Sichuan cuisine. Among them, ginger, Sichuan pepper and other seasonings, as early as the Han dynasty, as Sichuan people &quot;like the flavor of spices&quot; characteristics known throughout the country. This flavor refers to the Sichuan peppercorn and ginger, not chili peppers. The taste of Sichuan people today is far from that of Li Bai Su Shi. If there were no chili peppers from South America in the Ming and Qing dynasties, it would not be Sichuan cuisine for Sichuan people today. Sichuan cuisine claims to have a history of more than two thousand years. However, it is difficult to say how much Sichuan cuisine is related to ancient Sichuan cuisine. One hard evidence is that before the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were no chili peppers in Sichuan cuisine. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, Sichuan cuisine developed further until the Republic of China. Modern Sichuan cuisine eventually formed the characteristics of &quot;rich variety&quot;, &quot;strong taste and spicy&quot;, and developed into the first dish of Chinese cuisine.

Chairman Mao once said on January 30, 1949, &quot;I believe that a Chinese medicine, a Chinese dish, will be China&#x27;s two major contributions to the world. &quot;This evaluation was repeated in 1953 when he took a nap at the Liuzhuang Hotel in Hangzhou.

Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, was awarded the honorary title of &quot;World Cuisine Capital&quot; by UNESCO in 2010, and only six cities in the world received it. Chengdu Sichuan cuisine has long been the official cuisine of Sichuan Governor and Yamen. Chili peppers were introduced into Sichuan and widely used in Sichuan cuisine, which was a watershed between ancient Sichuan cuisine and modern Sichuan cuisine. Probably during the Kangxi period in the early Qing dynasty. The book &quot;Flower Mirror&quot; written and published by Chen Xiuzi in 1688, Kangxi, is recorded in volume five: &quot;Pepper, a sea mad vine, commonly known as spicy eggplant……the most spicy, used by many people, very fine, winter moon to replace pepper. &quot;Here the paprika, is chili, also known as sea pepper, Qin pepper and so on. The perfect combination of chili peppers and broad beans (i.e., beans) created Sichuan bean, known as the soul of Sichuan cuisine, is widely used in Sichuan cuisine, which is regarded as a symbol of the formation of modern Sichuan cuisine. Peanuts, commonly known as Hu Beans, are the most famous of the many varieties of Sichuan Beans. Among the many varieties of Sichuan chilli bean paste, Pixian chilli bean paste is the most famous. The innovative use of pickled peppers, pickle and black bean sauce in Sichuan cuisine has formed 24 common flavors, 54 cooking methods and more than 3,000 classic traditional dishes in three categories of Sichuan cuisine, which are the hallmarks of modern Sichuan cuisine.

Native to Peru in South America, chili peppers were domesticated as cultivated species in Mexico, introduced to Europe in the 15th century, and introduced from the sea to China in the late 16th century, the late Ming dynasty. Because of the introduction of Western countries, it is also called &quot; Fan pepper&quot;. It is also called &quot;sea pepper&quot; because it is introduced from the sea, and Sichuan chili pepper is introduced from Guanzhong to Shu, so it is also called &quot;Qin pepper&quot;. Sichuan cuisine is famous for its excellent use of chili chilli peppers and Sichuan peppers, which have been used for more than a thousand years as a characteristic and representative of Sichuan cuisine. Therefore, the Western translation of pepper is literally translated as &quot;Sichuan Pepper&quot;, which shows the influence of pepper and Sichuan cuisine in the world.

==Features==
The complex topography of Sichuan Province, including its mountains, hills, plains, plateaus and the Sichuan Basin, has shaped its food customs with versatile and distinct ingredients.

Abundant rice and vegetables are produced from the fertile Sichuan Basin, whereas a wide variety of herbs, mushrooms and other fungi prosper in the highland regions. Pork is overwhelmingly the most common type of meat consumed. Beef is somewhat more common in Sichuan cuisine than it is in other Chinese cuisines, perhaps due to the prevalence of oxen in the region. Sichuan cuisine also uses various bovine and porcine organs as ingredients, such as intestine, arteries, head, tongue, skin and liver, in addition to other commonly used portions of the meat. Rabbit meat is also much more popular in Sichuan than elsewhere in China. It is estimated that the Sichuan Basin and Chongqing area are responsible for about 70 percent of China&#x27;s total rabbit meat consumption. Yoghurt, which probably spread from India through Tibet in medieval times, is consumed among the Han Chinese. This is an unusual custom in other parts of the country. The salt produced from Sichuan salt springs and wells, unlike sea salt, does not contain iodine, which led to goiter problems before the 20th century.

Sichuan cuisine often contains food preserved through pickling, salting and drying. Preserved dishes are generally served as spicy dishes with heavy application of chili oil.

===Meal styles===
The most unique and important spice in Sichuan cuisine is the Sichuan pepper (). Sichuan peppercorn has an intense, fragrant citrus-like flavour and produces a &quot;tingly-numbing&quot; () sensation in the mouth. Other commonly used spices in Sichuan cuisine are garlic, chili peppers, ginger, and star anise. There are 40 kinds of Sichuan cuisine cooking techniques such as frying, stir fry, oiling, and crispy fried. Taste type to spicy, fish flavor, strange taste as its outstanding characteristics.

Broad bean chili paste () is one of the most important seasonings. It is an essential component to famous dishes such as Mapo tofu and double-cooked pork slices. Sichuan cuisine is the origin of several prominent sauces/flavours widely used in modern Chinese cuisine, including:
* &quot;Yuxiang&quot; (魚香)
* &quot;Mala&quot; (麻辣) 
* &quot;Guaiwei&quot; (怪味)
Other examples of mixed flavor including spicy and hot (&quot;Mala),&quot; fish flavor (&quot;Yuxiang&quot;), hot and sour, the five spices (&quot;Wuxiang;&quot; 五香), ginger juice, mashed garlic, sweet and sour, spice salt (&quot;Jiaoyan&quot;; 椒盐), dried tangerine or orange peel (&quot;Chenpi&quot;; 陈皮), burnt chili, pot-stewed fowl (&quot;Lu&quot;; 卤味), odd flavor (&quot;Guaiwei&quot;; 怪味), and other recombinations of these seasonings.

Common preparation techniques in Sichuan cuisine include stir frying, steaming and braising, but a complete list would include more than 20 distinct techniques.

<text>Shanghai cuisine (; Shanghainese: &quot;zaon⁶ he⁵ tshe¹&quot;; IPA: ), also known as Hu cuisine (; Shanghainese: &quot;wu⁶ tshe¹&quot;; IPA: ), is a popular style of Chinese food. In a narrow sense, Shanghai cuisine refers only to what is traditionally called Benbang cuisine (; &quot;pen⁵ paon¹ tshe⁵&quot;; &#x27;local cuisine&#x27;) which originated in Shanghai. In a broader sense, it refers to complex styles of cooking developed under the influence of neighboring Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.

The dishes within the cuisine need to master the three elements of &quot;color, aroma, and taste&quot; (). Like other cuisines within China, Shanghai cuisine emphasizes the use of seasonings, the quality of raw ingredients, and preserving the original flavors of ingredients. The adoption of Western influence in Shanghai cuisine resulted in a unique cooking style known as Haipai cuisine ().

==Characteristic features==
Shanghai cuisine is characterized by its use of soy sauce, which gives dishes a red and shiny appearance. Both dark soy sauce and regular soy sauce are used in Shanghai cooking. Dark soy sauce creates a dark amber color in dishes, while regular soy sauce enhances the flavor. The four classic words used to describe Shanghai food are &quot;&quot;, which means that Shanghai food uses a considerable amount of oil and soy sauce. Dishes are prepared using various methods, such as baking, stewing, braising, steaming, and deep-frying. Seafood is also a prominent feature of Shanghai cuisine, with fish, crab, and chicken being made &quot;drunken&quot; using spirits and brisk cooking techniques. Salted meats and preserved vegetables are commonly used to enhance various dishes. Additionally, sugar plays an important role in Shanghai cuisine when used in combination with soy sauce. Rice is more commonly served than noodles or other wheat products. 

Shanghai cuisine aims to emphasize the original flavors of raw ingredients while utilizing condiments to enhance the taste. Compared to other Chinese cuisines, it has a mellower and slightly sweet taste. Sweet and sour is a typical Shanghai taste. Presentation is also a key aspect of Shanghai cuisine, with ingredients being meticulously cut and arranged to create a harmonious color scheme.

Interestingly, in the early 20th century, Shanghai families did not regularly include fish in their daily meals despite the city being a port town. Meat was considered a luxury, and meals typically consisted of vegetables, beans, and rice. Families would only consume meat or fish four times a month, on the second, eighth, sixteenth, and twenty-third days, which were known as &quot;dang hun&quot;. Today, with greater awareness of nutrition, there is a higher demand for low-sugar and low-fat foods, and more vegetables are being incorporated into diets to promote healthier eating habits.

==History==

Shanghai cuisine is the youngest of the ten major cuisines of China, although it still has more than 400 years of history. Traditionally called Benbang cuisine, it originated in the Ming and Qing dynasties (c. 1368–1840). During the reign of Emperor Jiaqing and Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, a food stall was set up in the old city of Shanghai called &quot;Shovel Bang&quot; (). After 1930, as Shanghai&#x27;s industry and commerce rapidly developed, the main customers of Benbang cuisine were an emerging class of workers. As a result, the proportion of inexpensive dishes in Benbang cuisine began to decrease.

In the later part of the 19th century, after Shanghai became a major domestic and international trading port, Benbang dishes underwent substantial change. After the opening of Shanghai port in 1843, sixteen different catering schools opened in Shanghai. Anhui cuisine was the first to gain popularity in Shanghai, followed by Suxi cuisine, Cantonese cuisine, Huaiyang cuisine, and Beijing cuisine. In the 1930s, Suxi cuisine was prevalent in almost half of Shanghai&#x27;s restaurants. Guangdong cuisine was highly popular among both residents of Shanghai and foreigners. As a result of adopting influences from other cuisines, the flavors of Shanghai cuisine became more complex.

Western influence in Shanghai cuisine resulted in the development of a unique cooking style known as Haipai cuisine (). At the time, eating Western food was considered fashionable, but Chinese people initially struggled to adapt to certain aspects of Western cuisine, such as rare steak. Western food in Shanghai was influenced by many countries but formed its own distinct characteristics. Russian Shanghai Western food, which typically included one main dish and one soup (such as borscht, bread and butter), became particularly popular in Shanghai due to its economic benefits. Before 1937, there were over 200 Western restaurants in Shanghai, particularly on Xiafei Road and Fuzhou Road.

Nowadays, Shanghai&#x27;s traditional cuisine is usually found only in home-cooked meals and some old Benbang restaurants. Shanghai is now more famous for its numerous exotic restaurants, especially those serving Japanese and French food.

==Notable dishes in Shanghai cuisine==

=== Breakfast ===
Breakfast food in Shanghai is varied and contains foods mainly made from wheat, rice, and flour. Many of them are influenced by Cantonese, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang cuisine, and through historical precipitation, these breakfasts have slowly become favorites of people in Shanghai today. The most classic Shanghai breakfast is called &quot;The Four Warriors&quot; (; &quot;sy⁵ du⁶ cin¹ kaon¹&quot;). These are the four most popular breakfast choices for Shanghainese.

* Glutinous rice rolls (; &quot;tshy¹ ve⁶&quot;)
* Soy milk (; &quot;deu⁶ cian¹&quot;)
* Chinese cruller (; &quot;yeu⁶ diau⁶&quot;)
* Sesame pancake (; &quot;du⁶ pin⁵&quot;)

===Seafood===
Seafood is commonly seen in Shanghai cuisine. These are some popular dishes.
* Eel noodles (; &quot;moe⁶ ng⁶ mi⁶&quot;) – Made with sliced eels and wheat noodles.
*Scallion stewed crucian carp (; &quot;tshon¹ sau¹ ciq⁷ ng⁶&quot;) – The preparation of this common crucian carp dish is quite involved and complex. It requires a significant amount of time to prepare, as the fish must be soaked in vinegar, deep-fried, stewed for a prolonged period, and cooled to make it tender enough to be consumed with all its bones. The difficulty in perfecting this dish, as well as its complexity, led to it being used as a test by families when recruiting a cook.
* Shanghai hairy crab (; &quot;zaon⁶ he⁵ mau⁶ ha⁵&quot;) – A variety of Chinese mitten crab. The crab is usually steamed with ginger, and eaten with a dipping sauce of rice vinegar, sugar, and ginger. Crab meat can be mixed with lard to make &quot;xiefen&quot;, or consumed in xiaolongbao or with tofu.
* Squirrel-shaped mandarin fish (; &quot;son¹ tshy⁵ kue⁵ ng⁶&quot;) – This dish features fresh mandarin fish and combines sweet and sour flavors. The fish is deep-fried and has a crispy exterior and soft interior. The dish is yellow and red, and it is displayed in the shape of a squirrel when plated. Hot broth is poured over it, which produces a high-pitched sound. It could be referring to a cooking technique where the addition of hot liquid (like broth) to certain ingredients (perhaps something crispy or dry) results in a distinct sound, typically due to the rapid steaming or bubbling.

===Meat and poultry===

* Beggar&#x27;s chicken (; &quot;ciau⁵ ho⁵ ci¹&quot; or &quot;ciau⁵ hua⁵ ci¹&quot;) – Beggar&#x27;s chicken calls for a chicken wrapped in lotus leaves, encased in mud, and roasted in fire, resulting in a slice of delicious and tender meat. According to a legend, a beggar in the Qing dynasty stole and hid a chicken under mud, hence the name of the dish.
* Lion&#x27;s head (; &quot;sy¹ tsy⁵ deu⁶&quot;) – This dish gets its name from the shape of the pork meatball resembling a lion&#x27;s head and the cabbage, or other vegetables, resembling the lion&#x27;s mane. It is served in two varieties: white (or plain) and red. The red version is cooked with soy sauce and is typically served in a white pot.
* Red braised pork belly (; &quot;ghon⁶ sau¹ gnioq⁸&quot;) – Braised pork belly cooked in Shanghainese soy sauce for a long time, resulting in a lump of juicy and tender meat.
* Sweet and sour spareribs (; &quot;daon⁶ tshu⁵ ba⁶ kueq⁷&quot;) – The fresh pork ribs, which appear shiny and red after being cooked, are traditionally deep-fried, then coated in a sweet and sour sauce.

* Dongpo pork () - The pork is typically cut into thick, approximately 5 centimeter (2.0 inch) squares, with an even distribution of fat and lean meat, while retaining the skin.

=== Noodles ===
* Shanghai fried noodles (; &quot;zaon⁶ he⁵ tshau⁵ mi⁶&quot;) – Shanghai fried noodles are fried thick noodles (sometimes udon) with soy sauce. It is most commonly cooked with bok choy and pork.
* Chilled noodles (; &quot;lan⁶ mi⁶&quot;) – This dish is a combination of chilled noodles mixed with various sauces and toppings. Traditionally, the noodles are steamed before being cooked for improved flavor. After the noodles are cooled, they are mixed with sesame oil, soy sauce, and peanut sauce. People often add additional toppings when making it at home, and commonly use leftover food they have in the fridge.
* Noodle soup (; &quot;thaon¹ mi⁶&quot;) – Su-style noodles are a common type of noodle soup. There are two different soup bases, and it is typically garnished with various toppings, mostly meat.

=== Soup ===

* Borscht (; &quot;lu⁶ son⁵ thaon¹&quot;) – This dish is a combination of tomatoes and beef. It is considered a classic Shanghai dish that incorporates local elements of Shanghai cuisine. Originally introduced to Shanghai from Russia, it has now become a common dish in Shanghai homes.

=== Snacks ===
* Shengjian mantou (; &quot;san¹ ci¹ moe⁶ deu⁶&quot;) or Shengjianbao (; &quot;san¹ ci¹ pau¹&quot;) – A Shanghai mantou is a round bun filled with pork, similar to a xiaolongbao but thicker due to the addition of yeast. It is pan-fried and topped with sesame seeds and chopped scallions for flavor.
* Xiaolongbao (; &quot;shiau⁵ lon⁶ pau¹&quot;, known locally as ; &quot;shiau⁵ lon⁶ moe⁶ deu⁶&quot;) – A type of steamed dumpling made with a thin skin of dough and stuffed with pork or minced crab meat, and soup. The delicious soup stays inside the dumpling until it is bitten.
*Guotie (; &quot;ku¹ thiq⁷&quot;) or potstickers – Essentially Jiaozi (Chinese dumplings), but rather than being boiled or steamed, they are first fried in oil on one side, then steamed by adding a small amount of water and covering the pan. When the water evaporates, the dumpling is crispy on one side and soft and chewy on the other. Traditionally, guotie is filled with ground pork and finely chopped Chinese scallions or cabbage.
*Savory mooncakes (; &quot;shi¹ gnioq⁸ yuq⁸ pin⁵&quot;) – Mooncakes consumed in other parts of China are usually sweet, with fillings such as sesame seeds, walnuts, and red bean paste. However, in Shanghai, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, locals consume a savory version of mooncakes filled with meat. This type of mooncake is usually only available at select local restaurants.

=== Desserts ===

* Tangyuan (; &quot;thaon¹ yoe⁶&quot;) – A type of sweet dumpling made of glutinous rice flour and stuffed with black sesame. Qibao has a number of tangyuan vendors.

<doc id="27910" wikidata="Q555997" url="?curid=27910" title="Soul food">
<text>Soul food is the ethnic cuisine of African Americans. Originating in the American South from the cuisines of enslaved Africans transported from Africa through the Atlantic slave trade, soul food is closely associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States. The expression &quot;soul food&quot; originated in the mid-1960s when &quot;&quot; was a common word used to describe African-American culture. Soul food uses cooking techniques and ingredients from West African, Central African, Western European, and Indigenous cuisine of the Americas.

The cuisine was initially denigrated as low quality and belittled because of its origin. It was seen as low-class food, and African Americans in the North looked down on their Black Southern compatriots who preferred soul food (see the Great Migration). The concept evolved from describing the food of slaves in the South, to being taken up as a primary source of pride in the African American community even in the North, such as in New York City, Chicago and Detroit.

Soul food historian Adrian Miller said the difference between soul food and Southern food is that soul food is intensely seasoned and uses a variety of meats to add flavor to food and adds a variety of spicy and savory sauces. These spicy and savory sauces add robust flavor. This method of preparation was influenced by West African cuisine where West Africans create sauces to add flavor and spice to their food. Black Americans also add sugar to make cornbread, while &quot;white southerners say when you put sugar in corn bread, it becomes cake&quot;. European immigrants seasoned and flavored their food using salt, pepper, and spices. African Americans add more spices, and hot and sweet sauces to increase the spiciness, or heat of their food. Bob Jeffries, the author of &quot;Soul Food Cookbook&quot;, said the difference between soul food and Southern food is: &quot;While all soul food is Southern food, not all Southern food is soul. Soul food cooking is an example of how really good Southern [African-American] cooks cooked with what they had available to them.&quot;

Impoverished White and Black people in the South cooked many of the same dishes stemming from Southern cooking traditions, but styles of preparation sometimes varied. Certain techniques popular in soul and other Southern cuisines (i.e., frying meat and using all parts of the animal for consumption) are shared with cultures all over the world.

==Etymology==

The earliest use of the word &quot;soul food&quot; to describe a type of cuisine is found in a 1909 published memoir of a former slave named Thomas L. Johnson. Johnson described a church service where the congregation was served food. He wrote: &quot;There are some, when preaching, only preach three-quarters of the truth, or less, when serving up dishes of soul-food to suit the palates of those they must please.&quot; The term &quot;soul food&quot; became popular during the 1960s and 1970s in the midst of the Black Power movement. One of the earliest written uses of the term is found in &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, which was published in 1965. LeRoi Jones (later known as Amiri Baraka) published an article entitled &quot;Soul Food&quot; and was one of the key proponents for establishing the food as a part of the Black American identity. Those who had participated in the Great Migration found within soul food a reminder of the home and family they had left behind after moving to unfamiliar northern cities. Soul food restaurants were Black-owned businesses that served as neighborhood meeting places where people socialized and ate together. According to author Laretta Henderson, middle-class African Americans embrace their &quot;blackness&quot; by preparing and eating soul food. Henderson wrote:In its culinary incarnation, &quot;soul food&quot; was associated with a shared history of oppression and inculcated, by some, with cultural pride. Soul food was eaten by the bondsmen. It was also the food former slaves incorporated into their diet after emancipation. Therefore, during the 1960s, middle-class blacks used their reported consumption of soul food to distance themselves from the values of the white middle class, to define themselves ethnically, and to align themselves with lower-class blacks. Irrespective of political affiliation or social class, the definition of &quot;blackness&quot;, or &quot;soul&quot;, became part of everyday discourse in the black community. This style of cooking is celebrated in the month of June, called National Soul Food month.

==History==

===Transatlantic slave trade===
During the period of the transatlantic slave trade, enslaved people ate African foods aboard slave ships. These included rice, millet, okra, black-eyed peas, yams, and legumes such as kidney beans and lima beans. These crops were brought to North America and became a staple in Southern cuisine. One enslaved African aboard a slave ship recalled later that all they ate were yams on the voyage from Africa to Charleston, South Carolina. Slave ships were provisioned with African vegetables, fruits, and animals to feed the enslaved people bound in chains below the ships&#x27; decks. These items were later planted and used in the New World for food and as cash crops. The introduction of African plants to the Americas that shaped American cuisine was part of what is called the Columbian exchange. Researchers from Mercer University Libraries said: &quot;The foods selected to bring to America were brought over for specific reasons. &#x27;They all remain palatable long after harvesting and were thus ideal for use on the slow voyage from Africa. Secondly, they are all the edible parts of plants that thrive in the American South, and therefore they flourished once they had been planted hopefully by the slave in the garden space allotted to him on his owner&#x27;s plantation&#x27;&quot;. Another way rice, okra, and millet came to North America was by enslaved African women on slave ships hiding the seeds of rice, okra, and millet in their braided hair as a precaution against an unknown future in the new land where they would be forced to work.

The guineafowl is a bird indigenous to Africa imported to the Americas by way of the slave trade; the bird was brought by the Spanish to the Caribbean, and introduced to the South of what is now the United States in the early 16th century. Guinea fowl became a source of meat for enslaved Black Americans and eventually part of the subsistence culture of the whole region. On American plantations, enslaved people consumed the eggs of the guinea fowl, as well as cooking the meat with rice like their West-Central African forebears. Enslaved Africans in the South continued to prepare their traditional dishes of guinea fowl and plant foods native to West and Central Africa. They adapted European and Native American foods and cooking methods to create new recipes that were passed down orally in Black families and later published in African-American cookbooks by the end of the American Civil War.

===Slavery===
Soul food recipes have pre-slavery influences, as West African and European foodways were adapted to the environment of the region. Soul food originated in the home cooking of the rural Southern United States or the &quot;Deep South&quot; during the time of slavery, using locally gathered or raised foods and other inexpensive ingredients. Rabbits, squirrels, and deer were often hunted for meat. Fish, frogs, crawfish, turtles, shellfish, and crab were often collected from fresh waters, salt waters, and marshes. Soul food cookery began when African American/Black American enslaved people learned to make do with what they were given to eat by their enslavers: leftovers and the undesirable parts of animals such as ham hocks, hog jowls and pigs&#x27; feet, ears, skin, and intestines, which white plantation owners did not eat. Soul food was created by enslaved African Americans, who created meals out of minimal ingredients. Slaves combined their knowledge of West-Central African cooking methods with techniques borrowed from Native Americans and Europeans, thus creating soul food.

Pork and corn were two staple items in the Southern United States for both slave owners and slaves. Many of the foods integral to the cuisine originated in the limited foodstuffs that poor southern subsistence farmers had at hand. This in turn was reflected in the rations given to enslaved people their enslavers. Enslaved people were typically given a peck of cornmeal and 3–4 pounds of pork per week, and those rations formed the basis of African American soul food. Most enslaved people needed to consume a high-calorie diet to replenish the calories spent working long days in the fields or performing other physically arduous tasks. The slave owners would have smoked ham and corn pudding while the enslaved were left with the offal. The leftovers and scraps from meals cooked for the &quot;big houses&quot; (plantation houses) were called &quot;juba&quot; by the enslaved. They were put in troughs on Sundays for the slaves to eat. The term &quot;juba&quot; occurs in numerous African languages, and folk knowledge records that early on it had the meaning of &quot;little bits&quot; of food.

Archaeological and historical research concerning slave cabins in the Southern United States indicates that enslaved African Americans used bowls more often than flatware and plates, suggesting that they primarily made stews and &quot;gumbo&quot; for meals, using local ingredients gathered in nature, vegetables grown in their gardens, and leftover animal scraps rejected by their enslavers. This process allowed enslaved people to create new dishes, for which they developed a variety of ways to season and add spice using hot sauces they prepared. The research shows that white plantation families more often used plates and flatware, indicating that they ate meals consisting of individual cuts of meats and vegetables that were not blended into one dish like the stews made by enslaved people. Enslaved people living on plantations located along the Atlantic coast developed a diversity of foodways enabled by their access to seafood.

During slavery times, Gullah people in the Lowcountry of South Carolina and Georgia practiced a fishing culture that came from West Africa and made canoes similar in appearance to the ones in sub-Saharan Africa. Gullah people passed down their fishing traditions and prepared meals of fish using local ingredients from the region, developing fish dishes that are still a part of Gullah culture. Author Amy Lynne Young&#x27;s research at the Mary Plantation in Louisiana showed the differences in foodways between enslaved people living inland versus those living along the Atlantic coast. Families in coastal areas had access to a variety of meats from land and sea animals, especially those who lived on the coastlines and barrier Sea Islands. Inland slaves&#x27; choices of meats were limited, consisting of game such as rabbit and squirrel, farm chickens, pigs, and leftover animal scraps. Vegetables were locally gathered or grown in their gardens. Young suggests enslaved people living along the coast consequently had a more diverse diet than inland slaves. This demonstrates regional styles of cooking soul food based on local ingredients.

Frederick Douglass said in his autobiography that because enslaved people living on the Eastern shore of Maryland near the Choptank River received the bare minimum in food from their enslavers, they fished for food to supplement their diet, catching turtles, fish, and eels. Douglass wrote: &quot;The men and women slaves received, as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, and one bushel of corn meal&quot;. Another way they supplemented their diet was by growing vegetable gardens; they grew corn, potatoes, peas, beans, herbs, and melons. They did not have fat or cooking oil to cook their food. Slaveholders in Dorchester County, Maryland rarely fed their slaves. To supplement their poor diets, enslaved people in Dorchester fished for food in the Choptank River and hunted game on land. The animals they caught for food included rabbit, turtle, duck, goose, turkey, pigeon, woodpecker, possum, raccoon, skunk, deer, and muskrat. They cooked vegetables such as okra, corn, leafy greens, and sweet potatoes that they grew in their gardens. From these various food sources enslaved people created their meals.

Researchers at St. Mary&#x27;s County Library located in Maryland documented an African American muskrat recipe. &quot;Skin and disjoint the animal. Soak it in salted or vinegar water for two hours. Put the pieces in a pan of water, and parboil until slightly tender, but not real done. Dust in a mixture of seasoned flour, salted and peppered to taste, and fry in hot fat until golden brown.&quot; Black Americans in St. Mary&#x27;s County created recipes during slavery that were passed down orally in their families. To add heat and flavor to seafood dishes, enslaved and free Africans in Baltimore and the Chesapeake region of Maryland grew fish peppers in their gardens. After national emancipation many African Americans got into the seafood industry. By 1864, almost half of all watermen in Maryland were former slaves. They became skilled in netting shrimp, gathering oysters, and fishing. During the American Civil War, some enslaved people in Maryland ate clabber milk, fish, and cornbread. After the war, Maryland became known for its crabbing industry, and Maryland deep-fried crab cakes became a part of soul food cuisine.

Enslaved fishermen in Virginia caught fish to feed their families and the slave community. &quot;The Encyclopedia of Virginia&quot; said if the history of free and enslaved Black fishermen: &quot;Enslaved workers also received fish considered undesirable by whites, such as garfish, whose red flesh Niemcewicz explained &#x27;is little esteemed, serving only as food for negroes&#x27;, and black catfish, which held less appeal for whites than white catfish, which was &#x27;considered excellent&#x27;. Enslaved workers also fished in their time off to supplement their rations.&quot; At George Washington&#x27;s residential plantation in Virginia, Mount Vernon, enslaved cooks there prepared corn meal pancakes, &quot;hoe cakes&quot;, individual cuts of meat, and seasoned cooked vegetables for the Washington family, while the enslaved people primarily ate corn meal and salted fish.

The diet of slaves in Virginia generally included meat from farm animals, vegetables, blackberries, walnuts, and seafood. Historical research at the Burroughs plantation in Franklin County, Virginia by the National Park Service showed that enslaved people there had a diet of cornbread, pork, chicken, sweet potatoes, and boiled corn for breakfast. Along the coast, enslaved people ate oysters and seafood. Booker T. Washington was born enslaved in Franklin County, Virginia in 1856 and wrote an autobiography titled, &quot;The Story of My Life and Work and Up from Slavery&quot;, that described the diet he grew up with as an enslaved child. Washington&#x27;s mother was an enslaved plantation cook who prepared meals for the white families.

Booker T. Washington&#x27;s mother cooked over an open fireplace or in skillets and pots. Washington, his mother, and siblings ate out of pots and skillets while white families ate from plates and flatware using forks and spoons. His mother prepared one-pot meals for her family using local meats, vegetables, nuts, and berries, combining all the ingredients in a pot to make a stew. This way of cooking is still done in West Africa and continued in the Southern United States with enslaved families. Enslaved people at the Burroughs plantation had a variety of vegetables with which to make stews; they were: &quot;Asparagus, beets, beans, black-eyed peas, carrots, cabbage, cucumbers, garden peas, Irish potatoes, kale, lettuce, lima beans, muskmelons, okra, onions, peppers, radishes, tomatoes, turnips, and watermelons would be planted, ripened, and harvested from spring through fall&quot;.

According to Chambers&#x27;s research, Igbo Africans influenced the foodways of Black Americans in Virginia. During the slave trade, about 30,000 Igbo people were imported from Igboland to Virginia. Igbo people in West Africa ate yams, okra, poultry, goats, and fished for their food. Okra, yams, black-eyed peas, and other African foods were brought to Virginia and enslaved Igbo people cooked these foods and prepared stews as one-pot meals. Enslaved people fished for food in the Chesapeake Bay and prepared seafood meals. In Virginia&#x27;s nearby creeks and rivers, slaves caught catfish, crayfish, perch, herring, and turtles for food. White plantation owners in Virginia rarely provided food to feed their slaves. To supplement their diets, enslaved people relied on Igbo methods such as hunting, fishing, and foraging for food and prepared meals that were influenced by Igbo culture. Chambers wrote: &quot;Slave owners stinted the slaves, throwing the people back onto their own resourcefulness for sustenance. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, masters provided slaves with only the barest necessities. Weekly or monthly rations consisted of salt fish and/ or pork, corn or cornmeal, and salt and perhaps molasses. The largest plantation holders usually doled out salted herring as well as smoked pork and corn, which the slaves pounded and mixed with beans and boiled into hominy&quot;.

A few enslaved chefs had some degree of autonomy because of their cooking skills, such as Hercules Posey and James Hemings. Hercules Posey was the enslaved cook for George Washington at Mount Vernon in Virginia. Posey&#x27;s dishes were so popular among elite White families that he had quasi-freedom to leave the house on his own and earn money selling leftovers. According to historians, the dishes Posey made were influenced by West African, European, and Native American foodways. He created dishes of veal, roast beef, and duck, along with puddings and jellies prepared in a way not unlike that of other chefs, but creating his own sauces and flavors. Posey was never given his freedom, and eventually escaped from slavery. James Hemings (brother of Sally Hemings) was born enslaved in colonial Virginia and was the head chef for Thomas Jefferson. Hemings combined African, French, and Native American food traditions. While enslaved, Hemings traveled to Paris, France with Jefferson, where he trained under French chefs and learned how to make macaroni pie (today called macaroni and cheese). Hemings introduced and popularized macaroni and cheese in the United States; it later became a common side item in soul food dishes in Black communities.

Sesame is an African crop that was brought to South Carolina in 1730 during the slave trade. Thomas Jefferson noted how enslaved people prepared stews, baked breads, boiled their greens with sesame seeds, and made sesame pudding. Slaves ate sesame raw, toasted, and boiled. It was used as an ingredient for baked breads in colonial America and is still used in the present day.

Some slaves grew herbs in their gardens to add flavor to their food. Other cooking techniques were boiling and simmering food in an earthenware or iron pot known as colonoware. Salt was used to preserve meats for weeks until consumption. To sweeten their food and beverages, slaves used molasses. They also made blackstrap molasses, a very dark molasses with robust flavor, by cooking the juice of sugarcane low and slow. Other sweet sauces created and used by slaves were sorghum syrup, similar to molasses, made by cooking the juice of the sorghum plant. Sorghum seeds came from West Africa by way of the transatlantic slave trade and were grown by enslaved people on plantations in the New World and used to make sweet sauces.

According to research by scholars at Mercer University, white plantation families initially refused to eat African foods prepared by their slaves, although in many plantation kitchens enslaved African women were the primary cooks. These women passed down cultural knowledge of cooking techniques to the children. Older slave women were preferred as cooks by white plantation families because they were seen as nonthreatening, knowledgeable, and skilled in cooking. Time spent in the kitchen was time that enslaved mothers could spend bonding with their children and teaching them about life, culture, and foodways. In African societies and during slavery, women were the primary cooks. The role of enslaved Black women in the kitchen and as mothers led to racist stereotypes portraying them as Mammys.

Slave narratives revealed continued African methods of cooking, heating, and seasoning food. Enslaved people roasted and heated their foods using ashes from fire pits, a traditional cooking method in Africa. This method was passed down orally in Black families in the Antebellum South, and slave narratives describe how slaves cooked food this way. The word &quot;ash&quot; was appended to the name of some of the food thus prepared, as in &quot;ash cake&quot; and &quot;ash roasted potatoes&quot;. Enslaved people placed food directly on hot ashes or coals to roast or bake their foods. Pots and pans were also placed on top of hot ashes and coals to cook food. Some slaves heated or cooked their foods by putting them on leaves placed on top of the hot ashes. A former slave, Betty Curlett from Arkansas, told of roasting her potatoes on hot ashes: &quot;They cooked a washpot full of peas for a meal or two and roasted potatoes around the pot in the ashes.&quot;

Some slaves did not receive enough food from their enslavers as some slaves starved and consequently were malnourished. House slaves and field slaves had different diets. House slaves ate the leftovers they prepared for white plantation families such as individual cuts from meats like chicken, turkey, or fish, along with pies and seasoned vegetables. Slaves working in the field ate leftover animal scraps, offal, and whatever food they could find in their environment. Some field slaves rarely ate regular hearty meals. Historian John Blassingame&#x27;s book published in 1972, &quot;The Slave Community: Plantation Life in the Antebellum South&quot;, was researched from a collection of slave narratives. According to Blassingame&#x27;s research, some enslaved people received the bare minimum in food and had to supplement their diets by hunting, fishing, and foraging for food. Louisiana slave records showed enslaved people ran away because of inadequate food and overwork. To survive, slaves stole food from their enslavers, killed cattle from nearby farms, and hunted and fished for food.

Research from the National Park Service and professor George Estabrook said that enslaved people supplemented their diets &quot;By boiling black-eyed peas, turnip greens, and pork fat in a single kettle and serving the mixture with grits made from home-ground corn, slaves cooked up meals that satisfied their dietary requirements, as well as their appetites.&quot; The black-eyed peas were a source of protein and the greens provided fiber and vitamins C and A. Boiling greens in a kettle produced a vitamin-packed beverage called pot liquor that was consumed by the enslaved during the Antebellum era to maintain their health. White plantation owners ate the greens prepared by their slaves and left the green liquid (broth) for the slaves to drink not realizing the nutrients was in the broth. Pot liquor (also called potlikker) has Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin K, and iron. The enslaved and their descendants created healing remedies using pot liquors. Slave gardens were important in the slave community, it supplemented slaves nutrient-deprived diet because their slaveholders did not provide enough food to feed them. Slaveholders allowed their slaves to grow food in gardens because it saved their enslavers money, giving them an excuse not to buy food for their slaves. Some slaveholders provided the enslaved seeds to grow their own food. Slaves also made money by selling some of the food they grew to their enslavers.

Chitterlings (also known as chitlins) are cleaned pig intestines; they are cooked in a pot and seasoned. This food has been associated with enslaved Black people in the American South; however, eating animal innards (intestines) is practiced in other cultures such as Asia, Europe, and West Africa. The Hausa people in West Africa eat chicken intestines. Enslaved Africans in the American South continued their traditions of cooking, seasoning, and eating animal innards. Enslaved people added extremely hot peppers for additional flavor and spice to their chitlins. Cooking chitlins was time consuming; field slaves slow cooked their pig intestines while they were working in the field. The parts of the pig that white plantation owners did not eat they gave to the enslaved which they used to season food and prepared one-pot meals, soups, and chitlin dishes. Chitterlings are considered a delicacy in other cultures. Due to the time it takes to clean pig intestines, chitterlings were preserved for special occasions and holidays. Some cooks season chitterlings with onions, celery, garlic, salt, pepper, and butter. Booker T. Washington wrote that enslaved people ate chitlins during the Christmas season. Christmas in Virginia was a time when slaves hired to work on other plantations came home to visit their families at their enslaver&#x27;s plantations. Enslaved families were supplied with food that consisted of chitlins, sausage, and side meats. After the American Civil War, cornbread, pigs&#x27; feet, hogs&#x27; ears, peas, and chitlins were prepared for Booker T. Washington&#x27;s daughter, Portia Washington Pittman, 87th birthday.

===Foodways on the Underground Railroad===
Freedom seekers (runaway slaves) foraged, fished, and hunted for food on their journey to freedom on the Underground Railroad. With these ingredients, they prepared one-pot meals (stews), a West African cooking method. Enslaved and free Black people left food outside their front doors to provide nourishment to the freedom seekers. The meals created on the Underground Railroad became a part of the foodways of Black Americans called soul food. For example, Thomas Downing was born enslaved in 1791 on Chincoteague Island, on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. He learned how to harvest clams, oysters, and terrapin from the Chincoteague Bay, a lagoon of the Atlantic Ocean between Chincoteague and Assateague islands, and prepared meals from this seafood. Downing left Virginia during the War of 1812 and traveled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a city that had Black Americans working in the culinary industry. There, he settled in the free Black community and found work catching oysters. Gaining his freedom in 1819, Downing, his wife, and sons moved to New York City, where the Hudson River provided work for New York&#x27;s African American men working on the water harvesting oysters. By 1825 he had opened an oyster cellar, &quot;Downing&#x27;s Oyster House&quot;, on Broadway Street, in the city&#x27;s business district. There he served raw, fried, and stewed oysters, oyster pie, fish with oyster sauce, and poached turkey stuffed with oysters. In the basement of his restaurant, Downing and his eldest son George hid people who were escaping slavery and seeking freedom. Downing became known as the &quot;Oyster King of New York&quot;.

===Slave recipes===
In the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration paid American writers to gather stories from the last generations of African Americans born into slavery that are called slave narratives. Alongside the narratives are collections of recipes for sauces, desserts, and cooked meat and seafood dishes made by formerly enslaved African Americans. These records have been studied by John Blassingame, Michael Twitty, Jessica B. Harris, and other historians as they reveal the food culture and diets of enslaved people. The narratives show how enslaved people created new dishes that influenced Southern cuisine in the United States. The foods enslaved people prepared in the kitchens for white plantation families influenced the diets and cooking methods of European Americans.

Research from slave narratives showed enslaved people cooked sweet potatoes by roasting or frying them in lard. Sweet potatoes were mashed and sweetened with molasses. A traditional soul food dessert in Black families for Thanksgiving and Christmas is sweet potato pie. Enslaved people also consumed pot liquor, the liquid left behind after boiling greens. George Key, who was born enslaved in Arkansas, said: &quot;We had stew made out of pork and potatoes, and sometimes greens and pot liquor, and we had ash cake mostly, but biscuits about once a month.&quot; Making pot liquor continued after emancipation. Jackie Torrence, an African American storyteller, remembers her grandmother making pot liquor from mustard greens, collard greens, pinto beans, peas, and white potatoes as gravy. Pot liquor was also used as a healing remedy to treat earache and ingrown toenails.

A former slave named Wesley Jones from South Carolina gave a recipe to make a vinegar-based barbecue sauce using black and red peppers and vinegar. Wesley said slaves barbecued meats often, smoking and basting their meats with this homemade barbecue sauce; they would stay up all night slow cooking the meat. Other slave narratives described barbecuing as a preferred method of cooking because it added flavor and spice to food. Slaves barbecued their foods for special occasions and on their days off. Henry Bland,a former slave who lived in Georgia, said slaves had July 4 (Independence Day) off from work, allowing them to barbecue food, play ball games, wrestle, and play music.

A former slave named Callie Elder from Georgia said her grandfather cooked catfish with lard, salt, and pepper, and rolled the catfish in cornmeal before baking. Former slave Clara Davis from Alabama cooked catfish using tomatoes and potatoes or prepared baked catfish with a tomato gravy and sweet potatoes. Slaves in the South fried catfish in lard or other fats and seasoned their food with salt acquired from evaporated sea water. Enslaved people made use of fruits like apples and peaches that had been introduced to North America by European colonists. Some fruits, such as apples, were battered and deep fried in oil, fruit fritters were also fried, and peaches were stewed. Former slaves Mose King from Arkansas and Rose Williams from Texas described eating goat. Mary Minus Biddie was a former slave from Florida and said enslaved people cooked goat in a smokehouse. David Goodman Gullins was a former slave from Georgia and said they prepared barbecued goat. Goat is a traditional meat in West Africa and was commonly cooked and eaten in the American south by slaves.

Enslaved people also barbecued squirrels. One recipe for barbecued squirrels that might have been similar to the way slaves cooked them was given in an 1879 cookbook: &quot;Put them in the oven and let them cook until done. Lay them on a dish and set near the fire. Take out the bacon, sprinkle one spoonful of flour in the gravy and let it brown. Then pour in one teacup of water, one tablespoon of butter and some tomato or walnut catsup. Let it cool, and then pour it over the squirrel.&quot; Barbecuing and preparing barbecue sauce and hot sauce were done to season lower grades of meats. Enslaved people living near rivers and the Atlantic Ocean caught crab and made stews with the crab meat in a pot with okra, sometimes adding a sauce. Cooking seafood with okra is a traditional cooking method from West Africa that slaves continued on Southern plantations. Some of these recipes made by former slaves were published in African-American cookbooks. The earliest such cookbook was self-published in 1866 by Malinda Russell as a pamphlet titled, &quot;A Domestic Cookbook: Containing a Careful Selection of Useful Receipts for the Kitchen&quot;. A cookbook published in 1900 in the city of Charleston, South Carolina had recipes used by formerly enslaved Gullah people. Benne seeds from &quot;sesame&quot;, a plant native to West Africa, were eaten raw with sugar or milk. Enslaved people also made cakes, wafers, and brittles from them for white plantation families whom they called &quot;buckra&quot; (a Gullah word for white people).

Archeologist, historian, and former professional chef, Kelley Fanto Deetz, wrote a book, &quot;Bound to the Fire How Virginia&#x27;s Enslaved Cooks Helped Invent American Cuisine&quot;, that said recipes prepared by enslaved cooks in Virginia contributed to some of the well-known fried and baked meat and vegetable dishes in American southern cuisine. The foods from West-Central Africa brought to the United States by way of the trans-Atlantic slave trade were used by enslaved cooks and combined with North American ingredients using West African, Native American, and European cooking methods to create meals that in the 17th century were necessary for survival that later influenced the foodways of southern Americans generally.

===Barbecue traditions===
Enslaved Africans in the American south contributed their own influence to the American barbecue tradition. The first people to barbecue food in North America were Indigenous people/Native Americans. West and Central Africans had their own method of barbecuing food that they brought to the Americas and the West Indies. The Hausa people in West Africa had a term for barbecue, &quot;babbake&quot;. This term is used &quot;...to describe a complex of words referring to grilling, toasting, building a large fire, singeing hair or feathers and cooking food over a long period of time over an extravagant fire&quot;. The blending of Native American and African styles of barbecuing meat contributed to the creation of the current barbecuing culture in the US. During slavery times, white plantation owners left the labor-intensive work of preparing and barbecuing food to their slaves. Food historian Adrian Miller said the history of Black people and barbecue during slavery: &quot;Blackness and barbecue were wedded in the public imagination because old-school barbecue was so labour intensive. Someone had to clear the area where the barbecue was held, chop and burn the wood for cooking, dig the pit, butcher, process, cook and season the animals, serve the food, entertain the guests and clean up afterward. Given the racial dynamics of the antebellum South, enslaved African Americans were forced to do that work. The media, in turn, took note that a barbecue, as a social event, was a black experience from beginning to end.&quot; On Fourth of July celebrations, the enslaved prepared barbecued food for white politicians and their enslavers.

Enslaved people brought their own influences on the creation of barbecue sauce. Hot and sweet sauces are used in West and Central African cuisine to add flavor, heat, and moisture to food. In 1748, Peter Kalm, a Swedish-Finnish botanist, noted enslaved Africans in Philadelphia cultivated guinea peppers and the pods were pounded and &quot;mixed with salt preserved in a bottle&quot; to make sauces poured over fish and meats. Frederick Douglass Opie, writing in his book &quot;Hog and Hominy&quot;, describes the origins of soul food in Africa: &quot;African women cooked most meats over an open pit and ate them with a sauce similar to what we now call a barbecue sauce, made from lime or lemon juice and hot peppers.&quot; &quot;Slaves made up a large percentage of the Texas population by 1860. During this time they brought with them the idea of cooking over an open fire and dousing meats with a sauce, that sounds an awful lot like the barbecue sauce we know today.&quot; After the American Civil War, a Black pitmaster named Arthur Watts, brought his family&#x27;s barbecue sauce recipe and barbecuing methods to Kewanee, Illinois and became a well-known pitmaster. In African-American communities, barbecuing food became a preferred method of cooking during Emancipation Day celebrations.

===Emancipation===
On January 1, 1863, Gullah people in the Sea Islands of South Carolina celebrated their freedom on New Year&#x27;s Day at Camp Saxton in Beaufort with food and barbecues. Black people in the barrier islands of South Carolina became free early during the American Civil War after the Battle of Port Royal on November 7, 1861, when many of the plantation owners and white residents fled the area after the arrival of the Union Navy and Army. As a result, over 10,000 African Americans became free on that day. However, their freedom was not official in government writing until the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1863. Thousands of newly freed people celebrated their freedom with food, song, and dance. Charlotte Forten, the first black teacher at the Penn School on St. Helena Island in Beaufort, attended the Emancipation Day celebration at Camp Saxton and recorded in her journal they ate roasted oxen and barbecue. Susie King Taylor, a Geechee woman born enslaved in Liberty County, Georgia, wrote in her memoir that she had also attended the Emancipation Day celebration at Camp Saxton: &quot;It was a glorious day for us all, and we enjoyed every minute of it, and as a fitting close and crowning event of this occasion we had a grand barbecue&quot;. Other Emancipation Day celebrations were celebrated with a barbecue feast, a tradition that originated in the slave community.

After the American Civil War, 4 million African Americans were freed from slavery. They celebrated their newly won freedom with barbecues and Emancipation Day celebrations and prepared soul food meals. Two months after the Civil War ended in April 1865, slaveholders in Galveston, Texas refused to tell their slaves the Civil War had ended and they were free. On June 19, 1865, United States Brigadier General Gordon Granger and his troops arrived in Galveston and issued General order No. 3. This order enforced the Emancipation Proclamation which declared enslaved people in Texas were now free. To celebrate their freedom, African Americans in Galveston, and other Black communities in the United States, gathered at public parks and prepared red foods that represent the color of freedom. These celebrations are called Juneteenth, which became a national holiday under the Biden Administration in the year 2021.

According to food historian Michael Twitty, the reason African Americans eat red food on Juneteenth is that it reminds them of the blood of their ancestors that was shed during slavery, and the cultural colors of the Yoruba and Bakongo people, who were enslaved in the Southern United States and brought to North America under the slave trade. Among the Yoruba and Bakongo people, the color red represents power, sacrifice, and transformation. The red foods eaten at Juneteenth are, watermelon, red lemonade, and red velvet cake. In addition to red foods, BBQ, fried foods, and other cooked meals are prepared to celebrate the day of freedom.

After emancipation, many Black Americans in the South became sharecroppers and cooked what was available in their region. This created regional styles of cooking with similar dishes passed down orally in Black families. Due to slave laws, it was illegal in many states for slaves to learn to read or write. Soul food recipes and cooking techniques were passed down orally until after emancipation.

The first soul food cookbook is attributed to Abby Fisher, entitled &quot;What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking&quot; and published in 1881. &quot;Good Things to Eat&quot; was published in 1911; the author, Rufus Estes, was a former slave who worked for the Pullman railway car service. Many other cookbooks were written by Black Americans during that time, but as they were not widely distributed, most are now lost.

===Global spread of African-American cuisine===
The global spread of soul food came during World War I and World War II. Thousands of Black Americans enlisted in the army as soldiers and nurses. Some Black soldiers chose to stay overseas than return to the United States where Jim Crow laws, racism, and lynchings were widespread. African American service men and women opened soul food restaurants in Europe, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and Japan and introduced African-American cuisine to people in foreign countries. In the 1920s through the 1940s, African-American culture was popular in France. French people enjoyed jazz, African-American dance, and cuisine. Food historian Adrian Miller said the global spread of soul food: &quot;The global spread of soul food really took off after the end of World War II. After the war, recently discharged black military veterans in the European theater stayed overseas to open and operate restaurants. At first, they cooked mainly for African Americans who were active-duty military and serving at nearby bases. In some of the countries where the United States had a military presence, like France, Germany, Japan, Vietnam, and Thailand, it was easy for these entrepreneurs to find the cheap ingredients they needed for their recipes, because the locals ate similar foods: chicken, fish, greens, okra, pork, sweet potatoes.&quot;

===Mid-20th century to present day===
The introduction of soul food to cities such as Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Harlem came during the Great Migration as African Americans moved to the North looking for work. Sylvia Woods was born in Hemingway, South Carolina in 1926. When Woods was a teenager she moved to Harlem and worked in a Brooklyn factory. In 1954, Woods changed jobs and started working at Johnson&#x27;s Luncheonette located in central Harlem. Seven years later, Woods and her husband purchased the luncheonette and opened it as a soul food restaurant in 1962, calling it Sylvia&#x27;s Restaurant. Sylvia Woods became known as the &quot;queen of soul food.&quot;

Food historian Adrian Miller studied soul food&#x27;s development in Maryland and in Northern American states. Soul food in Maryland&#x27;s Black communities added local flavors from seafood from the Chesapeake Bay. People in Maryland fried chicken in shallow fat in a frying pan, covering it with a lid, thus frying and steaming the chicken, which was served with waffles. Chicken and waffles became a common soul food item to eat in Black communities in Maryland and in Harlem, New York. During the blues and jazz era, musicians and singers performed and practiced late into the night and stopped at black-owned restaurants for food where cooks prepared fried chicken and waffles for their customers. Nightclubs in Black communities in the United States during the Jim Crow era were called the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit, named after the dish that was usually associated with Black southerners and soul food. The Chitlin&#x27; Circuit was given its name by entertainers because it included black-owned night clubs that served chitlins (chitterlings) and soul food.

During the civil rights movement, soul food restaurants were places where civil rights leaders and activists met to discuss and strategize civil rights protests and ideas for implementing social and political change. Paschal&#x27;s Restaurant in Atlanta, like Georgia Gilmore&#x27;s eatery in Montgomery, had an important part in the civil rights movement. Upon returning to Atlanta from Montgomery, Martin Luther King got permission &quot;to bring his team members and guests to Paschal&#x27;s to eat, meet, rest, plan, and strategize.&quot; The Atlanta History Center said: &quot;Throughout the civil rights movement in Atlanta, soul food restaurants were hubs of change where civil rights leaders could convene, converse, and strategize, and in times of terror and violence, these places were retreats where leaders could plan their next tactical moves, giving many of these spots a legacy beyond good cooking&quot;. Soul food restaurants in Atlanta, Georgia served as the primary meeting places for numerous civil rights leaders and supporters of the movement. Many politicians and civil rights leaders gathered to discuss plans about the movement at Paschal&#x27;s Restaurant on West Hunter Street. In the 1950s and 1960s, civil rights icons such as Andrew Young, John Lewis, Martin Luther King Jr., Julian Bond, Adam Clayton Powell Jr., and Jesse Jackson frequented the restaurant, staying late into the night talking about civil rights strategies and politics. Several soul food restaurants were located on West Hunter Street because Jim Crow laws restricted where African Americans were allowed to operate their businesses.

In 1963, a few days before the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in Washington D.C., where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his &quot;I Have a Dream Speech&quot; on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, King ate at a soul food restaurant called the Florida Avenue Grill. During the years of the civil rights movement, other civil rights leaders and activists met at the restaurant, planning and strategizing for the movement. Before King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, he ate at the Four Way restaurant and had fried catfish and lemon icebox pie. Throughout his civil rights career, King frequented several soul food restaurants where he ate and met with other local and national civil rights leaders. After King&#x27;s assassination, riots broke out in Washington D.C., and the leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Stokely Carmichael, asked the owner of Ben&#x27;s Chili Bowl restaurant to remain open to provide food for police officers, student activists, and firefighters as they worked together to stop the riot. Authors Hoekstra and Khan said in their book, &quot;The People&#x27;s Place: Soul Food Restaurants and Reminiscences from the Civil Rights Era to Today&quot;, that soul food restaurants served as places to bring communities and families together in times of trouble during the Jim Crow era and helped in the fight against segregation laws by allowing white and Black people to eat together.

In Montgomery, Alabama, civil rights protestors convened and organized for the movement at soul food restaurants because they provided a safe haven and a place to eat and relax. Martha&#x27;s Place and Chris&#x27; Hotdogs were visited by protestors. During this period of activism, Jereline and Larry James Bethune, the owners of the restaurant Brenda&#x27;s BBQ, also in Montgomery, taught African Americans how to register to vote and how to read a ballot when Jim Crow laws and literacy tests prevented Black people from voting. Civil rights activists frequented the restaurant for moral and financial support. The owners also helped to print out fliers for the movement and allowed protestors to have secret meetings in the back of the restaurant.

Atlanta&#x27;s oldest black-owned restaurant, the Evelyn Jones Cafe, was founded in 1936 by Evelyn Jones and her sister. In the mid-1940s, Evelyn and her husband, Luther Frazier, enlarged the restaurant and renamed it Frazier&#x27;s Cafe Society. It is located at 880 Martin Luther King Jr. Drive (then known as West Hunter Street). The Jones family challenged Jim Crow laws when they allowed whites and blacks to eat together. It was the first interracial restaurant on West Hunter Street. The cafe also served as a location for civil rights leaders to meet. The foods the restaurant served were Virginia baked ham, pork chop dinner, jumbo shrimp, roast beef, and other classic Southern dishes. Club from Nowhere was a black-owned soul food restaurant that opened in 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, operated by civil rights activist Georgia Gilmore. Gilmore&#x27;s fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, stuffed pork chops, stuffed peppers, and coleslaw were popular among her black and white customers. These were dishes she learned how to make from the women in her family. Gilmore&#x27;s restaurant provided food for civil rights leaders during the Montgomery bus boycott, and her soul food was a favorite among Martin Luther King Jr. Several soul food restaurants served black and white people before the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made segregated facilities illegal.

During the Jim Crow era in the 20th century, it was not safe for Black Americans to travel on the road as they faced possible violence from white supremacists. Black people needed to know what places were safe to stop for food, gas, and motels. In 1936, an African American postal worker from Harlem, New York, named Victor Hugo Green created &quot;The Green Book&quot; for Black people to travel safely in the Southern United States, where Jim Crow laws were widespread. Several soul food restaurants were listed in the book because they were safe havens for African Americans to eat. One restaurant listed in the Green Book was Swett&#x27;s, which opened in 1954.

The Black Church (African-American churches) played a key role in Black communities as they provided food and a place of worship. Researchers from PBS said: &quot;Religion played a key role in the proliferation of soul food, as well as the diversification of the cuisine. Black churches, crucial during slavery and in the Civil Rights movement, were also crucial as gathering places, where Black communities could eat and rejoice over plates of chicken and dumplings, black-eyed peas and rice, red drinks, and the classic Black American church dish, fried catfish and spaghetti&quot;. Chris Carter is an African American pastor and professor of history who published a book about the Black Church and soul food in 2021 titled, &quot;The Spirit of Soul Food: Race, Faith, and Food Justice&quot;. According to Carter, soul food in the African-American community is food that fights injustices centered around the lack of access to food, as some Black Americans live in poverty and Black churches on Sundays and during the week prepare meals to feed their community.

Since the mid-20th century, many cookbooks highlighting soul food and African-American foodways have been compiled and published. One notable soul food chef is celebrated traditional Southern chef and author Edna Lewis, who released a series of books between 1972 and 2003, including &quot;A Taste of Country Cooking&quot; in which she weaves stories of her childhood in Freetown, Virginia into her recipes for &quot;real Southern food&quot;.

Another early and influential soul food cookbook is Vertamae Grosvenor&#x27;s &quot;Vibration Cooking, or the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl&quot;, originally published in 1970, focused on South Carolina Lowcountry/Geechee/Gullah cooking. Its focus on spontaneity in the kitchen—cooking by &quot;vibration&quot; rather than precisely measuring ingredients, as well as &quot;making do&quot; with ingredients on hand—captured the essence of traditional African-American cooking techniques. The simple, healthful, basic ingredients of lowcountry cuisine, like shrimp, oysters, crab, fresh produce, rice, and sweet potatoes, made it a bestseller.

Usher boards and Women&#x27;s Day committees of various religious congregations large and small, and even public service and social welfare organizations such as the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) have produced cookbooks to fund their operations and charitable enterprises. The NCNW produced its first cookbook, &quot;The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro&quot;, in 1958, and revived the practice in 1993, producing a popular series of cookbooks featuring recipes by famous Black Americans, among them: &quot;The Black Family Reunion Cookbook&quot; (1991), &quot;Celebrating Our Mothers&#x27; Kitchens: Treasured Memories and Tested Recipes&quot; (1994), and &quot;Mother Africa&#x27;s Table: A Chronicle of Celebration&quot; (1998). The NCNW also recently reissued &quot;The Historical Cookbook&quot;.

The Special Collections at the University of Alabama has the largest collection of over 450 African-American cookbooks. Kate Matheney, a librarian at the University of Alabama, studied the history of African-American cookbooks and found that several Black cookbooks were authored by white women. As they were the primary cooks in plantation houses, enslaved Africans in Alabama influenced the foodways of whites there. During the Jim Crow era, African American women worked in the homes of white families as domestics and prepared their meals. Some white women authored Black cookbooks using stereotypical images of black women as Mammies on the cover of cookbooks to better market the recipes they learned from black cooks to audiences. African Americans authored their cookbooks using non-stereotypical images and added recipes they learned from their family.

In 2011, culinary historian Jessica B. Harris published a book titled, &quot;High on the Hog&quot; that describes the origins and development of African-American dishes and their roots in Sub-Saharan Africa. Enslaved and free African Americans incorporated indigenous foods from North America such as plants, fruits, and animals but Africanized the foods by preparing and flavoring their dishes similarly to West and Central Africans. Harris&#x27; book later became a docuseries in 2021 on Netflix called &quot;High on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America&quot;.

In 2018 African American author and culinary historian Michael Twitty published &quot;The Cooking Gene: A Journey Through African American Culinary History in the Old South&quot; about the history, development, and evolution of soul food in Black communities in the Southern United States.

Gullah Geechee chef Emily Meggett was born on Edisto Island, South Carolina in 1922. Meggett learned how to farm and cook from her family and published a book about Gullah cuisine in 2022 titled, &quot;Gullah Geechee Home Cooking: Recipes from the Matriarch of Edisto Island&quot;.

In 2024, Lakisha Harris became the first Black woman in the United States to present a presentation on soul food at the American Culinary Federation (ACF) National Convention titled, &quot;Culinary Freedom of the Soul&quot;.

Gullah Geechee chef Benjamin Dennis IV, born in Charleston, South Carolina, teaches about Gullah and African-American cuisine&#x27;s origins in West African cuisine and its influence on American foodways.

Professional chef Mashama Bailey cooks a fusion of foods derived from the African diaspora with Old World and New World cuisine (of the Southern United States) at &quot;The Grey&quot; restaurant in Savannah, Georgia. Bailey learned how to cook soul food from her mother and attended the Institute of Culinary Education; she then traveled to Burgundy, France, where she trained under French chefs. Bailey blends Gullah Geechee cuisine with other cuisines of the African diaspora and continues to educate the public about African-American food culture.

Ashleigh Shanti is an Affrilachian chef who owns the restaurant &quot;Good Hot Fish&quot; in Asheville, North Carolina. She opened a restaurant with a focus on Black Appalachian cuisine and culture. She said &quot;A big part of why I fell in love with the restaurant industry was watching the women in my family and the power they had serving simple, humble food. I thought it was incredible: how their food could transform someone&#x27;s mood, making them happy, making them cry.&quot;

African American chef Carla Hall, author of the cookbook &quot;Carla Hall&#x27;s Soul Food: Everyday and Celebration&quot;, is a television personality and the culinary ambassador to the National Museum of African American History and Culture Sweet Home Cafe in Washington, D.C. Hall has Yoruba ancestors from Nigeria, West Africa, and Bubi ancestors from Equatorial Guinea in Central Africa.

===African-American cuisine in Mexico===

Tiara Darnell, an African American woman born in Mitchellville, Maryland, moved to Mexico and opened a soul food restaurant in Mexico City called &quot;Blaxicocina.&quot; Darnell prepares traditional soul food dishes using Mexican ingredients. The dishes she makes in her restaurant are all family recipes passed down from family members who live in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland and Washington, D.C. The soul food cuisine Darnell makes adds Mexican flavors and ingredients blending African-American cuisine with Mexican cuisine.

==African influence==
Scholars have found substantial African influence in soul food recipes, especially from the West and Central regions of Africa. This influence can be seen in the heat level of many soul food dishes, as well as many ingredients used to prepare them. Peppers used to add spice to food include malagueta pepper, as well as variants native to the Western Hemisphere such as red (cayenne) peppers. Several foods essential to Southern cuisine and soul food were domesticated or consumed in the African savannah and the tropical regions of West and Central Africa. The foods brought from Africa to North America include gherkin, cantaloupe, eggplant, kola nuts, watermelon, pigeon peas, black-eyed peas, okra, sorghum, and guinea pepper.

A species of rice, &quot;Oryza glaberrima&quot; was domesticated in Africa, and many people brought to the Americas preserved rice cooking techniques. Rice was a cash crop in the South Carolina Lowcountry, and during the slave trade, Europeans selected coastal inhabitants of West Africa who had knowledge of rice cultivation. Rice is a staple side dish in the Lowcountry region and in Louisiana. It is a main ingredient in dishes such as jambalaya and red beans and rice, popular in Southern Louisiana. Recipes for rice and beans developed in West Africa were brought to the South Carolina Lowcountry by enslaved Africans and continue to be prepared by their descendants, the Gullah people. A Gullah dish of rice, black-eyed peas, onions, and bacon is Hoppin&#x27; John. Food historian Jessica B. Harris traces this dish to a Senegalese food called &quot;Chiebou niebe&quot;, made with rice and beef. Enslaved Black Americans in the United States thus created new dishes with origins in West Africa but using North American ingredients. A Gullah New Year tradition is eating Hoppin&#x27; John to bring in good luck. Customarily eaten on January 1 throughout the Lowcountry region, it is often paired with cornbread and collard greens, which are also said to bring prosperity.

Charleston red rice is made with rice and tomato paste. This dish originated from jollof rice in West Africa, which is made with a tomato product giving the rice its red color. In the Lowcountry of South Carolina and Georgia, enslaved Gullah Geechee people&#x27;s main source of food was rice paired with meats and shellfish. These rice cooking techniques, influenced by rice dishes made in West Africa, are practiced today in Gullah communities.

There are many documented parallels between the foodways of West Africans and soul food recipes. The consumption of sweet potatoes in the United States echoes the consumption of yams in West Africa. The presence of cornbread on African-American tables is analogous to West African use of fufu to soak up sauces and stews.

Harris starred in the 2021 docuseries &quot;High on the Hog: How African American Cuisine Transformed America&quot; and traveled to Benin, West Africa, where she saw women making a leafy sauce called &quot;feuille&quot;, prepared similarly to how African Americans cook collard greens.

West Africans also cooked meat over open pits and brought their methods of barbecuing and making barbecue sauce to the Americas. The Hausa word for barbecue is &quot;babbake&quot;. Indigenous peoples in North America also barbecued their meats. African Americans use African and Native American techniques of barbecue.

It was not uncommon to see food served out of an empty gourd. Many techniques to change the overall flavor of staple food items such as nuts, seeds, and rice contributed to added dimensions of evolving flavors. These techniques included roasting, frying with palm oil, baking in ashes, and steaming in leaves such as banana leaf.

==Native American influence==
Southeastern Native American culture is an important element of Southern cuisine. From their cultures came one of the main staples of the Southern diet: corn (maize), either ground into meal or limed with an alkaline salt to make hominy, in a Native American process known as nixtamalization. Corn was used to make all kinds of dishes, from the familiar cornbread and grits to liquors such as moonshine and whiskey (which are still important to the Southern economy). Black Americans in Tuskegee, Alabama combined molasses and leftover cooked grease, a combination they called &quot;sap&quot;, to pour over their cornbread and &quot;hoe cakes&quot;. An additional Native American influence in soul food is the use of maple syrup. Indigenous people used maple syrup to sweeten and add flavor to dishes; this influenced the foodways of African Americans as they used maple syrup to sweeten their dishes and poured syrup over pancakes and other breakfast foods.

The foods of Black Seminoles in Florida and Oklahoma are influenced by Gullah rice and bean dishes and Seminole foodways. Black Seminoles cooked rice, &quot;sometimes applying a sauce of okra or spinach leaves&quot;. Historian Ray Von Robertson conducted oral interviews with sixteen Black Seminoles from 2006 and 2007 and found that Seminole cultural influences were incorporated into their daily lives in practices such as foodways and herbal medicine. Black Seminoles cooked and ate fry bread, &quot;sofkee&quot;, and grape dumplings.

Many fruits are available in this region: blackberries, muscadines, raspberries, and many other wild berries were part of Southern Native Americans&#x27; diets as well.African, European, and Native Americans of the American South supplemented their diets with meats derived from the hunting of native game. What meats people ate depended on seasonal availability and geographical region. Common game included opossums, rabbits, and squirrels.

==Sauces and seasoning==
Since the mid-20th century, Black Americans have seasoned cooked meats and vegetables with Lawry&#x27;s Seasoned Salt. Because Lawry&#x27;s is economical and offers multiple herbs and spices in one product, Black Americans use it in most of their dishes except sweet dishes. For extra flavor and spice, hot sauce is sprinkled over fried chicken and fish, collard greens, and other cooked foods. West Africans made variations of hot spicy sauces using hot peppers indigenous to the region. After their enslavement and transportation to the southern United States, they continued to make their own versions of hot sauces using spices and peppers from North America. By the mid-20th century, Black Americans were turning to store-bought hot sauces to add flavor and spice to their food. During slavery times, enslaved people had flavored their vegetables with bacon grease or other parts of the pig. This tradition continues today with Black families using pig feet, bacon grease, or turkey necks to flavor collard and turnip greens.

Culinary historian Michael Twitty, thinks enslaved African Americans likely influenced the creation of Old Bay Seasoning, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not that African Americans necessarily invented it, but without us, the story is impossible.&quot; In his travels to West Africa, Twitty observed how West Africans always add peppers, salt, and a hot condiment to their seafood dishes. Twitty believes enslaved West Africans were probably the first to put &quot;kitchen pepper&quot; on shellfish. In colonial America, kitchen pepper was a common kitchen spice blend that often included nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, allspice, ginger, black pepper, and mace. He notes that &quot;there&#x27;s always a peppery, salty kind of thing that you eat crustaceans with. It&#x27;s always with a hot condiment—it&#x27;s never just plain.&quot; Twitty believes that hundreds of years of cooking shellfish with kitchen pepper developed into the crab spice blends common in the Chesapeake Bay area when Gustav Brunn came to Baltimore.

The founder of the Old Bay Seasoning company, Gustuv Brunn was a German Jewish immigrant who came to the United States in the 1930s with his family to flee Adolf Hitler&#x27;s ascent to power. After Brunn arrived in Baltimore, he created his own seafood seasoning blend influenced by local seasoning recipes and called it &quot;Delicious Brand Shrimp and Crab Seasoning&quot;, but it was not popular with the locals. Brunn changed the name to Old Bay and sold a few pounds of Old Bay to a nearby seafood wholesaler. Word spread and over time it became a popular seasoning. Seafood dishes in soul food cuisine today will have Old Bay as the primary seasoning combined with other herbs and sauces to add robust flavor.

==Cultural relevance==

Soul food originated in the southern region of the US and is consumed by African-Americans across the nation. Traditional soul food cooking is seen as one of the ways enslaved Africans passed their traditions to their descendants once they were brought to the US. It is a cultural creation stemming from slavery and Native American and European influences.

Soul food recipes are popular in the South due to the accessibility and affordability of the ingredients. Scholars have said that while white Americans provided the material supplies for soul food dishes, the cooking techniques found in many of the dishes have been visibly influenced by the enslaved Africans themselves.

The bountiful vegetables found in Africa were substituted in dishes down south with new leafy greens consisting of dandelion, turnip, and beet greens. Pork, more specifically hog, was introduced into several dishes in the form of cracklins from the skin, pigs&#x27; feet, chitterlings, and lard used to increase the fat intake into vegetable dishes. Spices such as thyme, and bay leaf blended with onion and garlic gave dishes their own characteristics.

Red drinks are common at African American social functions. Restaurants with a mostly black clientele typically serve at least one red drink. Red drinks are important in soul food culture because they represent social connections between friends and family, and a link with the African diaspora. Newbell Puckett, a southern sociologist who documented African American folk beliefs in his 1926 study, &quot;Folk Beliefs of the Southern Negro&quot;, said that there was cultural and historical continuity between African American culture and West African societies where red had been an important ritual and royal color for hundreds of years. There were two notable red drinks in West Africa, kola tea and hibiscus tea, by the time the Atlantic slave trade began. Kola tea was made from the nuts of West African trees, especially &quot;Cola nitida&quot;. Tea made from the dried red flowers of the hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa), a plant related to okra, is used to make a tea called &quot;bissap&quot;, from the French &quot;jus de bissap&quot;. It is popular in Senegal and Gambia. &quot;Bissap&quot; was called sorrel tea or red sorrel in the Americas.

Figures such as LeRoi Jones (Amiri Baraka), Elijah Muhammad, and Dick Gregory played notable roles in shaping the conversation around soul food. Muhammad and Gregory opposed soul food because they felt it was unhealthy and was slowly killing African-Americans. They saw soul food as a remnant of oppression and felt it should be left behind. Many African-Americans were offended by the Nation of Islam&#x27;s rejection of pork as it is a staple ingredient used to flavor many dishes.

Stokely Carmichael also spoke out against soul food, claiming that it was not true African food due to its colonial and European influence. Many voices in the Black Power Movement saw soul food as something African-Americans should take pride in and used it to distinguish African-Americans from white Americans. Proponents of soul food embraced the concept and used it as a counterclaim to the argument that African-Americans had no culture or cuisine.

Soul food spread throughout the United States when African-Americans from the South moved to major cities across the country such as Chicago and New York City during the Great Migration. They brought with them the foods and traditions of the Southern United States, where they had been enslaved. Later, the magazine &quot;Ebony Jr!&quot; was important in transmitting the cultural relevance of soul food dishes to middle-class African-American children who typically ate a more standard American diet. Today Soul food is frequently found at religious rituals and social events such as funerals, fellowship, Thanksgiving, and Christmas in the black community.

Soul food is culturally similar to Romani cuisine in Europe.

==Health concerns==
Soul food prepared traditionally and consumed in large amounts can be detrimental to one&#x27;s health. Opponents of eating soul food have been vocal about health concerns surrounding the culinary traditions since the name was coined in the mid-20th century.

Soul food has been criticized for its high starch, fat, sodium, cholesterol, and caloric content, as well as the inexpensive and often low-quality nature of the ingredients such as salted pork and cornmeal. In light of this, soul food has been implicated by some in the disproportionately high rates of high blood pressure (hypertension), type 2 diabetes, clogged arteries (atherosclerosis), stroke, and heart attack suffered by African-Americans. Figures who led discussions surrounding the negative impacts of soul food include Dr. Alvenia Fulton, Dick Gregory, and Elijah Muhammad.

On the other hand, critics and traditionalists have argued that attempts to make soul food healthier also make it less tasty, as well as less culturally/ethnically authentic. There is also often a foundational difference in how health is perceived; perceptions of healthiness by consumers of soul food may differ from normal understandings in American culture.

The nutritional value of most processed foods, and not just those implicated in a traditional perception of soul food, has degraded as the agricultural system in the United States became industrialized, fueled by federal subsidies. This urges a consideration of how concepts of racial authenticity evolve alongside changes in the structures that make some foods more available and accessible than others.

An important aspect of the preparation of soul food was the reuse of cooking lard. Because many cooks could not afford to buy new shortening to replace what they used, they would pour the liquefied cooking grease into a container. After cooling completely, the grease re-solidified and could be used again the next time the cook required lard. With changing fashions and perceptions of healthy eating, some cooks may use preparation methods that differ from those of cooks who came before them: using liquid oil like vegetable oil or canola oil for frying and cooking, and using smoked turkey instead of pork, for example. Changes in hog farming techniques have also resulted in drastically leaner pork, in the late 20th and 21st centuries. Some cooks have even adapted recipes to include vegetarian alternatives to traditional ingredients, including tofu and soy-based analogues. Several Black chefs have opened vegan soul food restaurants to cook healthier foods rooted in African American culture. Others, such as Jenne Claiborne, author of the &quot;Sweet Potato Soul Cookbook&quot;, have started a YouTube channel and show people how to prepare healthier soul food.

Several of the ingredients included in soul food recipes have pronounced health benefits. Collard and other greens are rich sources of several vitamins (including vitamin A, B6, folic acid or vitamin B9, vitamin K, and C), minerals (manganese, iron, and calcium), fiber, and small amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. They also contain a number of phytonutrients, which are thought to play a role in the prevention of ovarian and breast cancers.

The traditional preparation of soul food vegetables often consists of high temperatures or slow cooking methods, which can lead the water-soluble vitamins (e.g., Vitamin C and the B complex vitamins) to be destroyed or leached out into the water in which the greens are cooked. This water is often consumed and is known as pot liquor. Because it contains micronutrients from the greens cooked in it, pot liquor contributes to the nutritional value of a meal when consumed. Peas and legumes are inexpensive sources of protein, and they also contain important vitamins, minerals, and fiber.

<doc id="27914" wikidata="Q130858" url="?curid=27914" title="House of Sforza">
<text>The House of Sforza () was a ruling family of Renaissance Italy, based in Milan. Sforza rule began with the family&#x27;s acquisition of the Duchy of Milan following the extinction of the Visconti family in the mid-15th century and ended with the death of the last member of the family&#x27;s main branch, Francesco II Sforza, in 1535.

==History==

The first son of Muzio Attendolo Sforza, Francesco I Sforza, married Bianca Maria (1425–1468) in 1441. She was the daughter and only heir of the last Duke of Milan, Filippo Maria Visconti. He thus acquired the title of Duke of Milan (1450–1466), ruled Milan for 16 years, and made the Sforzas the heirs of the house of Visconti.

The family also held the seigniory of Pesaro, starting with Muzio Attendolo&#x27;s second son, Alessandro (1409–1473). The Sforza held Pesaro until 1512, after the death of Costanzo II Sforza.

Muzio&#x27;s third son, Bosio (1411–1476), founded the branch of Santa Fiora, who held the title of count of Cotignola; the Sforza ruled the small county of Santa Fiora in southern Tuscany until 1624. Members of this family also held important ecclesiastical and political positions in the Papal States, and moved to Rome in 1674, taking the name of Sforza Cesarini.

The Sforza became allied with the Borgia family through the arranged marriage (1493–1497) between Lucrezia Borgia and Giovanni (the illegitimate son of Costanzo I of Pesaro). This alliance failed, as the Borgia family annulled the marriage once the Sforza family were no longer needed.

In 1499, in the course of the Italian Wars, the army of Louis XII of France took Milan from Ludovico Sforza (known as &quot;Ludovico il Moro&quot;, famous for taking Leonardo da Vinci into his service).

After Imperial German troops drove out the French, Maximilian Sforza, son of Ludovico, became Duke of Milan (1512–1515) until the French returned under Francis I of France and imprisoned him.

In 1521 Charles V drove out the French and restored the younger son of Ludovico, Francesco II Sforza to the duchy. Francesco remained the ruler of Milan until his death in 1535 and as he was childless the Duchy reverted to the Emperor, who passed it to his son Philip II in 1540, thus beginning the period of Spanish rule in Milan.

<text>The Septuagint ( ), sometimes referred to as the Greek Old Testament or The Translation of the Seventy (), and abbreviated as LXX, is the earliest extant Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible from the original Biblical Hebrew. The full Greek title derives from the story recorded in the Letter of Aristeas to Philocrates that &quot;the laws of the Jews&quot; were translated into the Greek language at the request of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–247 BC) by seventy-two Hebrew translators—six from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.
Biblical scholars agree that the first five books of the Hebrew Bible were translated from Biblical Hebrew into Koine Greek by Jews living in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, centred on the large community in Alexandria, probably in the early or middle part of the 3rd century BC. The remaining books were presumably translated in the 2nd century BC. Some targums translating or paraphrasing the Bible into Aramaic were also made during the Second Temple period.
Few people could speak and even fewer could read in the Hebrew language during the Second Temple period; Koine Greek and Aramaic were the lingua francas at that time among the Jewish community. The Septuagint, therefore, satisfied a need in the Jewish community.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Septuagint&quot; is derived from the Latin phrase &quot;The Old Testament from the version of the Seventy Translators&quot;). This phrase in turn was derived from the . It was not until the time of Augustine of Hippo (354–430 CE) that the Greek translation of the Jewish scriptures was called by the Latin term . The Roman numeral LXX (seventy) is commonly used as an abbreviation, in addition to formula_1 or &quot;G&quot;.

== Composition ==

=== Jewish legend ===

According to tradition, Ptolemy II Philadelphus (the Greek Pharaoh of Egypt) sent seventy-two Hebrew translators—six from each of the Twelve Tribes of Israel—from Jerusalem to Alexandria to translate the &quot;Tanakh&quot; from Biblical Hebrew into Koine Greek, for inclusion in his library. This narrative is found in the possibly pseudepigraphic Letter of Aristeas to his brother Philocrates, and is repeated by Philo of Alexandria, Josephus (in &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;), and by later sources (including Augustine of Hippo). It is also found in the Tractate Megillah of the Babylonian Talmud:

Philo of Alexandria writes that the number of scholars was chosen by selecting six scholars from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Caution is needed here regarding the accuracy of this statement by Philo of Alexandria, as it implies that the twelve tribes were still in existence during King Ptolemy&#x27;s reign, and that the Ten Lost Tribes of the twelve tribes had not been forcibly resettled by Assyria almost 500 years previously. Although not all the people of the ten tribes were scattered, many peoples of the ten tribes sought refuge in Jerusalem and survived, preserving a remnant of each tribe and their lineages. Jerusalem swelled to five times its prior population due to the influx of refugees. According to later rabbinic tradition (which considered the Greek translation as a distortion of sacred text and unsuitable for use in the synagogue), the Septuagint was given to Ptolemy two days before the annual Tenth of Tevet fast.

According to Aristobulus of Alexandria&#x27;s fragment 3, portions of the Law were translated from Hebrew into Greek long before the well-known Septuagint version. He stated that Plato and Pythagoras knew the Jewish Law and borrowed from it.

In the preface to his 1844 translation of the Septuagint, Lancelot Charles Lee Brenton acknowledges that the Jews of Alexandria were likely to have been the writers of the Septuagint, but dismisses Aristeas&#x27; account as a pious fiction. Instead, he asserts that the real origin of the name &quot;Septuagint&quot; pertains to the fact that the earliest version was forwarded by the authors to the Jewish Sanhedrin at Alexandria for editing and approval.

The Jews of Alexandria celebrated the translation with an annual festival on the island of Pharos, where the Lighthouse of Alexandria stood—the location where the translation was said to have taken place. During the festival, a large gathering of Jews, along with some non-Jewish visitors, would assemble on the beach for a grand picnic.

=== History ===
The 3rd century BC is supported for the translation of the Pentateuch by a number of factors, including its Greek being representative of early Koine Greek, citations beginning as early as the 2nd century BC, and early manuscripts datable to the 2nd century BC. After the Torah, other books were translated over the next two to three centuries. It is unclear which was translated when, or where; some may have been translated twice (into different versions), and then revised. The quality and style of the translators varied considerably from book to book, from a literal translation to paraphrasing to an interpretative style.

The translation process of the Septuagint and from the Septuagint into other versions can be divided into several stages: the Greek text was produced within the social environment of Hellenistic Judaism, and completed by 132 BC. With the spread of Early Christianity, this Septuagint in turn was rendered into Latin in a variety of versions and the latter, collectively known as the &quot;&quot;, were also referred to as the Septuagint initially in Alexandria but elsewhere as well. The Septuagint also formed the basis for the Slavonic, Syriac, Old Armenian, Old Georgian, and Coptic versions of the Christian Old Testament.

=== Language ===
The Septuagint is written in Koine Greek. Some sections contain Semiticisms, which are idioms and phrases based on Semitic languages such as Hebrew and Aramaic. Other books, such as Daniel and Proverbs, have a stronger Greek influence.

The Septuagint may also clarify pronunciation of pre-Masoretic Hebrew; many proper nouns are spelled with Greek vowels in the translation, but contemporary Hebrew texts lacked vowel pointing. However, it is unlikely that all Biblical Hebrew sounds had precise Greek equivalents.

=== Canonical differences ===
The Septuagint does not consist of a single, unified corpus. Rather, it is a collection of ancient translations of the &quot;Tanakh&quot;, along with other Jewish texts that are now commonly referred to as apocrypha. Importantly, the canon of the Hebrew Bible was evolving over the century or so in which the Septuagint was being written. Also, the texts were translated by many different people, in different locations, at different times, for different purposes, and often from different original Hebrew manuscripts.

The Hebrew Bible, also called the &quot;Tanakh&quot;, has three parts: the &quot;Torah&quot; (&quot;Law&quot;), the &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; (&quot;Prophets&quot;), and the &quot;Ketuvim&quot; (&quot;Writings&quot;). The Septuagint has four: law, history, poetry, and prophets. The books of the Apocrypha were inserted at appropriate locations. Extant copies of the Septuagint, which date from the 4th century AD, contain books and additions not present in the Hebrew Bible as established in the Jewish canon and are not uniform in their contents. According to some scholars, there is no evidence that the Septuagint included these additional books. These copies of the Septuagint include books known as &quot;anagignoskomena&quot; in Greek and in English as deuterocanon (derived from the Greek words for &quot;second canon&quot;), books not included in the modern Jewish canon. These books are estimated to have been written between 200 BC and 50 AD. Among them are the first two books of Maccabees; Tobit; Judith; the Wisdom of Solomon; Sirach; Baruch (including the Letter of Jeremiah), and additions to Esther and Daniel. The Septuagint version of some books, such as Daniel and Esther, are longer than those in the Masoretic Text, which were affirmed as canonical in Rabbinic Judaism. The Septuagint Book of Jeremiah is shorter than the Masoretic Text. The Psalms of Solomon, 1 Esdras, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, the Letter of Jeremiah, the Book of Odes, the Prayer of Manasseh and Psalm 151 are included in some copies of the Septuagint.

The Septuagint has been rejected as scriptural by mainstream Rabbinic Judaism for a couple of reasons. First, the Septuagint differs from the Hebrew source texts in many cases (particularly in the Book of Job). For example, according to Heinrich Guggenheimer, intentional mistranslations in Deuteronomy 6 make reference to ancient sources of the Passover Haggadah. Second, the translations appear at times to demonstrate an ignorance of Hebrew idiomatic usage. A particularly noteworthy example of this phenomenon is found in Isaiah 7:14, in which the Hebrew word (, which translates into English as &quot;young woman&quot;) is translated into the Koine Greek as (, which translates into English as &quot;virgin&quot;).

The Septuagint became synonymous with the Greek Old Testament, a Christian canon incorporating the books of the Hebrew canon with additional texts. Although the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church include most of the books in the Septuagint in their canons, Protestant churches usually do not. After the Reformation, many Protestant Bibles began to follow the Jewish canon and exclude the additional texts (which came to be called the Apocrypha) as noncanonical. The Apocrypha are included under a separate heading in the King James Version of the Bible.

=== Final form ===
All the books in Western Old Testament biblical canons are found in the Septuagint, although the order does not always coincide with the Western book order. The Septuagint order is evident in the earliest Christian Bibles, which were written during the 4th century.

Some books which are set apart in the Masoretic Text are grouped together. The Books of Samuel and the Books of Kings are one four-part book entitled (Basileon, &#x27;Of Reigns&#x27;) in the Septuagint. The Books of Chronicles, known collectively as Παραλειπομένων (Paraleipoménon, &#x27;Of Things Left Out&#x27;) supplement Reigns. The Septuagint organizes the minor prophets in its twelve-part Book of Twelve, as does the Masoretic Text.

Some ancient scriptures are found in the Septuagint, but not in the Hebrew Bible. The books are Tobit; Judith; the Wisdom of Solomon; Wisdom of Jesus son of Sirach; Baruch and the Letter of Jeremiah, which became chapter six of Baruch in the Vulgate; the additions to Daniel (The Prayer of Azarias, the Song of the Three Children, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon); the additions to Esther; 1 Maccabees; 2 Maccabees; 3 Maccabees; 4 Maccabees; 1 Esdras; Odes (including the Prayer of Manasseh); the Psalms of Solomon, and Psalm 151.

Fragments of deuterocanonical books in Hebrew are among the Dead Sea Scrolls found at Qumran. Sirach, whose text in Hebrew was already known from the Cairo Geniza, has been found in two scrolls (2QSir or 2Q18, 11QPs_a or 11Q5) in Hebrew. Another Hebrew scroll of Sirach has been found in Masada (MasSir). Five fragments from the Book of Tobit have been found in Qumran: four written in Aramaic and one written in Hebrew (papyri 4Q, nos. 196-200). Psalm 151 appears with a number of canonical and non-canonical psalms in the Dead Sea scroll 11QPs(a) (also known as 11Q5), a 1st-century AD scroll discovered in 1956. The scroll contains two short Hebrew psalms, which scholars agree were the basis for Psalm 151. The canonical acceptance of these books varies by Christian tradition.

== Use ==

=== Jewish use ===

It is unclear to what extent Alexandrian Jews accepted the authority of the Septuagint. Manuscripts of the Septuagint have been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, and were thought to have been in use among various Jewish sects at the time.

Several factors led most Jews to abandon the Septuagint around the 2nd century AD. The earliest gentile Christians used the Septuagint out of necessity, since it was the only Greek version of the Bible and most (if not all) of these early non-Jewish Christians could not read Hebrew. The association of the Septuagint with a rival religion may have made it suspect in the eyes of the newer generation of Jews and Jewish scholars. Jews instead used Hebrew or Aramaic Targum manuscripts later compiled by the Masoretes and authoritative Aramaic translations, such as those of Onkelos and Rabbi Yonathan ben Uziel.

Perhaps most significant for the Septuagint, as distinct from other Greek versions, was that the Septuagint began to lose Jewish sanction after differences between it and contemporary Hebrew scriptures were discovered. Even Greek-speaking Jews tended to prefer other Jewish versions in Greek (such as the translation by Aquila), which seemed to be more concordant with contemporary Hebrew texts.

=== Christian use ===

The Early Christian church used the Greek texts, since Greek was a &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the eastern parts of the Roman Empire at the time and the language of the Greco-Roman Church, while Aramaic was the language of Syriac Christianity. The relationship between the apostolic use of the Septuagint and the Hebrew texts is complicated. Although the Septuagint seems to have been a major source for the Apostles, it is not the only one. St. Jerome offered, for example, Matthew 2:15 and 2:23, John 19:37, John 7:38, and 1 Corinthians 2:9 as examples found in Hebrew texts but not in the Septuagint. Matthew 2:23 is not present in current Masoretic tradition either; according to Jerome, however, it was in Isaiah 11:1. The New Testament writers freely used the Greek translation when citing the Jewish scriptures (or quoting Jesus doing so), implying that Jesus, his apostles, and their followers considered it reliable.

In the early Christian Church, the presumption that the Septuagint was translated by Jews before the time of Christ and that it lends itself more to a Christological interpretation than 2nd-century Hebrew texts in certain places was taken as evidence that &quot;Jews&quot; had changed the Hebrew text in a way that made it less Christological. Irenaeus writes about Isaiah 7:14 that the Septuagint clearly identifies a &quot;virgin&quot; (Greek &quot;παρθένος&quot;; &quot;bethulah&quot; in Hebrew) who would conceive. The word &quot;almah&quot; in the Hebrew text was, according to Irenaeus, interpreted by Theodotion and Aquila (Jewish converts), as a &quot;young woman&quot; who would conceive. Again according to Irenaeus, the Ebionites used this to claim that Joseph was the biological father of Jesus. To him that was heresy facilitated by late anti-Christian alterations of the scripture in Hebrew, as evident by the older, pre-Christian Septuagint.

Jerome broke with church tradition, translating most of the Old Testament of his Vulgate from Hebrew rather than Greek. His choice was sharply criticized by Augustine, his contemporary. Although Jerome argued for the superiority of the Hebrew texts in correcting the Septuagint on philological and theological grounds, because he was accused of heresy he also acknowledged the Septuagint texts. Acceptance of Jerome&#x27;s version increased, and it displaced the Septuagint&#x27;s Old Latin translations.

The Eastern Orthodox Church prefers to use the Septuagint as the basis for translating the Old Testament into other languages, and uses the untranslated Septuagint where Greek is the liturgical language.

Critical translations of the Old Testament which use the Masoretic Text as their basis consult the Septuagint and other versions to reconstruct the meaning of the Hebrew text when it is unclear, corrupted, or ambiguous. According to the New Jerusalem Bible foreword, &quot;Only when this (the Masoretic Text) presents insuperable difficulties have emendations or other versions, such as the [...] LXX, been used.&quot; The translator&#x27;s preface to the New International Version reads, &quot;The translators also consulted the more important early versions (including) the Septuagint [...] Readings from these versions were occasionally followed where the MT seemed doubtful&quot;

== Textual history ==

=== Textual analysis ===
Modern scholarship holds that the Septuagint was written from the 3rd through the 1st centuries BC, but nearly all attempts at dating specific books (except for the Pentateuch, early- to mid-3rd century BC) are tentative. Later Jewish revisions and recensions of the Greek against the Hebrew are well-attested. The best-known are Aquila (128 AD), Symmachus, and Theodotion. These three, to varying degrees, are more-literal renderings of their contemporary Hebrew scriptures compared to the Old Greek (the original Septuagint). Modern scholars consider one (or more) of the three to be new Greek versions of the Hebrew Bible.

Although much of Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot; (a six-version critical edition of the Hebrew Bible) is lost, several compilations of fragments are available. Origen kept a column for the Old Greek (the Septuagint), which included readings from all the Greek versions in a critical apparatus with diacritical marks indicating to which version each line (Gr. στίχος) belonged. Perhaps the &quot;Hexapla&quot; was never copied in its entirety, but Origen&#x27;s combined text was copied frequently (eventually without the editing marks) and the older uncombined text of the Septuagint was neglected. The combined text was the first major Christian recension of the Septuagint, often called the &quot;Hexaplar recension&quot;. Two other major recensions were identified in the century following Origen by Jerome, who attributed these to Lucian (the Lucianic, or Antiochene, recension) and Hesychius (the Hesychian, or Alexandrian, recension).

==== Manuscripts ====

The oldest manuscripts of the Septuagint include 2nd-century BC fragments of Leviticus and Deuteronomy (Rahlfs nos. 801, 819, and 957) and 1st-century BC fragments of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and the Twelve Minor Prophets (Alfred Rahlfs nos. 802, 803, 805, 848, 942, and 943). Relatively-complete manuscripts of the Septuagint postdate the Hexaplar recension, and include the 4th-century AD Codex Vaticanus and the 5th-century Codex Alexandrinus. These are the oldest-surviving nearly-complete manuscripts of the Old Testament in any language; the oldest extant complete Hebrew texts date to about 600 years later, from the first half of the 10th century. The 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus also partially survives, with many Old Testament texts. The Jewish (and, later, Christian) revisions and recensions are largely responsible for the divergence of the codices. The Codex Marchalianus is another notable manuscript.

==== Differences from the Vulgate and the Masoretic Text ====
The text of the Septuagint is generally close to that of the Masoretes and Vulgate. Genesis 4:1–6 is identical in the Septuagint, Vulgate and the Masoretic Text, and Genesis 4:8 to the end of the chapter is the same. There is only one noticeable difference in that chapter, at 4:7:

The differences between the Septuagint and the MT fall into four categories:
# &quot;Different Hebrew sources for the MT and the Septuagint&quot;. Evidence of this can be found throughout the Old Testament. A subtle example may be found in Isaiah 36:11; the meaning remains the same, but the choice of words evidences a different text. The MT reads &quot;...al tedaber yehudit be-&#x27;ozne ha`am al ha-homa&quot; [speak not the Judean language in the ears of (or—which can be heard by) the people on the wall]. The same verse in the Septuagint reads, according to the translation of Brenton: &quot;and speak not to us in the Jewish tongue: and wherefore speakest thou in the ears of the men on the wall.&quot; The MT reads &quot;people&quot; where the Septuagint reads &quot;men&quot;. This difference is very minor and does not affect the meaning of the verse. Scholars had used discrepancies such as this to claim that the Septuagint was a poor translation of the Hebrew original. This verse is found in Qumran (1QIsa&quot;a&quot;), however, where the Hebrew word &quot;haanashim&quot; (the men) is found in place of &quot;haam&quot; (the people). This discovery, and others like it, showed that even seemingly-minor differences of translation could be the result of variant Hebrew source texts.
# &quot;Differences in interpretation&quot; stemming from the same Hebrew text. An example is Genesis 4:7, shown above.
# &quot;Differences as a result of idiomatic translation issues&quot;: A Hebrew idiom may not be easily translated into Greek, and some difference is imparted. In Psalm 47:10, the MT reads: &quot;The shields of the earth belong to God&quot;; the Septuagint reads, &quot;To God are the mighty ones of the earth.&quot;
# &quot;Transmission changes in Hebrew or Greek&quot;: Revision or recension changes and copying errors

==== Dead Sea Scrolls ====
The Biblical manuscripts found in Qumran, commonly known as the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), have prompted comparisons of the texts associated with the Hebrew Bible (including the Septuagint). Emanuel Tov, editor of the translated scrolls, identifies five broad variants of DSS texts:
# Proto-Masoretic: A stable text and numerous, distinct agreements with the Masoretic Text. About 60 per cent of the Biblical scrolls (including 1QIsa-b) are in this category.
# Pre-Septuagint: Manuscripts which have distinctive affinities with the Greek Bible. About five per cent of the Biblical scrolls, they include 4QDeut-q, 4QSam-a, 4QJer-b, and 4QJer-d. In addition to these manuscripts, several others share similarities with the Septuagint but do not fall into this category.
# The Qumran &quot;Living Bible&quot;: Manuscripts which, according to Tov, were copied in accordance with the &quot;Qumran practice&quot;: distinctive, long orthography and morphology, frequent errors and corrections, and a free approach to the text. They make up about 20 per cent of the Biblical corpus, including the Isaiah Scroll (1QIsa-a).
# Pre-Samaritan: DSS manuscripts which reflect the textual form of the Samaritan Pentateuch, although the Samaritan Bible is later and contains information not found in these earlier scrolls, (such as God&#x27;s holy mountain at Shechem, rather than Jerusalem). These manuscripts, characterized by orthographic corrections and harmonizations with parallel texts elsewhere in the Pentateuch, are about five per cent of the Biblical scrolls and include 4QpaleoExod-m.
# Non-aligned: No consistent alignment with any of the other four text types. About 10 per cent of the Biblical scrolls, they include 4QDeut-b, 4QDeut-c, 4QDeut-h, 4QIsa-c, and 4QDan-a.

The textual sources present a variety of readings; Bastiaan Van Elderen compares three variations of Deuteronomy 32:43, the Song of Moses:

=== Print editions ===
The text of all print editions is derived from the recensions of Origen, Lucian, or Hesychius:
* The &quot;editio princeps&quot; is the Complutensian Polyglot Bible. Based on now-lost manuscripts, it is one of the received texts used for the KJV (similar to &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;) and seems to convey quite early readings.
* The by Brian Walton is one of the few versions that includes a Septuagint not based on the Egyptian Alexandria-type text (such as Vaticanus, Alexandrinus and Sinaiticus), but follows the majority which agree (like the Complutensian Polyglot).
* The Aldine edition (begun by Aldus Manutius) was published in Venice in 1518. The editor says that he collated ancient, unspecified manuscripts, and it has been reprinted several times.
* The Roman or Sixtine Septuagint, which uses &quot;Codex Vaticanus&quot; as the base text and later manuscripts for the lacunae in the uncial manuscript. It was published in 1587 under the direction of Antonio Carafa, with the help of Roman scholars Gugliemo Sirleto, Antonio Agelli and Petrus Morinus and by the authority of Sixtus V, to assist revisers preparing the Latin Vulgate edition ordered by the Council of Trent. It is the &quot;textus receptus&quot; of the Greek Old Testament and has been published in a number of editions, such as: those of Robert Holmes and James Parsons (Oxford, 1798–1827), the seven editions of Constantin von Tischendorf which appeared at Leipzig between 1850 and 1887 (the last two published after the death of the author and revised by Nestle), and the four editions of Henry Barclay Swete (Cambridge, 1887–95, 1901, 1909). A detailed description of this edition has been made by H. B. Swete in &quot;An Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek&quot; (1900), pp. 174–182.
* Grabe&#x27;s edition was published in Oxford from 1707 to 1720 and reproduced, imperfectly, the Codex Alexandrinus of London. For partial editions, see Fulcran Vigouroux, &quot;Dictionnaire de la Bible&quot;, 1643 and later.
* Alfred Rahlfs&#x27; edition of the Septuagint. Alfred Rahlfs, a Septuagint researcher at the University of Göttingen, began a manual edition of the Septuagint in 1917 or 1918. The completed &quot;Septuaginta&quot;, published in 1935, relies mainly on the &quot;Vaticanus&quot;, &quot;Sinaiticus&quot; and &quot;Alexandrinus&quot; and presents a critical framework with variants from these and several other sources.
* The Göttingen Septuagint &quot;(Septuaginta: Vetus Testamentum Graecum)&quot;, a critical version in multiple volumes published from 1931 to the present, is not yet complete; the largest missing parts are the historical books (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles), Proverbs and Song of Songs, as well as a new edition of Psalms. Its two critical apparatuses present variant readings in the Old Greek text and variants of the other Greek recensions (i.e., the Hexapla, Theodotion, Symmachus, Aquilla, Lucian).
* In 2006, a revision of Alfred Rahlfs&#x27; &quot;Septuaginta&quot; was published by the German Bible Society. This revised edition includes over a thousand changes. The text of this revised edition contains changes in the diacritics, and only two wording changes: in Isaiah 5:17 and 53:2, Is 5:17 &quot;ἀπειλημμένων&quot; became &quot;ἀπηλειμμένων&quot;, and Is 53:2 &quot;ἀνηγγείλαμεν&quot; became by conjecture &quot;ἀνέτειλε μένà&quot;.
* The &quot;Apostolic Bible Polyglot&quot; contains a Septuagint text derived primarily from the agreement of any two of the Complutensian Polyglot, the Sixtine, and the Aldine texts.
* &quot;Septuaginta: A Reader&#x27;s Edition&quot;, a 2018 reader&#x27;s edition of the Septuagint using the text of the 2006 revised edition of Rahlf&#x27;s Septuaginta.

=== Onomastics ===
One of the main challenges, faced by translators during their work, emanated from the need to implement appropriate Greek forms for various onomastic terms, used in the Hebrew Bible. Most onomastic terms (toponyms, anthroponyms) of the Hebrew Bible were rendered by corresponding Greek terms that were similar in form and sounding, with some notable exceptions.

One of those exceptions was related to a specific group of onomastic terms for the region of Aram and ancient Arameans. Influenced by Greek onomastic terminology, translators decided to adopt Greek custom of using &quot;Syrian&quot; labels as designations for Arameans, their lands and language, thus abandoning endonymic (native) terms, that were used in the Hebrew Bible. In the Greek translation, the region of Aram was commonly labeled as &quot;Syria&quot;, while Arameans were labeled as &quot;Syrians&quot;. Such adoption and implementation of terms that were foreign (exonymic) had far-reaching influence on later terminology related to Arameans and their lands, since the same terminology was reflected in later Latin and other translations of the Septuagint, including the English translation.

Reflecting on those problems, American orientalist Robert W. Rogers (d. 1930) noted in 1921: &quot;it is most unfortunate that Syria and Syrians ever came into the English versions. It should always be Aram and the Aramaeans&quot;.

=== English translations ===
The first English translation (which excluded the apocrypha) was Charles Thomson&#x27;s in 1808, which was revised and enlarged by C. A. Muses in 1954 and published by the Falcon&#x27;s Wing Press.

&quot;The Septuagint with Apocrypha: Greek and English&quot; was translated by Lancelot Brenton in 1854. It is the traditional translation, and most of the time since its publication it has been the only one readily available. It has also been continually in print. The translation, based on the Codex Vaticanus, contains the Greek and English texts in parallel columns. It has an average of four footnoted, transliterated words per page, abbreviated &quot;Alex&quot; and &quot;GK&quot;.

&quot;The Complete Apostles&#x27; Bible&quot; (translated by Paul W. Esposito) was published in 2007. Using the Masoretic Text in the 23rd Psalm (and possibly elsewhere), it omits the apocrypha.

A New English Translation of the Septuagint and the Other Greek Translations Traditionally Included Under that Title (NETS), an academic translation based on the New Revised Standard version (in turn based on the Masoretic Text) was published by the International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies (IOSCS) in October 2007.

The &quot;Apostolic Bible Polyglot,&quot; published in 2003, features a Greek-English interlinear Septuagint. It includes the Greek books of the Hebrew canon (without the apocrypha) and the Greek New Testament; the whole Bible is numerically coded to a new version of the Strong numbering system created to add words not present in the original numbering by Strong. The edition is set in monotonic orthography. The version includes a Bible concordance and index.

The &quot;Orthodox Study Bible&quot;, published in early 2008, features a new translation of the Septuagint based on the Alfred Rahlfs&#x27; edition of the Greek text. Two additional major sources have been added: the 1851 Brenton translation and the New King James Version text in places where the translation matches the Hebrew Masoretic text. This edition includes the NKJV New Testament and extensive commentary from an Eastern Orthodox perspective.

Nicholas King completed &quot;The Old Testament&quot; in four volumes and &quot;The Bible&quot;.

&quot;Brenton&#x27;s Septuagint, Restored Names Version&quot; (SRNV) has been published in two volumes. The Hebrew-names restoration, based on the Westminster Leningrad Codex, focuses on the restoration of the Divine Name and has extensive Hebrew and Greek footnotes.

&quot;The Holy Orthodox Bible&quot; by Peter A. Papoutsis and &quot;The Old Testament According to the Seventy&quot; by Michael Asser are based on the Greek Septuagint text published by the Apostoliki Diakonia of the Church of Greece.

In 2012, Lexham Press published the &quot;Lexham English Septuagint&quot; (LES), providing a literal, readable, and transparent English edition of the Septuagint for modern readers. In 2019, Lexham Press published the &quot;Lexham English Septuagint,&quot; Second Edition (LES2), making more of an effort than the first to focus on the text as received rather than as produced. Because this approach shifts the point of reference from a diverse group to a single implied reader, the new LES exhibits more consistency than the first edition. &quot;The Lexham English Septuagint (LES), then, is the only contemporary English translation of the LXX that has been made directly from the Greek.&quot;

== Society and journal ==

The International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies (IOSCS), a non-profit learned society, promotes international research into and study of the Septuagint and related texts. The society declared 8 February 2006 International Septuagint Day, a day to promote the work on campuses and in communities. The IOSCS publishes the &quot;Journal of Septuagint and Cognate Studies&quot;.

<text>The Codex Sinaiticus (; Shelfmark: London, British Library, Add MS 43725), also called the Sinai Bible, is a fourth-century Christian manuscript of a Greek Bible, containing the majority of the Greek Old Testament, including the deuterocanonical books, and the Greek New Testament, with both the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of Hermas included. It is designated by the siglum [Aleph] or 01 in the Gregory-Aland numbering of New Testament manuscripts, and δ 2 in the von Soden numbering of New Testament manuscripts. It is written in uncial letters on parchment. It is one of the four great uncial codices (these being manuscripts which originally contained the whole of both the Old and New Testaments). Along with Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Vaticanus, it is one of the earliest and most complete manuscripts of the Bible, and contains the oldest complete copy of the New Testament. It is a historical treasure, and using the study of comparative writing styles (palaeography), it has been dated to the mid-fourth century.

Biblical scholarship considers Codex Sinaiticus to be one of the most important Greek texts of the New Testament, along with Codex Vaticanus. Until German Biblical scholar (and manuscript hunter) Constantin von Tischendorf&#x27;s discovery of Codex Sinaiticus in 1844, the Greek text of Codex Vaticanus was unrivalled. Since its discovery, study of Codex Sinaiticus has proven to be useful to scholars for critical studies of the biblical text.

Codex Sinaiticus came to the attention of scholars in the 19th century at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, with further material discovered in the 20th and 21st centuries. Although parts of the codex are scattered across four libraries around the world, most of the manuscript is held today in the British Library in London, where it is on public display.

== Description ==

The manuscript is a codex (the forerunner to the modern book) made from vellum parchment, originally in double sheets, which may have measured about 40 by 70 cm. The whole codex consists of quires of eight leaves (with a few exceptions), a format which came to be popular throughout the Middle Ages (this being eight parchment pages laid on top of each other, and folded in half to make a full block (also known as a folio); several of these were then stitched together to create a book). The folios were made primarily from calf skins, secondarily from sheep skins. Tischendorf thought the parchment had been made from antelope skins, but modern microscopic examination has shown otherwise. Most of the quires (or signatures) contain four sheets, save two containing five. It is estimated that the hides of about 360 animals were employed for making the folios of this codex. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns, 48 lines per column, with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically (writing each new poetic phrase on a new line), in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters. Each rectangular page has the proportions 1.1 to 1, while the block of text has the reciprocal proportions, 0.91 (the same proportions, rotated 90°). If the gutters between the columns were removed, the text block would mirror the page&#x27;s proportions. Typographer Robert Bringhurst referred to the codex as a &quot;subtle piece of craftsmanship&quot;. The cost of the material, copying time required for the scribes, and binding, is estimated to have equalled the lifetime wages of one individual at the time.

Throughout the New Testament portion, the words are written in &quot;scriptio continua&quot; (words without any spaces in between them) in the hand-writing style that came to be called &quot;biblical uncial&quot; or &quot;biblical majuscule&quot;. The parchment was ruled with a sharp point to prepare for writing lines. The letters are written along these lines, with neither breathings nor polytonic accents (markings utilised to indicate changes of pitch or emphasis). A variety of types of punctuation are used: high and middle points; colon; diaeresis on initial iota and upsilon; a few ligatures are used, along with the paragraphos: initial letter into margin (extent of this varies considerably). A plain iota is replaced by the epsilon-iota diphthong almost regularly (commonly though imprecisely known as itacism), e.g. instead of , instead of , instead of , etc.

Nomina sacra with overlines are employed throughout. Some words usually abbreviated in other manuscripts (such as and ), are written in both full and abbreviated forms. The following nomina sacra are written in abbreviated forms (nominative forms shown): ( / &quot;god&quot;), ( / &quot;lord&quot;), ( / &quot;Jesus&quot;), ( / &quot;Christ&quot;), ( / &quot;spirit&quot;), ( / &quot;spiritual&quot;), ( / &quot;son&quot;), ( / &quot;man&quot;), ( / &quot;heaven&quot;), ( / &quot;David&quot;), ( / &quot;Jerusalem&quot;), ( / &quot;Israel&quot;), ( / &quot;mother&quot;), ( / &quot;father&quot;), ( / &quot;saviour&quot;).

The portion of the codex held by the British Library consists of 346½ folios, 694 pages (38.1 cm x 34.5 cm), constituting over half of the original work. Of these folios, 199 belong to the Old Testament, including the apocrypha (deuterocanonical), and 147½ belong to the New Testament, along with two other books, the Epistle of Barnabas and part of The Shepherd of Hermas. The apocryphal and deuterocanonical books present in the surviving part of the Septuagint are 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 and 4 Maccabees, Wisdom, and Sirach. The books of the New Testament are arranged in this order: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul (Hebrews follows 2 Thess.), the Acts of the Apostles, the General Epistles, and the Book of Revelation. The fact that some parts of the codex are preserved in good condition while others are in very poor condition suggests they were separated and stored in several places.

While large portions of the Old Testament are missing, it is assumed the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments. About half of the Greek Old Testament (or &quot;Septuagint&quot;) survived, along with a complete New Testament, the entire Deuterocanonical books, the Epistle of Barnabas and portions of The Shepherd of Hermas.

=== Text-type and relationship to other manuscripts ===
For most of the New Testament, Codex Sinaiticus is in general agreement with &quot;Codex Vaticanus (B)&quot; and &quot;Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C)&quot;, attesting the Alexandrian text-type.
A notable example of an agreement between the text in Sinaiticus and Vaticanus is they both omit the word εικη (&#x27;without cause&#x27;, &#x27;without reason&#x27;, &#x27;in vain&#x27;) from Matthew 5:22: &quot;But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement&quot;.

In John 1:1–8:38, Codex Sinaiticus differs from Vaticanus (B) and all other Alexandrian manuscripts. It is in closer agreement with &quot;Codex Bezae (D)&quot; in support of the Western text-type. For example, in John 1:4, Sinaiticus and Codex Bezae are the only Greek manuscripts with textual variant (&quot;in him is life&quot;) instead of (&quot;in him was life&quot;). This variant is supported by Vetus Latina and some Sahidic manuscripts. This portion has a large number of corrections.
There are a number of differences between Sinaiticus and Vaticanus; Textual critic Herman C. Hoskier enumerated 3036 differences:
::::Matt: 656
::::Mark: 567
::::Luke: 791
::::John: 1022
::::Total — 3036.

According to textual critic Fenton Hort, &quot;Sinaiticus&quot; and &quot;Vaticanus&quot; were derived from a much older common source, &quot;the date of which cannot be later than the early part of the second century, and may well be yet earlier&quot;.

Example of differences between Sinaiticus and Vaticanus in Matt 1:18–19 (one transposition difference; two spelling differences; one word substitution difference):

Biblical scholar B. H. Streeter remarked there was a great agreement between the codex and the Vulgate of Jerome. According to him, Origen brought the Alexandrian text-type that was used in this codex to Caesarea, and it was subsequently employed by Jerome for his Latin revision.

Between the 4th and 12th centuries, seven or more correctors worked on this codex, making it one of the most corrected manuscripts in existence. During his investigation in Petersburg, Tischendorf enumerated 14,800 corrections in the portion which was only held in Petersburg (2/3 of the codex). According to textual critic David C. Parker, the full codex has about 23,000 corrections. In addition to these corrections some letters were marked by dots as doubtful (e.g. ṪḢ).

== History ==

=== Early history ===

==== Provenance ====
Little is known of the manuscript&#x27;s early history. According to Hort, it was written in the West, probably in Rome, as suggested by the fact that the chapter division in the Acts of the Apostles common to Sinaiticus and Vaticanus occurs in no other Greek manuscript, but is found in several manuscripts of the Latin Vulgate. Robinson countered this argument, suggesting that this system of chapter divisions was introduced into the Vulgate by Jerome himself, as a result of his studies at Caesarea. According to Kenyon the forms of the letters are Egyptian and they were found in Egyptian papyri of earlier date. Gardthausen, Ropes and Jellicoe thought it was written in Egypt. Biblical scholar J. Rendel Harris believed that the manuscript came from the library of Pamphilus at Caesarea Maritima. Streeter, Skeat, and Milne also believed that it was produced in Caesarea.

==== Date ====
The codex can be dated with a reasonable degree of confidence between the early fourth century and the early fifth century. It could not have been written before about 325 because it contains the Eusebian Canons, which is a &quot;terminus post quem&quot;. The &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; is less certain. Milne and Skeat relied on small cursive notes to assert that the date of the production of the codex was not likely to be much later than about 360. More recent research suggests that these cursive notes could be as late as the early fifth century.

Tischendorf theorized that Codex Sinaiticus was one of the fifty copies of the Bible commissioned from Eusebius by Roman emperor Constantine after his conversion to Christianity (&quot;De vita Constantini&quot;, IV, 37). This hypothesis was supported by Pierre Batiffol. Biblical scholar&#x27;s Caspar René Gregory and T.C. Skeat believed that it was already in production when Constantine placed his order, but had to be suspended in order to accommodate different page dimensions.

Biblical scholar Frederic G. Kenyon argued: &quot;There is not the least sign of either of them ever having been at Constantinople. The fact that Sinaiticus was collated with the manuscript of Pamphilus so late as the sixth century seems to show that it was not originally written at Caesarea&quot;.

==== Scribes and correctors ====
Tischendorf believed four separate scribes copied the work (whom he named A, B, C and D), and five correctors amended portions (whom he designated a, b, c, d and e). He posited one of the correctors was contemporaneous with the original scribes, and the others worked during the sixth and seventh centuries. After Milne and Skeat&#x27;s reinvestigation, it is now agreed Tischendorf was incorrect, as scribe C never existed. According to Tischendorf, scribe C wrote the poetic books of the Old Testament. These are written in a different format from the rest of the manuscript – they appear in two columns (the rest of books is in four columns), written stichometrically. Tischendorf probably interpreted the different formatting as indicating the existence of another scribe. The three remaining scribes are still identified by the letters Tischendorf gave them: A, B, and D. There were in fact more correctors, with at least seven (a, b, c, ca, cb, cc, e).

Modern analysis identifies three scribes:

* Scribe A wrote most of the historical and poetical books of the Old Testament; almost the whole of the New Testament; and the Epistle of Barnabas
* Scribe B was responsible for the Prophets and for the Shepherd of Hermas
* Scribe D wrote the whole of Tobit and Judith; the first half of 4 Maccabees; the first two-thirds of the Psalms; and the first five verses of Revelation

Scribe B was a poor speller, and scribe A was not much better; the best scribe was D. Metzger states: &quot;scribe A had made some unusually serious mistakes&quot;. Scribes A and B used &quot;nomina sacra&quot; in contracted forms most often (ΠΝΕΥΜΑ contracted in all occurrences, ΚΥΡΙΟΣ contracted except in 2 occurrences), whereas scribe D mostly used the uncontracted forms. Scribe D distinguished between sacral and nonsacral uses of ΚΥΡΙΟΣ. His spelling errors are the substitution of ΕΙ for Ι, and Ι for ΕΙ in medial positions, both equally common. Otherwise substitution of Ι for initial ΕΙ is unknown, and final ΕΙ is only replaced in the word ΙΣΧΥΕΙ. The confusion of Ε and ΑΙ is very rare. In the Book of Psalms, this scribe has ΔΑΥΕΙΔ instead of ΔΑΥΙΔ 35 times, while scribe A normally uses an abbreviated form . Scribe A made the most phonetic errors: confusion of Ε and ΑΙ occurs in all contexts. Milne and Skeat characterised scribe B as &quot;careless and illiterate&quot;.
A paleographical study at the British Museum in 1938 found the text had undergone several corrections. The first corrections were done by several scribes before the manuscript left the scriptorium. Readings which they introduced are designated by the siglum a. Milne and Skeat have observed the superscription to 1 Maccabees was made by scribe D, while the text was written by scribe A. Scribe D corrects his own work and that of scribe A, but scribe A limits himself to correcting his own work. In the sixth or seventh century, many alterations were made (b) – according to a colophon at the end of the book of Esdras and Esther, the source of these alterations was &quot;a very ancient manuscript that had been corrected by the hand of the holy martyr Pamphylus&quot; (martyred in 309). If this is so, material beginning with 1 Samuel to the end of Esther is Origen&#x27;s copy of the Hexapla. From this colophon, the corrections are concluded to have been made in Caesarea Maritima in the sixth or seventh centuries. The pervasive iotacism, especially of the diphthong, remains uncorrected.

=== Discovery ===
The Codex may have been seen in 1761 by the Italian traveller Vitaliano Donati, when he visited the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery at Sinai in Egypt. His diary was published in 1879, in which was written:
In questo monastero ritrovai una quantità grandissima di codici membranacei... ve ne sono alcuni che mi sembravano anteriori al settimo secolo, ed in ispecie una Bibbia in membrane bellissime, assai grandi, sottili, e quadre, scritta in carattere rotondo e bellissimo; conservano poi in chiesa un Evangelistario greco in caractere d&#x27;oro rotondo, che dovrebbe pur essere assai antico. 

&quot;In this monastery I found a great number of parchment codices ... there are some which seemed to be written before the seventh century, and especially a Bible (made) of beautiful vellum, very large, thin and square parchments, written in round and very beautiful letters; moreover there are also in the church a Greek Evangelistarium in gold and round letters, it should be very old.&quot; 

The &quot;Bible on beautiful vellum&quot; may be Codex Sinaiticus, and the gold evangelistarium is likely Lectionary 300 on the Gregory-Aland list.
German Biblical scholar Constantin von Tischendorf wrote about his visit to the monastery in &quot;Reise in den Orient&quot; in 1846 (translated as &quot;Travels in the East&quot; in 1847), without mentioning the manuscript. Later, in 1860, in his writings about the Sinaiticus discovery, Tischendorf wrote a narrative about the monastery and the manuscript that spanned from 1844 to 1859. He wrote that in 1844, during his first visit to the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, he saw some leaves of parchment in a waste-basket. They were &quot;rubbish which was to be destroyed by burning it in the ovens of the monastery&quot;, although this is firmly denied by the Monastery. After examination he realized that they were part of the Septuagint, written in an early Greek uncial script. He retrieved from the basket 129 leaves in Greek which he identified as coming from a manuscript of the Septuagint. He asked if he might keep them, but at this point the attitude of the monks changed. They realized how valuable these old leaves were, and Tischendorf was permitted to take only one-third of the whole, i.e. 43 leaves. These leaves contained portions of 1 Chronicles, Jeremiah, Nehemiah, and Esther. After his return they were deposited in the Leipzig University Library, where they remain. In 1846 Tischendorf published their contents, naming them the &#x27;Codex Friderico-Augustanus&#x27; (in honor of Frederick Augustus and keeping secret the source of the leaves). Other portions of the same codex remained in the monastery, containing all of Isaiah and 1 and 4 Maccabees.

In 1845, Archimandrite Porphyrius Uspensky (1804–1885), at that time head of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and subsequently Bishop of Chigirin, visited the monastery and the codex was shown to him, together with leaves which Tischendorf had not seen. In 1846, Captain C. K. MacDonald visited Mount Sinai, saw the codex, and bought two codices (495 and 496) from the monastery.
In 1853, Tischendorf revisited the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery to get the remaining 86 folios, but without success. Returning in 1859, this time under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, he was shown Codex Sinaiticus. He would later claim to have found it discarded in a rubbish bin. (This story may have been a fabrication, or the manuscripts in question may have been unrelated to Codex Sinaiticus: Rev. J. Silvester Davies in 1863 quoted &quot;a monk of Sinai who... stated that according to the librarian of the monastery the whole of Codex Sinaiticus had been in the library for many years and was marked in the ancient catalogues... Is it not likely... that a manuscript known in the library catalogue would have been jettisoned in the rubbish basket.&quot; Indeed, it has been noted that the leaves were in &quot;suspiciously good condition&quot; for something found in the trash.) Tischendorf had been sent to search for manuscripts by Russia&#x27;s Tsar Alexander II, who was convinced there were still manuscripts to be found at the Sinai monastery. The text of this part of the codex was published by Tischendorf in 1862:
* Konstantin von Tischendorf: &quot;Bibliorum codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus.&quot; Giesecke &amp; Devrient, Leipzig 1862.
This work has been digitised in full and all four volumes may be consulted online.
It was reprinted in four volumes in 1869:
* Konstantin von Tischendorf, G. Olms (Hrsg.): &quot;Bibliorum codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus. 1. Prolegomena.&quot; G. Olms, Hildesheim 1869 (Repr.).
* Konstantin von Tischendorf, G. Olms (Hrsg.): &quot;Bibliorum codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus. 2. Veteris Testamenti pars prior.&quot; G. Olms, Hildesheim 1869 (Repr.).
* Konstantin von Tischendorf, G. Olms (Hrsg.): &quot;Bibliorum codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus. 3. Veteris Testamenti pars posterior.&quot; G. Olms, Hildesheim 1869 (Repr.).
* Konstantin von Tischendorf, G. Olms (Hrsg.): &quot;Bibliorum codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus. 4. Novum Testamentum cum Barnaba et Pastore.&quot; G. Olms, Hildesheim 1869 (Repr.).

The complete publication of the codex was made by Kirsopp Lake in 1911 (New Testament), and in 1922 (Old Testament). It was the full-sized black and white facsimile of the manuscript, &quot;made from negatives taken from St. Petersburg by my wife and myself in the summer of 1908&quot;.

The story of how Tischendorf found the manuscript, which contained most of the Old Testament and all of the New Testament, has all the interest of a romance. Tischendorf reached the monastery on 31 January; but his inquiries appeared to be fruitless. On 4 February, he had resolved to return home without having gained his object:
On the afternoon of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment with him in his cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: &quot;And I, too, have read a Septuagint&quot; – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from the corner of the room a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, I had taken out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.
After some negotiations, he obtained possession of this precious fragment. James Bentley gives an account of how this came about, prefacing it with the comment, &quot;Tischendorf therefore now embarked on the remarkable piece of duplicity which was to occupy him for the next decade, which involved the careful suppression of facts and the systematic denigration of the monks of Mount Sinai.&quot; He conveyed it to Tsar Alexander II, who appreciated its importance and had it published as nearly as possible in facsimile, so as to exhibit correctly the ancient handwriting. In 1869 the Tsar sent the monastery 7,000 rubles and the monastery of Mount Tabor 2,000 rubles by way of compensation. The document in Russian formalising this was published in 2007 in Russia and has since been translated.

The codex is regarded by the monastery as having been stolen, which is proven by a receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from St. Petersburg ‘to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request’, a copy of which is on display in the publicly-accessible area of the monastery.
This view of Tischendorf&#x27;s role in the transfer to Saint Petersburg has been contested by several scholars in Europe. New Testament scholar Bruce Metzger wrote:
Certain aspects of the negotiations leading to the transfer of the codex to the Tsar&#x27;s possession are open to an interpretation that reflects adversely on Tischendorf&#x27;s candour and good faith with the monks at Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery. For an account intended to exculpate him of blame, see Erhard Lauch&#x27;s article &#x27;Nichts gegen Tischendorf&#x27; in &quot;Bekenntnis zur Kirche: Festgabe für Ernst Sommerlath zum 70. Geburtstag&quot; (Berlin, c. 1961), pp.15-24; for an account that includes a hitherto [i.e., before 1964] unknown receipt given by Tischendorf to the authorities at the monastery promising to return the manuscript from Saint Petersburg &#x27;to the Holy Confraternity of Sinai at its earliest request,&#x27; see Ihor Ševčenko, &quot;New Documents on Tischendorf and the Codex Sinaiticus&quot;, published in the journal &quot;Scriptorium&quot;, xviii (1964), pp. 55–80.


=== Simonides ===
On 13 September 1862 Constantine Simonides (1820–1890), skilled in calligraphy and with a controversial background with manuscripts, made the claim in print in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; that he had written the codex himself as a 19-year-old boy in 1839 in the Panteleimonos monastery at Athos. Constantin von Tischendorf, who worked with numerous Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf&#x27;s contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and the invitation to Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of Codex Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides, which later have been disproved. Since Bradshaw was a social &#x27;hub&#x27; among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.

In answer to Simonides in &quot;Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; (December 1862), Tischendorf noted only in the New Testament were there many differences between it and all other manuscripts. Henry Bradshaw, a bibliographer, combatted the claims of Constantine Simonides in a letter to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; (26 January 1863). Bradshaw argued that Codex Sinaiticus brought by Tischendorf from the Greek monastery of Mount Sinai was not a modern forgery or written by Simonides. The controversy seems to regard the misplaced use of the word &#x27;fraud&#x27; or &#x27;forgery&#x27; since it may have been a repaired text, a copy of the Septuagint based upon Origen&#x27;s Hexapla, a text which has been rejected for centuries because of its lineage from Eusebius who introduced Arian doctrine into the courts of Constantine I and II.

Not every scholar and Church minister was delighted about the codex find. Burgon, a supporter of the Textus Receptus, suggested that Codex Sinaiticus, as well as codices Vaticanus and Codex Bezae, were the most corrupt documents extant. Each of these three codices &quot;clearly exhibits a fabricated text – is the result of arbitrary and reckless recension.&quot; The two most weighty of these three codices, and B, he likens to the &quot;two false witnesses&quot; of Matthew 26:60.

However, independent discoveries of other fragments of the codex in recent history (see below) prove its authenticity, and disprove all theories of it being a forgery.

=== Recent history ===
In the early 20th century Vladimir Beneshevich (1874–1938) discovered parts of three more leaves of the codex in the bindings of other manuscripts in the library of Mount Sinai. Beneshevich went on three occasions to the monastery (1907, 1908, 1911) but does not tell when or from which book these were recovered. These leaves were also acquired for St. Petersburg, where they remain.
For many decades, the Codex was preserved in the Russian National Library. In 1933, the Soviet Union sold the codex to the British Museum (after 1973 part of it was separated to become the British Library) for £100,000 raised by public subscription (worth £ in 2025). After coming to Britain it was examined by Skeat and Milne using an ultra-violet lamp.

In May 1975, during restoration work, the monks of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery discovered a room beneath the St. George Chapel which contained many parchment fragments. Kurt Aland and his team from the Institute for New Testament Textual Research were the first scholars who were invited to analyse, examine and photograph these new fragments of the New Testament in 1982. Among these fragments were twelve complete leaves from the &quot;Sinaiticus&quot;, eleven leaves of the Pentateuch and one leaf of the Shepherd of Hermas. Together with these leaves 67 Greek Manuscripts of New Testament have been found (uncials 0278 – 0296 and some minuscules).

In June 2005, a team of experts from the United Kingdom, Europe, Egypt, Russia and United States undertook a joint project to produce a new digital edition of the manuscript (involving all four holding libraries), and a series of other studies was announced. This will include the use of hyperspectral imaging to photograph the manuscripts to look for hidden information such as erased or faded text. This was done in cooperation with the British Library.

More than one quarter of the manuscript was made publicly available at The Codex Sinaiticus Website on 24 July 2008. On 6 July 2009, 800 more pages of the manuscript were made available, showing over half of the entire text, although the entire text was intended to be shown by that date.

The complete document is now available online in digital form and available for scholarly study. The online version has a fully transcribed set of digital pages, including amendments to the text, and two images of each page, with both standard lighting and raked lighting to highlight the texture of the parchment.

Prior to 1 September 2009, the University of the Arts London PhD student, Nikolas Sarris, discovered the previously unseen fragment of the Codex in the library of Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery. It contains the text of Book of Joshua 1:10.

== Present location ==

The codex is now split into four unequal portions: 347 leaves in the British Library in London (199 of the Old Testament, 148 of the New Testament), 12 leaves and 14 fragments in the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery, 43 leaves in the Leipzig University Library, and fragments of 3 leaves in the Russian National Library in Saint Petersburg.

Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery still maintains the importance of a letter, handwritten in 1844 with an original signature of Tischendorf confirming that he borrowed those leaves and that they would be returned from Russia if requested. However, Russian scholars contend that recently published documents, including a deed of gift dated 11 September 1868 (four years after the removal of the manuscript from the monastery) and signed by Archbishop Kallistratos and the monks of the monastery, amount to a proof that the manuscript was obtained legally. This deed, which agrees with a report by Kurt Aland on the matter, has now been published. This development is not widely known in the English-speaking world, as only German- and Russian-language media reported on it in 2009. Doubts as to the legality of the gift arose because when Tischendorf originally removed the manuscript from Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery in September 1859, the monastery was without an archbishop, so that even though the intention to present the manuscript to the Tsar had been expressed, no legal gift could be made at the time. Resolution of the matter was delayed through the turbulent reign of Archbishop Cyril (consecrated 7 December 1859, deposed 24 August 1866).
Skeat in his article &quot;The Last Chapter in the History of the Codex Sinaiticus&quot; concluded in this way:

This is not the place to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the importance of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.
== Impact on biblical scholarship ==
Along with Codex Vaticanus, Codex Sinaiticus is considered one of the most valuable manuscripts available, as it is one of the oldest and likely closer to the original text of the Greek New Testament. It is the only uncial manuscript with the complete text of the New Testament, and the only ancient manuscript of the New Testament written in four columns per page which has survived to the present day. With only 300 years separating Codex Sinaiticus and the lifetime of Jesus, it is considered by some to be more accurate than most New Testament copies in preserving readings where almost all manuscripts are assumed by them to be in error.

For the Gospels, Sinaiticus is considered among some people as the second most reliable witness of the text (after Vaticanus); in the Acts of the Apostles, its text is equal to that of Vaticanus; in the Epistles, Sinaiticus is assumed to be the most reliable witness of the text. In the Book of Revelation, however, its text is corrupted and is considered of poor quality, and inferior to the texts of Codex Alexandrinus, , and even some minuscule manuscripts in this place (for example, Minuscule 2053, 2062).

<text>St. John Fisher University is a private university in Rochester, New York in the United States. It is named after John Fisher, an English Catholic cardinal and saint. It was named St. John Fisher College until July 1, 2022.

==History==
St. John Fisher University (originally St. John Fisher College) was founded as a men&#x27;s college in 1948 by the Basilian Fathers and with the aid of James E. Kearney, then the Bishop of the Diocese of Rochester. It is now operated as an coeducational independent institution in the Catholic tradition (independent since 1968; coeducational since 1971).

In 2015, St. John Fisher College applied for and received the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the New England Resource Center for Higher Education (NERCHE).

The college was listed as a census-designated place in 2020, with a residential population of 1,307. In 2022, the college was renamed St. John Fisher University.

==Academics==
Fisher is made up of five schools. It offers nearly 40 undergraduate majors, as well as a variety of master&#x27;s and doctoral programs.

===School of Arts and Sciences===
The School of Arts and Sciences is the largest school within St. John Fisher University. It offers degrees and minors in over 20 undergraduate academic disciplines.

===Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. School of Education===
The school is named after Ralph C. Wilson, Jr., the founding owner of the Buffalo Bills professional football team. It is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education and offers undergraduate degrees in Inclusive Adolescence Education and Inclusive Childhood Education. It also offers a master&#x27;s degree and initial certification program for those areas. Teachers already holding initial certification can earn graduate degrees and professional certification in Literacy Education (B-6 and 5–12), Special Education, and Educational Leadership, as well as an accelerated Doctor of Education in Executive Leadership.

The School of Education is active in community outreach programs including a literacy center that provides tutoring and small group instruction in literacy for elementary through high school students. The School of Education works closely with local school districts including the Rochester City School District, which hosts a number of Professional Development Sites where practicing teachers and pre-service teachers work alongside education faculty to develop best practices.

===School of Business===
Fisher&#x27;s business programs are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International). When this accreditation was gained, all business programs at the University were brought together in 2003 to form the school&#x27;s first professional school, the School of Business.

===Wegmans School of Pharmacy===
The Wegmans School of Pharmacy is one of eight pharmacy schools in New York State and is the first pharmacy school in the Greater Rochester community. It opened in fall 2006 and became fully accredited in May 2010. It awards a Doctor of Pharmacy degree to candidates who successfully complete four years of professional study.
The school was made possible by a $5 million gift from the late Robert Wegman, who served for many years as president of Wegmans Food Markets.

===Wegmans School of Nursing===
This school is also named after Robert Wegman, who contributed $8 million to the college to create the School of Nursing. Fisher&#x27;s nursing programs are fully accredited by the New York State Education Department and the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education.

The university also offers an online RN to BSN program, master&#x27;s degrees in both Nursing and Mental Health Counseling, and a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree.

===Scholarships===
Nearly all first-year students receive some form of financial assistance. Need-based and merit-based scholarships, as well as grants, loans, and part-time employment, are available for eligible students. Two unique scholarships are awarded to incoming freshmen.

==Athletics==
The university is a founding member of the Empire 8 Athletic Association and competes with other full member schools. It competes at the NCAA Division III level, and is a member of the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), the Empire 8, the Liberty League (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rowing), and the United Volleyball Conference (men&#x27;s). Its mascot is the cardinal.

During the 2014–15 season, St. John Fisher won Empire 8 championships for men&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field, men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s outdoor track &amp; field, men&#x27;s golf, and women&#x27;s lacrosse.

Growney Stadium is home to Fisher&#x27;s football, field hockey, soccer, and lacrosse teams. The stadium&#x27;s all-weather playing field has lighting and a 2,500 seat grandstand. The Manning &amp; Napier Varsity Gymnasium is home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. Dugan Yard is Fisher&#x27;s baseball field. Other outdoor facilities include the Polisseni Track and Field Complex, regulation-sized practice fields (which serve as the home rugby fields), and a softball diamond.

In 2006, Fisher&#x27;s football team finished the season with a 12–2 record overall and shared the Empire 8 Conference title. Fisher received an at-large bid into the NCAA Division III Tournament, in which they defeated Union College, Springfield College, and Rowan University to reach the national semifinals, which they lost to Mount Union College, the defending national champions, by a score of 26–14.

In 2007, Fisher&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team won the Empire 8 Conference title for the 5th consecutive year and the 6th time in seven years. In 2006, Fisher advanced to the Elite Eight of the NCAA Men&#x27;s Division III Basketball Championship Tournament.

The women&#x27;s basketball program was led for 34 seasons by Phil Kahler, who posted a career record of 797 wins (the most in Division III history) and 175 losses with a career winning percentage of .821. Under Kahler, the women&#x27;s basketball program reached the NCAA Division III Championship Tournament 14 times and played in the NCAA Women&#x27;s Division III Basketball Championship game in 1988 and 1990. Kahler retired shortly before the start of the 2008–09 basketball season and was replaced on the bench by Marianne O&#x27;Connor Ermi, his top assistant coach for 20 seasons. The women&#x27;s basketball team is now led by Melissa Kuberka who was hired as a head coach before the 2017-18 season.

===Buffalo Bills Training Camp===
Since 2000, St. John Fisher University has been home to the Buffalo Bills&#x27; NFL summer training camp.

==Student life==
Many campus clubs and organizations are available to students. Four of the major organizations on campus include the Student Government Association, the Student Activities Board, the Residence Hall Association, and Commuter Council.

Other clubs include music groups, Greek-lettered organizations, language clubs, cultural organizations, student publications, and intramural sports. Many academic departments also sponsor clubs. Fisher students can contribute to the community through a variety of service organizations including Students With a Vision and Colleges Against Cancer. Numerous service projects occur each year including Project Community Convergence, Relay for Life, the Giant Read, and the Sweetheart Ball.

The Office of Campus Ministry offers faith-based programs and activities to students of all faith traditions regardless of religious tradition or spiritual beliefs.

== Teddi Dance for Love ==
The Annual Teddi Dance for Love is a 24 hour dance marathon started by Lou Buttino in 1983 that benefits Camp Good Days and Special Times. This project funds a trip to Florida for the children of Camp Good Days and has raised over $1.8 million since its inception.

<text>Scouting, also known as the Scout Movement, is a worldwide youth social movement employing the Scout method. It is a program of informal education with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities, including camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports. Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of social standing in a country and encouraging equality, with neckerchief and campaign hat or comparable headwear. Distinctive uniform insignia include the fleur-de-lis and the trefoil, as well as merit badges and other patches.

In 1907, Robert Baden-Powell, a lieutenant general in the British Army held a Scouting encampment on Brownsea Island in England. Baden-Powell wrote &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; (London, 1908), partly based on his earlier military books. The Scout Movement of both Boy Scouts and Girl Guides (renamed to Girl Scouts in some countries) was well established in the first decade of the twentieth century. Later, programs for younger children, such as Wolf Cubs (1916), now Cubs, and for older adolescents, such as Rovers (1918), were adopted by some Scout organizations. In 1910, Baden-Powell formed the Girl Guides, for girls in the United Kingdom which spread internationally as Girl Guides and includes age programs of (Brownie Guide, Girl Guide and Girl Scout, Ranger Guide).

In 2007, Scouting and Guiding together had over 38 million members in 216 countries. International umbrella organizations include: World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), for boys-only and co-educational organizations: World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), primarily for girls-only organizations but also accepting co-educational organizations, World Federation of Independent Scouts, World Organization of Independent Scouts, Order of World Scouts, International Union of Guides and Scouts of Europe, and Confederation of European Scouts.

==History==

===Origins===

The trigger for the Scouting movement was the 1908 publication of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; written by Robert Baden-Powell. At Charterhouse, one of England&#x27;s most famous public schools, Baden-Powell had an interest in the outdoors. Later, as a military officer, Baden-Powell was stationed in British India in the 1880s where he took an interest in military scouting and in 1884 he published &quot;Reconnaissance and Scouting&quot;.

In 1896, Baden-Powell was assigned to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War. In June 1896 he met here and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas originated here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell&#x27;s woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called &quot;scoutcraft&quot;, the fundamentals of Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. During this time in the Matobo Hills Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and acquired his kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and to call them together in training courses.

Three years later, in South Africa during the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell was besieged in the small town of Mafikeng (Mafeking) by a much larger Boer army. The Mafeking Cadet Corps was a group of youths that supported the troops by carrying messages, which freed the men for military duties and kept the boys occupied during the long siege. The Cadet Corps performed well, helping in the defence of the town (1899–1900), and were one of the many factors that inspired Baden-Powell to form the Scouting movement. Each member received a badge that illustrated a combined compass point and spearhead. The badge&#x27;s logo was similar to the fleur-de-lis shaped arrowhead that Scouting later adopted as its international symbol. The siege of Mafeking was the first time since his own childhood that Baden-Powell, a regular serving soldier, had come into the same orbit as &quot;civilians&quot;—women and children—and discovered for himself the usefulness of well-trained boys.

In the United Kingdom, the public, through newspapers, followed Baden-Powell&#x27;s struggle to hold Mafeking, and when the siege was broken he had become a national hero. This rise to fame fuelled the sales of the small instruction book he had written in 1899 about military scouting and wilderness survival, &quot;Aids to Scouting,&quot; that owed much to what he had learned from discussions with Burnham.

On his return to England, Baden-Powell noticed that boys showed considerable interest in &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot;, which was unexpectedly used by teachers and youth organizations as their first Scouting handbook. He was urged to rewrite this book for boys, especially during an inspection of the Boys&#x27; Brigade (of which he was vice president at the time), a large youth movement drilled with military precision. Baden-Powell thought this would not be attractive and suggested that the Boys&#x27; Brigade could grow much larger were Scouting to be used. He studied other schemes, parts of which he used for Scouting.

In July 1906 Ernest Thompson Seton sent Baden-Powell a copy of his 1902 book &quot;The Birchbark Roll of the Woodcraft Indians&quot;. Seton, a British-born Canadian-American living in the United States, met Baden-Powell in October 1906, and they shared ideas about youth training programs. In 1907 Baden-Powell wrote a draft called &quot;Boy Patrols&quot;. In the same year, to test his ideas, he gathered 21 boys of mixed social backgrounds (from boy&#x27;s schools in the London area and a section of boys from the Poole, Parkstone, Hamworthy, Bournemouth, and Winton Boys&#x27; Brigade units) and held a week-long camp in August on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, Dorset. His organizational method, now known as the Patrol System and a key part of Scouting training, allowed the boys to organize themselves into small groups with an elected patrol leader.

In late 1907, Baden-Powell went on an extensive speaking tour arranged by his publisher, Arthur Pearson, to promote his forthcoming book, &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. He had not simply rewritten his &quot;Aids to Scouting&quot;; he omitted the military aspects and transferred the techniques (mainly survival skills) to non-military heroes: backwoodsmen, explorers (and later on, sailors and airmen). He also added innovative educational principles (the Scout method) by which he extended the attractive game to a personal mental education.

At the beginning of 1908, Baden-Powell published &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; in six fortnightly parts, setting out activities and programmes which existing youth organisations could use. The reaction was phenomenal, and quite unexpected. In a very short time, Scout Patrols were created up and down the country, all following the principles of Baden-Powell&#x27;s book. In 1909, the first Scout Rally was held at Crystal Palace in London, to which 11,000 Scouts came—and some girls dressed as Scouts and calling themselves &quot;Girl Scouts&quot;. Baden-Powell retired from the Army and, in 1910, he formed The Boy Scouts Association, and later The Girl Guides. By the time of The Boy Scouts Association&#x27;s first census in 1910, it had over 100,000 Scouts.

&quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; was published in England later in 1908 in book form. The book is now the fourth-bestselling title of all time, and was the basis for the later American version of the &quot;Boy Scout Handbook&quot;.

At the time, Baden-Powell intended that the scheme would be used by established organizations, in particular the Boys&#x27; Brigade, from the founder William A. Smith. However, because of the popularity of his person and the adventurous outdoor games he wrote about, boys spontaneously formed Scout patrols and flooded Baden-Powell with requests for assistance. He encouraged them, and the Scouting movement developed momentum. In 1910 Baden-Powell formed The Boy Scouts Association in the United Kingdom. As the movement grew, Sea Scouts, Air Scouts, and other specialized units were added to the program.

===Original Scout Law===
The scouts law is for boys, as follows;

*A Scout&#x27;s honour is to be trusted – This means the scout will try as best as he can to do what he promised, or what is asked of him
*A Scout is loyal – to his king or queen, his leaders and his country.
*A Scout&#x27;s duty is to be useful, and to help others
*A Scout is a friend to all, and a brother to every other Scout – Scouts help one another, regardless of the differences in status or social class.
*A Scout is courteous – He is polite and helpful to all, especially women, children and the elderly. He does not take anything for being helpful.
*A Scout is a friend to animals – He does not make them suffer or kill them without need to do so.
*A Scout obeys orders – Even the ones he does not like.
*A Scout smiles and whistles
*A Scout is thrifty – he avoids unnecessary spending of money.
*A Scout is clean in thought, word and deed (added later)

===Promise of 1908===
In his original book on boy scouting, General Baden-Powell introduced the Scout promise, as follows:

&quot;Before he becomes a scout, a boy must take the scout&#x27;s oath, thus:

:&#x27;On my honour I promise that—
:#I will do my duty to God and the King.
:#I will do my best to help others, whatever it costs me.
:#I know the scout law, and will obey it.&#x27;
While taking this oath the scout will stand, holding his right hand raised level with his shoulder, palm to the front, thumb resting on the nail of the little finger and the other three fingers upright, pointing upwards:—

This is the scout&#x27;s salute and secret sign.&quot;

===Movement===

The Boy Scout Movement swiftly established itself throughout the British Empire soon after the publication of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;. By 1908, Scouting was established in Gibraltar, Malta, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Malaya (YMCA Experimental Troop in Penang) and South Africa. In 1909 Chile was the first country outside the British dominions to have a Scouting organization recognized by Baden-Powell. The first Scout rally, held in 1909 at the Crystal Palace in London, attracted 10,000 boys and a number of girls. By 1910, Argentina, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States had Boy Scouts.

The program initially focused on boys aged 11 to 18, but as the movement grew the need became apparent for leader training and programs for younger boys, older boys, and girls. The first Cub Scout and Rover Scout programs were in place by the late 1910s. They operated independently until they obtained official recognition from their home country&#x27;s Scouting organization. In the United States, attempts at Cub programs began as early as 1911, but official recognition was not obtained until 1930.

Girls wanted to become part of the movement almost as soon as it began. Baden-Powell and his sister Agnes Baden-Powell introduced the Girl Guides in 1910, a parallel movement for girls, sometimes named Girl Scouts. Agnes Baden-Powell became the first president of the Girl Guides when it was formed in 1910, at the request of the girls who attended the Crystal Palace Rally. In 1914, she started Rosebuds—later renamed Brownies—for younger girls. She stepped down as president of the Girl Guides in 1920 in favor of Robert&#x27;s wife Olave Baden-Powell, who was named Chief Guide (for England) in 1918 and World Chief Guide in 1930. At that time, girls were expected to remain separate from boys because of societal standards, though co-educational youth groups did exist. By the 1990s, two-thirds of the Scout organizations belonging to WOSM had become co-educational.

Baden-Powell could not single-handedly advise all groups who requested his assistance. Early Scoutmaster training camps were held in London and Yorkshire in 1910 and 1911. Baden-Powell wanted the training to be as practical as possible to encourage other adults to take leadership roles, so the Wood Badge course was developed to recognize adult leadership training. The development of the training was delayed by World War I, and the first Wood Badge course was not held until 1919. Wood Badge is used by Boy Scout associations and combined Boy Scout and Girl Guide associations in many countries. Gilwell Park near London was purchased in 1919 on behalf of The Scout Association as an adult training site and Scouting campsite. Baden-Powell wrote a book, &quot;Aids to Scoutmastership&quot;, to help Scouting Leaders, and wrote other handbooks for the use of the new Scouting sections, such as Cub Scouts and Girl Guides. One of these was &quot;Rovering to Success&quot;, written for Rover Scouts in 1922. A wide range of leader training exists in 2007, from basic to program-specific, including the Wood Badge training.

===Influences===
Important elements of traditional Scouting have their origins in Baden-Powell&#x27;s experiences in education and military training. He was a 50-year-old retired army general when he founded Scouting, and his revolutionary ideas inspired thousands of young people, from all parts of society, to get involved in activities that most had never contemplated. Comparable organizations in the English-speaking world are the Boys&#x27; Brigade and the non-militaristic Woodcraft Folk; however, they never matched the development and growth of Scouting.

Aspects of Scouting practice have been criticized as too militaristic. 

Local influences have also been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting has been able to find acceptance in a wide variety of cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant focus in the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell&#x27;s personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.

The name &quot;Scouting&quot; seems to have been inspired by the important and romantic role played by military scouts performing reconnaissance in the wars of the time. In fact, Baden-Powell wrote his original military training book, &quot;Aids To Scouting&quot;, because he saw the need for the improved training of British military-enlisted scouts, particularly in initiative, self-reliance, and observational skills. The book&#x27;s popularity with young boys surprised him. As he adapted the book as &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot;, it seems natural that the movement adopted the names &quot;Scouting&quot; and &quot;Boy Scouts.&quot;

&quot;Duty to God&quot; is a principle of Scouting, though it is applied differently in various countries. The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) take a strong position, excluding atheists. The Scout Association in the United Kingdom permits variations to its Promise, in order to accommodate different religious obligations. While for example in the predominantly atheist Czech Republic the Scout oath does not mention God altogether with the organization being strictly irreligious, in 2014, United Kingdom Scouts were given the choice of being able to make a variation of the Promise that replaced &quot;duty to God&quot; with &quot;uphold our Scout values&quot;, Scouts Canada defines Duty to God broadly in terms of &quot;adherence to spiritual principles&quot; and leaves it to the individual member or leader whether they can follow a Scout Promise that includes Duty to God. Worldwide, roughly one in three Scouts are Muslim.

==Movement characteristics==
Scouting is taught using the Scout method, which incorporates an informal educational system that emphasizes practical activities in the outdoors. Programs exist for Scouts ranging in age from 6 to 25 (though age limits vary slightly by country), and program specifics target Scouts in a manner appropriate to their age.

===Scout method===
The Scout method is the principal method by which the Scouting organizations, boy and girl, operate their units. WOSM describes Scouting as &quot;a voluntary nonpolitical educational movement for young people open to all without distinction of origin, race or creed, in accordance with the purpose, principles and method conceived by the Founder&quot;. It is the goal of Scouting &quot;to contribute to the development of young people in achieving their full physical, intellectual, social and spiritual potentials as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members of their local, national and international communities.&quot;

The principles of Scouting describe a code of behavior for all members, and characterize the movement. The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals, comprising seven elements: law and promise, learning by doing, team system, symbolic framework, personal progression, nature, and adult support. While community service is a major element of both the WOSM and WAGGGS programs, WAGGGS includes it as an extra element of the Scout method: service in the community.

The Scout Law and Promise embody the joint values of the Scouting movement worldwide, and bind all Scouting associations together. The emphasis on &quot;learning by doing&quot; provides experiences and hands-on orientation as a practical method of learning and building self-confidence. Small groups build unity, camaraderie, and a close-knit fraternal atmosphere. These experiences, along with an emphasis on trustworthiness and personal honor, help to develop responsibility, character, self-reliance, self-confidence, reliability, and readiness; which eventually lead to collaboration and leadership. A program with a variety of progressive and attractive activities expands a Scout&#x27;s horizon and bonds the Scout even more to the group. Activities and games provide an enjoyable way to develop skills such as dexterity. In an outdoor setting, they also provide contact with the natural environment.

Since the birth of Scouting, Scouts worldwide have taken a Scout Promise to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribe to the Scout Law. The form of the promise and laws have varied slightly by country and over time, but must fulfil the requirements of the WOSM to qualify a National Scout Association for membership.

The Scout Motto, &quot;Be Prepared&quot;, has been used in various languages by millions of Scouts since 1907. Less well-known is the Scout Slogan, &quot;Do a good turn daily&quot;.

Common ways to implement the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing &quot;good citizenship&quot; and decision-making by young people in an age-appropriate manner. Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities is a key element. Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.

Camping is most often arranged at the unit level, such as one Scout troop, but there are periodic camps (known in the US as &quot;camporees&quot;) and &quot;jamborees&quot;. Camps occur a few times a year and may involve several groups from a local area or region camping together for a weekend. The events usually have a theme, such as pioneering. World Scout Moots are gatherings, originally for Rover Scouts, but mainly focused on Scout Leaders. Jamborees are large national or international events held every four years, during which thousands of Scouts camp together for one or two weeks. Activities at these events will include games, Scoutcraft competitions, badge, pin or patch trading, aquatics, woodcarving, archery and activities related to the theme of the event.
In some countries a highlight of the year for Scouts is spending at least a week in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, caving, and fishing.

At an international level Scouting perceives one of its roles as the promotion of international harmony and peace. Various initiatives are in train towards achieving this aim including the development of activities that benefit the wider community, challenge prejudice and encourage tolerance of diversity. Such programs include co-operation with non-Scouting organisations including various NGOs, the United Nations and religious institutions as set out in &quot;The Marrakech Charter&quot;.

===Uniforms and distinctive insignia===


The Scout uniform is a widely recognized characteristic of Scouting. In the words of Baden-Powell at the 1937 World Jamboree, it &quot;hides all differences of social standing in a country and makes for equality; but, more important still, it covers differences of country and race and creed, and makes all feel that they are members with one another of the one great brotherhood&quot;. The original uniform, still widely recognized, consisted of a khaki button-up shirt, shorts, and a broad-brimmed campaign hat. Baden-Powell also wore shorts, because he believed that being dressed like a Scout helped to reduce the age-imposed distance between adult and youth. Uniform shirts are now frequently blue, orange, red or green and shorts are frequently replaced by long trousers all year or only under cold weather.

While designed for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams to make them ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders&#x27; Wood Badges could be used as emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.

Distinctive insignia for all are Scout uniforms, recognized and worn the world over, include the Wood Badge and the World Membership Badge. Scouting has two internationally known symbols: the trefoil is used by members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) and the fleur-de-lis by member organizations of the WOSM and most other Scouting organizations.

The swastika was used as an early symbol by the Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom and others. Its earliest use in Scouting was on the Thanks Badge introduced in 1911. Lord Baden-Powell&#x27;s 1922 design for the Medal of Merit added a swastika to the Scout Arrowhead to symbolize good luck for the recipient. In 1934, Scouters requested a change to the design because of the connection of the swastika with its more recent use by the German National Socialist Workers (Nazi) Party. A new Medal of Merit was issued by the Boy Scouts Association in 1935.

==Age groups and sections==

Scouting and Guiding movements are generally divided into sections by age or school grade, allowing activities to be tailored to the maturity of the group&#x27;s members. These age divisions have varied over time as they adapt to the local culture and environment.

Scouting was originally developed for adolescents—youths between the ages of 11 and 17. In most member organizations, this age group composes the Scout or Guide section. Programs were developed to meet the needs of young children (generally ages 6 to 10) and young adults (originally 18 and older, and later up to 25). Scouts and Guides were later split into &quot;junior&quot; and &quot;senior&quot; sections in many member organizations, and some organizations dropped the young adults&#x27; section. The exact age ranges for programs vary by country and association.
The national programs for younger children include Lion Scouts, Tiger Scouts, Wolf Scouts, Bear Scouts, Webelos Scouts, Arrow of the Light Scouts, Cub Scouts, Brownies, Daisies, Rainbow Guides, Beaver Scouts, Joey Scouts, Keas, and Teddies. Programs for post-adolescents and young adults include the Rangers and Young Leaders, Rover Scouts, Senior Scouts, Venturer Scouts, Explorer Scouts, and the Scout Network. Many organizations also have a program for members with special needs. This is usually known as Extension Scouting, but sometimes has other names, such as Scoutlink. The Scout Method has been adapted to specific programs such as Air Scouts, Sea Scouts, Rider Guides and Scoutingbands.

In many countries, Scouting is organized into neighborhood Scout Groups, or Districts, which contain one or more sections. Under the umbrella of the Scout Group, sections are divided according to age, each having their own terminology and leadership structure.

==Adults and leadership==

Adults interested in Scouting or Guiding, including former Scouts and Guides, often join organizations such as the International Scout and Guide Fellowship. In the United States and the Philippines, university students might join the co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega. In the United Kingdom, university students might join the Student Scout and Guide Organisation, and after graduation, the Scout and Guide Graduate Association. In some countries, it is possible to join scouting and guiding organizations as a show of support without accepting an active volunteering position, one option being joining a group specifically for adults, such as ScoutLink or a Trefoil Guild.

Scout units are usually operated by adult volunteers, such as parents and carers, former Scouts, students, and community leaders, including teachers and religious leaders. Scout Leadership positions are often divided into &#x27;uniform&#x27; and &#x27;lay&#x27; positions. Uniformed leaders have received formal training, such as the Wood Badge, and have received a warrant for a rank within the organization. Lay members commonly hold part-time roles such as meeting helpers, committee members and advisors, though there are a small number of full-time lay professionals.

A unit has uniformed positions—such as the Scoutmaster and assistants—whose titles vary among countries. In some countries, units are supported by lay members, who range from acting as meeting helpers to being members of the unit&#x27;s committee. In some Scout associations, the committee members may also wear uniforms and be registered Scout leaders.

Above the unit are further uniformed positions, called Commissioners, at levels such as district, county, council or province, depending on the structure of the national organization. Commissioners work with lay teams and professionals. Training teams and related functions are often formed at these levels. In the UK and in other countries, the national Scout organization appoints the Chief Scout, the most senior uniformed member.

==Around the world==

Following its foundation in the United Kingdom, Scouting spread around the globe. The first association outside the British Empire was founded in Chile on May 21, 1909, after a visit by Baden Powell. In most countries of the world, there is now at least one Scouting (or Guiding) organization. Each is independent, but international cooperation continues to be seen as part of the Scout Movement. In 1922 the WOSM started as the governing body on policy for the national Scouting organizations (then male only). In addition to being the governing policy body, it organizes the World Scout Jamboree every four years.

In 1928 the WAGGGS started as the equivalent to WOSM for the then female-only national Scouting/Guiding organizations. It is also responsible for its four international centres: Our Cabaña in Mexico, Our Chalet in Switzerland, Pax Lodge in the United Kingdom, and Sangam in India.

Today at the international level, the two largest umbrella organizations are:
* World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), for boys-only and co-educational organizations.
* World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), primarily for girls-only organizations but also accepting co-educational organizations.

===Co-educational===

There have been different approaches to co-educational Scouting. Some countries have maintained separate Scouting organizations for boys and girls, In other countries, especially within Europe, Scouting and Guiding have merged, and there is a single organization for boys and girls, which is a member of both the WOSM and the WAGGGS. The United States–based Boy Scouts of America permitted girls to join in early 2018. In others, such as Australia and the United Kingdom, the national Scout association has opted to admit both boys and girls, but is only a member of the WOSM, while the national Guide association has remained as a separate movement and member of the WAGGGS. In some countries like Greece, Slovenia and Spain there are separate associations of Scouts (members of WOSM) and guides (members of WAGGGS), both admitting boys and girls.

The Scout Association in the United Kingdom has been co-educational at all levels since 1991, and this was optional for groups until the year 2000 when new sections were required to accept girls. The Scout Association transitioned all Scout groups and sections across the UK to become co-educational by January 2007, the year of Scouting&#x27;s centenary. The traditional Baden-Powell Scouts&#x27; Association has been co-educational since its formation in 1970.

In the United States, the Cub Scout and Boy Scout programs of the BSA were for boys only until 2018; it has changed its policies and is now inviting girls to join, as local packs organize all-girl dens (same uniform, same book, same activities). For youths age 14 and older, Venturing has been co-educational since the 1930s. The Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) is an independent organization founded in 1912 for girls and young women only. Adult leadership positions in the BSA and GSUSA are open to both men and women.

In 2006, of the 155 WOSM member National Scout Organizations (representing 155 countries), 122 belonged only to WOSM, and 34 belonged to both WOSM and WAGGGS. Of the 122 which belonged only to WOSM, 95 were open to boys and girls in some or all program sections, and 20 were only for boys. All 34 that belonged to both WOSM and WAGGGS were open to boys and girls.

WAGGGS had 144 Member Organizations in 2007 and 110 of them belonged only to WAGGGS. Of these 110, 17 were coeducational and 93 admitted only girls.

===Membership===
As of 2019, there are over 46 million registered Scouts and as of 2020 9 million registered Guides around the world, from 216 countries and territories.


===Nonaligned and Scout-like organizations===
Fifteen years passed between the first publication of &quot;Scouting for Boys&quot; and the creation of the current largest supranational Scout organization, WOSM, and millions of copies had been sold in dozens of languages. By that point, Scouting was the purview of the world&#x27;s youth, and several Scout associations had already formed in many countries.

Alternative groups have formed since the original formation of the Scouting &quot;Boy Patrols&quot;. They can be a result of groups or individuals who maintain that the WOSM and WAGGGS are more political and less youth-based than envisioned by Lord Baden-Powell. They believe that Scouting in general has moved away from its original intent because of political machinations that happen to longstanding organizations, and want to return to the earliest, simplest methods. Others do not want to follow all the original ideals of Scouting but still desire to participate in Scout-like activities.

In 2008, there were at least 539 independent Scouting organizations around the world, 367 of them were a member of either WAGGGS or WOSM. About half of the remaining 172 Scouting organizations are only local or national oriented. About 90 national or regional Scouting associations have created their own international Scouting organizations. Those are served by five international Scouting organizations:
* Order of World Scouts, the first international Scouting organisation, founded in 1911.
* International Union of Guides and Scouts of Europe, an independent faith-based Scouting organization founded in 1956.
* Confederation of European Scouts, established in 1978.
* World Federation of Independent Scouts, formed in Laubach, Germany, in 1996.
* World Organization of Independent Scouts, mostly South-American, founded in 2010.

Some Scout-like organizations are also served by international organizations, many with religious elements, for example:
* Pathfinders – A youth organization of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, formed in 1950.
* Royal Rangers – A youth organization of the Assemblies of God, formed in 1962.

==Influence on society==
After the inception of Scouting in the early 1900s, some nations&#x27; programs have taken part in social movements such as the nationalist resistance movements in India. Although Scouting was introduced to Africa by British officials as a way to strengthen their rule, the values they based Scouting on helped to challenge the legitimacy of British imperialism. Likewise, African Scouts used the Scout Law&#x27;s principle that a Scout is a brother to all other Scouts to collectively claim full imperial citizenship.

==Controversies==
In the United Kingdom, The Scout Association had been criticised for its insistence on the use of a religious promise, leading the organization to introduce an alternative in January 2014 for those not wanting to mention a god in their promise. This change made the organisation entirely non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, gender, sexuality, and religion (or lack thereof).

The Boy Scouts of America was the focus of criticism in the United States for not allowing the open participation of homosexuals until removing the prohibition in 2013.

Communist states such as the Soviet Union in 1920 and fascist regimes like Nazi Germany in 1934 often either absorbed the Scout movement into government-controlled organizations, or banned Scouting entirely.

==In film and the arts==
Scouting has been a facet of culture during most of the twentieth century in many countries; numerous films and artwork focus on the subject. Movie critic Roger Ebert mentioned the scene in which the young Boy Scout, Indiana Jones, discovers the Cross of Coronado in the movie &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, as &quot;when he discovers his life mission&quot;.

The works of painters Ernest Stafford Carlos, Norman Rockwell, Pierre Joubert and Joseph Csatari and the 1966 film &quot;Follow Me, Boys!&quot; are prime examples of this ethos. Scouting is often dealt with in a humorous manner, as in the 1989 film &quot;Troop Beverly Hills&quot;, the 2005 film &quot;Down and Derby&quot;, and the film &quot;&quot;. In 1980, Scottish singer and songwriter Gerry Rafferty recorded &quot;I was a Boy Scout&quot; as part of his &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot; album.

<text>Sociobiology is a field of biology that aims to explain social behavior in terms of evolution. It draws from disciplines including psychology, ethology, anthropology, evolution, zoology, archaeology, and population genetics. Within the study of human societies, sociobiology is closely allied to evolutionary anthropology, human behavioral ecology, evolutionary psychology, and sociology.

Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of social insects. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.

While the term &quot;sociobiology&quot; originated at least as early as the 1940s; the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of E. O. Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of controversy. Critics, led by Richard Lewontin and Stephen Jay Gould, argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as aggressiveness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between nature and nurture. Among sociobiologists, the controversy between laying weight to different levels of selection was settled between D.S. Wilson and E.O. Wilson in 2007.

==Definition==

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as &quot;the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization&quot;.

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by natural selection. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one&#x27;s genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be inherited from generation to generation.

For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This behavior is adaptive because killing the cubs eliminates competition for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.

==History==
The philosopher of biology Daniel Dennett suggested that the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes was the first proto-sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book &quot;Leviathan&quot; Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.

The geneticist of animal behavior John Paul Scott coined the word &quot;sociobiology&quot; at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behavior, which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research. With John Paul Scott&#x27;s organizational efforts, a &quot;Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology&quot; of the Ecological Society of America was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, E. O. Wilson came in contact with this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a &quot;sociobiologist&quot; at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.
Wilson&#x27;s sociobiology is different from John Paul Scott&#x27;s or Altmann&#x27;s, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximization of the genetic fitness by W. D. Hamilton, Robert Trivers, John Maynard Smith, and George R. Price. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when &quot;biology in the field&quot; was threatened to be made old-fashioned by &quot;modern&quot; practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).

Once a specialist term, &quot;sociobiology&quot; became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book &quot;Sociobiology: The New Synthesis&quot;, which sparked an intense controversy. Since then &quot;sociobiology&quot; has largely been equated with Wilson&#x27;s vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as altruism, aggression, and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson&#x27;s own research specialty) and other Hymenoptera, but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. Peter Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot;, written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a Pulitzer Prize winning book, &quot;On Human Nature&quot;, that addressed human behavior specifically.

Edward H. Hagen writes in &quot;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology&quot; that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, &quot;one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century.&quot; &quot;Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists.
&quot; Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world&#x27;s top scientific journals such as &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Science&quot;. The more general term behavioral ecology is commonly substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.

== Theory ==

Sociobiologists maintain that human behavior, as well as nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.

Natural selection is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism&#x27;s ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be &quot;selected for&quot;. Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an organism a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman animal species has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it has become a foundation of evolutionary biology. However, there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore, these traits were probably &quot;adaptive&quot; in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses Nikolaas Tinbergen&#x27;s four categories of questions and explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called &quot;ultimate explanations&quot;) are
* the function (i.e., adaptation) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e., phylogeny) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called &quot;proximate explanations&quot;) are
* the development of the individual (i.e., ontogeny) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g., brain anatomy and hormones).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in instinctive, or intuitive behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of mammals – including humans – are very protective of their offspring. Sociobiologists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral adaptations, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.

Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon groups. The mechanisms responsible for group selection employ paradigms and population statistics borrowed from evolutionary game theory. Altruism is defined as &quot;a concern for the welfare of others&quot;. If altruism is genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children.

Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological hypothesis by finding an evolutionarily stable strategy that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy, and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between social insects and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist, in some animals has been correlated to the degree of genome shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of infanticide by male harem-mating animals when the alpha male is displaced as well as rodent female infanticide and fetal resorption are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the food and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an ecological balance. Just as an expansion of a sheep population might encourage the expansion of a wolf population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and IQ have high heritability. The researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits.

Various theorists have argued that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive. The evolutionary neuroandrogenic (ENA) theory, by sociologist/criminologist Lee Ellis, posits that female sexual selection has led to increased competitive behavior among men, sometimes resulting in criminality. In another theory, Mark van Vugt argues that a history of intergroup conflict for resources between men have led to differences in violence and aggression between men and women. The novelist Elias Canetti also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.

==Support for premise==
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behavior. For example, the transcription factor FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the serotonergic system in the brain, is required for normal aggressive and anxiety-like behavior. Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behavior. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal behavior in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.

A genetic basis for instinctive behavioral traits among non-human species, such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists; however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviors in human societies has remained extremely controversial.

==Reception==

Steven Pinker argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of biological determinism, accusing among others Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin of being &quot;radical scientists&quot;, whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science, while Lewontin, Steven Rose and Leon Kamin, who drew a distinction between the politics and history of an idea and its scientific validity, argue that sociobiology fails on scientific grounds. Gould grouped sociobiology with eugenics, criticizing both in his book &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot;. When Napoleon Chagnon scheduled sessions on sociobiology at the 1976 American Anthropological Association convention, other scholars attempted to cancel them with what Chagnon later described as &quot;Impassioned accusations of racism, fascism and Nazism&quot;; Margaret Mead&#x27;s support caused the sessions to occur as scheduled.

Noam Chomsky has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the Sociobiology Study Group, as reported by Ullica Segerstråle, Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature. Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the &quot;blank slate&quot; doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker&#x27;s and others&#x27; work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 &quot;Reflections on Language&quot;. Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of Peter Kropotkin&#x27;s &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot;, which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what &quot;ought&quot; to be, only what &quot;is&quot; the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from &quot;is&quot; to &quot;ought&quot;, an instance of the naturalistic fallacy. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered anti-social, such as ethnic nepotism, is based on moral assumptions, meaning that such opposition is not falsifiable by scientific advances. The history of this debate, and others related to it, are covered in detail by , , and .

More formally, #P is the class of function problems of the form &quot;compute &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;, where &quot;f&quot; is the number of accepting paths of a nondeterministic Turing machine running in polynomial time. Unlike most well-known complexity classes, it is not a class of decision problems but a class of function problems. The most difficult, representative problems of this class are #P-complete.

==Relation to decision problems==
An NP decision problem is often of the form &quot;Are there any solutions that satisfy certain constraints?&quot; For example:
* Are there any subsets of a list of integers that add up to zero? (subset sum problem)
* Are there any Hamiltonian cycles in a given graph with cost less than 100? (traveling salesman problem)
* Are there any variable assignments that satisfy a given CNF (conjunctive normal form) formula? (Boolean satisfiability problem or SAT)
* Does a univariate real polynomial have any positive roots? (Root finding)

The corresponding #P function problems ask &quot;how many&quot; rather than &quot;are there any&quot;. For example:
* How many subsets of a list of integers add up to zero?
* How many Hamiltonian cycles in a given graph have cost less than 100?
* How many variable assignments satisfy a given CNF formula?
* How many roots of a univariate real polynomial are positive?

==Related complexity classes==
Clearly, a #P problem must be at least as hard as the corresponding NP problem. If it&#x27;s easy to count answers, then it must be easy to tell whether there are any answers—just count them and see whether the count is greater than zero. Some of these problems, such as root finding, are easy enough to be in FP, while others are #P-complete.

One consequence of Toda&#x27;s theorem is that a polynomial-time machine with a #P oracle (P#P) can solve all problems in PH, the entire polynomial hierarchy. In fact, the polynomial-time machine only needs to make one #P query to solve any problem in PH. This is an indication of the extreme difficulty of solving #P-complete problems exactly.

Surprisingly, some #P problems that are believed to be difficult correspond to easy (for example linear-time) P problems. For more information on this, see #P-complete.

The closest decision problem class to #P is PP, which asks whether a majority (more than half) of the computation paths accept. This finds the most significant bit in the #P problem answer. The decision problem class ⊕P (pronounced &quot;Parity-P&quot;) instead asks for the least significant bit of the #P answer.

==Formal definitions==
#P is formally defined as follows:
: #P is the set of all functions formula_1 such that there is a polynomial time nondeterministic Turing machine formula_2 such that for all formula_3, formula_4 equals the number of accepting branches in formula_2&#x27;s computation graph on formula_6. 

#P can also be equivalently defined in terms of a verifer. A decision problem is in NP if there exists a polynomial-time checkable certificate to a given problem instance—that is, NP asks whether there exists a proof of membership for the input that can be checked for correctness in polynomial time. The class #P asks &quot;how many&quot; certificates there exist for a problem instance that can be checked for correctness in polynomial time. In this context, #P is defined as follows:
: #P is the set of functions formula_7 such that there exists a polynomial formula_8 and a polynomial-time deterministic Turing machine formula_9, called the verifier, such that for every formula_3, formula_11. (In other words, formula_4 equals the size of the set containing all of the polynomial-size certificates).

==History==
The complexity class #P was first defined by Leslie Valiant in a 1979 article on the computation of the permanent of a square matrix, in which he proved that permanent is #P-complete.

Larry Stockmeyer has proved that for every #P problem formula_13 there exists a randomized algorithm using an oracle for SAT, which given an instance formula_14 of formula_13 and formula_16 returns with high probability a number formula_6 such that formula_18. The runtime of the algorithm is polynomial in formula_14 and formula_20. The algorithm is based on the leftover hash lemma.

<text>The #P-complete problems (pronounced &quot;sharp P complete&quot; or &quot;number P complete&quot;) form a complexity class in computational complexity theory. The problems in this complexity class are defined by having the following two properties:
*The problem is in #P, the class of problems that can be defined as counting the number of accepting paths of a polynomial-time non-deterministic Turing machine.

*The problem is #P-hard, meaning that every other problem in #P has a Turing reduction or polynomial-time counting reduction to it. A counting reduction is a pair of polynomial-time transformations from inputs of the other problem to inputs of the given problem and from outputs of the given problem to outputs of the other problem, allowing the other problem to be solved using any subroutine for the given problem. A Turing reduction is an algorithm for the other problem that makes a polynomial number of calls to a subroutine for the given problem and, outside of those calls, uses polynomial time. In some cases parsimonious reductions, a more specific type of reduction that preserves the exact number of solutions, are used.

#P-complete problems are at least as hard as NP-complete problems. A polynomial-time algorithm for solving a #P-complete problem, if it existed, would solve the P versus NP problem by implying that P and NP are equal. No such algorithm is known, nor is a proof known that such an algorithm does not exist.

==Examples==
Examples of #P-complete problems include:
* How many different variable assignments will satisfy a given general Boolean formula? (#SAT)
* How many different variable assignments will satisfy a given DNF formula?
* How many different variable assignments will satisfy a given 2-satisfiability problem?
* How many perfect matchings are there for a given bipartite graph?
* What is the value of the permanent of a given matrix whose entries are 0 or 1? (See #P-completeness of 01-permanent.)
* How many graph colorings using &quot;k&quot; colors are there for a particular graph &quot;G&quot;?
* How many different linear extensions are there for a given partially ordered set, or, equivalently, how many different topological orderings are there for a given directed acyclic graph?

These are all necessarily members of the class #P as well. As a non-example, consider the case of counting solutions to a 1-satisfiability problem: a series of variables that are each individually constrained, but have no relationships with each other. The solutions can be efficiently counted, by multiplying the number of options for each variable in isolation. Thus, this problem is in #P, but cannot be #P-complete unless #P=FP. This would be surprising, as it would imply that P=NP=PH.

== Easy problems with hard counting versions ==

Some #P-complete problems correspond to easy (polynomial time) problems. Determining the satisfiability of a Boolean formula in disjunctive normal form is easy: such a formula is satisfiable if and only if it contains a satisfiable conjunction (one that does not contain a variable and its negation), whereas counting the number of satisfying assignments is #P-complete. Furthermore, deciding 2-satisfiability is easy compared to counting the number of satisfying assignments. Topologically sorting is easy in contrast to counting the number of topological sortings. A single perfect matching can be found in polynomial time, but counting all perfect matchings is #P-complete. The perfect matching counting problem was the first counting problem corresponding to an easy P problem shown to be #P-complete, in a 1979 paper by Leslie Valiant which also defined the class #P and the #P-complete problems for the first time.

== Approximation ==

There are probabilistic algorithms that return good approximations to some #P-complete problems with high probability. This is one of the demonstrations of the power of probabilistic algorithms.

Many #P-complete problems have a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme, or &quot;FPRAS,&quot; which, informally, will produce with high probability an approximation to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, in time that is polynomial with respect to both the size of the problem and the degree of accuracy required. Jerrum, Valiant, and Vazirani showed that every #P-complete problem either has an FPRAS, or is essentially impossible to approximate; if there is any polynomial-time algorithm which consistently produces an approximation of a #P-complete problem which is within a polynomial ratio in the size of the input of the exact answer, then that algorithm can be used to construct an FPRAS.

<doc id="27926" wikidata="Q2472762" url="?curid=27926" title="Saint Piran">
<text>Piran or Pyran (; ), died c. 480, was a 5th-century Cornish abbot and saint, possibly of Irish origin. He is the patron saint of tin-miners, and is also generally regarded as the patron saint of Cornwall, although Michael and Petroc also have some claim to this title.

The consensus of scholarship has identified the &quot;Life&quot; of Piran as a copy of that of the Irish saint Ciarán of Saigir with the names changed. While we cannot be certain of Piran’s origins, it is generally accepted that he was Irish, that he spent time in Wales and later was expelled from Ireland because of his powerful preaching of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Having been thrown into the sea tied to a mill stone, he miraculously arrived on the shores of Cornwall where he built his tiny oratory and continued his work of evangelism, founding communities.

Saint Piran&#x27;s Flag, a white cross on a black background, is the county flag of Cornwall. Saint Piran&#x27;s Day falls on 5 March.

==Life==
Piran is the most famous of all the saints said to have come to Cornwall from Ireland. G. H. Doble thought that Piran was a Welshman from Glamorgan, citing the lost chapel once dedicated to him in Cardiff.

From medieval times, since Brittonic languages and Goidelic languages regularly alternate p and k sounds, he had become erroneously identified with the Irish saint Ciarán of Saigir who founded the monastery at Seir-Kieran in County Offaly.Joseph Loth has argued, on detailed philological grounds, that the names Piran and Ciarán could not possibly refer to the same person.

The fourteenth-century &quot;Life of Saint Piran&quot;, probably written at Exeter Cathedral, is a complete copy of an earlier Middle Irish life of Ciarán of Saighir, with different parentage and a different ending that takes into account Piran&#x27;s works in Cornwall, and especially details of his death and the movements of his Cornish shrine; thus &quot;excising the passages which speak of his burial at Saighir&quot; (Doble).

Professor Nicholas Orme writes in his &quot;Churches of Medieval Exeter&quot;, that &quot;it may well be that Piran was the inspiration for the Kerrian dedication (in Exeter), albeit believed (as Piran usually was) to be identical with Ciarán.&quot; Also, the saint of the church in Exeter was &quot;Keranus&quot; or &quot;Kyeranus&quot; [Queranus] in Latin documents, with &quot;Kerrian&quot; being the local vernacular pronunciation.

The St Piran Trust has undertaken research which suggests that Piran was either Ciarán of Saighir or a disciple, as indicated by James Brennan of Kilkenny and T. F. G. Dexter, whose thesis is held in the Royal Cornwall Museum. 

The Celtic Scholar Charles Plummer suggested that Piran might, instead, be identified with Ciarán of Clonmacnoise, who founded the monastery of Clonmacnoise also in County Offaly, but this is doubtful since this saint is believed to have died of yellow fever at the age of thirty-two and was buried at Clonmacnoise. His father is, however, sometimes said to have been a Cornishman. David Nash Ford accepts the Ciarán of Clonmacnoise identification, whilst further suggesting that Piran&#x27;s father in the Exeter life, Domuel, be identified with Dywel fab Erbin, a fifth-century prince of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall).

5 March is the traditional feast day of both Saint Ciarán of Saighir and Saint Piran. However the Calendar of Launceston Church records an alternative date of 18 November for the latter. In Perranzabuloe parish Perran Feast is traditionally celebrated on the last Monday in October. On the previous Sunday there are services at the site of St Piran&#x27;s Oratory and in the parish church of St Piran.

==Legends==

* The Irish tied him to a mill-stone, rolled it over the edge of a cliff into a stormy sea, which immediately became calm, and the saint floated safely over the water to land upon the sandy beach of Perranzabuloe in Cornwall. His first disciples are said to have been a badger, a fox, and a bear
* He landed in Cornwall, and there established himself as a hermit. His sanctity and his austerity won for him the veneration of all around, and the gift of miracles, with which he was favoured, brought many to seek his charitable aid.
* He was joined at Perranzabuloe by many of his Christian converts and together they founded the Abbey of Lanpiran, with Piran as abbot.
* Piran &#x27;rediscovered&#x27; tin-smelting (tin had been smelted in Cornwall since before the Romans&#x27; arrival, but the methods had since been lost) when the tin in his black hearthstone, which was evidently a slab of tin-bearing ore, was smelted out of it and rose to the top in the form of a white cross (thus the image on the flag).

==Death and veneration==
Piran was reportedly executed by Theodoric or Tador, King of
Cornwall in 480, about the time of Vortigern (Usher&#x27;s Prim. 869). It is also said that at his death, the remains of the Blessed Martin the Abbot which he had brought from Ireland were buried with him at Perranzabuloe.

His own remains were subsequently exhumed and redistributed to be venerated in various reliquaries. Exeter Cathedral was reputed to be the possessor of one of his arms, while according to an inventory, St Piran&#x27;s Old Church, Perranzabuloe, had a reliquary containing his head and also a hearse in which his body was placed for processionals. In 1443, Cornish nobleman, Sir John Arundell bequeathed money in his will for the preservation of the head of St Piran in the chapel at Perranzabuloe.

The churches at Perranuthnoe and Perranarworthal were dedicated to Piran and holy wells at Perranwell and Probus, Cornwall are named after him. In Brittany St. Peran, Loperan and Saint-Perran are also named after him. The former Methodist chapel at Laity Moor has served as the Orthodox Church of Archangel Michael and Holy Piran since 1996.

The earliest documented link to the design of the St Piran&#x27;s Flag with Piran is on the coat of arms of the &quot;de Saint-Péran&quot; or &quot;Saint-Pezran&quot; (pronounced &quot;Péran&quot;) family from Cornouaille in Brittany. The earliest evidence known comes from the 15th century, with the arms being &quot;De sable à la croix pattée d&#x27;argent.&quot; (a black shield with a white cross pattée).

Mount St. Piran is a mountain in Banff National Park near Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada, named after the saint. St Piran&#x27;s crab, &quot;Clibanarius erythropus&quot;, was also named in his honour, in 2016.

===St Piran&#x27;s Day===
St Piran&#x27;s Day on 5 March is popular in Cornwall and the term &#x27;Perrantide&#x27; has been coined to describe the week prior to this day. Many Cornish-themed events occur in the Duchy and also in areas in which there is a large community descended from Cornish emigrants. The village of Perranporth (&#x27;Porthpyran&#x27; in Cornish) hosts the annual inter-Celtic festival of , which is also named in honour of him.

One St Piran&#x27;s Day event is the march across the dunes to St Piran&#x27;s cross which hundreds of people attend, generally dressed in black, white and gold, and carrying the Cornish Flag. A play of the Life of St Piran, in Cornish, has been enacted since 2000 at the event. Daffodils are also carried and placed at the cross. Daffodils also feature in celebrations in Truro, most likely due to their &#x27;gold&#x27; colour. Black, white and gold are colours associated with Cornwall due to St Piran&#x27;s Flag (black and white), and the Duchy Shield (gold coins on black).

In 2006 Cornish MP Dan Rogerson asked the government to make 5 March a public holiday in Cornwall to recognise celebrations for St Piran&#x27;s Day.
In 2010, a short movie about St. Piran was made and premiered at the Heartland Film Festival.

<text>Scrabble is a word game in which two to four players score points by placing tiles, each bearing a single letter, onto a game board divided into a 15×15 grid of squares. The tiles must form words that, in crossword fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns and are included in a standard dictionary or lexicon.

American architect Alfred Mosher Butts invented the game in 1931. &quot;Scrabble&quot; is produced in the United States and Canada by Hasbro, under the brands of both of its subsidiaries, Milton Bradley and Parker Brothers. Mattel owns the rights to manufacture &quot;Scrabble&quot; outside the U.S. and Canada. As of 2008, the game is sold in 121 countries and is available in more than 30 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide, and roughly one-third of American homes and half of British homes have a &quot;Scrabble&quot; set. There are approximately 4,000 &quot;Scrabble&quot; clubs around the world.

==Equipment==

Scrabble is played on a 15x15 board, containing 225 squares. Certain squares are premium squares, which multiply the number of points awarded: eight dark red &quot;triple word&quot; squares, 17 pale red &quot;double word&quot; squares, of which one, the center square (H8), is marked with a star or other symbol, 12 dark blue &quot;triple letter&quot; squares, and 24 pale blue &quot;double letter&quot; squares. In 2008, Hasbro changed the colors of the premium squares to orange for TW, red for DW, blue for DL, and green for TL, but the original premium square color scheme is still preferred for &quot;Scrabble&quot; boards used in tournaments.

An English-language set contains 100 tiles, 98 of which are marked with a letter and a point value between 1 and 10. Each tile&#x27;s point value is based on its frequency in English, with vowels and common letters such as L, N, R, S, and T worth 1 point, and rare letters such as Q and Z worth 10 points. The remaining two tiles are blank and carry no value. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values. Tiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are square and thick, slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Each player uses a rack that conceals their tiles from other players.

==History==

In 1931 in Poughkeepsie, New York, the American architect Alfred Mosher Butts created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented, called &quot;Lexiko&quot;. The two games had the same set of letter tiles, whose distributions and point values Butts worked out by performing a frequency analysis of letters from various sources, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The new game, which he called &quot;Criss-Crosswords&quot;, added the 15×15 gameboard and the crossword-style gameplay. He manufactured a few sets himself but was not successful in selling the game to any major game manufacturers of the day.

In 1948, James Brunot, a resident of Newtown, Connecticut, and one of the few owners of the original &quot;Criss-Crosswords&quot; game, bought the rights to manufacture the game in exchange for granting Butts a royalty on every unit sold. Although he left most of the game (including the distribution of letters) unchanged, Brunot slightly rearranged the &quot;premium&quot; squares of the board and simplified the rules; he also renamed the game &quot;Scrabble&quot;, a real word that means &quot;scratch frantically&quot;. In 1949, Brunot and his family made sets in a converted former schoolhouse in Dodgingtown, Connecticut, a section of Newtown. They made 2,400 sets that year but lost money. 

In 1952, unable to meet demand himself, Brunot licensed the manufacturing rights to Long Island-based Selchow and Righter, one of the manufacturers that, like Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley Company, had previously rejected the game. &quot;It&#x27;s a nice little game. It will sell well in bookstores,&quot; Selchow and Righter president Harriet T. Righter remembered saying about Scrabble when she first saw it. In its second year as a Selchow and Righter product, 1954, nearly four million sets were sold. Selchow and Righter then bought the trademark to the game in 1972.

Meanwhile, JW Spear acquired the rights to sell the game in Australia and the UK on January 19, 1955. In 1986, Selchow and Righter was sold to Coleco, which soon afterward went bankrupt. Hasbro then purchased Coleco&#x27;s assets in 1989, including &quot;Scrabble&quot; and &quot;Parcheesi&quot;. Mattel then acquired JW Spear in 1994. Since then, Hasbro has owned the rights to manufacture &quot;Scrabble&quot; in the U.S. and Canada, and Mattel has held the rights to manufacture the game in other parts of the world.

In 1984, &quot;Scrabble&quot; was turned into a daytime game show on NBC. The &quot;Scrabble&quot; game show ran from July 1984 to March 1990, with a second run from January to June 1993. The show was hosted by Chuck Woolery. Its tagline in promotional broadcasts was, &quot;Every man dies; not every man truly Scrabbles.&quot; In 2011, a new TV variation of &quot;Scrabble&quot;, called &quot;Scrabble Showdown&quot;, aired on The Hub cable channel, which is a joint venture of Discovery Communications, Inc. and Hasbro.

&quot;Scrabble&quot; was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2004.

===Evolution of the rules===
The &quot;box rules&quot; included in each copy of the North American edition have been edited four times: in 1953, 1976, 1989, and 1999.

The major changes in 1953 were as follows.
* It was made clear that:
** words could be played through single letters already on the board,
** a player could play a word parallel and immediately adjacent to an existing word provided all crossing words formed were valid,
** the effect of two premium squares was to be compounded multiplicatively.
* The previously unspecified penalty for having one&#x27;s play successfully challenged was stated: withdrawal of tiles and loss of turn.

The major changes in 1976 were as follows.
* It was made clear that the blank tile beats an A when drawing to see who goes first.
* A player could pass their turn, doing nothing.
* A loss-of-turn penalty was added for challenging an acceptable play.
* If final scores are tied, the player whose score was highest before adjusting for unplayed tiles is the winner; in tournament play, a tie is counted as half a win for both players.

The editorial changes made in 1989 did not affect gameplay.

The major changes in 1999 were as follows.
* It was made clear that:
** a tile can be shifted or replaced until the play has been scored,
** a challenge applies to all the words made in the given play.
* Playing all seven tiles is officially called a &quot;bingo&quot; in North America and a &quot;bonus&quot; elsewhere.
* A change in the wording of the rules could have been interpreted as meaning that a player may form more than one word on one row on a single turn.

==Rules==
Before the game, a word list or dictionary is selected in order to adjudicate any challenges during the game. In tournament play, the word list is specified in advance, typically the NASPA Word List, the &quot;Official Scrabble Players Dictionary&quot;, or Collins Scrabble Words. All 100 tiles are placed into an opaque bag. One player is selected to go first; a commonly used method is for each player to draw one tile from the bag, and whoever draws a letter alphabetically closest to A goes first (blanks supersede A). Each player then draws seven tiles and places them on their rack, hidden from other players.
===Gameplay===
On every turn, the player at turn can perform one of the following options:
* Pass, forfeiting the turn and scoring zero.
* Exchange one or more tiles for an equal number from the bag, scoring zero. This can only be done if 7 or more tiles remain in the bag.
* Play at least one tile on the board, adding the value of all words formed to the player&#x27;s cumulative score.

The first play of the game must consist of at least two tiles and cover the center square (H8). Any play thereafter must use at least one of the player&#x27;s tiles to form a &quot;main word&quot; (containing all of the player&#x27;s played tiles in a straight line) reading left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Diagonal plays are not allowed. At least one tile must be adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to a tile already on the board. If the play includes a blank tile, the player must designate the letter the blank represents; that letter remains unchanged for the rest of the game unless the play is challenged off. The player announces the score for that play, and then draws tiles from the bag equal to the number of tiles played, so that there are seven tiles on their rack. If there are not enough tiles, the player draws any remaining tiles instead. If the game is played using a clock, the player starts the opponent&#x27;s clock after announcing the score and before drawing tiles. Players may keep track of tiles played during the game.

If a player has made a play and not yet drawn a tile, any other player may choose to challenge any or all words formed by the play. The challenged word(s) are then searched in the agreed-upon word list or dictionary. If at least one challenged word is unacceptable, the play is removed from the board, and the player scores zero for that turn. If all challenged words are acceptable, the challenger loses their turn. In tournament play, players are not entitled to know which word(s) are invalid or the definitions of any challenged words. Penalties for unsuccessfully challenging an acceptable play vary in club and tournament play and are described in greater detail below.

====End of game====
The game ends when either:
* One player has played every tile on their rack (&quot;playing out&quot;) and no tiles remain in the bag (regardless of the tiles on the opponent&#x27;s rack).
* At least six successive scoreless turns have occurred and either player decides to end the game. This typically occurs at the end of the game when neither player can form a valid play. (For several years, a game could not end with a cumulative score of 0–0, but that is no longer the case, and such games have since occurred a number of times in tournament play, the winner being the player with the lower total point value on their rack and thus a score less negative than the opponent&#x27;s.)
* In tournament play, when either player exceeds 10 minutes of overtime.

At the end of the game, each player&#x27;s score is reduced by the sum of the values of their unplayed tiles; if a player plays out, the sum of all other players&#x27; unplayed tiles is added to that player&#x27;s score. This rule differs slightly in most tournaments; a player who plays out adds twice this sum, and the opponent&#x27;s score is unchanged.

===Scoring===
The score for a play is determined as follows:
* The value of each tile is indicated with a point value (between 1 and 10, with blanks worth zero points), and the score of every new word formed is equal to the sum of the point values of the letters in that word. If a play covers any premium squares (such as DLS or TWS squares), the point value of the corresponding letter or word is multiplied by 2 or 3 respectively. The center star is also a DWS square.
* Premium squares only apply when newly placed tiles cover them. Any subsequent plays do not count these premium squares. A play that covers a DWS or TWS multiplies the value of the entire word(s) by 2 or 3, including tiles already on the board.
* If a newly placed word covers both letter and word premium squares, the letter premium(s) is/are calculated first, followed by the word premium(s).
* If a player makes a play where the main word covers two DWS squares, the value of that word is doubled, then redoubled (i.e. 4× the word value). Similarly, if the main word covers two TWS squares, the value of that word is tripled, then re-tripled (9× the word value). Such plays are often referred to as &quot;double-doubles&quot; and &quot;triple-triples&quot; respectively.
* If a player plays all seven of their tiles on their turn (known as a &quot;bingo&quot; in North America and as a &quot;bonus&quot; elsewhere), a 50-point bonus is added to the score of the play.

Scoreless turns can occur when a player passes, exchanges tiles, loses a challenge, or otherwise makes an illegal move. A scoreless turn can also occur if a play consists of only blank tiles, but this is extremely unlikely in actual play.

====Scoring example====
See the example board at right. 
Suppose Player 1 plays QUITE 8D, with the Q on a DLS and the E on the center star. Because the center star is a DWS, the score for this play is formula_1 points.

Player 2 extends the play to form the word MES(QUITE) 8A with the M on the TWS at 8A. The score for this play is formula_2 points. The Q is not doubled, as the Q was not played on this turn.

Player 1 plays INFaNCY 9D with a blank A, forming five 2-letter words, QI, UN, IF, TA, and EN. Because several additional words were formed, each new word is scored separately. The score for this play, without the 50-point bonus, is

formula_3 points. Because all 7 tiles were played on this turn, a 50-point bonus is added, and the score for this play is formula_4 points.

Player 2 plays RECO(UN)TS E4 through the word UN. Because this word covers two DWS squares, the score for this word is quadrupled, and the score for the play is formula_5 points. Player 1 is ahead 136–97.

===Acceptable words===

All words of length 2 to 15 letters that appear in the agreed-upon dictionary or lexicon are acceptable words in &quot;Scrabble&quot;, as are all their inflected forms and plurals. Words that contain apostrophes, are hyphenated or capitalized (such as proper nouns) are generally not allowed unless they also appear as acceptable entries; for example, words such as , and , while typically containing an apostrophe or considered a proper noun, have unrelated meanings and are therefore acceptable in major Scrabble lexicons. Acronyms and abbreviations are generally not allowed unless they have separate entries (such as AWOL, RADAR, SCUBA, and WYSIWYG). Variant spellings, slang or offensive terms, archaic or obsolete terms, and specialized jargon words are acceptable if they meet all other criteria for acceptability, but archaic spellings (e.g., NEEDE or MAKETH) are generally not acceptable words. Foreign words are generally not allowed in English-language &quot;Scrabble&quot; unless they have been incorporated into the English language, such as the words QI, KILIM, and PATISSERIE.

Vulgar and offensive words are generally excluded from the &quot;Official Scrabble Players Dictionary&quot; but allowed in club and tournament play. The North American Scrabble Players Association removed slurs from its lexicon in 2020, after conducting a poll of its members. Mattel removed 400 derogatory terms from its official word list in 2021, in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, with the company&#x27;s head of games saying: &quot;Can you imagine any other game where you can score points and win by using a racial epithet? It’s long overdue.&quot; This does not exclude players from playing these words, as it is within the rules of the game to play unacceptable words (at the risk of losing a challenge).

There are two popular competition word lists for English-language Scrabble:
* NASPA Word List (NWL, also known as OTCWL, OWL, or TWL)
* Collins Scrabble Words (CSW, also called &quot;Collins&quot; or &quot;SOWPODS&quot;)
The first predominates in the U.S., Canada, and Thailand, and the second in English Scrabble in the rest of the world. There is also a large community of competitive Collins players in North America, with its own NASPA rating system.

Today&#x27;s NASPA Word List (NWL), published by NASPA Games, descends from the &quot;Official Tournament and Club Word List&quot; (a non-bowdlerized version of the &quot;Official Scrabble Players Dictionary&quot;) and its companion &quot;Long Words List&quot; for longer words. The current version of NWL is NWL2023, effective February 2024, and the &quot;Official Scrabble Players Dictionary&quot;, published by Merriam-Webster, is currently in its seventh edition of 2022. NWL includes all current OSPD words, plus several hundred offensive words and genericized trademarks such as KLEENEX; as of 2020, it no longer includes words judged to be personally applicable offensive slurs.

The NWL and OSPD are compiled using a number of major college-level dictionaries, principally those published by Merriam-Webster. If a word appears, at least historically, in any one of the dictionaries, it is included in the NWL and the OSPD. If the word has only an offensive meaning, it is included only in the NWL. The key difference between the OSPD and the NWL is that the OSPD is marketed for &quot;home and school&quot; use, without words which their source dictionaries judged offensive, rendering the &quot;Official Scrabble Players Dictionary&quot; less fit for official &quot;Scrabble&quot; play. The OSPD is available in bookstores, while the NWL is available only through NASPA.

====&quot;Collins Scrabble Words&quot;====
In all other English-speaking countries, the competition word list is &quot;Collins Scrabble Words&quot; 2021 edition, known as CSW21 (Versions of this lexicon before 2007 were known as SOWPODS). Historically, this list has contained all OTCWL words plus words sourced from the Chambers and Collins English dictionaries, but recent editorial decisions have caused greater discrepancies between CSW and NWL. CSW is commonly used to adjudicate major tournaments outside North America.

Tournaments are also played using CSW in North America, particularly since Hasbro ceased to control tournament play in 2009. NASPA, the Word Game Players Organization, and Collins Coalition (CoCo) all sanction CSW tournaments, using separate Elo rating systems.

===Challenges===

The penalty for a successfully challenged play is nearly universal: the offending player removes the tiles played and forfeits their turn. (In some online games, an option known as &quot;void&quot; may be used, wherein unacceptable words are automatically rejected by the program. The player is then required to make another play, with no penalty applied.)

The penalty for an unsuccessful challenge (where all words challenged in the play are deemed valid) varies considerably, including:

* &quot;Double Challenge&quot;, in which an unsuccessfully challenging player must forfeit the next turn. This penalty governs North American (NASPA-sanctioned) OWL tournament play, and is the standard for North American, Israeli, and Thai clubs. Because loss of a turn generally constitutes the greatest risk for an unsuccessful challenge, it provides the greatest incentive for a player to &quot;bluff&quot;, or play a &quot;phony&quot; – a plausible word that they know or suspect to be unacceptable, hoping their opponent will not challenge it. Or a player can put down a legal word that appears to be a phony hoping the other player will incorrectly challenge it and lose their turn.
* &quot;Single Challenge&quot;/&quot;Free Challenge&quot;, in which no penalty whatsoever is applied to a player who unsuccessfully challenges. This is the default rule in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as for many tournaments in Australia, although these countries do sanction occasional tournaments using other challenge rules.
* Modified &quot;Single Challenge&quot;, in which an unsuccessful challenge does not result in the loss of the challenging player&#x27;s turn, but is penalized by the loss of a specified number of points. The most common penalty is 5 points. The rule has been adopted in Singapore (since 2000), Malaysia (since 2002), South Africa (since 2003), New Zealand (since 2004), and Kenya, as well as in contemporary World Scrabble Championships (since 2001) and North American (NASPA-sanctioned) Collins tournaments, and particularly prestigious Australian tournaments. Some countries and tournaments (including Sweden) use a 10-point penalty instead. In most game situations, this penalty is much lower than that of the &quot;double challenge&quot; rule. Consequently, such tournaments encourage greater willingness to challenge and discourage playing dubious words.

Under tournament rules, a player may request to &quot;hold&quot; the opponent&#x27;s play to consider whether to challenge it, provided that the opponent has not yet drawn replacement tiles. The holding player&#x27;s clock still runs, and the opponent cannot draw replacement tiles for 15 seconds or until the hold is released but may draw tiles afterward (which must be kept separate). If a player successfully challenges, the opponent must reveal any replacement tiles before returning them to the bag.

==Competitive play==
===Club and tournament play===

Tens of thousands play club and tournament &quot;Scrabble&quot; worldwide. The rules and equipment in tournament Scrabble differ somewhat from those typically found in casual play. For example, all tournament (and most club) games are played with a game clock and a set time control, and are only between two players (or occasionally, two teams of players). A player who goes overtime does not immediately lose the game (as in chess), but is instead assessed a 10-point penalty per minute. Also, the original wooden tiles are not allowed in tournaments as it is possible for players to &quot;feel&quot; the tiles in the bag (especially blank tiles); thus, molded plastic tiles are often used. Players are allowed tracking sheets containing the tile distribution, from which tiles can be crossed off as they are played.

Regularly held major tournaments include:
# &quot;The WESPA Championship&quot; (formerly the World Scrabble Championship): an invitational championship organized by WESPA.
# &quot;The Scrabble Players Championship&quot; (formerly North American Scrabble Championship): organized by NASPA Games, an open event attracting several hundred players, held around July–August every year in the United States.
# &quot;The National Scrabble Championship&quot;: organized by the Association of British Scrabble Players (ABSP) and held every year in the United Kingdom.
# &quot;The Brand&#x27;s Crossword Game King&#x27;s Cup&quot;: the largest tournament in the world. Held annually in Thailand around the end of June or the beginning of July.
# &quot;The UK Open&quot;: the largest Scrabble tournament in Europe, held annually in Coventry in England, since 2008.

Other important tournaments include:
# &quot;The World Youth Scrabble Championships&quot;: entry by country qualification, restricted to under 18 years old. Held annually since 2006.
# &quot;The National School Scrabble Championship&quot;: entry open to North American school students. Held annually since 2003.
# &quot;The Canadian Scrabble Championship&quot;: entry by invitation only to the top fifty Canadian players. Held every two to three years.
# &quot;The Singapore Open Scrabble Championship&quot;: international Singapore championship held annually since 1997.

&quot;Scrabble&quot; clubs typically meet weekly and may typically hold one or more open, sanctioned tournaments per year.
===Records===
The following records were achieved during international competitive club or tournament play, according to authoritative sources, including the book &quot;Everything Scrabble&quot; by Joe Edley and John D. Williams Jr. (revised edition, Pocket Books, 2001) and the Scrabble FAQ. When available, separate records are listed based upon different official word lists:
# OTCWL, the North American list, also used in Thailand and Israel, known today as the NASPA Word List (NWL);
# OSW, formerly the official list in the UK;
# SOWPODS, the combined OTCWL+OSW list now used in much of the world, known today as &quot;Collins Scrabble Words&quot;.
To date, new editions or revisions of these lists have not been considered substantial enough to warrant separate record-keeping.
* &quot;High game (OTCWL)&quot; – 830 by Michael Cresta (Massachusetts), at the Lexington (Massachusetts) club, October 12, 2006. Cresta defeated Wayne Yorra 830–490.
* &quot;High game (OTCWL) in a tournament game&quot; – 803 by Joel Sherman (New York), at a tournament in Stamford, Connecticut, December 9, 2011. Sherman defeated Bradley Robbins 803–285, playing a record-tying seven bingos and sticking Robbins with the Q.

* &quot;Highest losing score (OTCWL)&quot; – 552 by Stefan Rau (Connecticut) to Keith Smith&#x27;s (Texas) 582, Round 12 of the 2008 Dallas Open.
* &quot;Highest tie game (OTCWL)&quot; – 502–502 by John Chew and Zev Kaufman, at a 1997 Toronto Club tournament.
* &quot;Highest tie game (SOWPODS)&quot; – 532–532 by Sinatarn Pattanasuwanna (Thailand) and Tawan Paepolsiri (Thailand) at the 2012 World Youth Scrabble Championship.
* &quot;Highest opening move score (OTCWL)&quot; – &quot;MuZJIKS&quot; (with a blank for the U) 126 by Jesse Inman (South Carolina) at the National Scrabble Championship, 2008. The highest possible legal score on a first turn is &quot;MUZJIKS&quot; 128, using an actual U rather than a blank. (Note: The odds of drawing MUZJIKS without blanks is 9 in 432,325,411, or 1 in formula_6)
* &quot;Highest opening move score (SOWPODS)&quot; – &quot;BEZIQUE&quot; 124 by Sam Kantimathi (1993), Joan Rosenthal and Sally Martin.
* &quot;Highest single play (OTCWL)&quot; – &quot;QUIXOTRY&quot; 365 by Michael Cresta (Massachusetts), 2006.
* &quot;Highest single play (SOWPODS)&quot; – &quot;CAZIQUES&quot; 392 by Karl Khoshnaw.
* &quot;Highest average score, multi-day tournament (OSPD)&quot; – 503 by James Leong (Saskatchewan) over 12 rounds at Brandon, Man., 2015. 484 by Doug Brockmeier (California) over 12 rounds at Elmhurst, Illinois, 2011. 471 by Chris Cree (Texas) over 18 rounds at the Bayou Bash in Houston, Tex., 2007.

* &quot;Highest average score, one day tournament (SOWPODS)&quot; – 548 by Jackson Smylie of Toronto, Ontario, over 5 rounds at Caledon, Ontario
* &quot;Highest average score, one day tournament (OTCWL)&quot; – 532 by Jackson Smylie over 4 rounds at North American Scrabble Championship early bird in Las Vegas

Two other records are believed to have been achieved under a British format known as the &quot;high score rule&quot;, in which a player&#x27;s tournament result is determined only by the player&#x27;s own scores, and not by the differentials between that player&#x27;s scores and the opponents&#x27;. Play in this system &quot;encourages elaborate setups often independently mined by the two players&quot;, and is significantly different from the standard game in which defensive considerations play a major role. While the &quot;high score&quot; rule has led to impressively high records, it is currently out of favor.
* High game score – 1,049 by Phil Appleby of Lymington, Hampshire, UK, on June 25, 1989, in Wormley, Hertfordshire, UK. His opponent scored just 253 points, giving Appleby a record victory margin of 796 points.
* High single play – CAZIQUES for 392, by Saladin Karl Khoshnaw in Manchester, UK, in April 1982.

Much higher-scoring plays are possible (e.g., plays covering three TWS squares), but extremely unlikely to occur without elaborate setups by both players. The highest reported score for a single play is 1786 points using the word oxyphenbutazone creating seven additional words simultaneously. When only adding the word SESQUIOXIDIZING to these official lists, one could theoretically score 2015 (OSPD) and 2044 (SOWPODS) points in a single move. The highest reported combined score for a theoretical game based on SOWPODS is 4046 points, constructed by Nathan Hedt of Australia.
Other records are available for viewing at &quot;Total Scrabble&quot;, an unofficial record book that includes the above as sources and expands on other topics.

In August 1984, Peter Finan and Neil Smith played &quot;Scrabble&quot; for 153 hours at St. Anselm&#x27;s College, Birkenhead, Merseyside, setting a new duration record. A longer record was never recorded by &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;, as the publishers decided that duration records of this nature were becoming too dangerous and stopped accepting them.

==Software==
===Computer players===
Maven is a computer opponent for the game created by Brian Sheppard. The official &quot;Scrabble&quot; computer game in North America uses a version of Maven as its artificial intelligence and is published by Atari. Outside North America, the official &quot;Scrabble&quot; computer game is published by Ubisoft. Quackle is an open-source alternative to Maven of comparable strength, created by a five-person team led by Jason Katz-Brown. A Qt cross-platform version of Quackle is available on GitHub.

===Video game versions===
Video game versions of &quot;Scrabble&quot; have been released for various platforms, including IBM PC compatibles, Mac, Amiga, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Portable, iPod, iOS, Game.com, Palm OS, Amstrad CPC, Xbox 360, Kindle, Wii, and mobile phones.

The Nintendo DS version of &quot;Scrabble 2007 Edition&quot; made news when parents became angry over the game&#x27;s AI using potentially offensive language during gameplay.

===Web versions===
Several websites offer the possibility to play &quot;Scrabble&quot; online against other users, such as the Internet Scrabble Club and Pogo.com from Electronic Arts (North America only).

Facebook initially offered a variation of &quot;Scrabble&quot; called Scrabulous as a third-party application add-on. On July 24, 2008, Hasbro filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against its developers. Four days later, Scrabulous was disabled for users in North America, eventually reappearing as &quot;Lexulous&quot; in September 2008, with changes made to distinguish it from Scrabble. By December 20, Hasbro had withdrawn its lawsuit.

Mattel launched its official version of online &quot;Scrabble&quot;, &quot;Scrabble by Mattel&quot;, on Facebook in late March 2008. The application was developed by Gamehouse, a division of RealNetworks that was licensed by Mattel. Since Hasbro controls the copyright for North America with the copyright for the rest of the world belonging to Mattel, the Gamehouse Facebook application was available only to players outside the United States and Canada. The version developed by Electronic Arts for Hasbro was available throughout the world.

When Gamehouse ceased support for its application, Mattel replaced it with the Electronic Arts version in May 2013. This decision was met with criticism from its userbase. The Hasbro version continues to be available worldwide but now uses IP lookup to display Hasbro branding to North American players and Mattel branding to the rest of the world. Electronic Arts have also released mobile apps for Android and iOS, allowing players to continue the same game on more than one platform.

As well as facilities to play occasional games online, there are many options to play in leagues.

In 2020, the license for Scrabble passed from Electronic Arts to Scopely, which launched the app Scrabble GO on March 5, 2020, with the Electronic Arts version discontinued on June 5, 2020. The new app was very different, leading to protests, and Scopely soon began to offer a &#x27;Classic&#x27; version, without some of the extras initially offered: &quot;this updated mode is reimagined to reflect the ask for a streamlined experience. Features such as boosts, rewards and all other game modes are disabled&quot;, the company announced.

== Variations ==
===&quot;Super Scrabble&quot;===

A new licensed product, &quot;Super Scrabble&quot;, was launched in North America by Winning Moves Games in 2004 under license from Hasbro, with the deluxe version (with turntable and lock-in grid) released in February 2007. A Mattel-licensed product for the rest of the world was released by Tinderbox Games in 2006. This set comprises 200 tiles in slightly modified distribution to the standard set and a 21×21 playing board.

===National versions===

Versions of the game have been released in several other languages.

The game was called Alfapet when it was introduced in Sweden in 1954, but since the mid-1990s, the game has also been known as Scrabble in Sweden. Alfapet is now another crossword game, developed by the owners of the name Alfapet. A Russian version is called &quot;Erudit&quot;. A Hebrew version is called Shabets Na (שבץ נא). Versions have been prepared for Dakotah, Haitian Creole, Dakelh (Carrier language), and Tuvan.

For languages with digraphs counted as single letters, such as Welsh and Hungarian, the game features separate tiles for those digraphs.

An Irish-language version of Scrabble was published by Glór na nGael in 2010. The previous year the same organisation published the Junior version of the game and two years later it republished Junior Scrabble using a two-sided (and two skill level) board.

===Television game show version===

In 1987, a board game was released by Selchow &amp; Righter, based on the game show hosted by Chuck Woolery that aired on NBC from 1984 to 1990 (and for five months in 1993). Billed as the &quot;Official Home Version&quot; of the game show (or officially as the &quot;TV Scrabble Home Game&quot;), gameplay bears more resemblance to the game show than it does to a traditional &quot;Scrabble&quot; game, although it does utilize a traditional &quot;Scrabble&quot; gameboard in play.

===Games based on &quot;Scrabble&quot;===
There are numerous variations of the game. While they are similar to the original &quot;Scrabble&quot; game, they include minor variations. For example, Literati draws random tiles instead of providing a finite number of tiles for the game, assigns different point levels to each letter and has a slightly different board layout, whereas Lexulous assigns eight letters to each player instead of seven. &quot;Words with Friends&quot; uses a different board layout and different letter values, as does &quot;Words of Gold&quot;.
Duplicate Scrabble is a popular variant in French speaking countries. Every player has the same letters on the same board and the players must submit a paper slip at the end of the allotted time (usually 3 minutes) with the highest scoring word they have found. This is the format used for the French World Scrabble Championships but it is also used in Romanian and Dutch. There is no limit to the number of players that can be involved in one game, and at Vichy in 1998 there were 1,485 players, a record for French &quot;Scrabble&quot; tournaments.

&quot;&quot; is a variant that is much more popular in Italy than the original game. It features a 17×17 grid of cells and peculiar rules.

Popular among tournament &quot;Scrabble&quot; players is &quot;Clabbers&quot;. In &quot;Clabbers&quot;, any move that consists of anagrams of allowable words is allowed. For example, because ETAERIO is allowable in ordinary Collins Scrabble, EEAIORT would be allowable in &quot;Clabbers&quot;.

A junior version, called &quot;Junior Scrabble&quot;, has been marketed. This has slightly different distributions of frequencies of letter tiles to the standard &quot;Scrabble&quot; game.

Word games similar to or influenced by &quot;Scrabble&quot; include &quot;Bananagrams&quot;, &quot;Boggle&quot;, &quot;Dabble&quot;, &quot;Nab-It!&quot;, &quot;Perquackey&quot;, &quot;Puzzlage&quot;, &quot;Quiddler&quot;, &quot;Scribbage&quot;, &quot;Tapple&quot;, &quot;Upwords&quot;, and &quot;WordSpot&quot;.

There are also number-based variations, such as &quot;Equate&quot;.

==Gameboard formats==
The game has been released in numerous gameboard formats appealing to various user groups. The original boards included wood tiles and many &quot;deluxe&quot; sets still do.

===Tile Lock editions===
&quot;Tile Lock&quot; editions of &quot;Scrabble&quot; and &quot;Super Scrabble&quot; are made by Winning Moves and feature smaller, plastic tiles that are held in place on the board with little plastic posts. The standard version features exactly the same 100 tiles as regular &quot;Scrabble&quot;. The Tile Lock Super Scrabble features the same 200 tiles that are in Super Scrabble.

===Travel editions===
Editions are available for travelers who may wish to play in a conveyance such as a train or plane or to pause a game in progress and resume later. Many versions thus include methods to keep letters from moving, such as pegboards, recessed tile holders and magnetic tiles. Players&#x27; trays are also designed with stay-fast holders. Such boards are also typically designed to be reoriented by each player to put the board upright during the game, as well as folded and stowed with the game in progress.
* Production and Marketing Company, 1954 – metal hinged box, Bakelite tiles inlaid with round magnets, chrome tile racks, silver-colored plastic bag and cardboard box covered with decorative paper. The box, when opened flat, measures and the tiles measure square.
* Spear&#x27;s Games, the 1980s – boxed edition with pegboard, plastic tiles with small feet to fit snugly in the pegboard. Racks are clear plastic, allowing some sorting while holding tiles fairly snugly. The set comes with a drawstring plastic bag to draw tiles and a cardboard box. It is possible to save a game in progress by returning the board to the box. There is a risk of players&#x27; trays being mixed and upset, and the box lid, held on by friction, is subject to upset.
* Selchow &amp; Righter, 1980s – pocket edition with plastic &quot;magnetic&quot; board and tiles. Tile racks are also plastic with an asymmetrical shape to provide a handhold. All elements fit in a plastic envelope for travel and to permit a pause in the game. Plastic letters are very small and tend to lose their grip if not placed with slight lateral movement and if they are not perfectly clean. The game format is extremely small, allowing &quot;Scrabble&quot; games for backpackers and others concerned about weight and size.
* Hasbro Games, 2001 – hinged plastic board with clear tile-shaped depressions to hold tiles in play. Board is in a black, zippered folio such that board and tiles may be folded for travel, even with the game in play. The reverse side of the board contains numbered mounts for racks, holding tiles face down, allowing secure and confidential storage of tiles while a game is paused. Some versions have tile racks with individual tile slots, thus not permitting easy sorting of tiles in a rack. The board, when opened up, measures , and the tiles are in size.

===Deluxe editions===
At the opposite end, some &quot;deluxe&quot; or &quot;prestige&quot; editions offer superior materials and features. These include editions on a rotating turntable, so players can always face the board, with the letters upright and a raised grid that holds the tiles in place. Also available are alternative &quot;Scrabble&quot; boards, often made of glass or hardwood, that have superior rotating mechanisms and personalized graphics.

===Large print and braille editions===
An edition has been released (in association with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB)) with a larger board and letters for players with impaired vision. The colours on the board are more contrasting, and the font size has been increased from 16 to 24 point. The tiles are in bold 48 point, and have braille labels. A separate braille edition is also available.

===World&#x27;s Smallest edition===
Released by Super Impulse, &quot;World&#x27;s Smallest Scrabble&quot; measures 3 × 1.75 × 0.5 inches. It has the full gameplay of the standard version, with a board, a case, and 99 magnetic tiles. It is available worldwide, with Hasbro branding in the U.S. and Canada and Mattel branding elsewhere.

<text>Sedevacantism is a traditionalist Catholic movement which holds that since the 1958 death of Pius XII the occupiers of the Holy See are not valid popes due to their espousal of one or more heresies and that, for lack of a valid pope, the See of Rome is vacant. Sedevacantism owes its origins to the rejection of the theological and disciplinary changes implemented following the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965).

The term &quot;sedevacantism&quot; is derived from the Latin phrase , which means &quot;the chair [of the Bishop of Rome] being vacant&quot;. The phrase is commonly used to refer specifically to a vacancy of the Holy See which takes place from the Pope&#x27;s death or renunciation to the election of his successor.

The number of sedevacantists is unknown and difficult to measure; estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Various fractions of conclavists among sedevacantists have proceeded to end the perceived vacancy in the Holy See by electing their own pope. 

Although historically sedevacantism refers to traditional Catholics who view Pius XII to be the last Pope, a minority position called Benevacantism (as a portmanteau of &quot;Benedict&quot; and &quot;sedevacantism&quot;&quot;)&quot; has arisen which instead holds Pope Benedict XVI to be the last Pope, who continued as Pope until his death with Pope Francis ruling as a heretical antipope.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;sedevacantism&quot; derives from the Latin term &quot;sede vacante&quot;, which means “with the chair being vacant.” In the Catholic Church, when an episcopal see becomes vacant due to the death or removal of a Bishop from office for whatever reason, in the interim the diocese is automatically in a state of “&quot;sede vacante”&quot;, until a new designate is appointed and duly elevated to his see. With Sedevacantism, this is specifically in reference to the See of Saint Peter, i. e. – the Catholic Papacy. The term Sedevacantism, as a thesis that the post-Second Vatican Council claimants to the Papacy operating out of the Vatican City are non-Catholic Antipopes, originated from a 1973 work, &quot;Sede Vacante: Paul VI is Not a Legitimate Pope&quot;, by the Mexican Jesuit priest Joaquín Sáenz Arriaga. However, there were some instances of proto-sedevacatism, &quot;avant la lettre&quot;, reaching back into the 1960s.

==History==
===Early sedevacantism: origins in the 1960s===

Sedevacantism, &quot;avant la lettre&quot;, is evidenced from the mid-1960s, as part of a response to the Second Vatican Council in the Roman Catholic Church. The earliest example is from a group of traditionalist Catholics in Mexico associated with the radical right secret society &quot;Los TECOS&quot; based in Guadalajara, in particular their spiritual director, Fr. Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga, a Jesuit priest, the main figure associated with presenting this. In 1965, at a private meeting in the house of Anacleto González Guerrero (son of the &quot;Cristero&quot; martyr Anacleto González Flores), &quot;Los TECOS&quot; leaders proposed the motion that Paul VI (Giovanni Montini) was a crypto-Jew and an illegitimate Pope, that this line should be officially adopted as the position of Mexican traditionalists. A connected secret society, based in Puebla under Ramón Plata Moreno, known as &quot;El Yunque&quot;, although ultra-conservative as well and unhappy about the liberalising changes in the Catholic world, rejected the proposal, stating that Pope Paul VI was indeed the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. This led to a deadly split in the Mexican traditionalist scene. Earlier, during the Second Vatican Council, &quot;Los TECOS&quot; had distributed the document entitled &quot;Il Complotto contro la Chiesa&quot; (&quot;The Plot Against the Church&quot;) under the &quot;pseudonym&quot; of Maurice Pinay, warning Council fathers of a supposed “Judeo-Masonic-Communist” plot to infiltrate and destroy Christianity and the Catholic Church.

Another early expositor from Latin America was Carlos Alberto Disandro in Argentina, a personal associate of Juan Perón, belonging to the Catholic wing of orthodox Peronism, who raised the question in 1969 with his book &quot;Pontificado y Pontífice: una breve quaestio teológica&quot;.

== Positions ==

=== Origin ===

Sedevacantism owes its origins to the rejections of theological and disciplinary changes implemented following the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). Sedevacantists reject this Council, on the basis of their interpretations of its documents on ecumenism and religious liberty, among others, which they see as contradicting the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church and as denying the unique mission of Catholicism as the one true religion, outside of which there is no salvation. They also say that new disciplinary norms, such as the Mass of Paul VI promulgated on 3 April 1969, undermine or conflict with the historical Catholic faith and are deemed blasphemous, while post-Vatican II teachings, particularly those related to ecumenism, are labelled heresies. They conclude, on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and of postconciliar church teaching as false, that the popes involved are also false. Among even traditionalist Catholics, this is a quite divisive question.

Traditionalist Catholics who are not sedevacantists recognize the legitimate line of popes leading to and including Pope Francis. Sedevacantists, however, claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council, and conclude those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, they hold that Pope John XXIII and his successors have left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority. A notorious heretic, they say, cannot be the Catholic pope.

=== Justification ===
While sedevacantist arguments often hinge on interpretations of modernism as being a heresy, this is also debated.

=== Positions within sedevacantism ===
==== Clergy, Mass, and sacraments ====
Some sedevacantists accept the consecrations and ordinations of sedevacantist bishops and priests, and the offering of Masses and the administration of sacraments by the said bishops and priests, to be licit because of &quot;epikea&quot;, i.e. &quot;the interpretation of the mind and will of him who made the law&quot;. In this case, the ecclesiastical laws (e.g. prohibition of consecrations of bishops without papal mandate; prohibition of administration of sacraments without ecclesiastical authorization) are interpreted to cease when to follow them would be impossible, harmful, or unreasonable, or would mean transgressing divine laws (e.g. the church must have bishops and priests; Catholics must attend Mass and receive the sacraments), and because of a historical precedent for consecrating Catholic bishops during a long vacancy of the Holy See.

==== Liturgy ====
Anthony Cekada considers that a question among sedevacantists is whether it is permissible to go to Masses. These are Traditional Latin Masses naming the man considered by the majority of Catholics as the Pope in the Roman Canon in the prayer, specifically where the priest says (“together with Your Servant N., our Pope.”) Cekada argues that it is not, under any circumstances, permissible.

==== Relationship to sedeprivationism ====
In contrast to sedevacantists, sedeprivationists affirm the Thesis of Cassiciacum by the Dominican theologian Bishop Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers as being a valid position, which states that John XXIII and his successors are popes (“materially but not formally”), and that post-Vatican II popes will become legitimate once they recant their heresies.

This position is endorsed by the .

== Demography ==
There are estimated to be between several tens of thousands and more than two hundred thousand sedevacantists worldwide, mostly concentrated in the United States, Mexico, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Australia, but the actual size of the movement has never been accurately assessed. It remains extremely difficult to do so for a wide range of reasons, such as the fact that not all sedevacantists identify as such, nor do they necessarily belong to avowedly sedevacantist groups or societies.

== Early proponents ==

Early proponents of sedevacantism include:
* Bishop Francis Schuckardt, an American who was illicitly consecrated a bishop by Daniel Q. Brown and founded the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI), from which he was expelled in 1984. He later established a new sect, the Traditional Latin Rite Catholic Church (TLRCC).
* Bishop Daniel Q. Brown, an American former Old Catholic bishop who converted to sedevacantism and an associate of Schuckardt. Later reverted to Old Catholicism.
* Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga, a Mexican Jesuit priest and theologian who put forward sedevacantist ideas in his books &quot;The New Montinian Church&quot; (August 1971) and (1973).
* Francis E. Fenton, an American priest inspired by Sáenz&#x27;s writings and founded the Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement as an American parallel to the Mexican .
* Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers, a French Dominican priest and theologian who developed the Thesis of Cassiciacum in the 1970s. He was illicitly consecrated bishop in 1981 by Ngô Đình Thục.
* Several American priests of the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX): Daniel Dolan, Anthony Cekada, and Donald Sanborn, reportedly sedevacantists in the 1970s, who were expelled with several other priests by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre for holding this view. Nine of these priests later founded the Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV) in 1983. Dolan and Sanborn were later illicitly consecrated bishops.
* Oswald Baker, an English priest who was a know sedevacantist by at least 1982, and reportedly some time prior to that.
* Lucian Pulvermacher, an American missionary priest who left the Catholic Church in 1976 and in 1998 was elected pope of the conclavist &quot;True Catholic Church&quot; with the papal name “Pius XIII”.

== Sedevacantist bishops ==
=== Consecrated before Vatican II ===
The only known Catholic bishop consecrated before the Second Vatican Council who publicly became sedevacantist was Vietnamese Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục (consecrated in 1938), former Vicar Apostolic of Vĩnh Long, Vietnam and former Archbishop of Huế, Vietnam.

Bishop Alfredo Méndez-Gonzalez (consecrated in 1960), former Bishop of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, though not having publicly identified as a sedevacantist, associated himself with sedevacantist priests and consecrated a bishop for them.

===Thục line bishops===
Some bishops derive their episcopacy from Archbishop Thục or bishops of his lineage. Many of these bishops belong to the non-sedevacantist Palmarian Catholic Church; this is due to Thục having consecrated Bishop Clemente Domínguez y Gómez, later the Pope of the Palmarian Church, and the episcopal consecrations within this organization.

On 7 May 1981, Thục consecrated the sedeprivationist French priest Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers as a bishop. Des Lauriers was a French Dominican theologian and a papal advisor.

On 17 October 1981, Thục consecrated the sedevacantist Mexican priests Moisés Carmona and Adolfo Zamora as bishops. Carmona and Zamora had been sedevacantist leaders and propagators in Mexico.

The Vatican declared Thục &quot;latae sententiae&quot; excommunicated for these consecrations and for his declaration of Sedevacantism.

===Méndez-line bishops===
On 19 October 1993, in Carlsbad, California, United States, Bishop Méndez-Gonzalez consecrated the sedevacantist Clarence Kelly of the Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV) to the episcopacy. By Méndez&#x27;s wish, the consecration was kept secret until his death in 1995.

=== Whose lineages derive from earlier movements ===
A considerable number of sedevacantist bishops are thought to derive their holy orders from Bishop Carlos Duarte Costa, who in 1945 set up his own independent Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church. While Duarte Costa was not a sedevacantist, he instead questioned the papacy as an institution, denying papal infallibility and rejecting the pope&#x27;s universal jurisdiction. In further contrast to most Catholic traditionalists, Duarte Costa was left-wing.

== Groups ==
Sedevacantist groups include:
* Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen (CMRI), formed in 1967. It operates in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia and is based in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Its bishop is Mark Pivarunas.
* Most Holy Family Monastery (MHFM), a traditional Catholic monastery in Fillmore, New York, founded in 1967 and led by Michael and Peter Dimond.
* Society of Saint Pius V (SSPV), formed in 1983 when nine American priests split from the Society of Saint Pius X over a number of issues including using the liturgical books implemented under Pope John XXIII. It operates in North America from Oyster Bay Cove, New York, United States, and was headed by Bishop Clarence Kelly until his death in December 2023.
* (Institute of the Mother of Good Counsel; IMBC), a sedeprivationist group formed in 1985 when four Italian priests left the Society of Saint Pius X, over their stance on the Pope. It operates in Europe and Argentina. Based in Verrua Savoia, Turin, Italy, its bishop is Geert Stuyver.
* (Priestly Society of Trent; SST), formed in 1993 by priests of the deceased Bishop Moisés Carmona. Its bishop is Martín Dávila Gandara.
* Roman Catholic Institute (RCI), founded in 1993 by Bishop Donald Sanborn. It consists of Sanborn, his priests, and some of his seminarians, and is based in Brooksville, Florida.

<doc id="27931" wikidata="Q1643098" url="?curid=27931" title="Sailor Moon">
<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi. It was originally serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;shōjo&quot; manga magazine &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from 1991 to 1997; the 60 individual chapters (later reorganized into 52), along with several side stories, were compiled in 18 volumes. The series follows the adventures of a schoolgirl named Usagi Tsukino as she transforms into the eponymous character to search for a magical artifact, the . She leads a group of comrades, the Sailor Soldiers, called Sailor Guardians in later editions, as they battle against villains to prevent the theft of the Silver Crystal and the destruction of the Solar System.

The manga was adapted into an anime series produced by Toei Animation and broadcast in Japan from 1992 to 1997. Toei also developed three animated feature films, a television special, and three short films based on the anime. A live-action television adaptation, &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;, aired from 2003 to 2004, and a second anime series, &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, began simulcasting in 2014. The manga series was licensed for an English language release by Kodansha Comics in North America, and in Australia and New Zealand by Random House Australia. The entire anime series has been licensed by Viz Media for an English language release in North America and by Madman Entertainment in Australia and New Zealand.

Since its release, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; has received universal acclaim, with praise for its art, characterization, and humor. The manga has sold over 46 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling manga series, as well as one of the best-selling &quot;shōjo&quot; manga series of all time. The franchise has also generated in worldwide merchandise sales.

== Plot ==
One day in Juban, Tokyo, a middle-school student named Usagi Tsukino befriends Luna, a talking black cat who gives her a magical brooch enabling her to transform into Sailor Moon: a guardian destined to save Earth from the forces of evil. Luna and Usagi assemble a team of fellow Sailor Guardians to find their princess and the Silver Crystal. They encounter the studious Ami Mizuno, who awakens as Sailor Mercury; Rei Hino, a local Shinto shrine maiden who awakens as Sailor Mars; Makoto Kino, a tall and strong transfer student who awakens as Sailor Jupiter; and Minako Aino, a young aspiring idol who had awakened as Sailor Venus a few months prior, accompanied by her talking feline companion Artemis. Additionally, they befriend Mamoru Chiba, a high school student who assists them on occasion as Tuxedo Mask.

In the first arc, the group battles the Dark Kingdom, those members attempt to find the Silver Crystal and free an imprisoned, evil entity called Queen Metaria. Usagi and her team discover that in their previous lives, they were members of the ancient Moon Kingdom in a period of time called the Silver Millennium. The Dark Kingdom waged war against them, destroying the Moon Kingdom. Its ruler Queen Serenity sent her daughter Princess Serenity, reincarnated as Usagi, along with her protectors the Sailor Guardians, their feline advisers Luna and Artemis, and the princess&#x27;s true love Prince Endymion, who in turn was reborn as Mamoru.

At the beginning of the second arc, the Sailor Guardians meet Usagi and Mamoru&#x27;s future daughter Chibiusa, who arrives from a 30th-century version of Tokyo known as &quot;Crystal Tokyo&quot;, which is ruled by Neo Queen Serenity, Usagi of the future and has been attacked by the group of villains known as the Black Moon Clan. During their journey, Sailor Moon and her friends meet Sailor Pluto, Guardian of the Time-Space Door. During the climactic battle of the arc, Sailor Pluto dies trying to save the sailor soldiers and Chibiusa was brainwashed by the enemy and turned into the Black Lady, but was eventually reformed and awakens as a Guardian herself—Sailor Chibi Moon.

The third arc introduces two characters in a romantic relationship, car-racer Haruka Tenoh and violinist Michiru Kaioh, who appear as Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune. Their duty is to guard the Solar System against external threats. Physics student Setsuna Meioh, Sailor Pluto&#x27;s reincarnation, joins Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune in their mission to kill a mysterious girl named Hotaru Tomoe, whom they identify as the Guardian of Destruction Sailor Saturn. However, when Saturn awakens she joins the final fight against the main antagonists of the arc, the Death Busters, sacrificing her life in the process. With her newly obtained powers as Super Sailor Moon, Usagi restores the Earth and Hotaru is reincarnated as a baby.

The fourth arc explores the Sailor Guardians&#x27; dreams and nightmares when the villainous group Dead Moon Circus exploits the Guardians&#x27; deepest fears, invades Elysion (which hosts the Earth&#x27;s Golden Kingdom), and captures its high priest Helios, who turned into a Pegasus and tried to ask Guardians for help. This storyline also addresses Mamoru&#x27;s relevance as protector of the Earth and owner of the Golden Crystal, the sacred stone of the Golden Kingdom. Mamoru and all ten of the reunited Guardians combine their powers, enabling Usagi to transform into Eternal Sailor Moon and defeat Dead Moon&#x27;s leader, Queen Nehelenia.

In the final arc the Sailor Starlights from the Planet Kinmoku, their ruler Princess Kakyuu, and the mysterious little girl Chibi-Chibi join Usagi in her fight against Shadow Galactica, a group of both corrupted and false Sailor Guardians and led by Sailor Galaxia, who have been rampaging across the galaxy and killing other Sailor Guardians to steal their Star Seeds, Sailor Crystals—the essence of their lives. After Mamoru and all of the main Solar System Guardians are killed by Shadow Galactica, Usagi travels to the Galaxy Cauldron, the birthplace of all Star Seeds of the Milky Way, in an attempt to revive her loved ones and to confront Chaos, the source of all strife in the galaxy.

== Production ==
=== Creation of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; ===
Naoko Takeuchi, after working on the 1991 Nami Akimoto manga Miracle Girls, redeveloped &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; from her 1991 manga serial &quot;&quot;, which was first published on August 20, 1991, and featured Sailor Venus as the main protagonist. Takeuchi wanted to create a story with a theme about girls in outer space. While discussing with her editor Fumio Osano, he suggested the addition of Sailor fuku. When &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot; was proposed for adaptation into an anime by Toei Animation, Takeuchi redeveloped the concept so Sailor Venus became a member of a team. The resulting manga series became a fusion of the popular magical girl genre and the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series, of which Takeuchi was a fan. Recurring motifs include astronomy, astrology, gemology, Greco-Roman mythology, Japanese elemental themes, teen fashions, and schoolgirl antics.

Takeuchi said discussions with Kodansha originally envisaged a single story arc; the storyline was developed in meetings a year before serialization began. After completing the arc, Toei and Kodansha asked Takeuchi to continue the series. She wrote four more story arcs, which were often published simultaneously with the five corresponding seasons of the anime adaptation. The anime ran one or two months behind the manga. As a result, the anime follows the storyline of the manga fairly closely, although there are deviations. Takeuchi later said because Toei&#x27;s production staff were mostly male, she feels the anime has &quot;a slight male perspective.&quot;

Takeuchi later said she planned to kill off the protagonists, but Osano rejected the notion and said, &quot;[&quot;Sailor Moon&quot;] is a &quot;shōjo&quot; manga!&quot; When the anime adaptation was produced, the protagonists were killed in the final battle with the Dark Kingdom, although they were revived. Takeuchi resented that she was unable to do that in her version. Takeuchi also intended for the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; anime adaptation to last for one season, but due to the immense popularity, Toei asked Takeuchi to continue the series. At first, she struggled to develop another storyline to extend the series. While discussing with Osano, he suggested the inclusion of Usagi&#x27;s daughter from the future, Chibiusa.

=== Westernization ===
After the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; anime was released in North America and dubbed in English, fans and academics alike noted that the dub had westernized &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; from how it had been released in Japan. In the 1995 English version of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, the westernization of the characters is seen in how a majority of the character names are changed from Japanese to English names. Sailor Moon&#x27;s civilian name, Usagi Tsukino, is turned into Serena. The love interest of Sailor Moon, Mamoru Chiba, is turned into Darien Shields. The main theme is changed from a romance ballad discussing Serena&#x27;s (Usagi&#x27;s) eternal love for Darien (Mamoru) to an anthem focused on Serena&#x27;s newfound identity as the superheroine Sailor Moon. Other examples of westernization referenced by &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;&#x27;s audience included flipping scenes of traffic to have cars drive on the right side of the road along with the English dub changing any conversations between characters that contained lesser-known (in North America at the time) Japanese cultural references. According to Bandai America, the company in charge of Sailor Moon merchandise in the western hemisphere, the approach to advertising &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was to make the show and super-heroine &quot;&#x27;culturally appropriate&#x27; for the American market&quot;.

== Media ==
=== Manga ===

Written and illustrated by Naoko Takeuchi, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was serialized in the monthly manga anthology &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; from December 28, 1991, to February 3, 1997. The side-stories were serialized simultaneously in &quot;RunRun&quot;—another of Kodansha&#x27;s manga magazines. The 52 individual chapters were published in 18 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by Kodansha from July 6, 1992, to April 4, 1997. In 2003, the chapters were re-released in a collection of 12 &quot;shinzōban&quot; volumes to coincide with the release of the live-action series. The manga was retitled &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; and included new cover art, and revised dialogue and illustrations. The ten individual short stories were also released in two volumes. In 2013, the chapters were once again re-released in 10 &quot;kanzenban&quot; volumes to commemorate the manga&#x27;s 20th anniversary, which includes digitally remastered artwork, new covers and color artwork from its &quot;Nakayoshi&quot; run. The books have been enlarged from the typical Japanese manga size to A5. The short stories were republished in two volumes, with the order of the stories shuffled. &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot; was also included in the third edition.

The &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga was initially licensed for an English release by Mixx (later Tokyopop) in North America. The manga was first published as a serial in &quot;MixxZine&quot; beginning in 1997, but was later removed from the magazine and made into a separate, low print monthly comic to finish the first, second and third arcs. At the same time, the fourth and fifth arcs were printed in a secondary magazine called &quot;Smile&quot;. Pages from the Tokyopop version of the manga ran daily in the Japanimation Station, a service accessible to users of America Online. The series was later collected into a three-part graphic novel series spanning eighteen volumes, which were published from December 1, 1998, to September 18, 2001. In May 2005, Tokyopop&#x27;s license to the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga expired, and its edition went out of print.

In 2011, Kodansha Comics announced they had acquired the license for the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga and its lead-in series &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot; in English. They published the twelve volumes of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; simultaneously with the two-volume edition of &quot;Codename Sailor V&quot; from September 2011 to July 2013. The first of the two related short story volumes was published on September 10, 2013; the second was published on November 26, 2013. At Anime Expo 2017, Kodansha Comics announced plans to re-release &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; in an &quot;Eternal Edition&quot;, featuring a new English translation, new cover artwork by Takeuchi, and color pages from the manga&#x27;s original run, printed on extra-large premium paper. The first Eternal Edition volume was published on September 11, 2018; the tenth and final volume was published on October 20, 2020. On July 1, 2019, Kondasha Comics began releasing the Eternal Editions digitally, following an announcement the day before about the series being released digitally in ten different languages. In November 2020, Kodansha Comics announced plans to re-release the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga again as part of their &quot;Naoko Takeuchi Collection&quot;. The company described the new edition as a &quot;more affordable, portable&quot; version of the Eternal Edition. The first volume was published on April 5, 2022.

&quot;Sailor Moon&quot; has also been licensed in other English-speaking countries. In the United Kingdom, the volumes are distributed by Turnaround Publisher Services. In Australia, the manga is distributed by Penguin Books Australia.

The manga has been licensed in Russia as well as the CIS for distribution by publishing company XL Media. The first volume was released in 2018.

Kunihiko Ikuhara directed the first film, while the latter two were directed by Hiroki Shibata.

In 1997, an article in &quot;Variety&quot; stated that The Walt Disney Company was interested in originally acquiring the rights to &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; as a live action film to be directed by Stanley Tong &amp; Geena Davis set to star as Queen Beryl, along with Winona Ryder &amp; Elisabeth Shue planning to star in the film. After Disney put the project on turnaround, Universal Pictures acquired the film rights.

=== Companion books ===
There have been numerous companion books to &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. Kodansha released some of these books for each of the five story arcs, collectively called the &quot;Original Picture Collection&quot;. The books contain cover art, promotional material and other work by Takeuchi. Many of the drawings are accompanied by comments on the way she developed her ideas, created each picture and commentary on the anime interpretation of her story. Another picture collection, &quot;Volume Infinity&quot;, was released as a self-published, limited-edition artbook after the end of the series in 1997. This art book includes drawings by Takeuchi and her friends, her staff, and many of the voice actors who worked on the anime. In 1999, Kodansha published the &quot;Materials Collection&quot;; this contained development sketches and notes for nearly every character in the manga, and for some characters that never appeared. Each drawing includes notes by Takeuchi about costume pieces, the mentality of the characters and her feelings about them. It also includes timelines for the story arcs and for the real-life release of products and materials relating to the anime and manga. A short story, &quot;Parallel Sailor Moon&quot; is also featured, celebrating the year of the rabbit.

=== Novels ===
&quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was also adapted for publication as novels and released in 1998. The first book was written by Stuart J. Levy. The following novels were written by Lianne Sentar.

=== Stage musicals ===

In mid-1993, the first musical theater production based on &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; premiered, starring Anza Ohyama as Sailor Moon. Thirty such musicals in all have been produced, with one in pre-production. The shows&#x27; stories include anime-inspired plotlines and original material. Music from the series has been released on about 20 memorial albums. The popularity of the musicals has been cited as a reason behind the production of the live-action television series, &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;.

During the original run musicals ran in the winter and summer of each year, with summer musicals staged at the Sunshine Theater in the Ikebukuro area of Tokyo. In the winter, musicals toured to other large cities in Japan, including Osaka, Fukuoka, Nagoya, Shizuoka, Kanazawa, Sendai, Saga, Oita, Yamagata and Fukushima. The final incarnation of the first run, , went on stage in January 2005, following which, Bandai officially put the series on a hiatus. On June 2, 2013, Fumio Osano announced on his Twitter page that the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; musicals would begin again in September 2013. The 20th anniversary show &quot;La Reconquista&quot; ran from September 13 to 23 at Shibuya&#x27;s AiiA Theater Tokyo, with Satomi Ōkubo as Sailor Moon. Satomi Ōkubo reprised the role in the 2014 production &quot;Petite Étrangère&quot; which ran from August 21 to September 7, 2014, again at AiiA Theater Tokyo.

=== Live-action film &amp; series ===
==== Cancelled Disney film adaptation ====
During the 1990s, Disney was going to adapt Sailor Moon into a film under the Walt Disney Pictures banner but it was cancelled immediately.

==== Unrealized American adaptation ====

In 1993, Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, Bandai and Toon Makers, Inc. conceptualized their own version of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, which was half live-action and half Western-style animation. Toon Makers produced a 17-minute proof of concept pilot and a two-minute music video, both of which were directed by Rocky Solotoff, who also worked on the pilot&#x27;s script. Renaissance-Atlantic presented the concept to Toei, but it was turned down as their concept would have cost significantly more than simply exporting and dubbing the anime adaptation. The companies&#x27; work is believed by Solotoff to have been handed over to Raymond Iacovacci, one of the producers on the project, who stored the pilot script and animation cels in a storage facility. The logo created for the pilot was kept for the English dub, and Bandai released a &quot;Moon Cycle&quot; as part of its merchandise for the show, based on vehicles designed for the pilot.

The project was rediscovered in 1998 when the music video was screened at the Anime Expo convention in Los Angeles, where it was met with laughter by onlookers. A congoer recorded the music video and the audience response, which would later resurface on video sites such as YouTube. The pilot and the music video would go on to be discussed at conventions such as the 2011 Gen Con and 2012 Anime Expo. It was given the monikers of &quot;Toon Makers&#x27; Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Saban Moon&quot; despite having no connection with Saban Entertainment save for Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, which worked with the company on &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. The proof of concept video was widely considered to be lost media and director Solotoff reported that he was frequently contacted by people searching for the pilot. In 2012 multiple animation cels from the pilot, along with the script, surfaced on the internet after a storage locker, believed to be the one owned by Iacovacci, was sold.

In 1998, Frank Ward, along with his company Renaissance-Atlantic Entertainment, tried to revive the idea of doing a live-action series based on Sailor Moon, this time called &quot;Team Angel&quot;, without the involvement of Toon Makers. A 2-minute reel was produced and sent to Bandai America, but was also rejected.

In August 2022, the proof of concept was showcased for the first time on YouTube in a documentary by Ray Mona. Ray Mona obtained both the pilot and its music video, as well and its related materials, from the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C..

==== &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; ====
In 2003, Toei Company produced a Japanese live-action &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; television series using the new translated English title of &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot;. Its 49 episodes were broadcast on Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting from October 4, 2003, to September 25, 2004. &quot;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon&quot; featured Miyuu Sawai as Usagi Tsukino, Rika Izumi (credited as Chisaki Hama) as Ami Mizuno, Keiko Kitagawa as Rei Hino, Mew Azama as Makoto Kino, Ayaka Komatsu as Minako Aino, Jouji Shibue as Mamoru Chiba, Keiko Han reprising her voice role as Luna from the original anime and Kappei Yamaguchi voicing Artemis. The series was an alternate retelling of the Dark Kingdom arc, adding a storyline different from that in the manga and first anime series, with original characters and new plot developments. In addition to the main episodes, two direct-to-video releases appeared after the show ended its television broadcast. &quot;Special Act&quot; is set four years after the main storyline ends, and shows the wedding of the two main characters. &quot;Act Zero&quot; is a prequel showing the origins of and Tuxedo Mask.

The show was set to debut in early June 2020, but was first postponed to June 2021, and later to June 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and finally cancelled on February 23, 2023, due to an &quot;unstable world situation&quot;, following the Russo-Ukrainian war.

A Japanese idol pop group named SG5, short for Sailor Guardians 5, was announced in June 2022. Early plans to form the group began in 2020, with the official lineup and overall concept finalized in 2022. As part of the process, the group had to seek the approval of Naoko Takeuchi by performing in front of her and giving a presentation.

Their follow-up single, &quot;Underground&quot;, was released in July 2024 through Three Six Zero Recordings.

== Reception ==
&quot;Sailor Moon&quot; is one of the most popular manga series of all time and continues to enjoy high readership worldwide. More than one million copies of its &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes had been sold in Japan by the end of 1995. It has been described as iconic. By the series&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2012, the manga had sold over 35 million copies in over fifty countries, and the franchise has generated in worldwide merchandise sales as of 1996. By 1995, Sailor Moon toys used to bring in more than $250 million per year in Japan. The manga won the Kodansha Manga Award in 1993 for &quot;shōjo&quot;. The English adaptations of both the manga and the anime series became the first successful &quot;shōjo&quot; title in the United States. The character of Sailor Moon is recognized as one of the most important and popular female superheroes of all time.

&quot;Sailor Moon&quot; has also become popular internationally. &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was broadcast in Spain and France beginning in December 1993; these became the first countries outside Japan to broadcast the series. It was later aired in Russia, South Korea, the Philippines, China, Italy, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, before North America picked up the franchise for adaptation. In the Philippines, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; was one of its carrier network&#x27;s main draws, helping it to become the third-biggest network in the country. In 2001, the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga was Tokyopop&#x27;s best selling property, outselling the next-best selling titles by at least a factor of 1.5. In Diamond Comic Distributors&#x27;s May 1999 &quot;Graphic Novel and Trade Paperback&quot; category, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; Volume 3 was the best-selling comic book in the United States.

Academic Timothy J. Craig attributes &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;&#x27;s international success to three characteristics. First was the show&#x27;s magical girl transformation of ordinary characters into superheroes. Second was the ability of marketers to establish the international audience&#x27;s connection to characters, despite their culture being Japanese. The third was that the main superhero was female, something which was still rare in pop culture in countries like the United States during the 1990s.

In his 2007 book &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson gave the manga series three stars out of four. He enjoyed the blending of &quot;shōnen&quot; and &quot;shōjo&quot; styles and said the combat scenes seemed heavily influenced by &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, but shorter and less bloody. He also said the manga itself appeared similar to &quot;Super Sentai&quot; television shows. Thompson found the series fun and entertaining, but said the repetitive plot lines were a detriment to the title, which the increasing quality of art could not make up for; even so, he called the series &quot;sweet, effective entertainment.&quot; Thompson said although the audience for &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; is both female and male, Takeuchi does not use fanservice for males, which would run the risk of alienating her female audience. Thompson said fight scenes are not physical and &quot;boil down to their purest form of a clash of wills&quot;, which he says &quot;makes thematic sense&quot; for the manga.

While comparing the manga and anime, Sylvain Durand thought that the manga artwork is &quot;gorgeous&quot;, but its storytelling is more compressed and erratic and the anime has more character development. Durand said &quot;the sense of tragedy is greater&quot; in the manga&#x27;s telling of the &quot;fall of the Silver Millennium,&quot; giving more detail about the origins of the Four Kings of Heaven and on Usagi&#x27;s final battle against Queen Beryl and Metaria. Durand said the anime omits information that makes the story easy to understand, but judges the anime as more &quot;coherent&quot; with a better balance of comedy and tragedy, whereas the manga is &quot;more tragic&quot; and focused on Usagi and Mamoru&#x27;s romance.

For the week of September 11, 2011, to September 17, 2011, the first volume of the re-released &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga was the best-selling manga on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Manga Best Sellers list, with the first volume of &quot;Codename: Sailor V&quot; in second place. The first print run of the first volume sold out after four weeks.

In English-speaking countries, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; developed a cult following among anime fans and university students. Patrick Drazen says the Internet was a new medium that fans used to communicate and played a role in the popularity of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. Fans could use the Internet to communicate about the series, organize campaigns to return &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; to U.S. broadcast, to share information about episodes that had not yet aired, or to write fan fiction. Gemma Cox of &quot;Neo&quot; magazine said part of the series&#x27;s allure was that fans communicated via the Internet about the differences between the dub and the original version.

== Cultural impact and legacy ==
With their dynamic heroines and action-oriented plots, many credit &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; for reinvigorating the magical girl genre. After its success, many similar magical girl series, including &quot;Magic Knight Rayearth&quot;, &quot;Wedding Peach&quot;, &quot;Nurse Angel Ririka SOS&quot;, &quot;Saint Tail&quot;, &quot;Cyber Team in Akihabara&quot;, &quot;Corrector Yui&quot; and &quot;Pretty Cure&quot;, emerged. &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; has been called &quot;the biggest breakthrough&quot; in English-dubbed anime until 1995, when it premiered on YTV, and &quot;the pinnacle of little kid &quot;shōjo&quot; anime&quot;. Cultural anthropologist Rachel Thorn said that soon after &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, &quot;shōjo&quot; manga started appearing in book shops instead of fandom-dominated comic shops. The series are credited as beginning a wider movement of girls taking up &quot;shōjo&quot; manga. Canadian librarian Gilles Poitras defines a generation of anime fans as those who were introduced to anime by &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; in the 1990s, saying they were both much younger than other fans and were also mostly female.

Historian Fred Patten credits Takeuchi with popularizing the concept of a &quot;Super Sentai&quot;-like team of magical girls, and Paul Gravett credits the series with revitalizing the magical girl genre itself. A reviewer for &quot;THEM Anime Reviews&quot; also credited the anime series with changing the genre—its heroine must use her powers to fight evil, not simply have fun as previous magical girls had done. The series has also been compared to &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;. Sailor Moon also influenced the development of &quot;&quot;, &quot;W.I.T.C.H.&quot;, &quot;Winx Club&quot;, &quot;LoliRock&quot;, &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, and &quot;Totally Spies!&quot;.

&quot;Sailor Moon&quot; is associated with the feminist and Girl Power movements and with empowering its female viewers, especially regarding the &quot;credible, charismatic and independent&quot; characterizations of the Sailor Guardians. &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; is regarded as empowering to women and feminism in concept, in particular through the aggressive nature and strong personalities of the Sailor Guardians. It is a specific type of feminist concept where &quot;traditional feminine ideals [are] incorporated into characters that act in traditionally male capacities&quot;. While the Sailor Guardians are strong, independent fighters who thwart evil—which is generally a masculine stereotype—they are also ideally feminized in the transformation of the Sailor Guardians from teenage girls into magical girls.

The most notable hyper-feminine features of the Sailor Guardians—and most other females in Japanese girls&#x27; comics—are the girls&#x27; thin bodies, long legs, and, in particular, round, orb-like eyes. Eyes are commonly known as the primal source within characters where emotion is evoked—sensitive characters have larger eyes than insensitive ones. The stereotypical role of women in Japanese culture is to undertake romantic and loving feelings; therefore, the prevalence of hyper-feminine qualities like the openness of the female eye in Japanese girls&#x27; comics is clearly exhibited in &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;. Thus, &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; emphasizes a type of feminist model by combining traditional masculine action with traditional female affection through the Sailor Guardians.

== Merchandise ==
Since the early 2000s, Toei Animation has collaborated with various different brands to create merchandise outside of children&#x27;s demographic. On February 20, 2020, ColourPop released a &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; inspired makeup collection. Celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; in the U.S., streetwear brand KITH released clothing like hoodies and t-shirts with &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; graphics on them. In honor of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;&#x27;s 30th anniversary, brands like Sanrio, Uniqlo, and Maison de FLEUR launched a collaboration in January 2022.
