<text>The first memorials to the victims of the September 11 attacks in 2001 began to take shape online, as hundreds of posted their own thoughts, links to the Red Cross and other rescue agencies, photos, and eyewitness accounts. Numerous online September 11 memorials began appearing a few hours after the attacks, although many of these memorials were only temporary. Around the world, U.S. embassies and consulates became makeshift memorials as people came out to pay their respects.

The first reading of the names of the victims of 9/11 took place at the World Trade Center site on September 11, 2002.

The &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; was the first major physical memorial at the World Trade Center site. A permanent memorial and museum, the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center, were built as part of the design for overall site redevelopment. The 9/11 Memorial consists of two massive pools set within the original footprints of the Twin Towers with waterfalls cascading down their sides. The names of the victims of the attacks are inscribed around the edges of the waterfalls. Other permanent memorials have been constructed around the world.

One of the places that saw many memorials and candlelight vigils was Pier A in Hoboken, New Jersey. There was also a memorial service on March 11, 2002, at dusk on Pier A when the &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; first turned on, marking the half-year anniversary of the terrorist attack. A permanent September 11 memorial for Hoboken, called Hoboken Island, was chosen in September 2004.

&quot;The Sphere&quot;, the monumental and world&#x27;s largest cast bronze sculpture of modern times created by German artist Fritz Koenig stood between the twin towers on the Austin J. Tobin Plaza of the World Trade Center in New York City from 1971 until the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The artefact, weighing more than 20 tons, was the only remaining work of art to be recovered largely intact from the ruins of the collapsed Twin Towers after the attacks. Since then, the bronze sphere, primarily known in the United States as &quot;The Sphere&quot;, has been transformed into a symbolic memorial to commemorate 9/11. Having become a major tourist attraction, the unrestored sculpture was rededicated on August 16, 2017, by the Port Authority at a permanent location in Liberty Park overlooking the September 11 Memorial.

* Also on October 13, The September 11 Photo Project was founded. The Project was a not-for-profit community-based photo exhibit in response to the September 11 attacks and their aftermath. It toured seven cities over two years, collected photographs from more than 700 participants, and had over 300,000 visitors over its run. The Project provided a venue for the display of photographs accompanied by captions by anyone who wished to participate. The exhibit aimed to preserve a record of the spontaneous outdoor shrines that were being swept away by rain or wind or collected by the city for historic preservation. The Project was also made into a book titled &quot;The September 11 Photo Project&quot; in May 2002. It has sold over 60,000 copies to date.
* On March 11, 2002, the damaged sculpture &quot;The Sphere&quot;, formerly displayed in the World Trade Center, was dedicated by the city as a temporary memorial in Battery Park City.

====In other countries====
In Europe, annually a commemoration of September 11 to never forget, Nissoria was one of the first public places that dedicated a memorial to September 11 in Europe. Nissoria is in a small town located in the Province of Enna in Sicily, Italy. Two family members of this community, Vincenzo DiFazio and Salvatore Lopez, died on Sept 11 at the World Trade Center.

The then-mayor Dr. Marco Murgo along with the Chiara family Benito Sr. and son Mario developed the project to dedicate a small plot of land adjacent to a local school and museum that was entitled “Parco 11 Settembre”. The Commanding Officer of the nearby U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella met with this delegation from Nissoria and embraced this truly heartfelt initiative.

Ever since its dedication, and thanks to the present-day Mayor of Nissoria Dott. Armando Glorioso and Dott. Alberto Lunetta who continues this important event, a representation of both American and Italian military personnel from the nearby Military base NAS Sigonella comes to visit and annually commemorate along with all local Italian Authorities, Dignitaries and citizens who truly will never forget this tragic event.

* According to Radio Farda&#x27;s website, when the attacks&#x27; news was released, Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran (US interests protecting office in Iran), to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning. This piece of news on Radio Farda&#x27;s website also states that in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, the United States Department of State, published a post on its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people&#x27;s kindness on those harsh days. After the attacks, the President and the Supreme Leader of Iran condemned the attacks. BBC and &quot;Time&quot; magazine published reports on holding candlelit vigils for the victims by Iranian citizens on their websites.

The church also commissioned and recorded a tribute song written by Dave Pettigrew &amp; Frank Di Minno called, &quot;There is Hope.&quot;
* In Radcliff Kentucky at the Kentucky Veteran&#x27;s Cemetery Central, a committee of local citizens worked on a memorial effort taking only 8 weeks from the time of receipt of a piece of steel from the World Trade Center to the Tenth Anniversary remembrance ceremony. In that time they developed a concept design, found companies willing to donate time, labor, technical expertise, and material, and began a fundraising effort which allowed a memorial to be erected solely on private funding. This memorial completed phase I in these 8 weeks and now enters phase II. Hundreds of citizens assembled during the remembrance ceremony held for the Tenth Anniversary on Sunday, September 11.

==20th anniversary memorial services==
The 20th anniversary came just weeks after a hastened withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan following the 2021 Taliban offensive in which the Taliban reconquered most of Afghanistan. It was in this climate that former President George W. Bush said in a speech at the Shanksville memorial that both foreign and domestic extremists were &quot;children of the same foul spirit&quot;, a comparison which angered some right-wing politicians and media figures. President Joe Biden, former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, and their respective first ladies attended a memorial ceremony together at the National September 11 Memorial, where the World Trade Center towers fell two decades prior. Biden then went on to visit the other two 9/11 crash sites, stopping at the national memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and finally, the Pentagon. Former President Donald Trump visited police and fire houses in New York City to commemorate the attack.

The Acting Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Philip Reeker attended a special changing of the guard at Windsor Castle during which the US National Anthem was performed.

==Annual commemorations==

* Every year on September 11, a commemoration is held at the National September 11 Memorial. Family members read the names of victims of the attacks, as well as victims of the 1993 World Trade Center truck bombing. Elected officials and other dignitaries attend as well.
* The &quot;Tribute in Light&quot; project consists of 88 searchlights placed next to the site of the World Trade Center created two vertical columns of light. The tribute began in 2001, and is now made every year on September 11.
* Every year on September 11 in Nissoria, Sicily, Italy, a memorial service is held for two citizens of Nissoria who died in the September 11 attacks.

==Memorial flags==

The National 9/11 Flag was made from a tattered remains of a American flag found by recovery workers in the early morning of September 12, 2001. It was hanging precariously from some scaffolding at a construction site next to Ground Zero. Because of safety reasons the flag could not be taken down until late October 2001. Charlie Vitchers, a construction superintendent for the Ground Zero cleanup effort, had a crew recover the flag. It was placed in storage for seven years.

The flag has made a number of appearances across the country, including a Boston Red Sox Game, a New York Giants Home Opener, and the USS &quot;New York&quot; Commissioning Ceremony. It also appeared on the CBS Evening News and on ABC World News Tonight &quot;Persons of the Week.&quot;

The flag began a national tour on Flag day, which was on June 14, 2009. It visited all 50 states where service heroes, veterans, and other honorees each added stitching and material from other retired American flags in order to restore the original 13 stripes of the flag. The flag now resides at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.

The 9-11 Remembrance Flag was created to be a permanent reminder of the thousands of people lost in the September 11 attacks. The purpose of keeping the memories of September 11 alive is not to be forever mourning, but for &quot;learning from the circumstances and making every effort to prevent similar tragedies in our future.&quot; The flag is also meant to be a reminder of how the people of this country came together to help each other after the attacks. The red background of the flag represents the blood shed by Americans for their country. The stars represent the lost airplanes and their passengers. The blue rectangles stand for the twin towers and the white pentagon represents the Pentagon building. The blue circle symbolizes the unity of this country after the attacks.

The 9/11 National Remembrance Flag was designed by Stephan and Joanne Galvin soon after September 11, 2001. They wanted to do something to help and were inspired by a neighbor&#x27;s POW/MIA flag. They wanted to sell the flag so people would remember the September 11 attacks and in order to raise money for relief efforts. The blue represents the colors of the state flags that were involved in the attacks. The black represents sorrow for innocent lives lost. The four stars stand for the four planes that crashed and the lives lost, both in the crash and in the rescue efforts, as well as the survivors. The blue star is a representation of American Airlines Flight 77 and the Pentagon. The two white stars represent American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines flight 175, as well as the twin towers. The red star stands for United Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and all those who sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent. The colors of the stars represent the American flag. The four stars are touching each other and the blue parts of the flag in order to symbolize the unity of the people of the United States.

The National Flag of Honor and the National Flag of Heroes were created by John Michelotti for three main reasons: (1)&quot;To immortalize the individual victims that were killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.&quot; (2)&quot;To give comfort to the families left behind knowing that their loved one will be forever honored and remembered.&quot; (2)&quot;To create an enduring symbol, recognized by the world, of the human sacrifice that occurred on September 11, 2001.&quot;

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes are based on the American flag. They both have the names of all the innocent people who were killed in the September 11 attacks printed on the red and white stripes of the American Flag. Both flags have a white space across the bottom with the name of the flag and a description printed in black. The Flag of Honor reads: &quot;This flag contains the names of those killed in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them&quot; The Flag of Heroes reads: &quot; This flag contains the names of the emergency service personnel who gave their lives to save others in the terrorist attacks of September 11. Now and forever it will represent their immortality. We shall never forget them.&quot;

The Flag of Honor and the Flag of Heroes were featured at the NYC 9/11 Memorial Field 5th Anniversary in Manhattan&#x27;s Inwood Hill Park September 8–12, 2006. There 3,000 flags which represented those who died in the September 11 attacks. The flags were also featured on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; and on ABC affiliate WVEC in Norfolk, Virginia.

The Remembrance Flag has a white background with large, black Roman numerals IX/XI in the center and four black stars across the top. The IX/XI are the Roman numerals for 9/11. The four stars represent World Trade Center North, World Trade Center South, the Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA.

==Virtual memorials==
The growing popularity of virtual worlds such as &quot;Second Life&quot; has led to the construction of permanent virtual memorials and exhibits. Examples include:
* Celestial Requiem NYC (Second Life) is a virtual recreation of a submitted physical memorial proposal:

On September 11, 2007, a virtual reality World Trade Center Memorial will be presented to the people of the world. The location is in Second Life, on the island we have named after the original design: Celestial Requiem NYC. We have built this memorial because, to be blunt, the world needed it done years ago, and the two years longer to await the completion of the &quot;Reflected Absence&quot; memorial in New York city (by Michael Arad and Peter Walker) was in our opinion two years too long.

* World Trade Center Memorial (&quot;Second Life&quot;) is focused on the victims of 9/11, reminiscent of the Memorial Wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

===Planned September 11 memorials===
* Palm Harbor 9/11 Memorial, Palm Harbor, Florida – This memorial broke ground . It will be designed around a 150-pound piece of World Trade Center steel provided (and still owned) by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

<doc id="28051" wikidata="Q4698977" url="?curid=28051" title="Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks">
<text>After the September 11 attacks, there was an immediate call to action regarding the state of aviation security measures as the hijackers involved in 9/11 were able to successfully pass through security and take command of the plane. The existing security measures flagged more than half of the 19 hijackers in 9/11; however, they were cleared to board the plane because their bags were not found to contain any explosives. In the months and years following September 11, 2001, security at many airports worldwide were reformed to deter similar terrorist plots.

==Changes in airport security==
Prior to September 11, 2001, airport screening was provided in the U.S. by private security companies contracted by the airline or airport. In November 2001, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was introduced to take over all of the security functions of the country&#x27;s airports. The TSA increased the number of security agents employed from 16,200 to 56,000 and increased their compensation. In addition, they reformed the training for these agents. Prior to 9/11, the security staff was generally undertrained with a reported training time of 12 hours prior to 9/11; afterwards, this training was increased to more than 100 hours. They also implemented verification tests of the training by projecting images of banned objects on machines to see if workers would be able to identify them. The actual process of security screening was revised as well after 9/11. Passenger pre-checks became standard and the percent of baggage screened for explosives increased from an approximate 5% to 100%. In some countries, for example, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, there were no or only random security checks for domestic flights prior to 09/11/2001. On or quickly after September 11, decisions were made to introduce full security checks there. It was immediately implemented where possible, but took one to two years to implement everywhere since terminals were often not prepared with room for it. The TSA also introduced changes on the airplanes themselves, including bulletproof and locked cockpit doors and air marshals which became standard on commercial passenger aircraft.

===Increased security on aircraft===
Cockpit doors on many aircraft are reinforced and bulletproof to prevent unauthorized access. Passengers are now prohibited from entering the cockpit during flight. Some aircraft are also equipped with CCTV cameras, so the pilots can monitor cabin activity. Pilots are now allowed to carry firearms, but they must be trained and licensed. In the U.S., more air marshals have been placed on flights to improve security.

===Increased security screening===
On September 11, hijackers Khalid al-Mihdhar, Majed Moqed, and Nawaf al-Hazmi all set off the metal detector. Despite being scanned with a hand-held detector, the hijackers were passed through. Security camera footage later showed some hijackers had what appeared to be box cutters clipped to their back pockets. Box cutters and similar small knives were allowed onboard certain aircraft at the time.

Airport checkpoint screening has been significantly tightened since 2001, and security personnel are more thoroughly trained to detect weapons or explosives. In addition to standard metal detectors, many U.S. airports now employ full-body scanning machines, in which passengers are screened with millimeter wave technology to check for potential hidden weapons or explosives on their persons. Initially, early body scanners provoked quite a bit of controversy because the images produced by the machines were deemed graphic and intrusive. Many considered this an invasion of personal privacy, as TSA screeners were essentially shown an image of each passenger&#x27;s naked body. Newer body scanners have since been introduced which do not produce an image, but rather alert TSA screeners of areas on the body where an unknown item or substance may be hidden. A TSA security screener then inspects the indicated area(s) manually.

===Identification checks===
On September 11, some hijackers lacked proper identification, yet they were allowed to board due to being on domestic aircraft. After 9/11, all passengers 18 years or older in the United States must now have valid government-issued photo ID in order to fly. Airports may check the ID of any passenger (and staff member) at any time to ensure the details on the ID match those on the printed boarding pass. Only under exceptional circumstances may an individual fly without a valid ID. If approved for flying without an ID, the individual will be subject to extra screening of their person and their carry-on items. TSA does not have the capability to conduct background checks on passengers at checkpoints. Sensitive areas in airports, including airport ramps and operational spaces, are restricted from the general public. Called a SIDA (Security Identification Display Area) in the U.S., these spaces require special qualifications to enter. Non-passengers can also no longer meet passengers at their gate inside the terminal, but rather must wait on the other side of the TSA security check.

A European Union regulation demanded airlines make sure that the individual boarding the aircraft is the same individual who checked in his or her luggage; this was implemented by verifying an individual&#x27;s identification both at luggage check-in and when boarding.

Some countries also fingerprint travellers or use retina and iris scanning to help detect potential criminals, although this is predominantly in relation to detection of immigration violations by inbound passengers rather than security checking of outbound passengers.

==Criticism==
With regard to the 2015 Germanwings flight 9525 crash incident, a suicide by pilot where the captain was unable to regain access to the flight deck, some have stated that security features added to commercial airliners after 9/11 actually work against the safety of such planes.

===Lawsuit===
In 2003, John Gilmore sued United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and then-U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, arguing that requiring passengers to show identification before boarding domestic flights is tantamount to an internal passport, and is unconstitutional. Gilmore lost the case, known as &quot;Gilmore v. Gonzales&quot;, and an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.

==== Privacy issues ====
Air security and restrictions after the September, 2001 terrorist attacks have helped prevent further attacks from happening, but many Americans have issues with their privacy when traveling. The Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), was first implemented in the late 1990&#x27;s by the FFA. CAPPS flagged 6 of the 19 terrorists that were part of the attacks in 2001. The concern with CAPPS was that it also flagged 65,000 other passengers that day. Many Americans viewed this as a threat to their privacy and their information. CAPPS II was created post 9/11 and was created for the same purpose of preventing terrorist attacks and ensuring the safety of Americans. Many Americans had issues with CAPPS II because they believe that it racially and politically profiled passengers. In 2004, the TSA was delayed in testing and developing CAPPS II because they could not obtain passenger data because of privacy concerns.

<text>After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the United States government responded by commencing immediate rescue operations at the World Trade Center site, grounding civilian aircraft, and beginning a long-term response that included official investigations, legislative changes, military action, and restoration projects. 

Immediately following the attacks, massive search and rescue operations were launched, and terrorism investigations led to the declaration of War on Terrorism that launched military engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq. The &quot;9/11 Commission&quot; inspected the causes and motives of the attacks, and released its findings in the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;. 

As a result of the attacks, the U.S. federal government enacted the Homeland Security Act of 2002, creating the Department of Homeland Security, and the USA PATRIOT Act, to help detect and prosecute terrorism and other crimes. Subsequent clean-up and restoration efforts led to the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, and federal grants helped support the development of the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum, both of which opened in the early 2010s.

==Investigations==


===&quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;===
The &quot;National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States&quot;, known as the 9/11 Commission and chaired by former New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, was formed in late 2002 to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the attacks, including preparedness for, and the immediate response to, the September 11 attacks. On July 22, 2004, the commission released its findings in the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;.

===Internal CIA review===
The Central Intelligence Agency Office of Inspector General conducted an internal review of the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s performance prior to the September 11 attacks and was harshly critical of senior CIA officials for not doing everything possible to confront terrorism, including failing to stop two of the 9/11 hijackers, Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar, as they entered the United States, and hit failure to share information on the two men with the FBI.

===World Trade Center collapse===

A federal technical building and fire safety investigation of the collapses of the Twin Towers was conducted by the United States Department of Commerce&#x27;s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The goals of this investigation were to investigate the building construction, the materials used, and the technical conditions that contributed to the outcome of the WTC disaster. The investigation was to serve as the basis for:
*Improvements in the way buildings are designed, constructed, maintained, and used
*Improved tools and guidance for industry and safety officials
*Revisions to building and fire codes, standards, and practices
*Improved public safety
The report was completed on April 6, 2005, concluding that the fireproofing on the Twin Towers&#x27; steel infrastructures was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, if this had not occurred, the towers would likely have remained standing. The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making them sag. The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns to the point where exterior columns bowed inward. With the damage to the core columns, the buckling exterior columns could no longer support the buildings, causing them to collapse. In addition, the report asserts that the towers&#x27; stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide emergency escape for people above the impact zones. NIST stated that the final report on the collapse of 7 WTC will appear in a separate report.

==Civilian aircraft grounding==

For the first time in history, all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the United States and several other countries including Canada were immediately grounded, stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the world. The order was given at 9:42 by Federal Aviation Administration Command Center national operations manager Ben Sliney. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, &quot;This was an unprecedented order. The air traffic control system handled it with great skill, as about 4,500 commercial and general aviation aircraft soon landed without incident.

==Invocation of the continuity of government==
Contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders were implemented almost immediately after the attacks. Congress, however, was not told that the US was under a continuity of government status until February 2002.

==Rescue, recovery, and compensation==

Within hours of the attacks on New York City, a massive search and rescue (SAR) operation was launched, which included over 350 search and rescue dogs. Initially, only a handful of wounded people were found at the site, and in the weeks that followed it became evident that there weren&#x27;t any survivors to be found. Only twenty survivors were found alive in the rubble.

Rescue and recovery efforts took months to complete. It took several weeks to put out the fires burning in the rubble of the buildings, with the clean-up not being completed until May 2002. Temporary wooden &quot;viewing platforms&quot; were set up for tourists to view construction crews clearing out the gaping holes where the towers once stood. All of these platforms were closed on May 30, 2002.

Many relief funds were set up to assist victims of the attacks, with the task of providing financial assistance to the survivors and families of victims. By the deadline for victim&#x27;s compensation of September 11, 2003, 2,833 applications had been received from the families of those killed.

==War on Terror==

In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks, many U.S. citizens believed that the attacks had &quot;changed the world forever.&quot; The Bush administration announced a war on terror, with the goal of bringing Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals would be accomplished by means including economic and military sanctions against states perceived as harboring terrorists and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing. Immediately after the September 11 attacks, U.S. officials speculated on possible involvement by Saddam Hussein, which later was proven to be false.

As the attacks on the United States were judged to be within the parameters of its charter, NATO declared that Article 5 of the NATO agreement was satisfied on September 12, 2001, making the US war on terrorism the first time since its inception that NATO would actually participate in a &quot;hot&quot; war.

Osama bin Laden himself was located by US intelligence in 2011, and was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan by a US special operations unit on 2 May 2011.

In 2014, President Barack Obama claimed the formal end of the war in Afghanistan. However, U.S. troops did not withdraw entirely, as fewer than 15,000 troops still remained in the country. 

From 2019 to August 30, 2021, President Joe Biden withdrew the remaining 14,000 U.S. troops from Afghanistan, marking the official end of the 2001-2021 war.

Ayman al-Zawahiri, another planner of the attacks who succeeded Bin Laden as leader of Al-Qaeda, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in Kabul, Afghanistan on July 31, 2022.

==Arrests==
Following the attacks, 762 suspects were taken into custody in the United States. On December 12, 2001, Fox News reported that some 60 Israelis were among them. Federal investigators were reported to have described them as part of a long-running effort to spy on American government officials. A &quot;handful&quot; of these Israelis were described as active Israeli military or intelligence operatives.

In a letter to the editor, Ira Glaser, former head of the ACLU, claimed that none of those 762 detainees were charged with terrorism. &quot;The Justice Department inspector general&#x27;s report implies more than the violation of the civil liberties of 762 non-citizens. It also implies a dysfunctional and ineffective approach to protecting the public after Sept. 11, 2001... No one can be made safer by arresting the wrong people&quot;.

==Domestic response==
Immediately after opening the hunt on Osama bin Laden, President Bush also visited the Islamic Center of Washington and asked the public to view Arabs and Muslims living in the United States as American patriots. However, Islamophobia, or the fear of, hatred of, or prejudice against the religion of Islam or Muslims in general, still rose. Incidents of harassment and hate crimes against Muslims, Arabs, Middle Easterners, and South Asians was reported rose by a factor of more than 16 in the days following the attacks.

Congress passed and President Bush signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, creating the Department of Homeland Security, representing the largest restructuring of the U.S. government in contemporary history. Congress passed the USA PATRIOT Act, stating that it would help detect and prosecute terrorism and other crimes. Civil liberties groups have criticized the PATRIOT Act, saying that it allows law enforcement to invade the privacy of citizens and eliminates judicial oversight of law-enforcement and domestic intelligence gathering. The Bush Administration also invoked 9/11 as the reason to have the National Security Agency initiate a secret operation, &quot;to eavesdrop on telephone and e-mail communications between the United States and people overseas without court approval.&quot;

=== National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) ===

On June 6, 2002, Attorney General Ashcroft proposed regulations that would create a special registration program that required males aged 16 to 64 who were citizens of designated foreign nations resident in the U.S. to register with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), have their identity verified, and be interviewed, photographed and fingerprinted. Called the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS), it comprised two programs, the tracking of arrivals and departures on the one hand, and voluntary registrations of those already in the U.S., known as the &quot;call-in&quot; program. The DOJ acted under the authority of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which had authorized a registration system but was allowed to lapse in the 1980s because of budget concerns. Ashcroft identified those required to register as &quot;individuals of elevated national security concern who stay in the country for more than 30 days.&quot;

The processing of arrivals as part of their customs screening began in October 2002. It first focused on arrivals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. It handled 127,694 people before being phased out as universal screening processes were put in place.

The &quot;call-in&quot; registrations began in December. It initially applied to nationals of five countries, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Sudan, who were required to register by December 16, 2002. On November 6, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) set a deadline of January 10 for those from another 13 countries: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Eritrea, Lebanon, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Qatar, Somalia, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. On December 16, it set a deadline of February 21 for those from Armenia, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. It later included those from Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. It eventually included citizens of 23 nations with majority Muslim populations, as well as Eritrea, which has a large Muslim population, and North Korea. Failure to register at an INS office resulted in deportation. Those found in violation of their visa were allowed to post bail while processed for deportation. The program registered 82,880 people, of whom 13,434 were found in violation of their visas. Because nationality and Muslim affiliation are only approximations of one another, the program extended to such non-Muslims as Iranian Jews. The program was phased out beginning in May 2003.

The program received a mixed response. Some government officials pronounced the program a success. They said in the course of the combined programs, registration upon entry, and that of residents, they had arrested 11 suspected terrorists, found more than 800 criminal suspects or deportable convicts, and identified more than 9,000 illegal aliens. DOJ general counsel Kris Kobach said: &quot;I regard this as a great success. Sept. 11th awakened the country to the fact that weak immigration enforcement presents a huge vulnerability that terrorists can exploit.&quot; DOJ officials said fewer than 5% of those who came into INS offices to register were detained. James W. Ziglar, former head of INS who left the agency early in 2002, in part because of his differing opinions about the program with Ashcroft, said his objections to it had been proven correct: &quot;The people who could be identified as terrorists weren&#x27;t going to show up. This project was a huge exercise and caused us to use resources in the field that could have been much better deployed.&quot; &quot;As expected, we got nothing out of it.&quot; Although Homeland Security officials said that six men allegedly linked to terrorism were arrested as a result of the call-in program, that contention was challenged by the Sept. 11 commission, which found little evidence to support that claim.

In 2011, DHS suspended the program on efficiency grounds, stating that all NSEERS information was now collected from other sources. It completely glossed over the program&#x27;s civil liberties costs and did not communicate with those harmed by the program, according to the ACLU. NSEERS was finally officially terminated in 2016 by the Obama administration in order to make it more difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to achieve his goal of introducing a Muslim registry.

<doc id="28064" wikidata="Q5449693" url="?curid=28064" title="Financial assistance following the September 11 attacks">
<text>Charities and relief agencies raised over $657 million in the three weeks following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the vast bulk going to immediate survivors and victims&#x27; families.

== Government assistance ==
On September 21, 2001, the Congress approved a bill to aid the airline industry and establish a federal fund for victims. The cost of the mostly open-ended fund reached $7 billion. Victims of earlier terrorist attacks, including those linked to al-Qaida, were not included in the fund, nor were those who would not surrender the right to hold the airlines legally responsible.

== American Red Cross ==
In the aftermath of the attack, the American Red Cross&#x27; Liberty Fund amassed $547 million in donations. The charitable organization halted the collection of donations in October 2001, announcing that the monies pledged would be enough to cover immediate and longterm efforts to support the victims of the attack. While the Red Cross initially announced its intentions to put as much as $247 million of the fund toward preparedness for future terrorist attacks, the organization reversed course in the wake of extreme criticism and announced the entire fund would go toward victims.

In February of 2002, the New York Times reported that the Red Cross had &quot;distributed about $200 million to more than 30,000 displaced workers&quot; as of the date of publication.

In addition to financial donations, the American Red Cross collected nearly 1.2 million units of blood between Sept. 11 and Oct. 30, according to a New York Times article published in November of 2001.

== Other charitable drives ==
* In the Washington, D.C. area (Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area), &quot;Giant Food&quot; offered to match contributions made in-store up to $1 million.
* The Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund was created to support the families of the 79 employees of the Windows on the World restaurant.
* Arista Records re-released singer Whitney Houston&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; as a charity single following the attacks, with all profits going towards the firefighters and victims of the attacks. Mariah Carey also recorded a charity single, &quot;Never Too Far/Hero Medley&quot;, released on the Virgin Records label.
* In Ireland, the National Fire Brigade Committee opened a disaster fund to raise money for the families of those injured or killed in the attacks.
* Pop singer Britney Spears donated $1 to the children of firefighters, police officers and EMT&#x27;s who were killed on 9/11 from every ticket sold from her Dream Within a Dream Tour in 2001 and 2002.

== Emergency supplies ==
On Thursday and Friday, September 14–15 September 2001, various relief supplies for the World Trade Center relief effort were collected from the New York City area, and dropped off at the Javits Convention Center or at a staging area at Union Square. By Saturday morning, enough supplies (and volunteers) were collected.

== Memorial funds ==
Many families and friends of victims have set up memorial funds and projects to give back to their communities and change the world in honor of their loved ones&#x27; lives. Examples include:

* Beyond the 11th
* The Peter M. Goodrich Memorial Foundation
* Our Voices Together
* September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows
* Heroic Choices (originally the Todd M. Beamer Foundation)
* Tuesday&#x27;s Children

<doc id="28066" wikidata="Q7315010" url="?curid=28066" title="Rescue and recovery effort after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center">
<text>The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center elicited a large response of local emergency and rescue personnel to assist in the evacuation of the two towers, resulting in a large loss of the same personnel when the towers collapsed. After the attacks, the media termed the World Trade Center site &quot;Ground Zero&quot;, while rescue personnel referred to it as &quot;the Pile&quot;.

In the ensuing recovery and cleanup efforts, personnel related to the metalwork and construction professions would descend on the site to offer their services and remained until the site was cleared in May 2002. In the years since, investigations and studies have examined effects upon those who participated, noting a variety of afflictions attributed to the debris and stress.

==Building evacuation==

After American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower (1 WTC) of the World Trade Center, a standard announcement was given to tenants in the South Tower (2 WTC) to stay put and that the building was secure. However, many defied those instructions and proceeded to evacuate the South Tower (most notably, Rick Rescorla, Morgan Stanley Security Director, evacuated 2,687 of the 2,700 Morgan Stanley employees in the building). People evacuating from WTC 2 were ordered up from the lobby level to a door on the mezzanine level that led to a covered footbridge over West Street to a building complex then called the World Financial Center. People evacuating from WTC 1 were directed from the lobby level through the WTC shopping mall beneath the outdoor plaza. The firefighters directing evacuees did not want anyone going through the front doors because of falling debris and falling people.

Standard evacuation procedures for fires in the World Trade Center called for evacuating only the floors immediately above and below the fire, as simultaneous evacuation of up to 50,000 workers would be too chaotic.

==Emergency response==

=== Firefighters ===

Firefighters from the New York City Fire Department rushed to the World Trade Center minutes after the first plane struck the North Tower. Chief Joseph W. Pfeifer and his crew with Battalion 1 were among the first on the scene (Battalion 1 was the first Unit to notify the Manhattan Central Office.). Engine 10 and Ladder 10 were also some of the first on scene because their firehouse was directly across the street from the Towers. At 8:50 a.m., an Incident Command Post was established in the lobby of the North Tower. By 9:00 a.m., shortly before United Airlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower, the FDNY chief had arrived and took over command of the response operations. Concerned about falling debris, he moved the incident command center to a spot located across West Street, but numerous fire chiefs remained in the lobby which continued to serve as an operations post where alarms, elevators, communications systems, and other equipment were operated. The initial response by the FDNY was on rescue and evacuation of building occupants, which involved sending firefighters up to assist people that were trapped in elevators and elsewhere. Firefighters were also required to ensure all floors were completely evacuated.

Numerous staging areas were set up near the World Trade Center, where responding fire units could report and get deployment instructions. However, many firefighters arrived at the World Trade Center without stopping at the staging areas, partly because at 8:48 a.m. Battalion 1 transmitted a Third Alarm and ordered third alarm units to the Staging Area and second alarm units to the Towers. As a result, many chiefs could not keep track of the whereabouts of their units. Numerous firefighters reported directly to the building lobbies and were ordered by those commanding the operating post to proceed into the building.

Problems with radio communication caused commanders to lose contact with many of the firefighters who went into the buildings. The repeater system in the World Trade Center, which was required for portable radio signals to transmit reliably, was malfunctioning after the impact of the planes. As a result, firefighters were unable to report to commanders on their progress, and were unable to hear evacuation orders. In addition, many off-duty firefighters arrived to help without their radios. FDNY commanders lacked communication with the NYPD, who had helicopters at the scene, or with Emergency Medical Services (EMS) dispatchers. The firefighters on the scene also did not have access to television reports or other outside information, which could help in assessing the situation. When the South Tower collapsed at 9:59 a.m., firefighters in the North Tower were not aware of exactly what happened. The battalion chief in the North Tower lobby immediately issued an order over the radio for firefighters in the tower to evacuate, but many did not hear the order on the faulty radios. Because of this, 342 firefighters died in the collapse of the towers.

The command post located across West Street was taken out when the South Tower collapsed, making command and control even more difficult and disorganized. When the North Tower collapsed, falling debris killed Peter Ganci, the FDNY chief. Following the collapse of the World Trade Center, a command post was set up at a firehouse in Greenwich Village.

The FDNY deployed more than 200 units (about half of all units) to the site, with more than 400 firefighters on the scene when the buildings collapsed. This included a total of 121 engine companies, 62 ladder companies, and other special units. The FDNY also received assistance from fire departments in Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester County, and other neighboring jurisdictions, but with limited ability to manage and coordinate efforts.
Besides assisting with recovery operations at Ground Zero, volunteer firefighters from Long Island and Westchester manned numerous firehouses throughout the city to assist with other fire and emergency calls.

=== Doctors, EMS, and other medical staff ===
FDNY Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and Paramedics, along with 9-1-1 system ambulances operated by voluntary hospitals and volunteer ambulance corps, began arriving at 8:53 a.m., and quickly set up a staging area outside the North Tower, at West Street, which was quickly moved over to the corner of Vesey and West Streets. As more providers responded to the scene, five triage areas were set up around the World Trade Center site. EMS chiefs experienced difficulties communicating via their radios because of the overwhelming volume of radio traffic. At 9:45, an additional dispatch channel was set aside for use by chiefs and supervisors only, but many did not know about this and continued to operate on the other channel. The communication difficulties meant that commanders lacked good situational awareness.

Dispatchers at the 9-1-1 call center, who coordinate EMS response and assign units, were overwhelmed with incoming calls, as well as communications over the radio system. Dispatchers were unable to process and make sense of all the incoming information, including information from people trapped in the towers, about conditions on the upper floors. Overwhelmed dispatchers were unable to effectively give instructions and manage the situation.

EMS personnel were in disarray after the collapse of the South Tower at 9:59 a.m. Following the collapse of the North Tower at 10:28 a.m., EMS commanders regrouped on the North End of Battery Park City, at the Embassy Suites Hotel. Around 11:00 a.m., EMS triage centers were relocated and consolidated at the Chelsea Piers and the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. Throughout the early afternoon, the soundstages at the pier were separated into two areas, one for the more seriously injured and one for the walking wounded. On the acute side, multiple makeshift tables, each with a physician, nurse, and other health care workers, and non-emergency service volunteers, were set up for the arrival of mass casualties.

Supplies, including equipment for airway and vascular control, were obtained from neighboring hospitals. Throughout the afternoon, local merchants arrived to donate food. Despite this, few patients arrived for treatment, the earliest at about 5 p.m., and were not seriously injured, being limited to smoke inhalation. An announcement was made around 6–7 p.m. that a second shift of providers would cover the evening shift, and that an area was being set up for the day personnel to sleep. Soon after, when it was realized that few would have survived the collapse and be brought to the piers, many decided to leave and the area was closed down.

===Police===

The New York City Police Department quickly responded with the Emergency Service Units (ESU) and other responders after the crash of American Airlines Flight 11 into the North Tower. The NYPD set up its incident command center at Church Street and Vesey Street, on the opposite side of the World Trade Center from where the FDNY was commanding its operations. NYPD helicopters were soon at the scene, reporting on the status of the burning buildings. When the buildings collapsed, 23 NYPD officers were killed, along with 37 Port Authority Police Department officers. The NYPD helped facilitate the evacuation of civilians out of Lower Manhattan, including approximately 5,000 civilians evacuated by the Harbor Unit to Staten Island and to New Jersey. In ensuing days, the police department worked alternating 12-hour shifts to help in the rescue and recovery efforts.

=== Coast Guard, maritime industry, individual boat owners ===

Immediately after the first attack, the captains and crews of a large number of local boats steamed into the attack zone to assist in evacuation. These ships had responded to a request from the U.S. Coast Guard to help evacuate those stranded on Manhattan Island. Others, such as the &quot;John J. Harvey&quot;, provided supplies and water, which became urgently needed after the Towers&#x27; collapse severed downtown water mains. The Coast Guard Auxiliary helped lead a massive maritime evacuation with estimates of the number of people evacuated by water from Lower Manhattan that day in the eight-hour period following the attacks ranging from 500,000 to 1,000,000. Norman Mineta, Secretary of Transportation during the attacks, called the efforts &quot;the largest maritime evacuation conducted in the United States&quot;. The evacuation was the largest maritime evacuation or &quot;boatlift&quot; in history by most estimates, passing the nine-day evacuation of Dunkirk during World War II. As many as 2,000 people injured in the attacks were evacuated by these means.

===Amateur radio===

Amateur radio played a role in the rescue and clean-up efforts. Amateur radio operators established communications, maintained emergency networks, and formed bucket brigades with hundreds of other volunteer personnel. Approximately 500 amateur radio operators volunteered their services during the disaster and recovery.

The New Jersey Legislature honored the role of Amateur Radio operators in a proclamation on December 12, 2002.

Note: &quot;Government exhibits are from the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui.&quot;

==Search and rescue efforts==
On the day following the attacks, eleven people were rescued from the rubble, including six firefighters and three police officers. One woman was rescued from the rubble, near where a West Side Highway pedestrian bridge had been. Two PAPD officers, John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, were also rescued. Discovered by former U.S. Marines Jason Thomas and Dave Karnes, McLoughlin and Jimeno were pulled out alive after spending nearly 24 hours beneath of rubble. Their rescue was later portrayed in the 2006 film &quot;World Trade Center&quot;. In total, twenty survivors were pulled out of the rubble. The final survivor, Port Authority secretary Genelle Guzman-McMillan, was rescued 27 hours after the collapse of the North Tower.

Some firefighters and civilians who survived made cell phone calls from voids beneath the rubble, though the amount of debris made it difficult for rescue workers to get to them.

By Wednesday night, 82 deaths had been confirmed by officials in New York City.

Rescue efforts were paused numerous times in the days after the attack because nearby buildings, including One Liberty Plaza, were in danger of collapsing. The last fires at the World Trade Center site were extinguished on December 20, exactly 100 days after the attacks.

==Recovery efforts==

The search and rescue effort in the immediate aftermath at the World Trade Center site involved ironworkers, structural engineers, heavy machinery operators, asbestos workers, boilermakers, carpenters, cement masons, construction managers, electricians, insulators, machinists, plumbers and pipefitters, riggers, sheet metal workers, steelworkers, truckers and teamsters, American Red Cross volunteers, and many others. Lower Manhattan, south of 14th Street, was off-limits, except for rescue and recovery workers. There were also about 400 working dogs, the largest deployment of dogs in the nation&#x27;s history.

===Organization===
New York City Office of Emergency Management was the agency responsible for coordination of the city&#x27;s response to the attacks. Headed by then-Director Richard Sheirer, the agency was forced to vacate its headquarters, located in 7 World Trade Center, within hours of the attack. The building later collapsed. OEM reestablished operations temporarily at the police academy, where Mayor Giuliani gave many press conferences throughout the afternoon and evening of September 11. By Friday, rescue and reliefs were organized and administered from Pier 92 on the Hudson River.

Volunteers quickly descended on Ground Zero to help in the rescue and recovery efforts. At Jacob Javits Convention Center, thousands showed up to offer help, where they registered with authorities. Construction projects around the city came to a halt, as workers walked off the jobs to help at Ground Zero. Ironworkers, welders, steel burners, and others with such skills were in high demand. By the end of the first week, over one thousand ironworkers from across North America had arrived to help, along with countless others.

The New York City Department of Design &amp; Construction oversaw the recovery efforts. Beginning on September 12, the Structural Engineers Association of New York (SEAoNY) became involved in the recovery efforts, bringing in experts to review the stability of the rubble, evaluate safety of hundreds of buildings near the site, and designing support for the cranes brought in to clear the debris. The City of New York hired the engineering firm, LZA-Thornton Tomasetti, to oversee the structural engineering operations at the site.

To make the effort more manageable, the World Trade Center site was divided into four quadrants or zones. Each zone was assigned a lead contractor, and a team of three structural engineers, subcontractors, and rescue workers.
* AMEC – North Tower along West Street
* Bovis Lend Lease – South Tower along Liberty Street
* Tully Construction Company, Inc. – Eastern portion of the WTC site
* Turner/Plaza Construction Joint Venture – Northern portion and 7 World Trade Center

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the New York City Office of Emergency Management (OEM) provided support. Forestry incident management teams (IMTs) also provided support beginning in the days after the attacks to help manage operations.

A nearby Burger King restaurant was used as a center for police operations. Given that workers worked at the site, or &quot;The Pile&quot;, for shifts as long as twelve hours, a specific culture developed at the site, leading to workers developing their own argot.

===Debris removal===
&quot;The Pile&quot; was the term coined by the rescue workers to describe the 1.8 million tons of wreckage left from the collapse of the World Trade Center. They avoided the use of &quot;ground zero&quot;, which describes the epicenter of a bomb explosion.

Numerous volunteers organized to form &quot;bucket brigades&quot;, which passed 5-gallon buckets full of debris down a line to investigators, who sifted through the debris in search of evidence and human remains. Ironworkers helped cut up steel beams into more manageable sizes for removal. Much of the debris was hauled off to the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island where it was further searched and sorted.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, by September 24, 2001, more than 100,000 tons of debris had been removed from the site. Some structural engineers have criticized the decision to recycle the steel from the buildings before it could be analyzed as part of the post-collapse investigation.

====Reuse of steel====
Some of the steel was reused for memorials. New York City firefighters donated a cross made of steel from the World Trade Center to the Shanksville Volunteer Fire Company in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The beam, mounted atop a platform shaped like the Pentagon, was erected outside the Shanksville&#x27;s firehouse near the crash site of United Airlines Flight 93.

Twenty-four tons of the steel used in construction of USS &quot;New York&quot; (LPD-21) came from the small amount of rubble from the World Trade Center preserved for posterity.

====Vaulted bullion====
In the days following the destruction of the towers, rescuers found scorch marks, likely made by a cutting torch on a basement doorway underneath 4 WTC; this was thought to be the result of looters. Further exploration of the building&#x27;s basement revealed that the vault contained large amounts of gold and silver in the form of coins, as well as gold and silver bars. An armored truck operated by COMEX was also located below the World Trade Center among the other vehicles, which was fully loaded with gold and silver bars. In order to retrieve the bullion from the vault, electricity had to be supplied to its doors, which had withstood the force of the destruction above them.

Over the subsequent months, much of the bullion was recovered. Approximately 560,000 dollars worth of coins and bars were stored in the vault by the Bank of Nova Scotia prior to September 11, 2001, with the bank having stored a total of 379,036 troy ounces of gold and 29,942,619 troy ounces of silver inside the vault. Many of these coins were purchased by Lee S. Minshull of Palos Verdes, California, who then sent them to PCGS for grading in 2002. These coins were then sold to collectors. Coins salvaged from 4 WTC&#x27;s vault included American Silver Eagles, Canadian Gold Maple Leafs, South African Krugerrands and British Gold Britannias.

====Hazards====
Hazards at the World Trade Center site included a diesel fuel tank buried seven stories below. Approximately 2,000 automobiles that had been in the parking garage also presented a risk, with each containing, on average, at least of gasoline. Once recovery workers reached down to the parking garage level, they found some cars that had exploded and burned. The United States Customs Service, which was housed in 6 World Trade Center, had 1.2 million rounds of ammunition and weapons in storage in a third-floor vault, to support their firing range.

===Morale===

In the hours immediately after the attacks on the World Trade Center, three firefighters raised an American flag over the rubble. The flag was taken from a yacht, and the moment, which was captured on a well-known photograph, evoked comparisons to the iconic Iwo Jima photograph. Morale of rescue workers was boosted on September 14, 2001, when President George W. Bush paid a visit to Ground Zero. Standing with retired firefighter Bob Beckwith, Bush addressed the firefighters and rescue workers with a bullhorn and thanked them. Bush later remarked, &quot;I&#x27;m shocked at the size of the devastation, It&#x27;s hard to describe what it&#x27;s like to see the gnarled steel and broken glass and twisted buildings silhouetted against the smoke. I said that this was the first act of war on America in the 21st century, and I was right, particularly having seen the scene.&quot; After some workers shouted that they could not hear the President, Bush famously responded by saying &quot;I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!&quot;

At some point, rescue workers realized that they were not going to find any more survivors. After a couple of weeks, the conditions at Ground Zero remained harsh, with lingering odors of decaying human remains and smoke. Morale among workers was boosted by letters they received from children around the United States and the world, as well as support from thousands of neighbors in TriBeCa and other Lower Manhattan neighborhoods.

This support continued to spread and eventually led to the founding of over 250 non-profit organizations of which raised almost $700 million within their first two years of operation. One of the nonprofits included One Day&#x27;s Pay, later changed to MyGoodDeed, which championed the effort to designate September 11 as an official National Day of Service (9/11 Day).

By 2012, many of the more than 250 organizations had disbanded for lack of funding. Of the ones that remain, a handful remained functioning for those who remain in need. One of these organizations, Tuesday&#x27;s Children, was founded the day after September 11 in hopes of supporting the children immediately affected by the attacks. The founder of this non-profit, David Weild IV, now calls them one of the &quot;last men standing&quot; in that they are now one of the few remaining organizations who &quot;provide direct services for what social-service groups and survivors of the attacks call the &#x27;9-11 Community.&#x27;&quot;

Other notable non-profits who are &quot;still standing&quot; include:
# VOICES of September 11 who are &quot;built on the mission of providing a &#x27;voice&#x27; for those who died in the attacks&quot; and &quot;provide case management services, focus groups, depression and anxiety screenings, among other help for victims&#x27; families&quot;
# New York Says Thank You which is based on the idea of reaching out and giving back to &quot;the communities who helped the city when it needed it the most&quot;
# Windows of Hope Family Relief Fund who &quot;provides financial aid, health insurance, and educational help to the families of hospitality-industry workers killed in the attack&quot;

==Military support==

=== Civil Air Patrol ===

Immediately following the attacks, members of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) were called up to help respond. Northeast Region placed its personnel and assets on alert moments after learning of the attack. With the exception of CAP, civilian flights were grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration. CAP flew aerial reconnaissance missions over Ground Zero in order to provide detailed analysis of the wreckage and aid in recovery efforts, including transportation of blood donations.

=== National Guard ===

Elements of the New York Army National Guard&#x27;s 1-101st Cavalry (Staten Island), 258th Field Artillery, 442nd Military Police Company, and 69th Infantry Regiment based in Manhattan were the first military force to secure Ground Zero on September 11. The 69th Infantry&#x27;s armory on Lexington Avenue became the Family Information Center to assist persons in locating missing family members.

The National Guard supplemented the NYPD and FDNY, with 2,250 guard members on the scene by the next morning. Eventually thousands of New York Army and Air National Guardsmen participated in the rescue/recovery efforts. They conducted site security at the WTC, and at other locations. They provided the NYPD with support for traffic control, and they participated directly in recovery operations providing manpower in the form of &quot;bucket brigades&quot; sorting through the debris by hand.

Additionally service members provided security at a variety of location throughout the city and New York State to deter further attacks and reassure the public.

Members of the Air National Guard&#x27;s 109th Airlift Wing out of Scotia, and Syracuse&#x27;s 174th Fighter Wing immediately responded to New York City, setting up camp at places such as Fort Hamilton. Mostly civil engineers, firefighters and military police, they greatly aided in the clean-up effort. F-16s from the 174th Fighter Wing also ramped up their flying sorties and patrolled the skies.

The New Jersey National Guard assisted the New York National Guard&#x27;s efforts following the attacks.

=== U.S. Marine Corps ===
U.S. Marines were also present to assist in the rescue efforts. No official numbers of men who helped out was released but there was evidence that they were there.
Films such as 2006 docudrama &quot;World Trade Center&quot; and the 2021 documentary &quot;9/11: One Day in America&quot; talked of two Marines who rescued two trapped police officers in the rubble. U.S. Marines were headquartered at 340 Westside Hwy Bloomberg News Building. The commanding officer was Navy Commander Hardy, and executive officer was Maj. Priester. These two oversaw 110 military personnel of various branches, various police departments and EMTs.

=== U.S. Navy ===
The U.S. Navy deployed a hospital ship USNS &quot;Comfort&quot; (T-AH-20) to Pier 92 in Manhattan. Crew members provided food and shelter for more than 10,000 relief workers. Comfort&#x27;s 24-hour galley also provided 30,000 meals. Its medical resources were also used to provide first-aid and sick call services to nearly 600 people. The ship&#x27;s psychological response team also saw more than 500 patients.

==Handling of cleanup procedure==

A May 14, 2007, &quot;New York Times&quot; article, &quot;Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani&#x27;s Legacy&quot;, gave the interpretation that thousands of workers at Ground Zero have become sick and that &quot;regard Mr. Giuliani&#x27;s triumph of leadership as having come with a human cost&quot;. The article reported that the mayor seized control of the cleanup of Ground Zero, taking control away from established federal agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He instead handed over responsibility to the &quot;largely unknown&quot; city Department of Design and Construction. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of respirators. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.

Workers at the Ground Zero pit worked without proper respirators. They wore painters&#x27; masks or no facial covering. Specialists claim that the only effective protection against toxins, such as airborne asbestos, is a special respirator. New York Committee for Occupational Safety and Health industrial hygienist David Newman said, &quot;I was down there watching people working without respirators.&quot; He continued, &quot;Others took off their respirators to eat. It was a surreal, ridiculous, unacceptable situation.&quot;

The local EPA office sidelined the regional EPA office. Dr. Cate Jenkins, a whistle-blower EPA scientist, said that on September 12, 2001, a regional EPA office offered to dispatch 30 to 40 electron microscopes to the WTC pit to test bulk dust samples for the presence of asbestos fibers. Instead, the local office chose the less effective polarized light microscopy testing method. Dr. Jenkins alleged that the local office refused, and said, &quot;We don&#x27;t want you fucking cowboys here. The best thing they could do is reassign you to Alaska.&quot;

===Health effects===

There were many health problems caused by the toxins. 99% of exposed firefighters reported at least one new respiratory problem while working at the World Trade Center site that they had not experienced before. Chronic airway disease is the main lung injury among firefighters who were exposed to toxins during 9/11. Six years after the attacks, among those who never smoked, approximately 13% of firefighters and 22% of EMS had lungs that did not function as well as others around the same age. Steep declines in pulmonary lung function has been a problem since first detected among firefighters and EMS within a year of 9/11 have persisted.
Increasing numbers of Ground Zero workers are getting illnesses, such as cancer. Between September 11, 2001, through 2008, there were 263 new cases of cancer found in 8,927 male firefighters who responded to 9/11 attacks. This number is 25 more than what is expected from men from a similar age group and race. There is a 19% increase in cancer overall, between firefighters who responded to the attacks and those who were not exposed to toxins from responding to the attacks on September 11.

On January 30, 2007, Ground Zero workers and groups such as Sierra Club and Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes met at the Ground Zero site and urged President George Bush to spend more money on aid for sick Ground Zero workers. They said that the $25 million that Bush promised for the ill workers was inadequate. A Long Island iron-worker, John Sferazo, at the protest rally said, &quot;Why has it taken you 5½ years to meet with us, Mr. President?&quot;

Firefighters, police and their unions, have criticized Mayor Rudy Giuliani over the issue of protective equipment and illnesses after the attacks. A study by the National Institute of Environmental Safety and Health said that cleanup workers lacked adequate protective gear. The Executive Director of the National Fraternal Order of Police reportedly said of Giuliani: &quot;Everybody likes a Churchillian kind of leader who jumps up when the ashes are still falling and takes over. But two or three good days don&#x27;t expunge an eight-year record.&quot; Sally Regenhard, said, &quot;There&#x27;s a large and growing number of both FDNY families, FDNY members, former and current, and civilian families who want to expose the true failures of the Giuliani administration when it comes to 9/11.&quot; She told the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; that she intends to &quot;Swift Boat&quot; Giuliani.

Various health programs arose after the attacks to provide treatment for 9/11-related illnesses among responders, recovery workers, and other survivors. When the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act became federal law in January 2011, these programs were replaced by the World Trade Center Health Program.

== Investigations ==
Soon after the attacks, New York City commissioned McKinsey &amp; Company to investigate the response of both the New York City Fire Department and New York City Police Department and make recommendations on how to respond more effectively to such large-scale emergencies in the future.

Officials with the International Association of Fire Fighters have also criticized Rudy Giuliani for failing to support modernized radios that might have spared the lives of more firefighters. Some firefighters never heard the evacuation orders and died in the collapse of the towers.

== Estimated costs ==
Estimated total costs, as of October 3, 2001
:$5 billion for debris removal
:$14 billion for reconstruction
:$3 billion in overtime payments to uniformed workers
:$1 billion for replacement of destroyed vehicles and equipment
:(one Fire Department accident response vehicle costs $400,000)

==Reconstruction==

Plans for the World Trade Center rebuilding started in July 2002 which was headed by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. There were rounds of proposals on how to rebuild the World Trade Center; however, many of the early schemes were criticized for lacking creativity. There was division among members of the public, architects, and political leadership as to what an appropriate new World Trade Center would look like. Several architects were chosen and replaced throughout the planning and design process; there were issues with implementing the early designs. By 2006 all architects for the site had been chosen and designs were largely finalized in 2007. The date of completion for the World Trade Center was scheduled for 2016. , four of seven planned buildings were completed, as were the transportation hub, 9/11 Memorial, and Liberty Park.

<text>Communication problems and successes played an important role during the September 11 attacks in 2001 and their aftermath. Systems were variously destroyed or overwhelmed by loads greater than they were designed to carry, or failed to operate as intended or desired.
==Attackers==
The organizers of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks apparently planned and coordinated their mission in face to face meetings and used little or no electronic communication. This &quot;radio silence&quot; made their plan more difficult to detect.

==Federal government==
According to 9/11 Commission staff statement No. 17 there were several communications failures at the federal government level during and after the 9/11 attacks. Perhaps the most serious occurred in an &quot;Air Threat Conference Call&quot; initiated by the National Military Command Center (NMCC) after two planes had crashed into the World Trade Center, but shortly before The Pentagon was hit. The participants were unable to include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control command center, which had the most information about the hijackings, in the call.

According to the staff report:
Operators worked feverishly to include the FAA in this teleconference, but they had equipment problems and difficulty finding secure phone numbers. NORAD asked three times before 10:03 to confirm the presence of FAA on the conference, to provide an update on hijackings. The FAA did not join the call until 10:17. The FAA representative who joined the call had no familiarity with or responsibility for a hijack situation, had no access to decision makers, and had none of the information available to senior FAA officials by that time.

We found no evidence that, at this critical time, during the morning of September 11, NORAD’s top commanders, in Florida or Cheyenne Mountain Complex, ever coordinated with their counterparts at FAA headquarters to improve situational awareness and organize a common response. Lower-level officials improvised—the FAA’s Boston Center bypassing the chain of command to contact NEADS. But the highest level Defense Department officials relied on the NMCC’s Air Threat Conference, in which FAA did not meaningfully participate.

==First responders==
After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, radio repeaters for New York City Fire Department communication were installed in the tower complex. Because they were unaware that several controls needed to be operated to fully activate the repeater system, fire chiefs at their command post in the lobby of the North Tower thought the repeater was not functioning and did not use it, though it did work and was used by some firefighters. When police officials concluded the twin towers were in danger of collapsing and ordered police to leave the complex, fire officials were not notified. Fire officials on the scene were not monitoring broadcast news reports and did not immediately understand what had happened when the first (South) tower collapsed.

There was little communication between New York City Police Department and fire department commands even though an Office of Emergency Management (OEM) had been created in 1996 in part to provide such coordination. A primary reason for OEM&#x27;s inability to coordinate communications and information-sharing in the early hours of the WTC response was the loss of its emergency operations center, located on the twenty third floor of 7 World Trade Center, which had been evacuated after debris from the main tower&#x27;s collapse struck the building. This ignited several fires that caused it to collapse at 5 pm later that day.

Emergency relief efforts in both Lower Manhattan and at the Pentagon were augmented by volunteer amateur radio operators in the weeks after the attacks.

==Victims==

Cell phones and in-plane credit card phones played a major role during and after the attack, starting with hijacked passengers who called family or notified the authorities about what was happening. Passengers and crew who made calls include: Sandra Bradshaw, Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, Mark Bingham, Peter Hanson, Jeremy Glick, Barbara Olson, Renee May, Madeline Amy Sweeney, Betty Ong, Robert Fangman, Brian David Sweeney, and Ed Felt. Passengers and crew aboard United Airlines Flight 93 were able to assess their situation based on these conversations and plan a revolt that resulted in the aircraft crashing before reaching the hijackers’ intended target. According to the commission staff: &quot;Their actions saved the lives of countless others, and may have saved either the U.S. Capitol or the White House from destruction.&quot;

According to the 9/11 Commission Report, 13 passengers from Flight 93 made a total of over 30 calls to both family and emergency personnel (twenty-two confirmed air phone calls, two confirmed cell phone and eight not specified in the report). Brenda Raney, Verizon Wireless spokesperson, said that Flight 93 was supported by several cell sites. There were reportedly three phone calls from Flight 11, five from Flight 175, and three calls from Flight 77. Two calls from these flights were recorded, placed by flight attendants: Betty Ong on Flight 11 and CeeCee Lyles on Flight 93.

Alexa Graf, an AT&amp;T spokesperson, said it was almost a fluke
that the calls reached their destinations. Marvin Sirbu, professor of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University said on September 14, 2001, that &quot;The fact of the matter is that cell phones can work in almost all phases of a commercial flight.&quot; Other industry experts said that it is possible to use cell phones with varying degrees of success during the ascent and descent of commercial airline flights.

After each of the hijacked aircraft struck the World Trade Center, people inside the towers made calls to family and loved ones; for the victims, this was their last communication. Other callers directed their pleas for help to 9-1-1. Over nine hours of the 9-1-1 calls were eventually released after petitioning by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and families of the WTC victims. In 2001, U.S. cell phones did not yet have the photography capabilities that became widespread by the mid-2000s.

==General public==
After the attack, the cell phone networks of New York City and the Tri-State area were rapidly overloaded (a mass call event) as traffic doubled over normal levels. Cell phone traffic also overloaded across the East Coast, leading to crashes of the cell phone network. Verizon&#x27;s downtown wire phone service was interrupted for days and weeks because of cut subscriber cables, and to the 140 West Street exchange being shut for days. Capacity between Brooklyn and Manhattan was also diminished by cut trunk cables.

Following the attacks, the issues with the cell network weren&#x27;t resolved until 36 cellular COWs (cell towers on wheels) were deployed by September 14, 2001, in Lower Manhattan to support the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and provide critical phone service to rescue and recovery workers.

Since three of the major television broadcast network owned-and-operated stations had their transmission towers atop the North Tower (One World Trade Center), coverage was limited after the collapse of the tower. The FM transmitter of National Public Radio station WNYC was also destroyed in the collapse of the North Tower and its offices evacuated. For an interim period, it continued broadcasting on its AM frequency and used NPR&#x27;s New York offices to produce its programming.
The satellite feed of one television station, WPIX, froze on the last image received from the WTC mast; the image (a remote-camera shot of the burning towers), viewable across North America (as WPIX is available on cable TV in many areas), remained on the screen for much of the day until WPIX was able to set up alternate transmission facilities. It shows the WTC at the moment power cut off to the WPIX transmitter, prior to the towers&#x27; collapse.

During the September 11 attacks, WCBS-TV channel 2 and WXTV-TV channel 41 stayed on the air. Unlike most other major New York television stations, WCBS-TV maintained a full-powered backup transmitter at the Empire State Building after moving its main transmitter to the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The station was also simulcasted nationally on Viacom (which at the time owned CBS) cable network VH1 that day. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the station lent transmission time to the other stations who had lost their transmitters, until they found suitable backup equipment and locations.

The Emergency Alert System was never activated in the terrorist attacks, as the extensive media coverage made it unnecessary.

AT&amp;T eliminated any costs for domestic calls originating from the New York City area (phones using area codes 212, 718, 917, 646, and 347) in the days following 9/11.

==Radio communications==

Radio communications during the September 11 attacks served a vital role in coordinating rescue efforts by New York Police Department, New York Fire Department, Port Authority Police Department, and emergency medical services.

While radio communications were modified to address problems discovered after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, investigations into the radio communications during the September 11 attacks discovered that communication systems and protocols that distinguished each department was hampered by the lack of interoperability, damaged or failed network infrastructure during the attack, and overwhelmed by simultaneous communication between superiors and subordinates.

===Background===

A rough time line of the incident could include:
* 08:46 hrs.: American 11 crashes into the North Tower, a.k.a. &quot;1 World Trade Center&quot;, (0 minutes elapsed time).
* 09:03 hrs.: United 175 crashes into the South Tower, a.k.a. &quot;2 World Trade Center&quot;, (17 minutes elapsed time).
* 09:58 hrs.: South Tower, a.k.a. &quot;2 World Trade Center&quot; collapses, (55 minutes after aircraft impact, 72 minutes elapsed time).
* 10:28 hrs.: North Tower, a.k.a. &quot;1 World Trade Center&quot; collapses, (102 minutes elapsed time and post-impact).

The scale of the incident was described in the National Commission report on the attacks as &quot;unprecedented&quot;. In roughly seventeen minutes from 8:46 to 9:03 am, over a thousand police, fire, and emergency medical services (EMS) staff arrived at the scene. At some point during a large incident, any agency will reach a point where they find their resources overrun by needs. For example, the Port Authority Police could not schedule staff as if a September 11 attack would occur every shift. There is always a balance struck between readiness and costs. There is conflicting data but some sources suggest there may have been 2,000 to 3,000 workers involved in the rescue operation. It would be rare for most agencies to see an event where there were that many people to be rescued.

There is some level of confusion present in any large incident. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) asserts commanders did not have adequate information and interagency information sharing was inadequate. For example, on September 11, persons in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) 9-1-1 center told callers from the World Trade Center to remain in place and wait for instruction from firefighters and police officers. This was the plan for managing a fire incident in the building and the 9-1-1 center staff were following the plan. This was partly countered by public safety workers going floor-by-floor and telling people to evacuate. The 9/11 Commission report suggests people in the NYPD 9-1-1 center and New York City Fire Department (FDNY) dispatch would benefit from better situation awareness. The Commission described the call centers as not &quot;fully integrated&quot; with line personnel at the WTC. The report suggests the NYPD 9-1-1 center and FDNY dispatch were overrun by call volumes that had never been seen before. Adding to the confusion, radio coverage problems, radio traffic blocking, and building system problems occurred inside the burning towers. The facts show that much of the equipment worked as designed and users made the best of what was available to them.

Typical of any large fire, many 9-1-1 calls with conflicting information were received beginning at 8:46 am. In addition to reports that a plane had hit the World Trade Center, the EMS computer-aided dispatch (CAD) log shows reports of a helicopter crash, explosions, and a building fire. Throughout the incident, people at different locations had very different views of the situation. After the collapse of the first tower, many firefighters in the remaining tower had no idea the first tower had fallen.

A factor in radio communications problems included the fact that off-duty personnel self-dispatched to the incident scene. Some off-duty staff went into the towers without radios. According to the Commission report and news coverage, this was true of NYPD, Port Authority Police Department (PAPD), and FDNY personnel. Regardless of any radio coverage problems, these persons could not be commanded or informed by radio. In any incident of this scale, self-dispatched staff without radios would likely be a problem. Even if a cache of radios were brought to the scene to hand out, the scale of this incident would be likely to overrun the number of radios in the cache.

NIST concluded, at the beginning of the incident, there was an approximate factor of five (peak) increase in radio communications traffic over a normal level. After the initial peak, radio traffic through the incident followed an approximate factor of three steady increase. FDNY recordings suggest the dispatch personnel were overloaded: both fire and EMS dispatch were often delayed in responding to radio calls. Many 9-1-1 telephone calls to dispatch were disconnected or routed to &quot;all circuits are busy now&quot;, intercept recordings.

===Voice radio systems===
NIST calculated that about one third of radio messages transmitted during the surge of communications were incomplete or unintelligible. Documentary footage suggests the tactical channels were also overloaded; some footage captured audio of two or three conversations occurring simultaneously on a particular channel.

In this study of WTC incident communications, radio systems used at the site had problems but were generally effective in that users were able to communicate with one another. A 2002 video documentary &quot;9/11&quot; by Gedeon and Jules Naudet, (referred to as &quot;the documentary&quot;) was reviewed. It captured audio from hand-held radios in use at the incident and showed users communicating over radios from the lobby command post in the North Tower. 26 Red Book audio CDs of New York City Fire Department radio transmissions, covering the incident&#x27;s initial dispatch and the tower failures, were reviewed. These CDs were digitized versions of audio from the Fire Department&#x27;s logging recorders. In addition, text on an oral history CD with transcripts of fire personnel debriefed on the incident were reviewed.

====NYPD and PAPD systems in 2001====
In 2001, the NYPD used Ultra High Frequency (UHF) radios and divided the city into 35 radio zones. Most hand-held radios had at least 20 channels: while not all officers had all channels, all officers had the ability to communicate citywide. As a characteristic of physics, UHF signals penetrate buildings better than lower Very High Frequency (VHF) frequencies used by the FDNY fire units but generally cover shorter distances over open terrain. The Commission report did not cite any technical flaws with the NYPD radio system.

PAPD has systems described as &quot;low-power UHF&quot;. The Commission report says the systems were specific to a single site with the exception of one channel which was Port-Authority-wide. It&#x27;s unclear whether the PAPD systems were interstitial and limited to 2 watts output, used normal local-control channels but were limited in power output by the frequency coordinator, or used leaky cable systems which were solely intended to work inside the Port Authority buildings. The report says there were 7, site-specific Port Authority Police channels. In 2001, officers at one site could not, (in all cases), carry their radios to another site and use them. Not all radios had all channels.

====Fire and EMS dispatch channels====
Recordings of Citywide, Brooklyn, and Manhattan channels for Fire and Citywide, Brooklyn, and Manhattan channels for Emergency medical services were reviewed. Systems generally performed well. The audio coupling point for the logging recorder on Manhattan Fire made the dispatcher&#x27;s voice difficult to hear. An anonymous fire dispatcher who identifies as &quot;Dispatcher 416&quot; is noteworthy.

The Commission report says that, in 2001, FDNY used a system with 5 repeater channels: one for each of the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, with the Bronx and Staten Island sharing a single frequency using different Private Line (PL) tones, and a citywide channel. There were also five simplex channels in FDNY radios.

Observation shows, back in 2001, that the citywide EMS channel was voting more frequently than normal, signals were noisy, interfering signals were present, and that some receiver sites had equalization differences. Some transmissions had choppy audio possibly representative of interference from FSK paging or intermittent microwave radio paths to one or more receiver sites. For example, if a microwave radio path fails for half-second intervals, the voting comparator may vote out that receiver site until silence is detected. This can cause dropped syllables in the voted audio. Some transmissions were noisy, although transactions show the dispatcher was understanding radio traffic in spite of audio drop-outs in almost every case.

=====Port Authority fire repeater system (Repeater 7)=====

The Port Authority radio repeater, intended to allow communications inside the towers, did not appear to work as intended on September 11. The system, also called &quot;Port Authority Channel 30&quot;, was installed at Port Authority police desk in WTC 5 in 1994 after the 1993 World Trade Center attack. News accounts said the system had been turned off for unspecified technical reasons. The Commission report said it was customary to turn the system off because it somehow caused interference to radios in use at fire operations in other parts of the city. The documentary film gives different information, with a Fire Department member from Engine 7/Ladder 1 claiming that the aircraft&#x27;s impact caused the system to fail. Evidence suggests the remote control console in the lobby command was not working but the repeater was. The radio repeater was located in 5 World Trade Center. A remote control console was connected to the repeater allowing staff at the North Tower lobby command post to communicate without using a hand-held radio.

In a review of the logging recorder track of the Port Authority repeater, someone arrived early during the incident and began to establish a command post. From the command post in the lobby of the North Tower (1 World Trade Center), the user can be heard trying to transmit using a remote control unit. After several failed attempts to communicate with a user on the channel, the user steps through every channel selection on the remote, trying each one. The recording contains the tone remote control console stepping through all of its eight function tones. Someone says, &quot;... the wireline isn&#x27;t working&quot;, over the Port Authority channel. Something that looks like a Motorola T-1380-series remote is shown in the documentary. The fact that users pressing buttons on the remote control can clearly be heard on the logging recorder shows the transmit audio path was working. The recording does not reveal whether or not the console function tones were keying the transmitter.

Some users in the North Tower lobby interpreted the remote control unit not working as a failure of the entire channel. Other fire units, not knowing the channel had failed, arrived and began using it successfully. The recordings show at least some units were successfully using the repeater to communicate inside the South Tower until the moment it collapsed. The Commission report says the North Tower lobby command may not have worked because of a technical problem, the volume control turned all the way down, or because a button that must be pressed to enable it had not been pushed.

On the audio track, an outside agency, possibly in New Jersey and using a repeater, comes through the receive audio on the Port Authority Repeater 7 system. An ambulance being dispatched by the outside (non-FDNY) agency is heard. This may be what the FDNY had described as interference caused when the repeater was left enabled at all times. The distant user appears to be repeated through the system, (possibly on the same CTCSS tone as was configured in Repeater 7). This appears to be a distant co-channel user on the same input frequency as Repeater 7. It&#x27;s possible that by the random button pressing, a user sent a function tone that temporarily put the base station in &quot;monitor&quot; and that&#x27;s what caused the outside agency&#x27;s traffic to be heard. This is unlikely because subsequent transmit function tones should have toggled the receiver from monitor back to CTCSS-enabled.

=====Fire Department system=====
An oral history interview revealed the Port Authority UHF radios were normally used at incidents inside the World Trade Center. The interviewee said in normal, day-to-day calls, the WTC staff handed Port Authority UHF radios to firefighters on their arrival and that these radios, &quot;worked all over.&quot; This implies, but does not prove, that it was common knowledge among department members that FDNY radios had coverage problems inside the buildings. The 9-11 Commission uses the phrase, &quot;performed poorly&quot; to describe FDNY radios during the incident.

Oral history files show that at least four channels were employed at WTC:
* &quot;Channel 5&quot;, (possibly also called Command 5), was to be used for Command in both Towers.
* &quot;Tactical 1&quot; was to be used for Operations in the North Tower.
* &quot;Tactical 3&quot; was to be used for Operations in the South Tower.
* &quot;Repeater 7&quot;, also known as &quot;Port Authority Repeater&quot;, was also used by some units working in the North Tower.

One officer said a channel named &quot;Command 3&quot; was used for the North Tower. To those unfamiliar with the details of the FDNY system, it is unclear whether the interviewee meant Tactical 3 or a fifth channel.

FDNY personnel are seen using radios during the documentary footage of the WTC lobby area. Analysis of these scenes showed the radios all appeared to be receiving properly. Oral history files confirm radio communications were at least partly functional.

A problem that shows up in these types of incidents is that receivers in hand-held radios are subjected to signal levels that are likely to overload the receiver. Several radios may be transmitting within feet of one another on different channels. If overloading occurs, only very strong signals can be received while weaker signals disappear and are not received. The hand held radio receivers shown in the documentary appeared to work properly even though several other hand-held radios were transmitting only feet away. This is a hostile environment and suggests the hand-held equipment used by FDNY had good quality receivers, though in this case, the suggestion is incorrect. Second-hand observation is hardly the proper way to &#x27;test&#x27; radio receivers or to distinguish &#x27;good quality&#x27; from &#x27;bad&#x27; and this is likely a source of continued misunderstanding; particularly when these same radios were operating at higher floors, in closer proximity to, and in direct line-of-sight of digital cellular repeaters. Those repeaters were likely operating at unlicensed power levels, which was a common practice of cellular providers at the time, and continues to this day. Footage reveals intelligible recovered audio coming out of the radios and shows radio users communicating with others. This may not have been true of the entire WTC complex but was true of radio users in the crowded lobby.

Analysis of the 26 FDNY audio CDs showed the radios seemed to transmit into the radio systems okay. Radios calling dispatch got through. Calling units were intelligible. Users spoke with dispatchers. Dispatchers answered in ways that suggest they understood what was said. There were no noisy or truncated transmissions heard on any channel, (the equivalent of a dropped cellular call). This suggests the Fire Department&#x27;s radio backbone is soundly designed and working properly. It is possible that system coverage problems are present; problems that could have been mitigated had the Command Post radio (with greater transmit power) been used. It is also likely that some transmissions did not reach any of the receivers in the system and therefore would not be a detectable problem when listening to the recordings. At the same time those recordings were made, the cellular system was operating at or near full-capacity, meaning every cellular repeater was transmitting. The dense RF interference environment created in NYC that day was essentially a &#x27;perfect storm&#x27;; one in which a radio designed 25 years prior could not possibly contend with.

In some scenes, captured documentary audio showed the channels were busy. In some cases, two or more conversations were taking place over a single radio channel at the same time. Users on Tactical 1 may have been close enough to one another to communicate because signals in proximity to each other would overpower weaker signals. At any incident of this size, there is likely to be some overlapping radio traffic. In the same way that large incidents exhaust all the firefighting vehicles and staff, the radio channel resources may become taxed to their limits. NIST says about one third of the fire department radio transmissions were not complete or not understandable.

Some radio users had selected the wrong channels. For example, on the Repeater 7 channel, a unit was heard to call &quot;Manhattan&quot; dispatch and &quot;Citywide&quot;. Although the circumstances that led to the user selecting the wrong channel are not known, this can occur when the user is trapped in darkness or smoke and cannot see the radio. Users will typically try to count steps in a rotary switch channel selector starting from one end of the switch&#x27;s travel.

A communications van operated by FDNY responded to the incident. Its radio identifier was, &quot;Field Comm.&quot; A backup van was in use on the day of the incident because the primary van was out-of-service. The backup van was destroyed and audio recordings of tactical channels used at the incident site were lost.

=====FDNY radio programming=====
One annoyance with the fire systems was the presence of &quot;unit ID&quot; data bursts. These constant squawks, heard at the end of transmissions, are decoded at dispatch to identify the calling radio. The annoyance of the data bursts is a trade-off that could help find a firefighter who has been injured or needs help. It also automatically displays the unit ID at the dispatch console. In most systems, it also saves dispatch personnel from typing the unit ID. They press one key and the calling unit&#x27;s ID is inserted into the current CAD screen or command line.

Recordings show radios were programmed to send unit ID on tactical channels. Radios accept unit ID on a per-channel basis. When mobile or hand-held radios are programmed, the unit ID encoders should be disabled on all channels where the feature is not used. This saves air time for about two to three syllables of speech per push-to-talk press. For example, unless the communications van or chief&#x27;s vehicles had push-to-talk unit ID decoders, or the channels were recorded for later analysis where unit IDs were decoded from the recordings, the encoders should be turned off for tactical channels to reduce air time used.

It also sounded like some vehicle radios may have had &quot;status buttons&quot; using the data bursts. If true, the operator presses a button on the vehicle radio which sends a short data burst to dispatch. Dispatch gets the unit identity and the new status from a data decoder. These can cause interruptions in voice traffic but cut down on total air time required to conduct business because they occupy the channel for less time than it takes to say, &quot;Engine fifty on scene.&quot;

=====Tactical 1=====
This channel was the primary method of communication in the North tower. It was a simplex channel. Users complained it would only reach from the lobby to floors in the thirties. Tactical 1 was a default channel for use at some fire scenes. Some users who realized Repeater 7 was functional switched to that channel and were afforded better coverage than simplex users on Tactical 1. Audio recordings on the documentary film and NIST analysis show Tactical 1 was overloaded with heavy radio traffic. In contrast, the audio CD of Repeater 7 shows the channel was mostly idle.

The 9-11 commission report said a new portable repeater system had been developed to address shortcomings of Tactical 1 at a large incident. The system, called, &quot;the post&quot;, is carried to an area near the incident and set up for the duration to augment weak signals.

=====Command channel=====
The command channel used by officers at the incident was either called &quot;Channel 5&quot; or &quot;Command 5&quot; in documentation. Documents suggest the channel had a repeater but it was not clear if the repeater was citywide, installed in the Field Comm van, or housed in a battalion chief&#x27;s vehicle. Recordings of this channel were lost when the Field Comm van was destroyed. The documentary film and oral history records show the channel being used effectively.

====Interoperability====
The federal 9/11 Commission Report included recommendations on communications systems used by police, fire, and emergency medical services (EMS) at the WTC incident. In the report and in appearances on television news programs, commissioners said the capabilities of communications systems lacked the ability to communicate across department lines. That is to say, police units could not communicate with fire units directly by radio. Ambulances could not talk with police units directly by radio. Commission member Lee Hamilton, in several television appearances related to a 2006 book on the topic of the WTC incident, reiterated this factually correct view.

=====Aviation assets=====
An example that was cited by Hamilton: during the incident the Police Department helicopter was unable to communicate with Fire Department units in order to warn them of the towers&#x27; imminent collapse. The NIST document suggests the helicopter may have been able to offer several minutes warning. &quot;Several minutes&quot; may have been enough to get some people from the lower floors outside. This warning of imminent collapse went out over at least one police radio channel but there is nothing showing it was relayed to other people or channels. FDNY operates at least two communications vans: one of which was brought to the scene at the WTC incident. The Commission report reveals the primary FDNY van was equipped to talk to NYPD helicopters but the backup van (which had no NYPD helicopter capability) was in use on September 11, 2001.

In practice, many US helicopters used in emergency services are equipped with radios that allow communications on nearly any conventional two-way radio system, so long as the aircrew know the frequency and associated signaling tones. The radios usually have presets, like a car&#x27;s broadcast radio, that allow some channels to be configured ahead of need. There was no information in the Commission report suggesting NYPD helicopters had such a capability.

=====Cross-department=====
While it is technically possible to implement communications across departments, doing so introduces a host of new training and incident command problems. These are problems that would need to be managed in addition to the existing set of issues present at any large incident. The ability to maintain command, and monitor the safety of, groups working at an incident is diminished if a group of firefighters cannot be reached because they&#x27;ve switched over to the EMS channel. This could cause people to be sent to rescue them when there was no need. Similarly, if the Manhattan EMS dispatcher can&#x27;t reach an ambulance because they are on one of the fire channels, patient care is affected. New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, appearing on the &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; show, expressed his view that the existing radio systems performed satisfactorily during the WTC incident. In his view, the interoperability desired by the 9-11 Commission was not needed.

=====Need for NYPD/FDNY cross-department links?=====
These problems are not new to the World Trade Center incident; cross-department and cross-discipline communication has been a hotly contested and long-identified issue. For example, at the Oklahoma City federal building bombing incident, the inability to communicate among departments was also cited as a problem. Firefighters heard an evacuation order on their radio channel because of the reported presence of a second bomb. Police and EMS workers reportedly did not know of the order.

In Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s wake, a sergeant in the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries appeared on national television to describe not being able to reach persons from other agencies who were assisting with the recovery. She described seeing the people in a nearby boat but not being able to communicate with them.

Even if the technical problems are solved, the issue is more complicated than just adding radio channels or talk groups. It is also a cultural problem. In one local incident, a large number of officers from three police agencies were fielded to search for a violent criminal who had evaded officers from one of the agencies. The officers did not coordinate by switching to a shared radio channel. After the incident, one participant said the users thought their radios were incompatible and did not understand how the shared channel worked. This possibly reflects a training problem or a technology literacy problem. The problem seems to have been remedied since then.

In another instance, a fire agency had thoroughly trained for interoperability scenarios. During an incident where two agencies with different radio channels responded, a decision-maker said personnel from his agency would stay on their own channel. Decision-makers may occasionally act in unpredictable ways, even if technology literate and well-trained. It is not solely a technical problem, but an operational problem as well. Changes to ICS command structure, or operational changes in how the command post for an incident is set up, may produce better results than buying equipment or adding channels. Sometimes there are interoperability problems even where a structure for interoperability exists.

=====ICS: part of the solution?=====
One view of the Incident Command System is that units across department lines would communicate with their own representative at the command post or division level. That representative would relay any needs to another department. For example, a fire unit requesting five paramedic ambulances would identify the magnitude of a medical problem to their fire officer at the command post. This request would add to their commander&#x27;s operational picture of the division or incident command as she called EMS to request the ambulances. Situation awareness is an important part of effective command and is easy to lose at a large incident. Bypassing incident commanders can contribute to a decomposing of command.

=====Trunked systems, commercial services, and cross-department netting=====
One approach to cross-department netting is the capability of some modern trunked systems to provide a function called &quot;dynamic regrouping&quot;; a feature that Motorola doesn&#x27;t support in simplex (e.g. &#x27;fireground&#x27;) operations. It is therefore necessary for a disaster to be near enough the infrastructure to allow for repeater access/operation. Many agencies with Motorola trunked systems already have this capability but it&#x27;s hardly ever used; even in a crisis. The difficulty of operating such a system is often too great for poorly educated dispatchers who often have no college – much less any particular training in computers or communications systems – other than the &#x27;cursory&#x27; training they receive in a 3 or 5 day class the vendors offer. The feature allows the dispatch center personnel to send units from different agencies who are responding to the same incident to a common talk group or virtual channel. This assumes the agencies all share a capability to operate over the same trunked radio system, which is rare. In an informal survey of three agencies with trunked systems that included this feature, users at two sites reported they did not think their system included the feature. A representative from a third site said he &quot;...thought they had the feature but never used it.&quot; Of the three agencies with the feature, no one knew how to use it. This would suggest, (in at least the three agencies contacted,) that &quot;dynamic regrouping&quot; was not valuable. Like other disaster readiness processes, users would have to practice using the feature in order for it to be useful during an incident.

Some agencies use commercial two-way radio as an adjunct to their own communications networks. One professional engineering evaluation of public safety radio systems explains that commercial systems such as Nextel&#x27;s are not built to the same standards of coverage and non-blocking as public safety trunked systems. Like toy walkie talkies marketed to children, they are usable and helpful for non-urgent communications but should not be considered reliable enough for life safety uses. It is also true that most trunked radio system users are likely to hear busy signals, (error tones showing no channels are available,) for the first time during a large disaster. All systems have a finite capacity.

&quot;We don&#x27;t want or need trunking&quot; is what Chief Charles Dowd (NYPD) was heard to say at an APCO convention in Orlando (2006). NYPD operates a large, conventional repeater network with many legacy channels in the UHF band; and a technology developed &quot;so a large number of users can share a small number of channels&quot; (e.g. trunking) is clearly unnecessary and a frivolous waste of money.

With sufficient channels, there is no need for trunking. There are no &#x27;busy&#x27; tones in a conventional repeater system. In the event an individual needs to chime in, he simply waits his turn – just as he would do in a trunked system.

===Mobile data terminals===
All 911 ambulances and other FDNY vehicles have data terminals, sometimes referred to by staff in recordings and transcripts as MDTs. These terminals are connected to the computer-aided dispatch (CAD) back end or server. They can display text, page through screens describing jobs, and display lists of units assigned to a job.

A thorough analysis of data communications is not possible. What recordings show is that data terminals in at least some field units did not work properly during at least a portion of the incident. At 09:11:14, &quot;Division 3&quot; told Manhattan Fire dispatch, referring to the &quot;summary&quot; screen, &quot;Summary is only giving me a few units. You&#x27;re going to have to give it to me over the radio. I&#x27;m ready to write.&quot; This means the terminal was not displaying the entire list of units assigned to Division 3, as it would under normal conditions. The work-around: the Chief had to hand-write the list of units responding. In this one instance, the dispatcher reading the list of about 29 units tied up the Manhattan Fire channel for 53 seconds. During the reading of the list of units responding, one can hear several FDNY units try to interrupt the dispatcher. Their radio traffic was delayed until the entire list was read. This need to read lists of units because of slow or inoperable terminals occurred in at least three or four cases.

It&#x27;s unclear what caused data delays and incomplete screens on the mobile data terminals. Evidenced by the dispatcher reading the list of units assigned to Division 3, the CAD system was working properly at dispatch positions. At least some field units experienced problems. Possible causes of problems with data terminals in vehicles may have included:
* The radio backbone may have been overloaded because of the unusually high volume of requests for information from field units. Radio networks carrying data traffic have a finite data throughput capacity and can be overloaded. Even a well-designed system has some capacity limit.
* A bottleneck someplace in the network between the radio modem and the CAD system back end may have been overloaded by unusually heavy data traffic.
* Data terminals use a robust error correction protocol. A failure of some part of the radio backbone may have caused reduced radio signals in field units. The bit errors caused by weaker signals may have caused a corresponding increase in resending of data packets. Resent packets reduce overall data throughput.
* The attack placed an unusually heavy load on voice system channels. Interference problems caused by interactions between voice radio channel transmitters and data radio system elements may have caused an increase in bit errors, slowing data throughput.

Data terminals are partly purchased and installed to reduce load on dispatch staff and to reduce traffic on voice channels. When they work properly, they have a significant operational benefit. A data outage during an occurrence of high call traffic can quickly overrun dispatch and voice channel capacity in cases where a routine level of calls for service requires both data terminals and voice channels.

===New York City Council investigation===
New York City Council member Eric Gioia introduced a measure to have the Council investigate the issue of FDNY radio problems.

He then speaks to the president of Poland, goes to the State Department to announce additional food aid to Afghanistan. He has lunch with members of Congress, then goes to the Department of Labor to announce his intention to extend unemployment benefits in the 13 most-affected states by an additional 13 weeks.
*The New York City Comptroller, Alan Hevesi, states that the cost to New York from &quot;the crash, the attack, the calamity, the murder&quot; is already $45 billion and will reach $105 billion over the next two years.
*It is reported that a Russian jetliner, Siberia Airlines Flight 1812, en route from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk with 77 passengers exploded in mid-air before plunging into the Black Sea.

* 3:30 p.m. EDT: At a White House press briefing, Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson states that a 63-year-old Lantana, Florida resident was admitted to a hospital on Tuesday with non-contagious pulmonary anthrax. The British-born outdoorsman is the only known case, and the FBI, HHS, and CDC state that there is no evidence to support that this would be an act of bioterrorism (he dies later that day). See 2001 anthrax attacks for later developments, showing that this was an act of terrorism.
* In a White House briefing, Ari Fleischer says that the U.S. has no intention of making all their evidence against Osama bin Laden public which would jeopardize their ongoing investigation, and a few minutes later, says that the Bush administration believes it is important to be forthright in sharing information with the American public.

==Monday, October 8, 2001==
*1:25 p.m. EDT (approx): Health officials announce that anthrax spores were found in office where the man killed by anthrax worked. They were found in the nose of a co-worker and on a computer keyboard in the Boca Raton, Florida offices of the tabloid The Sun. In a press briefing, John Ashcroft states that the FBI has sealed the building is working with the CDC to determine if this is a criminal or terrorist act. See 2001 anthrax attacks.
*3:00 p.m CST (approx.): On American Airlines Flight 1238, en route from Los Angeles to Chicago, a man with severe mental problems stormed the cockpit 40 minutes before landing in Chicago, causing the plane to drop sharply and causing a panic. In light of the fear ignited by 9/11, flight crew and passengers were quick to wrestle the man to the ground and subdue him. Additionally, a distress signal was sent by the pilots, causing two F-16s to race at supersonic speeds to intercept and escort the aircraft to O&#x27;Hare International Airport. This caused a sonic boom in Chicago&#x27;s northwest suburbs, startling hundreds of thousands of people.

==Friday, October 12, 2001==

She had been exposed on September 25. She began presenting symptoms on the 28th. She began receiving Cipro on October 1. A biopsy was done on the 10th and sent to the CDC. See 2001 anthrax attacks.
* 3:45 p.m. EDT Ashcroft briefing: A complaint was filed against someone for lying to federal investigators.

<text>The September 11 attacks of 2001 were a major event that had a significant long-lasting impact even beyond the day of the attacks itself. This article summarizes events which relate to the attacks in the remaining days of September 2001. News coverage was significant in the period after the attacks which meant that many of these events were reported on quickly by news agencies at the time.

All times, except where otherwise noted, are in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), or UTC−04:00.

== September 2001 ==

=== Tuesday, September 11 ===
CBS and CNN report that a van filled with explosives has been stopped on the George Washington Bridge. According to the report, the New Jersey police claimed there were enough explosives to destroy the entire bridge. The FBI denied the report. 
=== Wednesday, September 12 ===
*2:30 a.m.: According to a later report, three Israeli men had been arrested because they had been seen celebrating the attack, though there were no explosives involved.
*Before 3:15 a.m.: &quot;The Boston Herald&quot; reports that at least five Arab men have been identified as suspects. Two of them were brothers, and one a trained pilot. Their passports have been traced to the United Arab Emirates. A car, rented in Portland, Maine, has been seized from the Logan International Airport garage, containing flight training manuals in Arabic. According to CNN, the FBI can neither confirm nor deny this. The men had been in a fight with a man shortly before take-off; this man later recalled the incident and called the police.
*Before 3:50 a.m.: &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; reports that Osama bin Laden has given a speech denying any connection to the attacks, which he called admirable.
*4:35 a.m.: CNN reports that search warrants have been issued in south Florida because of information from the passenger lists of the hijacked planes.

*10:00 a.m.: Congress reconvenes.
*10:53 a.m.: President George W. Bush holds a cabinet meeting, saying that the attacks &quot;were more than acts of terror. They were acts of war.&quot; Bush later that day tours the Pentagon to oversee the rescue and recovery efforts.

*3:58 p.m.: The FBI announces they have evidence showing the White House and Air Force One were intended targets of the attacks. Later this is recanted, and blamed on administration staffers misunderstanding the security information they received.
*5:00 p.m.: Attorney General John Ashcroft announces that some of the hijackers were pilots trained in the US.
*7:00 p.m.: Candlelight vigils are held in Washington Square, Union Square, Central Park, and various other locations in New York City, as well as across the country.

Both are later released, but re-arrested in late 2002.

*Between 4:15 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.: 10 people are detained at New York airports, reportedly including people who had boarded planes under false pretenses, people who had been trained to fly aircraft at the same schools as the previous terrorists, and people who had attempted to bring knives and other weapons past airport security. Some of these people had already been identified by the FBI as potential suspects. Three are removed from planes ready for departure by police SWAT teams, one resists arrest. It is later found that none of them were planning a hijacking.
*4:20 p.m.: The flight data recorder from United Airlines Flight 93 is recovered, fifteen feet below the surface of the ground.
*It is announced that Ahmed Shah Massoud, a military leader of the Northern Alliance, died on September 9 from wounds received during a Taliban suicide attack. His death was widely reported in the following days.
*On the orders of Queen Elizabeth II, the &#x27;Star-Spangled Banner&#x27; is played during the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace, marking the first time that the national anthem of a foreign nation was played at Buckingham Palace outside of an official state visit.

This live broadcast made UPN the first major television network to resume regular programs after the attacks. Not only was this the first major sporting event since the events of September 11, but it was also the first public assembly of its size.

<text>Strategic Air Command (SAC) was a United States Department of Defense Specified Command and a United States Air Force (USAF) Major Command responsible for command and control of the strategic bomber and intercontinental ballistic missile components of the United States military&#x27;s strategic nuclear forces from 1946 to 1992. SAC was also responsible for strategic reconnaissance aircraft; airborne command posts; and most of the USAF&#x27;s aerial refueling aircraft. 

SAC primarily consisted of the Second Air Force (2AF), Eighth Air Force (8AF) and the Fifteenth Air Force (15AF), while SAC headquarters (HQ SAC) included Directorates for Operations &amp; Plans, Intelligence, Command &amp; Control, Maintenance, Training, Communications, and Personnel. At a lower echelon, SAC headquarters divisions included Aircraft Engineering, Missile Concept, and Strategic Communications.

In 1992, as part of an overall post-Cold War reorganization of the U.S. Air Force, SAC was disestablished as both a Specified Command and as a MAJCOM, and its personnel and equipment redistributed among the Air Combat Command (ACC), Air Mobility Command (AMC), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF), United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), and Air Education and Training Command (AETC), while SAC&#x27;s central headquarters complex at Offutt AFB, Nebraska was concurrently transferred to the newly created United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), which was established as a joint Unified Combatant Command to replace SAC&#x27;s Specified Command role.

In 2009, SAC was reactivated and redesignated as the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). AFGSC eventually acquired all USAF bomber aircraft and the intercontinental ballistic missile force.

== Background ==

The Strategic Air Forces of the United States during World War II included General Carl Spaatz&#x27;s European command, United States Strategic Air Forces in Europe (USSTAF), consisting of the 8AF and 15AF, and the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific (USASTAF) and its Twentieth Air Force (20AF).

The U.S. Army Air Forces&#x27; first mission in the Strategic Bombing Campaign in the European Theater during World War II included the VIII Bomber Command, which conducted the first European &quot;heavy bomber&quot; attack by the USAAF on 17 August 1942; the Ninth Air Force, which conducted the first Operation Crossbow &quot;No-Ball&quot; missions on 5 December 1943; the Twelfth Air Force; and the Fifteenth Air Force, which executed bombing operations on 2 November 1943 during Operation Pointblank.

The Operation Overlord air plan for the strategic bombing of both Germany and German military forces in continental Europe prior to the 1944 invasion of France used several Air Forces, primarily those of the USAAF and those of the Royal Air Force (RAF), with the command of air operations transferring to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force on 14 April 1944.

Planning to reorganize for a separate and independent postwar U.S. Air Force had begun by the fall of 1945, with the Simpson Board tasked to plan, &quot;...the reorganization of the Army and the Air Force...&quot;. In January 1946, Generals Eisenhower and Spaatz agreed on an Air Force organization composed of the Strategic Air Command, the Air Defense Command, the Tactical Air Command, the Air Transport Command and the supporting Air Technical Service Command, Air Training Command, the Air University, and the Air Force Center.

== Establishment and transfer to USAF ==

Strategic Air Command was originally established in the U.S. Army Air Forces on 21 March 1946 upon the redesignation of Continental Air Forces (CAF), the World War II command tasked with the air defense of the continental United States (CONUS). At the time, CAF headquarters was located at Bolling Field (later Bolling AFB) in the District of Columbia and SAC assumed occupancy of its headquarters facilities until relocating SAC headquarters (HQ SAC) to nearby Andrews Field (later Andrews AFB), Maryland as a tenant activity until assuming control of Andrews Field in October 1946.

SAC initially totaled 37,000 USAAF personnel. In addition to Bolling Field and, seven months later, Andrews Field, SAC also assumed responsibility for:
* Roswell AAF, New Mexico (later renamed Roswell AFB, then Walker AFB), then home of the USAAF&#x27;s sole nuclear-capable bomb wing, and
* Smoky Hill AAF, Kansas (later renamed Smoky Hill AFB, then Schilling AFB)

SAC also had seven additional CAF bases transferred on 21 March 1946 which remained in SAC through the 1947 establishment of the U.S. Air Force as an independent service. Those installations included:
* Castle Field, California (later Castle Air Force Base)
* Clovis AAF, New Mexico (later Cannon Air Force Base)
* Fort Worth AAF, Texas (later Carswell Air Force Base)
* Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona (later Davis-Monthan Air Force Base) 
* Rapid City AAF, South Dakota (later Ellsworth Air Force Base)
* MacDill Field, Florida (later MacDill Air Force Base)
* Mountain Home AAF, Idaho (later Mountain Home Air Force Base)

On 31 March 1946, the following additional installation was also assigned to SAC:
* Kirtland Field, New Mexico (later Kirtland Air Force Base)

Under the first SAC Commander in Chief, General George C. Kenney, initial units reporting to the Strategic Air Command headquarters on 21 March 1946 included the Second Air Force, the IX Troop Carrier Command and the 73d Air Division.

Fifteenth Air Force was assigned to SAC on 31 March (15th AF&#x27;s 263rd Army Air Force Base Unit—with SAC&#x27;s radar detachments—transferred the same date directly under HQ SAC ), while the IX Troop Carrier Command was inactivated the same date and its assets redistributed within SAC.

With postwar demobilization still underway, eight of the ten assigned bomb groups were inactivated before the Eighth Air Force was assigned to SAC on 7 June 1946.

Despite the pressures of demobilization, SAC continued the training and evaluation of bomber crews and units still on active duty in the postwar Army Air Forces. Radar Bomb Scoring became the preferred method of evaluating bomber crews, with the last of 888 simulated bomb runs scored against a bombing site near San Diego, California during 1946, subsequently increasing to 2,449 bomb runs by 1947. In the wake of the successful employment of air-dropped nuclear weapons against Hiroshima and Nagasaki to effectively end World War II, SAC became the focus of the nation&#x27;s nuclear strike capability, to the extent that Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) Publication 1259/27 on 12 December 1946 identified that, &quot;...the &#x27;air atomic&#x27; strategic air force should only come under the orders of the JCS.&quot;

In addition to the strategic bombing mission, SAC also devoted significant resources to aerial reconnaissance. In 1946, SAC&#x27;s reconnaissance aircraft inventory consisted of F-2 photo variants of the C-45 Expeditor support aircraft, but by 1947 SAC had acquired an F-9C squadron consisting of twelve photo-reconnaissance variants of the B-17G Flying Fortress. An F-13 squadron, the F-13 later re-designated as the RB-29 Superfortress, was also established. SAC conducted routine aerial reconnaissance missions near the Soviet borders or near the 12-mile international waters limit, although some missions actually penetrated into Soviet airspace. The flight profiles of these missions—above 30,000 feet and in excess of 300 knots—made interception by Soviet air forces difficult until the Soviet&#x27;s 1948 introduction of the MiG-15 jet fighter. Project Nanook, the Cold War&#x27;s first Top Secret reconnaissance effort, used the first RB-29 missions for mapping and visual reconnaissance in the Arctic and along the northern Soviet coast. Later missions were Project LEOPARD along the Chukchi Peninsula, followed by Projects RICKRACK, STONEWORK, and COVERALLS.

In 1946, the US possessed only nine atomic bombs and twenty-seven B-29s capable at any one time of delivering them. Furthermore, it was later determined that an attack by the 509th Composite Bomb Group during the 1947 to 1948 time frame would have required at least five to six days just to transfer custody of the bombs from United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) sites to SAC and deploy the aircraft and weapons to forward operating bases before launching nuclear strikes.

Postwar budget and personnel cuts had an insidious effect on SAC as its Deputy Commander, Major General Clements McMullen, implemented mandated force reductions. This continued to wear down SAC as a command and morale plummeted. As a result, by the end of 1947, only two of SAC&#x27;s eleven groups were combat ready. After the 1948 Bikini Atoll nuclear tests, the &quot;Half Moon&quot; Joint Emergency War Plan developed in May 1948 proposed dropping 50 atomic bombs on twenty Soviet cities, with President Harry S. Truman approving &quot;Half Moon&quot; during the June 1948 Berlin Blockade, (Truman sent B-29s to Europe in July). SAC also ordered special ELINT RB-29s to detect improved Soviet radars and, in cooperation with the 51st Air Force Base Unit, SAC also monitored radioactive fallout from Soviet atomic testing on Novaya Zemlya.

In terms of overall Air Force basing and infrastructure, SAC continued to acquire an ever-increasing share of USAF infrastructure and the USAF associated budget. In 1947, before the USAF was established as an independent service, construction commenced on Limestone AAF, Maine (later renamed Loring AFB), a new SAC installation specifically designed to accommodate the B-36 Peacemaker. Fort Dix AAF, New Jersey (later McGuire AFB); Spokane AAF, Washington (later Fairchild AFB); and Wendover Field, Utah (later Wendover AFB) were also transferred to SAC between 30 April and 1 September 1947. Following the establishment of the USAF as a separate service, SAC bases in the United States consisted of:
* Castle Air Force Base, California
* Patrick Air Force Base, Florida
* Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico 
* Carswell Air Force Base, Texas
* Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona

* Amarillo AFB, Texas
* Eglin AFB, Florida
* Lowry AFB, Colorado
* Mather AFB, California
* Robins AFB, Georgia
* Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina

* Altus AFB, Oklahoma
* Laughlin AFB, Texas
* MacDill AFB, Florida
* Homestead AFB, Florida
* Travis AFB, California

== Run-up to Korea and start of the Cold War ==


SAC transferred to the United States Air Force on 26 September 1947, concurrent with the latter&#x27;s establishment as a separate military service. Units directly under SAC HQ included the 8AF and 15AF, as well as the 311th Air Division, 4th Fighter Wing, 82nd Fighter Wing, 307th Bomb Wing, and two reconnaissance units, the 311th Reconnaissance Wing and the 46th Reconnaissance Squadron. The 56th Fighter Wing was subsequently assigned to SAC on 1 October 1947.

Following the establishment of the U.S. Air Force, most SAC installations on U.S. territory were renamed as &quot;Air Force Base&quot; during late 1947 and into 1948, while non-U.S. installations were renamed as &quot;Air Base&quot;.

In May 1948, in an exercise versus Air Defense Command&#x27;s &quot;Blue&quot; force, a SAC &quot;Red&quot; strike force simulated attacks on Eastern Seaboard targets as far south as Virginia. After a &quot;scathing&quot; 1948 Lindbergh review of SAC operations in the air and at six SAC bases, General Kenney was removed as Commanding General on 15 October 1948 and replaced on 19 October 1948 by 8AF&#x27;s commander, Lieutenant General Curtis LeMay. Upon LeMay&#x27;s assumption of command, SAC had only 60 nuclear-capable aircraft, none of which possessed a realistic long range capability against the Soviet Union.

LeMay proposed that SAC should be able to deliver 80% of its weapons in one mission. The B-29D, which had become the B-50 in December 1945, was first delivered to SAC in June 1948. This was followed by SAC&#x27;s first Convair B-36 Peacemaker bomber arriving at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico in September 1948.

In November 1948, LeMay had SAC&#x27;s headquarters and its command post moved from Andrews AFB, Maryland to Offutt AFB, Nebraska. At Offutt, the command moved into the &quot;A Building&quot;, a three-story facility that had previously been used by the Glenn L. Martin Company during World War II. Concurrent with the establishment of this new headquarters facility, Lemay also increased SAC Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS) runs the same year to 12,084. SAC also enhanced its organic fighter escort capability by initiating replacement of its World War II vintage piston-engine F-51D Mustang and F-82E Twin Mustang fighter aircraft with F-84G Thunderjets.

In January 1949, SAC conducted simulated raids on Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. Assessments of these simulated raids by &quot;...LeMay&#x27;s entire command...were appalling&quot;, despite the SAC deputy commander, Major General McMullen, having instructed all bomber units to improve their effectiveness. To motivate crews and improve operational effectiveness command-wide, SAC established a competition, the first so-called &quot;Bomb Comp&quot; in 1948. Winners of this inaugural event were the 43rd Bombardment Group (unit) and, for aircrew award, a B-29 team from the 509th Bombardment Group.

Given its global operating environment, SAC also opened its own survival school at Camp Carson, Colorado in 1949, later moving this school to Stead AFB, Nevada in 1952 before transferring the school to the Air Training Command in 1954.

SAC also created Emergency War Plan 1–49 (EWP 1–49), which outlined the means for delivering 133 atomic bombs, &quot;...the entire stockpile...in a single massive attack...&quot; on 70 Soviet cities over a 30-day period.

The first Soviet atomic bomb test occurred on 29 August 1949 and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) subsequently identified SAC&#x27;s primary objective was to damage or destroy the Soviet Union&#x27;s ability to deliver nuclear weapons. The JCS further defined SAC&#x27;s secondary objective was to stop any Soviet advances into Western Europe, and its tertiary objective was the previous EWP 1–49 industrial mission.

== Korean War ==
In July 1950, in response to combat operations on the Korean peninsula, SAC dispatched ten nuclear-capable bombers to Guam and deployed four B-29 bomber wings in Korea for tactical operations, although this action caused SAC commander LeMay to comment &quot;...too many splinters were being whittled off the [deterrence] stick&quot;.

Initial SAC B-29 successes against North Korea in the summer of 1950 were countered by subsequent Soviet MiG-15 fighter-interceptors, and SAC&#x27;s 27th Fighter Escort Wing began escorting the bombers with F–84 Thunderjets. Ground-directed bombing (GDB) was subsequently used for close air support (CAS) missions after three SAC radar bomb scoring (RBS) squadron detachments (Dets C, K, &amp; N) arrived at Pusan in September 1950. In 1951, SAC &quot;began to eliminate its combat groups&quot;, transferring medium bombardment groups &quot;to Far East Air Forces (FEAF) Bomber Command for combat.&quot; In 1951, LeMay convinced the Air Staff to allow SAC to approve nuclear targets, and he continued refusing to submit war plans for JCS review, which the JCS eventually came to accept (of 20,000 candidates in 1960, SAC designated 3,560 as bombing targets—mostly Soviet air defense: airfields and suspected missile sites.)

Although experimented with prior to World War II, SAC refined aerial refueling to a fine art. SAC&#x27;s in-flight refueling mission began in July 1952 when its 31st Fighter-Escort Wing refueled sixty F-84G Thunderjets from Turner AFB, Georgia to Travis AFB, California non-stop with fuel from twenty-four KB-29P Superfortresses modified into aerial tankers. Exercise FOX PETER ONE followed with 31st FEW fighters being refueled Hickam AFB en route to Hawaii.

On 15 March 1953, a 38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron RB-50 returned fire on a Soviet MiG-15, while a 343d Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron RB-50 was shot down over the Sea of Japan 2 days after the Korean Armistice, while on 7 November 1954, an RB-29 was shot down near Hokkaido Island in northern Japan. By the time of 27 July 1953 Korean War cease-fire, SAC B-29s had flown over 21,000 sorties and dropped nearly 167,000 tons of bombs, with thirty-four B-29s lost in combat and forty-eight B-29s were lost to damage or crashes.

== Cold War and massive retaliation ==

SAC&#x27;s first jet strategic bomber was the swept-wing B-47 medium bomber, which first entered service in 1951 and became operational within SAC in 1953. The B-47 was a component of the October 1953 &quot;New Look&quot; strategy, which articulated, in part, that: &quot;&quot;...to minimize the threat...the major purpose of air defense was not to shoot down enemy bombers—it was to allow SAC...to get into the air&quot;[--and]&quot; not be destroyed on the ground&quot;[--to allow]&quot; massive retaliation&quot;.&quot;

Concern of a bomber gap grew after the 1955 Soviet Aviation Day and the Soviets rejected the &quot;Open Skies&quot; Treaty proposed at the Geneva Summit on 21 July 1955. US bomber strength peaked with &quot;over 2,500 bombers&quot; after production &quot;of over 2,000 B-47s and almost 750 B-52s&quot; (circa 1956, 50% of SAC aircraft &amp; 80% of SAC bombers were B-47s).

In an effort to concurrently enhance its reconnaissance capabilities, SAC also received several RB-57D Canberra aircraft in April 1956, with the aircraft initially based at Turner AFB, Georgia. In 1957, these aircraft were forward deployed to Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany, in order to conduct reconnaissance missions along the borders of the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact nations. However, an unintended consequence of this deployment was that Hawker Hunter fighters of the Royal Air Force stationed in the United Kingdom and in continental Europe often intercepted these classified RB-57 missions as they returned to Rhein-Main AB from over the Baltic.

Since it was designed as a medium bomber, SAC&#x27;s B-47 Stratojet traded speed for range. Because of this shorter range, and in order to better enable the B-47 fleet to reach its target sets in the Soviet Union, SAC routinely deployed its US-based B-47 wings to overseas forward operating bases in North Africa, Spain and Turkey. This program, in effect from 1957 to 1966, was known as &quot;Reflex&quot; with Sixteenth Air Force (16AF), a SAC numbered air force permanently stationed in Europe, having tactical and administrative control of the forward-deployed aircraft and units.

Beginning in 1955, SAC also moved a portion of its bomber and aerial refueling aircraft to 24-hour alert status, either on the ground or airborne. By 1960, fully one third of SAC&#x27;s bombers and aerial refueling aircraft were on 24-hour alert, with those crews and aircraft not already airborne ready to take off from designated alert sites at their respective bases within fifteen minutes. Bomber aircraft on ground alert were armed with nuclear weapons while aerial tanker aircraft were sufficiently fueled to provide maximum combat fuel offload to the bombers.

Concurrent with this increased alert posture and in order to better hone strategic bombing skillsets, the 1955 SAC Bombing and Navigation Competition was characterized by radar bomb scoring (RBS) runs on Amarillo, Denver, Salt Lake City, Kansas City, San Antonio and Phoenix; and the 1957 competition (nicknamed &quot;Operation Longshot&quot;) had three targets: Atlanta, Kansas City, and St. Louis. This use of RBS with simulated target areas utilizing mobile and fixed bomb scoring sites adjacent to major cities, industrial areas, military installations and dedicated bombing ranges throughout the United States. This format would continue through successive SAC Bombing and Navigation Competitions through the remainder of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Commencing in the late 1950s, in addition to representation from every SAC wing with a bombing and/or air refueling mission, later SAC competitions would also include participating bomber and aerial refueling units from the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Bomber Command and (after 30 April 1968) its successor, RAF Strike Command.

== Nuclear Bunkers, SAC Ground Alert, and transfer of SAC&#x27;s Fighter-Escort Wings ==

It was described as the &quot;Western Pentagon,&quot; specifically a, &quot;...four-story, reinforced concrete and masonry office building...&quot; above ground and a &quot;...segregated, adjacent three-story below ground command post.&quot; This was the description of what would become Building 500 at Offutt AFB and the new headquarters complex built expressly for SAC, with construction commencing in 1955. SAC headquarters moved from the A Building at Offutt AFB to Building 500 in 1957. The underground nuclear bunker had 24-inch thick walls and base floor, 10-inch thick intermediate floors, and 24-to-42-inch thick roof. It also contained a war room with six 16-foot data display screens and the capacity to sustain up to 800 people underground for two weeks. The below ground bunker portion of the headquarters complex also contained an IBM 704 computer, which was used to develop monthly weather forecasts at targets, as well as for computing fuel consumption and fallout cloud patterns for planning strike routes and egress routes (e.g., determining the timing as to which targets to bomb first).

In 1957, SAC also constructed The Notch, a facility alternatively known as the 8th Air Force Combat Operations Center (COC) and the Westover Communications Annex, since it was a sub-post of nearby Westover AFB. A 3-story nuclear bunker located on Bare Mountain, Massachusetts, The Notch was built with three-foot thick walls, 1.5 foot thick steel blast doors, and 20 feet underground to protect 350 people for 35 days. The Notch was shut down as a SAC facility in 1970 when 8th Air Force was relocated to Barksdale AFB, Louisiana.

Despite this investment in &quot;hardened&quot; headquarters and command and control facilities, the 1957 Gaither Commission identified, &quot;...little likelihood of SAC&#x27;s bombers surviving [a Soviet first strike] since there was no way to detect an incoming attack until the first [Soviet nuclear weapon] warhead landed.&quot; As a result, SAC&#x27;s bombers and tankers began sitting armed ground alert at their respective bases on 1 Oct 57.

In another organizational change during this time period, SAC&#x27;s fighter escort wings were transferred to Tactical Air Command (TAC) during 1957 and 1958. Finally, during January 1958&#x27;s Exercise Fir Fly, SAC &quot;faker&quot; aircraft (twelve B-47s) simulated bombing strikes against metropolitan areas and military installations in the United States defended by Air Defense Command&#x27;s 28th Air Division.

== Nuclear missiles, aircrew readiness, airborne alert, and strategic reconnaissance ==

After SAC&#x27;s 1st Missile Division was activated on 18 March 1957, SAC HQ established the Office of Assistant CINCSAC (SAC MIKE) at the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division in California on 1 January 1958. SAC MIKE was responsible for missile development liaison, the intermediate range Jupiter and Thor missiles having been transferred to SAC for alert in 1958.

Beginning on 1 February 1958, a SAC Liaison Team was also located at the NORAD Command Post at Ent AFB, Colorado, and the two commands agreed that direct land line communications should connect SAC bases with NORAD&#x27;s Air Defense Direction Centers. Also in the late 1950s, SAC continued to enhance its intelligence collection activities and develop innovative means of improving the survivability of its forces to surprise attack. From 1958 to about 1967, a SAC Detachment (TUSLOG Det 50) operated at Incirlik AB, Turkey, monitoring Soviet missile telemetry from the Kapustin Yar and Tyuratam launch complexes. In 1959-60, SAC evaluated deploying Minuteman I ICBMs via civilian railroad tracks on USAF-operated locomotives and trains.

President Eisenhower approved the first Atlas ICBM launch by a SAC crew for 9 September 1959 at Vandenberg AFB.

While missile operations continued to ramp up, robust training for flight crews to ensure survivability for strike missions also continued. In some instances SAC bombers would oppose ADC fighter-interceptors simulating Soviet interceptors. Conversely, SAC assisted ADC readiness by simulating Soviet bomber threats to the continental United States that ADC fighters would respond to. However, following a mid-air collision between an ADC F-102 and a SAC B-47 during a 17 December 1959 Quick Kick exercise, simulated NORAD fighter attacks were prohibited against SAC bombers.

On 18 March 1960, SAC intercontinental missiles began alert at Maine&#x27;s Snark Missile Launch Complex adjacent to Presque Isle AFB. The following month, on 22 April 1960, SAC turned over the last British-based PGM-17 Thor IRBM to the Royal Air Force. This was soon followed by SAC&#x27;s first Titan I ICBMs at Lowry AFB&#x27;s Titan I Missile Complex 1A in Colorado being placed on alert that June.

Beginning in November 1959, in order to counter Soviet surface-to-air missile threats, SAC began adding low-altitude bombing training for its manned bomber force as an adjunct to its legacy high-altitude training. Use of low level flight route corridors known as &quot;Oil Burner&quot; routes (later renamed &quot;Olive Branch&quot; routes in the 1970s), and the first of three SAC RBS trains were utilized starting in 1960. On 30 June 1960, SAC had 696 aircraft on alert in the Zone of Interior, also known as the ZI (referred to today as the Continental United States, or CONUS) and at overseas bases. These 696 aircraft were 113 B-52s, 346 B-47s, 85 KC-135s, and 152 KC-97s. SAC&#x27;s Emergency War Order (EWO) required the first aircraft to be airborne within 8 minutes and all aircraft to be airborne within 15 minutes after notification.

During the mid-1950s, having recalled numerous World War II USAAF and Korean War USAF combat veteran pilots, navigators, bombardiers and aircrewmen from inactive reserve status back to various lengths of active duty, SAC took the lead in integrating the Air Force&#x27;s reserve components into the overall SAC structure. By the beginning of the 1960s, SAC had also engineered the assignment of KC-97 Stratofreighter aerial refueling aircraft to Air National Guard groups and wings and having them fall under SAC&#x27;s operational claimancy.

On 11 August 1960, President Eisenhower approved the creation of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS), co-located at SAC headquarters at Offutt AFB.) JSTPS also included non-SAC agencies tasked with preparing the Single Integrated Operation Plan, or SIOP, and the National Strategic Target List for nuclear war.

On 1 July 1960, a SAC RB-47 with a six-man crew was shot down in international airspace over the Barents Sea by a Soviet MiG-19. Four of the crewmen were killed and two surviving crewmen were captured and held in Lubyanka Prison in Moscow for seven months.

On 3 February 1961, SAC&#x27;s Boeing EC-135 Looking Glass, began operations as the Airborne Command Post for the Nuclear Triad and the Post-Attack Command and Control System. From this date and for the next years, until 24 July 1990, SAC would maintain at least one Looking Glass aircraft continuously aloft 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, with an embarked SAC general officer and battle staff, ready to assume command of all strategic nuclear strike forces in the event that SAC headquarters was destroyed in a Soviet first strike.

SAC&#x27;s airborne alerts during this period also included Operation Chrome Dome for the bomber and tanker force. Although ostensibly a peacetime mission, Chrome Dome placed heavy demands on flight crews and five B-52 aircraft were lost to airborne mishaps during the operation&#x27;s eight-year period.


On 11 May 1961, SAC took delivery of its first B-58 Hustler supersonic medium bomber, assigning it to the 305th Bombardment Wing at Bunker Hill AFB. Optimized for high-altitude, high-speed penetration into Soviet territory prior to Soviet advancements in high-altitude surface-to-air missiles, the B-58 was expensive to operate and inefficient at lower altitudes. Its service in SAC would be comparatively short, eventually being replaced by the FB-111 by 1970.

After an early 1961 development by SAC of a Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS) field kit for use in the U.S. Army&#x27;s Nike surface-to-air missile systems, SAC aircraft flew several mock penetrations into Air Defense Command sectors in the 1961 SAGE/Missile Master test program, as well as the joint SAC-NORAD Sky Shield II exercise followed by Sky Shield III on 2 September 1962.

In 1961, following the Berlin Crisis, President John F. Kennedy increased the number of SAC aircraft on alert to 50 percent and during periods of increased tensions SAC kept some B-52 airborne in the event of a surprise attack.

In 1962, SAC gained full control of the various &quot;Q Areas&quot; developed by Sandia Laboratories for nuclear weapon storage adjacent to Loring AFB (Site E (Maine)/Caribou AFS), Ellsworth AFB (Site F (South Dakota)/Rushmore AFS), Fairchild AFB (Site G (Washington)/Deep Creek AFS), Travis AFB (Site H (California)/Fairfield AFS), and Westover AFB (Site I (Massachusetts)/Stony Brook AFS). These adjunct sites were subsequently converted to USAF-operated and maintained weapon storage areas (WSAs) in the same manner as WSAs on other SAC bases.

The solid fuel LGM-30A Minuteman I was first deployed in 1962 and the LGM-25C Titan II reached operational service in 1963. Project Added Effort phased out all first-generation ICBMs beginning on 1 May 1964 when Atlas-D were taken off alert at Vandenberg AFB&#x27;s 576th SMS (LGM-30F Minuteman II replaced Minuteman I in 1965).

In October 1962, an SAC BRASS KNOB mission U-2 piloted by Major Richard S. Heyser detected Soviet intermediate range ballistic missiles in Cuba. BRASS KNOB operations involving multiple U-2 aircraft were subsequently commenced at a forward operating location at McCoy AFB, Florida the same month. On the morning of 27 October, a SAC RB-47H of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, forward deployed to Kindley AFB, Bermuda crashed on takeoff, killing all four crewmembers, while later that afternoon, a 4028th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron U-2 forward deployed to McCoy AFB for BRASS KNOB operations was shot down over Cuba by an SA-2 Guideline missile, killing the pilot, Major Rudolf Anderson.

Throughout the early 1960s, the Kennedy Administration, under the aegis of Secretary of Defense McNamara, cancelled numerous SAC modernization programs. This included the Mach 3 North American B-70 Valkyrie in 1961, the GAM-87 Skybolt missile in 1962, and the Rocky Mountain Deep Underground Support Center in 1963. The B-70&#x27;s demise came due to its design as a high-altitude bomber with very limited low-altitude performance, making it vulnerable to rapid advances in Soviet high altitude surface-to-air missile defense systems. The following year, Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, was cancelled following numerous test failures and the perceived greater reliability of land-based and submarine-based ballistic missile systems. Although initially entering service in 1957, SAC&#x27;s 2nd-generation aerial refueling aircraft, the KC-135 Stratotanker, had reached sufficient inventory numbers to allow SAC to begin divestiture of its KC-97 Stratofreighter tankers, transferring them to SAC-gained Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard units. As the KC-135 became the primary aerial tanker in active service, SAC employed the aircraft for several non-stop B-52 and KC-135 flights around the world, demonstrating that SAC no longer needed to depend on Reflex stations at air bases in Spain and Britain.)

== Vietnam War and latter half of the Cold War ==

===SAC&#x27;s air war in Vietnam===
After the Secretary of Defense rejected LeMay&#x27;s November 1964 proposal for a &quot;...strategic air campaign against 94 targets in North Vietnam...&quot;, thirty SAC B-52Fs were deployed to Andersen AFB, Guam on 17 February 1965, representing the first increment of SAC aircraft forward deployed for the Vietnam War. The following month, in March 1965, the Strategic Air Command Advanced Echelon (SACADVON) was established as a &quot;...liaison unit for CINCSAC [was] located at MACV Headquarters to assist with the B-52 effort.&quot;

On 23 May 1965, SAC B-52Fs began unarmed missions for radar mapping &quot;...and later to test bombing with the assistance of ground homing beacons...&quot; SAC began saturation bombing on 18 June 1965 (8000 tons per month in 1966) and conducted Operation Arc Light missions from 1965 until the end of hostilities involving U.S. forces in 1973.

All B-52F missions in 1965 were against targets in South Vietnam (RVN) except for the December &quot;...Duck Flight mission [that] hit a suspected VC supply storage area [for which] part of the target box was in Laos.&quot; In April 1966, Vietnam operations began with the B-52D model, a 1956 model designed to use the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missile and the ADM-20 Quail aerial decoys for low altitude operations and modified in late 1965 by Project Big Belly to increase conventional bomb capacity.

SAC&#x27;s RBS Squadrons were discontinued when most detachment personnel transferred to Vietnam from 1966 to 1973 for Combat Skyspot ground-directed bombing operations. The first &quot;Quick Reaction&quot; bombing was the &quot;Pink Lady&quot; mission on 6 July 1966 using SAC B-52D/Fs to support the U.S. Army&#x27;s 1st Air Cavalry Division. The 1972 Operation Linebacker II also used Skyspot for Hanoi/Haiphong bombings in North Vietnam which resulted in the loss of 25 SAC aircrew members.

By May 1967, SACADVON had moved to Seventh Air Force headquarters at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, South Vietnam to schedule and coordinate &quot;...strikes for the 7th AF and MACV.&quot; From a level of 161,921 military and 20,215 civilian assigned to SAC in June 1968, SAC lost 13,698 first term airmen from November 1968 to May 1969 in a three phase drawdown known as Project 693 to comply with Public Law 90-364.

While conventional bombing, air refueling and strategic air reconnaissance operations in Southeast Asia increasingly occupied SAC&#x27;s operational commitments, SAC&#x27;s primary mission of nuclear deterrence continued to remain its primary focus. In 1969, &quot;...SAC&#x27;s B-52s and B-58s could carry B28, B41, B43, B53, and BA53 nuclear weapons&quot; (SAC had 311 nuclear AGM-28 Hound Dog missiles at the end of the year.) This also coincided with the B-58 Hustler&#x27;s in-progress retirement from SAC&#x27;s active inventory and its replacement with the FB-111.

On 18 March 1969, along the South Vietnamese border, SAC first bombed Cambodia (Operation Menu through 26 May 1970 was controlled by Skyspot). On 17 February 1970, SAC conducted the first &quot;GOOD LOOK&quot; bombing of Laos at the Plaine des Jarres after B-52 photorecon missions (&quot;GOOD LOOK ALPHA&quot; in August 1969 and &quot;GOOD LOOK BRAVO&quot; ) and the observations of a Skyspot installation in Thailand. SAC transferred &quot;...HQ 8th AF...to Andersen AFB, Guam on 1 April 1970 to oversee B-52D/G operations and to complement SACADVON&quot;. 8th AF took over from Third Air Division the generation of &quot;frag&quot; orders based on daily strike requests and amendments from COMUSMACV.

In 1970, SAC deployed the LGM-30G Minuteman III ICBM with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle or MIRVs, for striking 3 targets, while concurrently retiring the B-58 Hustler supersonic bomber.

1972 saw the commencement of Operation Linebacker II, a combined Seventh Air Force and U.S. Navy Task Force 77 aerial bombing campaign, conducted against targets in North Vietnam during the final period of US involvement in the Vietnam War. Linebacker II was conducted from 18 to 29 December 1972, leading to several informal names such as &quot;The December Raids&quot; and &quot;The Christmas Bombings&quot;. Unlike the previous Operation Rolling Thunder and Operation Linebacker interdiction operations, Linebacker II would be a &quot;maximum effort&quot; bombing campaign to destroy major target complexes in the Hanoi and Haiphong areas which could only be accomplished by SAC B-52D/Gs. It saw the largest heavy bomber strikes launched by the U.S. Air Force since the end of World War II. Linebacker II was a modified extension of the Operation Linebacker bombings conducted from May to October 1972, with the emphasis of the new campaign shifted to attacks by B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers rather than smaller tactical fighter aircraft. During Linebacker II, a total of 741 B-52D/G sorties were dispatched from bases in Thailand and Guam to bomb North Vietnam and 729 actually completed their missions. Overall SAC losses during Linebacker II numbered fifteen B-52s. The U.S. government claimed that the operation had succeeded in forcing North Vietnam&#x27;s Politburo to return to the negotiating table, with the Paris Peace Accords signed shortly after the operation.

By early 1973, offensive SAC air operations in Southeast Asia ceased and numerous SAC aircrewmen who had been shot down and captured as prisoners of war by North Vietnam were repatriated to the United States.

SAC aircraft used during the Vietnam War included B-52D, B-52F, B-52G, KC-135A, KC-135Q, various versions of the RC-135, SR-71, U-2, and EC-135.

===Post-Vietnam, 1970s budget cuts, 1980s renewal, and the Cold War redux===
During the Vietnam War, due to the escalating costs of combat operations in Southeast Asia, SAC was required to close several SAC bases, consolidate other bases, or transfer several bases to other MAJCOMs, other services, or the Air Reserve Component in order to remain within budgetary constraints. This included:
* Altus AFB (transferred to MAC, later to AETC)
* Bergstrom AFB (transferred to TAC, then ACC until BRAC closure in 1993)
* Columbus AFB (transferred to ATC, now AETC)
* Clinton-Sherman AFB (closed)
* Dow AFB (closed; portion transferred to ANG as Bangor ANGB)
* Hunter AFB (transferred to US Army as Hunter AAF)
* Larson AFB (closed)
* Lincoln AFB (closed; portion transferred to ANG as Lincoln ANGB)
* Little Rock AFB (transferred to TAC, later MAC, now AMC)
* Mountain Home AFB (transferred to TAC, now ACC)
* Turner AFB (transferred to USN as NAS Albany in 1968, closed 1975)

With the Vietnam War draw-down following the Paris Peace Treaty in 1973, reduced defense budgets forced SAC to inactivate several more wings, close still more bases in CONUS and Puerto Rico, transfer still additional bases to other MAJCOMS or the Air Reserve Component, and retire older B-52B, B-52C, B-52E and B-52F aircraft:
* Davis-Monthan AFB (transferred to TAC, now ACC)
* Forbes AFB (closed; portion transferred to ANG as Forbes ANGB)
* Glasgow AFB (closed)
* Kincheloe AFB (closed)
* McCoy AFB (closed; portion transferred to USN as Naval Training Center Orlando McCoy Annex until its BRAC-directed closure in 1999)
* Ramey AFB (closed; portion transferred to USCG as CGAS Borinquen)
* Rickenbacker AFB (closed; portion transferred to ANG as Rickenbacker ANGB)
* Westover AFB (transferred to AFRES, now AFRC, as Westover ARB)
* Wright-Patterson AFB (tenant SAC presence departed and transferred to Beale AFB; base remained with AFLC, now AFMC)

In 1973, the National Emergency Airborne Command Post, or NEACP, aircraft entered SAC&#x27;s inventory. Consisting of four Boeing E-4 aircraft, these highly modified Boeing 747 airframes were assigned to the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing at Offutt AFB and were forward deployed as necessary to support the National Command Authority.

By 1975, SAC&#x27;s manned bomber strength included several hundred B-52D, B-52G, B-52H and FB-111A aircraft, and &quot;...SAC&#x27;s first major exercise in 23 years&quot; was Exercise Global Shield 79. As for the ICBM force, SAC reached a peak strength of 1000 Minuteman II and III and 54 Titan II ICBMs on active status before seeing reductions and retirements through a combination of obsolescing systems and various arms reduction treaties with the Soviet Union.

By 1977, SAC had been pinning its hopes for a new manned strategic bomber in the form of the Rockwell B-1A Lancer. However, on 30 June 1977, President Jimmy Carter Carter announced that the B-1A would be canceled in favor of ICBMs, submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and a fleet of modernized B-52s armed with air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs).

On 1 December 1979, SAC assumed control of the ballistic missile warning system (BMEWS) and all Space Surveillance Network facilities from the inactivating Aerospace Defense Command (ADC). These activities would later be (transferred to Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) when the latter was established in 1982. SAC also continued to operate the Air Force&#x27;s entire KC-135 aerial refueling fleet, its EC-135 LOOKING GLASS and E-4 NEACAP command post aircraft, as well the entire strategic reconnaissance aircraft fleet consisting of the U-2, SR-71, RC-135, and WC-135.

In 1981, SAC received a new air refueling tanker aircraft to supplement the aging KC-135 Stratotanker force. Based on the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 commercial airliner, the KC-10A Extender was deployed equipped with improved military avionics, aerial refueling, and satellite communications equipment. That same year, President Ronald Reagan reversed the 1977 Carter administration decision regarding the B-1, directing that 100 examples of a refined version of the aircraft, now designated the B-1B Lancer, be procured as a long-range combat aircraft for SAC.

The LGM-118A Peacekeeper ICBM reached SAC in 1986, and the 114 Peacekeepers had a total warhead yield of about 342 megatons. This also served to offset the retirement of the obsolescent and maintenance-intensive LGM-25C Titan II ICBM, the last example of which was deactivated in May 1987. An additional underground &quot;16,000 square-foot, two-story reinforced concrete&quot; command post for HQ SAC was also constructed at Offutt AFB from 1986 to 1989 from a design by Leo A. Daly, who had designed the adjoining 1957 bunker. The first Rockwell B-1B Lancer was also delivered to SAC in 1987.

On 22 November 1988, the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit, under development as the Advanced Technology Bomber (ATB), a so-called &quot;black program&quot; since 1979, was officially acknowledged and rolled out for the first time for public display. The first &quot;stealth bomber&quot; designed for SAC, the aircraft made its first flight in May 1989.

== End of the Cold War and Operation Desert Storm ==
SAC reorganization at the end of the Cold War began as early as 1988 when the Carlucci Commission planned the closure of:
* Mather Air Force Base, California, an ATC undergraduate navigator training (UNT) base which hosted a tenant SAC B-52G / KC-135E bomb wing and a SAC-gained AFRES KC-135A air refueling group; and
* Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire, a SAC base with an FB-111A and KC-135E bomb wing and a SAC-gained ANG KC-135A air refueling wing

The closures were the beginning of a post-Cold War process that would later become known as Base Realignment and Closure or BRAC. Although Mather AFB&#x27;s navigator training mission would relocate to Randolph AFB, Texas, the Mather B-52G bomber/KC-135A tanker wing would inactivate and the AFRES KC-135 tanker group would relocate to nearby McClellan AFB, relocating again four years later to Beale AFB when another BRAC process would close McClellan AFB.

Concurrently, the Pease AFB bomber/tanker wing would lose its FB-111 aircraft and transfer to Whiteman AFB, Missouri in preparation for transition to the B-2 Spirit while a portion of Pease would be transferred to the New Hampshire Air National Guard for its ANG KC-135 air refueling wing and be renamed Pease Air National Guard Base.

Additional closures and divestments of SAC bases would continue throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, accelerating even more so as a result the START I Treaty&#x27;s mandated elimination of both the entire B-52G fleet and the inactivation of all Minuteman II and Peacekeeper ICBMs, as well as the 1992 reorganization of the Air Force that disestablished SAC and dispersed its assets to other new or existing MAJCOMs, primarily ACC and AMC. In addition to closures of Mather AFB and Pease AFB, this would eventually include the following subsequent closure and realignment actions, primarily due to BRAC:
* Altus AFB (tenant SAC presence disestablished and transferred to AMC, later AETC)
* Barksdale AFB (transferred to ACC, now AFGSC)
* Beale AFB (transferred to ACC)
* Carswell AFB (transferred to USN as NAS JRB Fort Worth per BRAC)
** AFRES (later AFRC) HQ 10th Air Force, an ACC-gained AF Reserve fighter wing, and an AMC-gained ANG airlift wing remain
* Castle AFB (closed by BRAC)
* Dyess AFB (transferred to ACC, now AFGSC)
* Eaker AFB (closed by BRAC)
* Ellsworth AFB (transferred to ACC, now AFGSC)
* Fairchild AFB (transferred to AMC)
* F. E. Warren AFB (transferred to ACC, then AFSPC, now AFGSC)
* Grand Forks AFB (transferred to AMC, now ACC)
* Griffiss AFB (closed by BRAC)
** AFMC Rome Air Development Center and ANG Northeast Air Defense Sector HQ remain
* Grissom AFB (transferred to AFRC as Grissom ARB)
* K. I. Sawyer AFB (closed by BRAC)
* Loring AFB (closed by BRAC)
* Malmstrom AFB (transferred to AMC, then AFSPC, now AFGSC)
* March AFB (transferred to AFRC as March ARB per BRAC)
* McConnell AFB (transferred to AMC)
* Minot AFB (transferred to ACC, now AFGSC)
* Offutt AFB (transferred to ACC)
* Plattsburgh AFB (closed by BRAC)
* Robins AFB (tenant Regular AF SAC presence disestablished; base remains an AFMC installation with ACC and ACC-gained ANG flying wings)
* Seymour Johnson AFB (TAC base transferred to ACC; tenant SAC presence disestablished and SAC-gained tenant AF Reserve presence transferred to AFRC, now gained by AMC)
* Whiteman AFB (transferred to ACC, now AFGSC)
* Wurtsmith AFB (closed by BRAC)
On 1 July 1989, the 1st Combat Evaluation Group reporting directly to SAC headquarters was split with most HQ 1CEVG organizations transferring to SAC HQ (e.g., the Command Instrument Flight Division) and RBS personnel, equipment, and radar stations becoming the 1st Electronic Combat Range Group. Airborne NEACP alerts ended in 1990 and during 1991&#x27;s Operation Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion and occupation, SAC bomber, tanker and reconnaissance aircraft flew operations (e.g., B-52s with conventional bombs and conventional warhead AGM-86 ALCMs) near Iraq from bases in Great Britain, Turkey, Cyprus, Diego Garcia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.

Following Operation Desert Storm, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the &quot;de facto&quot; end of the Cold War, President George H. W. Bush and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney directed SAC to take all bomber and refueling aircraft and Minuteman II ICBMs off of continuous nuclear alert on 27 September 1991 and placing said aircraft on quick reaction ground alert.

The 31 May 1992 major reorganization of the USAF organizational structure subsequently disestablished SAC, moving its bomber, reconnaissance and aerial command post aircraft and all SAC ICBMs, along with all Tactical Air Command aircraft, to the newly established Air Combat Command (ACC). The newly established Air Mobility Command (AMC) inherited most of SAC&#x27;s KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft and the entire KC-10 Extender aerial refueling tanker force, while some KC-135s were reassigned directly to USAFE and PACAF, with one additional air refueling wing assigned to the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) as the KC-135 formal training unit.

Land-based ICBMs were later transferred from ACC to Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), while manned bombers remained in ACC. USAF nuclear forces in ACC and AFSPC were then combined with the United States Navy&#x27;s Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine forces to form the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), which took over the SAC Headquarters complex at Offutt AFB.

In 2009, the entire land-based USAF ICBM force and that portion of the USAF manned bomber force that was still nuclear-capable, e.g., the B-2 Spirit and B-52 Stratofortress, was transferred to the newly established Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), while the B-1 Lancer conventional bomber force remained in ACC. In 2015, these B-1 units were also transferred to Air Force Global Strike Command, which assumed responsibility for all current and future USAF bomber forces.

== Culture and legacy ==
The Strategic Air Command left a lasting cultural impact in addition to its military legacy. The most prominent slogan associated with SAC is the official motto, “Peace Is Our Profession.” This phrase captured the command&#x27;s role in maintaining peace through deterrence during the Cold War. Another unofficial slogan became part of SAC lore: “To err is human; to forgive is not SAC policy.” This saying reflected the high standards and strict discipline within SAC, where precision and accountability were paramount due to the critical nature of its mission. Additional, unofficial slogans include &quot;Peace Through Strength&quot; and &quot;Peace Through Superior Firepower&quot;.

== Commemoration and new commands ==
The SAC Museum located adjacent to Offutt AFB was moved in 1998 to a site near Ashland, Nebraska and renamed as the Strategic Air and Space Museum in 2001.

Organizations commemorating SAC include the Strategic Air Command Veterans Association, the SAC Society, the B-47 Stratojet Association, the B-52 Stratofortress Association, the FB-111 Association, the SAC Airborne Command Control Association, the Association of Air Force Missileers, the SAC Elite Guard Association and the Strategic Air Command Memorial Amateur Radio Club. After the Cold War, SAC histories included a 1990 almanac and a 2006 organizational history.

In 2009, the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) was activated with the lineage of Strategic Air Command. AFGSC, headquartered at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, is one of two USAF component commands assigned to United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM). AFGSC currently consists of Eighth Air Force (8AF), responsible for the nuclear-capable manned heavy bomber force, and Twentieth Air Force (20AF), responsible for the ICBM force.

<doc id="28119" wikidata="Q187560" url="?curid=28119" title="Scheme (programming language)">
<text>Scheme is a dialect of the Lisp family of programming languages. Scheme was created during the 1970s at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT CSAIL) and released by its developers, Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers. It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose lexical scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization, giving stronger support for functional programming and associated techniques such as recursive algorithms. It was also one of the first programming languages to support first-class continuations. It had a significant influence on the effort that led to the development of Common Lisp.

The Scheme language is standardized in the official Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard and a &quot;de facto&quot; standard called the &quot;Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme&quot; (R&quot;n&quot;RS). A widely implemented standard is R5RS (1998). The most recently ratified standard of Scheme is &quot;R7RS-small&quot; (2013). The more expansive and modular R6RS was ratified in 2007. Both trace their descent from R5RS; the timeline below reflects the chronological order of ratification.

== History ==
===Origins===
Scheme started in the 1970s as an attempt to understand Carl Hewitt&#x27;s Actor model, for which purpose Steele and Sussman wrote a &quot;tiny Lisp interpreter&quot; using Maclisp and then &quot;added mechanisms for creating actors and sending messages&quot;. Scheme was originally called &quot;Schemer&quot;, in the tradition of other Lisp-derived languages such as Planner or &quot;Conniver&quot;. The current name resulted from the authors&#x27; use of the ITS operating system, which limited filenames to two components of at most six characters each. Currently, &quot;Schemer&quot; is commonly used to refer to a Scheme programmer.

===R6RS===
A new language standardization process began at the 2003 Scheme workshop, with the goal of producing an R6RS standard in 2006. This process broke with the earlier R&quot;n&quot;RS approach of unanimity.

R6RS features a standard module system, allowing a split between the core language and libraries. Several drafts of the R6RS specification were released, the final version being R5.97RS. A successful vote resulted in ratifying the new standard, announced on August 28, 2007.

Currently the newest releases of various Scheme implementations support the R6RS standard. There is a portable reference implementation of the proposed implicitly phased libraries for R6RS, called psyntax, which loads and bootstraps itself properly on various older Scheme implementations.

A feature of R6RS is the record-type descriptor (RTD). When an RTD is created and used, the record type representation can show the memory layout. It also calculated object field bit mask and mutable Scheme object field bit masks, and helped the garbage collector know what to do with the fields without traversing the whole fields list that are saved in the RTD. RTD allows users to expand the basic RTD to create a new record system.

R6RS introduces numerous significant changes to the language. The source code is now specified in Unicode, and a large subset of Unicode characters may now appear in Scheme symbols and identifiers, and there are other minor changes to the lexical rules. Character data is also now specified in Unicode. Many standard procedures have been moved to the new standard libraries, which themselves form a large expansion of the standard, containing procedures and syntactic forms that were formerly not part of the standard. A new module system has been introduced, and systems for exception handling are now standardized. Syntax-rules has been replaced with a more expressive syntactic abstraction facility (syntax-case) which allows the use of all of Scheme at macro expansion time. Compliant implementations are now &quot;required&quot; to support Scheme&#x27;s full numeric tower, and the semantics of numbers have been expanded, mainly in the direction of support for the IEEE 754 standard for floating point numerical representation.

===R7RS===
The R6RS standard has caused controversy because some see it as a departure from the minimalist philosophy. In August 2009, the Scheme Steering Committee, which oversees the standardization process, announced its intention to recommend splitting Scheme into two languages: a large modern programming language for programmers; and a small version, a subset of the large version retaining the minimalism praised by educators and casual implementors. Two working groups were created to work on these two new versions of Scheme. The Scheme Reports Process site has links to the working groups&#x27; charters, public discussions and issue tracking system.

The ninth draft of R7RS (small language) was made available on April 15, 2013. A vote ratifying this draft closed on May 20, 2013, and the final report has been available since August 6, 2013, describing &quot;the &#x27;small&#x27; language of that effort: therefore it cannot be considered in isolation as the successor to R6RS&quot;.

== Distinguishing features ==
Scheme is primarily a functional programming language. It shares many characteristics with other members of the Lisp programming language family. Scheme&#x27;s very simple syntax is based on s-expressions, parenthesized lists in which a prefix operator is followed by its arguments. Scheme programs thus consist of sequences of nested lists. Lists are also the main data structure in Scheme, leading to a close equivalence between source code and data formats (homoiconicity). Scheme programs can easily create and evaluate pieces of Scheme code dynamically.

The reliance on lists as data structures is shared by all Lisp dialects. Scheme inherits a rich set of list-processing primitives such as codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3 from its Lisp progenitors. Scheme uses strictly but dynamically typed variables and supports first class procedures. Thus, procedures can be assigned as values to variables or passed as arguments to procedures.

This section concentrates mainly on innovative features of the language, including those features that distinguish Scheme from other Lisps. Unless stated otherwise, descriptions of features relate to the R5RS standard. In examples provided in this section, the notation &quot;===&gt; result&quot; is used to indicate the result of evaluating the expression on the immediately preceding line. This is the same convention used in R5RS.

===Minimalism===

Scheme is a very simple language, much easier to implement than many other languages of comparable expressive power. This ease is attributable to the use of lambda calculus to derive much of the syntax of the language from more primitive forms. For instance of the 23 s-expression-based syntactic constructs defined in the R5RS Scheme standard, 14 are classed as derived or library forms, which can be written as macros involving more fundamental forms, principally lambda. As R5RS (§3.1) says: &quot;The most fundamental of the variable binding constructs is the lambda expression, because all other variable binding constructs can be explained in terms of lambda expressions.&quot;

: Fundamental forms: define, lambda, quote, if, define-syntax, let-syntax, letrec-syntax, syntax-rules, set!
: Derived forms: do, let, let*, letrec, cond, case, and, or, begin, named let, delay, unquote, unquote-splicing, quasiquote

Example: a macro to implement codice_4 as an expression using codice_5 to perform the variable bindings.
(define-syntax let
 (syntax-rules ()
 ((let ((var expr) ...) body ...)
 ((lambda (var ...) body ...) expr ...))))
Thus using codice_4 as defined above a Scheme implementation would rewrite &quot;codice_7&quot; as &quot;codice_8&quot;, which reduces implementation&#x27;s task to that of coding procedure instantiations.

In 1998, Sussman and Steele remarked that the minimalism of Scheme was not a conscious design goal, but rather the unintended outcome of the design process. &quot;We were actually trying to build something complicated and discovered, serendipitously, that we had accidentally designed something that met all our goals but was much simpler than we had intended...we realized that the lambda calculus—a small, simple formalism—could serve as the core of a powerful and expressive programming language.&quot;

===Lexical scope===

Like most modern programming languages and unlike earlier Lisps such as Maclisp, Scheme is lexically scoped: all possible variable bindings in a program unit can be analyzed by reading the text of the program unit without consideration of the contexts in which it may be called. This contrasts with dynamic scoping which was characteristic of early Lisp dialects, because of the processing costs associated with the primitive textual substitution methods used to implement lexical scoping algorithms in compilers and interpreters of the day. In those Lisps, it was perfectly possible for a reference to a free variable inside a procedure to refer to quite distinct bindings external to the procedure, depending on the context of the call.

The impetus to incorporate lexical scoping, which was an unusual scoping model in the early 1970s, into their new version of Lisp, came from Sussman&#x27;s studies of ALGOL. He suggested that ALGOL-like lexical scoping mechanisms would help to realize their initial goal of implementing Hewitt&#x27;s Actor model in Lisp.

The key insights on how to introduce lexical scoping into a Lisp dialect were popularized in Sussman and Steele&#x27;s 1975 Lambda Paper, &quot;Scheme: An Interpreter for Extended Lambda Calculus&quot;, where they adopted the concept of the lexical closure (on page 21), which had been described in an AI Memo in 1970 by Joel Moses, who attributed the idea to Peter J. Landin.

===Lambda calculus===

Alonzo Church&#x27;s mathematical notation, the lambda calculus, has inspired Lisp&#x27;s use of &quot;lambda&quot; as a keyword for introducing a procedure, as well as influencing the development of functional programming techniques involving the use of higher-order functions in Lisp. But early Lisps were not suitable expressions of the lambda calculus because of their treatment of free variables.

A formal lambda system has axioms and a complete calculation rule. It is helpful for the analysis using mathematical logic and tools. In this system, calculation can be seen as a directional deduction. The syntax of lambda calculus follows the recursive expressions from x, y, z, ...,parentheses, spaces, the period and the symbol λ. The function of lambda calculation includes: First, serve as a starting point of powerful mathematical logic. Second, it can reduce the requirement of programmers to consider the implementation details, because it can be used to imitate machine evaluation. Finally, the lambda calculation created a substantial meta-theory.

The introduction of lexical scope resolved the problem by making an equivalence between some forms of lambda notation and their practical expression in a working programming language. Sussman and Steele showed that the new language could be used to elegantly derive all the imperative and declarative semantics of other programming languages including ALGOL and Fortran, and the dynamic scope of other Lisps, by using lambda expressions not as simple procedure instantiations but as &quot;control structures and environment modifiers&quot;. They introduced continuation-passing style along with their first description of Scheme in the first of the Lambda Papers, and in subsequent papers, they proceeded to demonstrate the raw power of this practical use of lambda calculus.

===Block structure===
Scheme inherits its block structure from earlier block structured languages, particularly ALGOL. In Scheme, blocks are implemented by three &quot;binding constructs&quot;: codice_4, codice_10 and codice_11. For instance, the following construct creates a block in which a symbol called codice_12 is bound to the number 10:
(define var &quot;goose&quot;)
;; Any reference to var here will be bound to &quot;goose&quot;
(let ((var 10))
 ;; statements go here. Any reference to var here will be bound to 10.
;; Any reference to var here will be bound to &quot;goose&quot;
Blocks can be nested to create arbitrarily complex block structures according to the need of the programmer. The use of block structuring to create local bindings alleviates the risk of namespace collision that can otherwise occur.

One variant of codice_4, codice_10, permits bindings to refer to variables defined earlier in the same construct, thus:
(let* ((var1 10)
 (var2 (+ var1 12)))
 ;; But the definition of var1 could not refer to var2


The other variant, codice_11, is designed to enable mutually recursive procedures to be bound to one another.
;; Calculation of Hofstadter&#x27;s male and female sequences as a list of pairs

(define (hofstadter-male-female n)
 (letrec ((female (lambda (n)
 (if (= n 0)
 1
 (- n (male (female (- n 1)))))))
 (male (lambda (n)
 (if (= n 0)
 0
 (- n (female (male (- n 1))))))))
 (let loop ((i 0))
 (if (&gt; i n)
 (cons (cons (female i)
 (male i))
 (loop (+ i 1)))))))

(hofstadter-male-female 8)

===&gt; ((1 . 0) (1 . 0) (2 . 1) (2 . 2) (3 . 2) (3 . 3) (4 . 4) (5 . 4) (5 . 5))

(See Hofstadter&#x27;s male and female sequences for the definitions used in this example.)

All procedures bound in a single codice_11 may refer to one another by name, as well as to values of variables defined earlier in the same codice_11, but they may not refer to &quot;values&quot; defined later in the same codice_11.

A variant of codice_4, the &quot;named let&quot; form, has an identifier after the codice_4 keyword. This binds the let variables to the argument of a procedure whose name is the given identifier and whose body is the body of the let form. The body may be repeated as desired by calling the procedure. The named let is widely used to implement iteration.

Example: a simple counter
(let loop ((n 1))
 (if (&gt; n 10)
 (cons n
 (loop (+ n 1)))))

===&gt; (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
Like any procedure in Scheme, the procedure created in the named let is a first-class object.

===Proper tail recursion===

Scheme has an iteration construct, codice_21, but it is more idiomatic in Scheme to use tail recursion to express iteration. Standard-conforming Scheme implementations are required to optimize tail calls so as to support an unbounded number of active tail calls (R5RS sec. 3.5)—a property the Scheme report describes as &quot;proper tail recursion&quot;—making it safe for Scheme programmers to write iterative algorithms using recursive structures, which are sometimes more intuitive. Tail recursive procedures and the &quot;named codice_4&quot; form provide support for iteration using tail recursion.
;; Building a list of squares from 0 to 9:
;; Note: loop is simply an arbitrary symbol used as a label. Any symbol will do.

(define (list-of-squares n)
 (let loop ((i n) (res &#x27;()))
 (if (&lt; i 0)
 res
 (loop (- i 1) (cons (* i i) res)))))

(list-of-squares 9)
===&gt; (0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81)
===First-class continuations===

Continuations in Scheme are first-class objects. Scheme provides the procedure codice_23 (also known as codice_24) to capture the current continuation by packing it up as an escape procedure bound to a formal argument in a procedure provided by the programmer. (R5RS sec. 6.4) First-class continuations enable the programmer to create non-local control constructs such as iterators, coroutines, and backtracking.

Continuations can be used to emulate the behavior of return statements in imperative programming languages. The following function codice_25, given function codice_26 and list codice_27, returns the first element codice_28 in codice_27 such that codice_30 returns true.
(define (find-first func lst)
 (call-with-current-continuation
 (lambda (return-immediately)
 (for-each (lambda (x)
 (if (func x)
 (return-immediately x)))
 lst)
 #f)))

(find-first integer? &#x27;(1/2 3/4 5.6 7 8/9 10 11))
===&gt; 7
(find-first zero? &#x27;(1 2 3 4))
===&gt; #f
The following example, a traditional programmer&#x27;s puzzle, shows that Scheme can handle continuations as first-class objects, binding them to variables and passing them as arguments to procedures.
(let* ((yin
 ((lambda (cc) (display &quot;@&quot;) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c))))
 (yang
 ((lambda (cc) (display &quot;*&quot;) cc) (call-with-current-continuation (lambda (c) c)))))
 (yin yang))

When executed this code displays a counting sequence: codice_31
===Shared namespace for procedures and variables===
In contrast to Common Lisp, all data and procedures in Scheme share a common namespace, whereas in Common Lisp functions and data have separate namespaces making it possible for a function and a variable to have the same name, and requiring special notation for referring to a function as a value. This is sometimes known as the &quot;Lisp-1 vs. Lisp-2&quot; distinction, referring to the unified namespace of Scheme and the separate namespaces of Common Lisp.

In Scheme, the same primitives that are used to manipulate and bind data can be used to bind procedures. There is no equivalent of Common Lisp&#x27;s codice_32 and codice_33 primitives.
;; Variable bound to a number:
(define f 10)
f
===&gt; 10
;; Mutation (altering the bound value)
(set! f (+ f f 6))
f
===&gt; 26
;; Assigning a procedure to the same variable:
(set! f (lambda (n) (+ n 12)))
(f 6)
===&gt; 18
;; Assigning the result of an expression to the same variable:
(set! f (f 1))
f
===&gt; 13
;; functional programming:
(apply + &#x27;(1 2 3 4 5 6))
===&gt; 21
(set! f (lambda (n) (+ n 100)))
(map f &#x27;(1 2 3))
===&gt; (101 102 103)
==Implementation standards==
This subsection documents design decisions that have been taken over the years which have given Scheme a particular character, but are not the direct outcomes of the original design.

===Numerical tower===

Scheme specifies a comparatively full set of numerical datatypes including complex and rational types, which is known in Scheme as the numerical tower (R5RS sec. 6.2). The standard treats these as abstractions, and does not commit the implementor to any particular internal representations.

Numbers may have the quality of exactness. An exact number can only be produced by a sequence of exact operations involving other exact numbers—inexactness is thus contagious. The standard specifies that any two implementations must produce equivalent results for all operations resulting in exact numbers.

The R5RS standard specifies procedures codice_34 and codice_35 which can be used to change the exactness of a number. codice_35 produces &quot;the exact number that is numerically closest to the argument&quot;. codice_34 produces &quot;the inexact number that is numerically closest to the argument&quot;. The R6RS standard omits these procedures from the main report, but specifies them as R5RS compatibility procedures in the standard library (rnrs r5rs (6)).

In the R5RS standard, Scheme implementations are not required to implement the whole numerical tower, but they must implement &quot;a coherent subset consistent with both the purposes of the implementation and the spirit of the Scheme language&quot; (R5RS sec. 6.2.3). The new R6RS standard does require implementation of the whole tower, and &quot;exact integer objects and exact rational number objects of practically unlimited size and precision, and to implement certain procedures...so they always return exact results when given exact arguments&quot; (R6RS sec. 3.4, sec. 11.7.1).

Example 1: exact arithmetic in an implementation that supports exact 
rational complex numbers.

;; Sum of three rational real numbers and two rational complex numbers
(define x (+ 1/3 1/4 -1/5 -1/3i 405/50+2/3i))
x
===&gt; 509/60+1/3i
;; Check for exactness.
(exact? x)
===&gt; #t
Example 2: Same arithmetic in an implementation that supports neither exact 
rational numbers nor complex numbers but does accept real numbers in rational notation.

;; Sum of four rational real numbers
(define xr (+ 1/3 1/4 -1/5 405/50))
;; Sum of two rational real numbers
(define xi (+ -1/3 2/3))
xr
===&gt; 8.48333333333333
xi
===&gt; 0.333333333333333
;; Check for exactness.
(exact? xr)
===&gt; #f
(exact? xi)
===&gt; #f
Both implementations conform to the R5RS standard but the second does not conform to R6RS because it does not implement the full numerical tower.

===Delayed evaluation===

Scheme supports delayed evaluation through the codice_38 form and the procedure codice_39.

(define a 10)
(define eval-aplus2 (delay (+ a 2)))
(set! a 20)
(force eval-aplus2)
===&gt; 22
(define eval-aplus50 (delay (+ a 50)))
(let ((a 8))
 (force eval-aplus50))
===&gt; 70
(set! a 100)
(force eval-aplus2)
===&gt; 22

The lexical context of the original definition of the promise is preserved, and its value is also preserved after the first use of codice_39. The promise is only ever evaluated once.

These primitives, which produce or handle values known as promises, can be used to implement advanced lazy evaluation constructs such as streams.

In the R6RS standard, these are no longer primitives, but instead, are provided as part of the R5RS compatibility library (rnrs r5rs (6)).

In R5RS, a suggested implementation of codice_38 and codice_39 is given, implementing the promise as a procedure with no arguments (a thunk) and using memoization to ensure that it is only ever evaluated once, irrespective of the number of times codice_39 is called (R5RS sec. 6.4).

SRFI 41 enables the expression of both finite and infinite sequences with extraordinary economy. For example, this is a definition of the Fibonacci sequence using the functions defined in SRFI 41:
;; Define the Fibonacci sequence:
(define fibs
 (stream-cons 0
 (stream-cons 1
 (stream-map +
 fibs
 (stream-cdr fibs)))))
;; Compute the hundredth number in the sequence:
(stream-ref fibs 99)
===&gt; 218922995834555169026
===Order of evaluation of procedure arguments===
Most Lisps specify an order of evaluation for procedure arguments. Scheme does not. Order of evaluation—including the order in which the expression in the operator position is evaluated—may be chosen by an implementation on a call-by-call basis, and the only constraint is that &quot;the effect of any concurrent evaluation of the operator and operand expressions is constrained to be consistent with some sequential order of evaluation.&quot; (R5RS sec. 4.1.3)

(let ((ev (lambda(n) (display &quot;Evaluating &quot;)
 (display (if (procedure? n) &quot;procedure&quot; n))
 (newline) n)))
 ((ev +) (ev 1) (ev 2)))
===&gt; 3
Evaluating 1
Evaluating 2
Evaluating procedure

ev is a procedure that describes the argument passed to it, then returns the value of the argument. In contrast with other Lisps, the appearance of an expression in the operator position (the first item) of a Scheme expression is quite legal, as long as the result of the expression in the operator position is a procedure.

In calling the procedure &quot;&quot; to add 1 and 2, the expressions and may be evaluated in any order, as long as the effect is not as if they were evaluated in parallel. Thus the following three lines may be displayed in any order by standard Scheme when the above example code is executed, although the text of one line may not be interleaved with another because that would violate the sequential evaluation constraint.

===Hygienic macros===

In the R5RS standard and also in later reports, the syntax of Scheme can easily be extended via the macro system. The R5RS standard introduced a powerful hygienic macro system that allows the programmer to add new syntactic constructs to the language using a simple pattern matching sublanguage (R5RS sec 4.3). Prior to this, the hygienic macro system had been relegated to an appendix of the R4RS standard, as a &quot;high level&quot; system alongside a &quot;low level&quot; macro system, both of which were treated as extensions to Scheme rather than an essential part of the language.

Implementations of the hygienic macro system, also called codice_44, are required to respect the lexical scoping of the rest of the language. This is assured by special naming and scoping rules for macro expansion and avoids common programming errors that can occur in the macro systems of other programming languages. R6RS specifies a more sophisticated transformation system, codice_45, which has been available as a language extension to R5RS Scheme for some time.
;; Define a macro to implement a variant of &quot;if&quot; with a multi-expression
;; true branch and no false branch.
(define-syntax when
 (syntax-rules ()
 ((when pred exp exps ...)
 (if pred (begin exp exps ...)))))
Invocations of macros and procedures bear a close resemblance—both are s-expressions—but they are treated differently. When the compiler encounters an s-expression in the program, it first checks to see if the symbol is defined as a syntactic keyword within the current lexical scope. If so, it then attempts to expand the macro, treating the items in the tail of the s-expression as arguments without compiling code to evaluate them, and this process is repeated recursively until no macro invocations remain. If it is not a syntactic keyword, the compiler compiles code to evaluate the arguments in the tail of the s-expression and then to evaluate the variable represented by the symbol at the head of the s-expression and call it as a procedure with the evaluated tail expressions passed as arguments to it.

Most Scheme implementations also provide additional macro systems. Among popular ones are syntactic closures, explicit renaming macros and codice_46, a non-hygienic macro system similar to codice_47 system provided in Common Lisp.

The inability to specify whether or not a macro is hygienic is one of the shortcomings of the macro system. Alternative models for expansion such as scope sets provide a potential solution.

===Environments and eval===
Prior to R5RS, Scheme had no standard equivalent of the codice_48 procedure which is ubiquitous in other Lisps, although the first Lambda Paper had described codice_49 as &quot;similar to the LISP function EVAL&quot; and the first Revised Report in 1978 replaced this with codice_50, which took two arguments. The second, third and fourth revised reports omitted any equivalent of codice_48.

The reason for this confusion is that in Scheme with its lexical scoping the result of evaluating an expression depends on where it is evaluated. For instance, it is not clear whether the result of evaluating the following expression should be 5 or 6:

(let ((name &#x27;+))
 (let ((+ *))
 (evaluate (list name 2 3))))
If it is evaluated in the outer environment, where codice_52 is defined, the result is the sum of the operands. If it is evaluated in the inner environment, where the symbol &quot;+&quot; has been bound to the value of the procedure &quot;*&quot;, the result is the product of the two operands.

R5RS resolves this confusion by specifying three procedures that return environments and providing a procedure codice_48 that takes an s-expression and an environment and evaluates the expression in the environment provided. (R5RS sec. 6.5) R6RS extends this by providing a procedure called codice_54 by which the programmer can specify exactly which objects to import into the evaluation environment.

With modern scheme (usually compatible with R5RS) to evaluate this expression, one needs to define a function codice_49 which can look like this:
(define (evaluate expr)
 (eval expr (interaction-environment)))
codice_56 is the interpreter&#x27;s global environment.

===Treatment of non-Boolean values in Boolean expressions===
In most dialects of Lisp including Common Lisp, by convention the value codice_57 evaluates to the value false in a Boolean expression. In Scheme, since the IEEE standard in 1991, all values except codice_58, including codice_57&#x27;s equivalent in Scheme which is written as codice_60, evaluate to the value true in a Boolean expression. (R5RS sec. 6.3.1)

Where the constant representing the Boolean value of true is codice_61 in most Lisps, in Scheme it is codice_62.

===Disjointness of primitive datatypes===
In Scheme the primitive datatypes are disjoint. Only one of the following predicates can be true of any Scheme object: codice_63, codice_64, codice_65, codice_66, codice_67, codice_68, codice_69, codice_70, codice_71. (R5RS sec 3.2)

Within the numerical datatype, by contrast, the numerical values overlap. For example, an integer value satisfies all of the codice_72, codice_73, codice_74, codice_75 and codice_66 predicates at the same time. (R5RS sec 6.2)

===Equivalence predicates===

Scheme has three different types of equivalence between arbitrary objects denoted by three different &quot;equivalence predicates&quot;, relational operators for testing equality, codice_77, codice_78 and codice_79:
* codice_77 evaluates to codice_58 unless its parameters represent the same data object in memory;
* codice_78 is generally the same as codice_77 but treats primitive objects (e.g. characters and numbers) specially so that numbers that represent the same value are codice_78 even if they do not refer to the same object;
* codice_79 compares data structures such as lists, vectors and strings to determine if they have congruent structure and codice_78 contents.(R5RS sec. 6.1)

Type dependent equivalence operations also exist in Scheme: codice_87 and codice_88 compare two strings (the latter performs a case-independent comparison); codice_89 and codice_90 compare characters; codice_91 compares numbers.

===Comments===

Up to the R5RS standard, the standard comment in Scheme was a semicolon, which makes the rest of the line invisible to Scheme. Numerous implementations have supported alternative conventions permitting comments to extend for more than a single line, and the R6RS standard permits two of them: an entire s-expression may be turned into a comment (or &quot;commented out&quot;) by preceding it with codice_92 (introduced in SRFI 62) and a multiline comment or &quot;block comment&quot; may be produced by surrounding text with codice_93 and codice_94.

===Input/output===
Scheme&#x27;s input and output is based on the &quot;port&quot; datatype. (R5RS sec 6.6) R5RS defines two default ports, accessible with the procedures codice_95 and codice_96, which correspond to the Unix notions of standard input and standard output. Most implementations also provide codice_97. Redirection of input and standard output is supported in the standard, by standard procedures such as codice_98 and codice_99. Most implementations provide string ports with similar redirection capabilities, enabling many normal input-output operations to be performed on string buffers instead of files, using procedures described in SRFI 6. The R6RS standard specifies much more sophisticated and capable port procedures and many new types of port.

The following examples are written in strict R5RS Scheme.

Example 1: With output defaulting to (current-output-port):

(let ((hello0 (lambda() (display &quot;Hello world&quot;) (newline))))
 (hello0))
Example 2: As 1, but using optional port argument to output procedures

(let ((hello1 (lambda (p) (display &quot;Hello world&quot; p) (newline p))))
 (hello1 (current-output-port)))
Example 3: As 1, but output is redirected to a newly created file

;; NB: with-output-to-file is an optional procedure in R5RS
(let ((hello0 (lambda () (display &quot;Hello world&quot;) (newline))))
 (with-output-to-file &quot;helloworldoutputfile&quot; hello0))
Example 4: As 2, but with explicit file open and port close to send output to file

(let ((hello1 (lambda (p) (display &quot;Hello world&quot; p) (newline p)))
 (output-port (open-output-file &quot;helloworldoutputfile&quot;)))
 (hello1 output-port)
 (close-output-port output-port))
Example 5: As 2, but with using call-with-output-file to send output to a file.

(let ((hello1 (lambda (p) (display &quot;Hello world&quot; p) (newline p))))
 (call-with-output-file &quot;helloworldoutputfile&quot; hello1))
Similar procedures are provided for input. R5RS Scheme provides the predicates codice_100 and codice_101. For character input and output, codice_102, codice_103, codice_104 and codice_105 are provided. For writing and reading Scheme expressions, Scheme provides codice_106 and codice_107. On a read operation, the result returned is the end-of-file object if the input port has reached the end of the file, and this can be tested using the predicate codice_108.

With the standard, SRFI 28 also defines a basic formatting procedure resembling Common Lisp&#x27;s codice_109 function, after which it is named.

===Redefinition of standard procedures===
In Scheme, procedures are bound to variables. At R5RS the language standard formally mandated that programs may change the variable bindings of built-in procedures, effectively redefining them. (R5RS &quot;Language changes&quot;) For example, codice_110 can be extended to accept strings as well as numbers by redefining it:
(set! +
 (let ((original+ +))
 (lambda args
 (apply (if (or (null? args) (string? (car args)))
 string-append
 original+)
 args))))
(+ 1 2 3)
===&gt; 6
(+ &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot;)
===&gt; &quot;123&quot;
In R6RS every binding, including the standard ones, belongs to some library, and all exported bindings are immutable. (R6RS sec 7.1) Because of this, redefinition of standard procedures by mutation is forbidden. Instead, it is possible to import a different procedure under the name of a standard one, which in effect is similar to redefinition.

===Nomenclature and naming conventions===
In Standard Scheme, procedures that convert from one datatype to another contain the character string &quot;-&gt;&quot; in their name, predicates end with a &quot;?&quot;, and procedures that change the value of already-allocated data end with a &quot;!&quot;. These conventions are often followed by Scheme programmers.

In formal contexts such as Scheme standards, the word &quot;procedure&quot; is used in preference to &quot;function&quot; to refer to a lambda expression or primitive procedure. In normal usage, the words &quot;procedure&quot; and &quot;function&quot; are used interchangeably. Procedure application is sometimes referred to formally as &quot;combination&quot;.

As in other Lisps, the term &quot;thunk&quot; is used in Scheme to refer to a procedure with no arguments. The term &quot;proper tail recursion&quot; refers to the property of all Scheme implementations, that they perform tail-call optimization so as to support an indefinite number of active tail calls.

The form of the titles of the standards documents since R3RS, &quot;Revisedn Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme&quot;, is a reference to the title of the ALGOL 60 standard document, &quot;Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60,&quot; The Summary page of R3RS is closely modeled on the Summary page of the ALGOL 60 Report.

== Review of standard forms and procedures ==
The language is formally defined in the standards R5RS (1998) and R6RS (2007). They describe standard &quot;forms&quot;: keywords and accompanying syntax, which provide the control structure of the language, and standard procedures which perform common tasks.

===Standard forms===
This table describes the standard forms in Scheme. Some forms appear in more than one row because they cannot easily be classified into a single function in the language.

Forms marked &quot;L&quot; in this table are classed as derived &quot;library&quot; forms in the standard and are often implemented as macros using more fundamental forms in practice, making the task of implementation much easier than in other languages.

While codice_111 is defined as a library syntax in R5RS, the expander must know about it to achieve the splicing function. In R6RS it is no longer a library syntax.

===Standard procedures===
The following two tables describe the standard procedures in R5RS Scheme. R6RS is far more extensive and a summary of this type would not be practical.

Some procedures appear in more than one row because they cannot easily be classified into a single function in the language.
String and character procedures that contain &quot;-ci&quot; in their names perform case-independent comparisons between their arguments: upper case and lower case versions of the same character are taken to be equal.

Implementations of - and / that take more than two arguments are defined but left optional at R5RS.

== Scheme Requests for Implementation ==

Because of Scheme&#x27;s minimalism, many common procedures and syntactic forms are not defined by the standard. In order to keep the core language small but facilitate standardization of extensions, the Scheme community has a &quot;Scheme Request for Implementation&quot; (SRFI) process by which extension libraries are defined through careful discussion of extension proposals. This promotes code portability. Many of the SRFIs are supported by all or most Scheme implementations.

SRFIs with fairly wide support in different implementations include:

* 0: feature-based conditional expansion construct
* 1: list library
* 4: homogeneous numeric vector datatypes
* 6: basic string ports
* 8: receive, binding to multiple values
* 9: defining record types
* 13: string library
* 14: character-set library
* 16: syntax for procedures of variable arity
* 17: generalized set!
* 18: Multithreading support
* 19: time data types and procedures
* 25: multi-dimensional array primitives
* 26: notation for specializing parameters without currying
* 27: sources of random bits
* 28: basic format strings
* 29: localization
* 30: nested multi-line comments
* 31: a special form for recursive evaluation
* 37: args-fold: a program argument processor
* 39: parameter objects
* 41: streams
* 42: eager comprehensions
* 43: vector library
* 45: primitives for expressing iterative lazy algorithms
* 60: integers as bits
* 61: a more general cond clause
* 66: octet vectors
* 67: compare procedures

== Implementations ==
The elegant, minimalist design has made Scheme a popular target for language designers, hobbyists, and educators, and because of its small size, that of a typical interpreter, it is also a popular choice for embedded systems and scripting. This has resulted in scores of implementations, most of which differ from each other so much that porting programs from one implementation to another is quite difficult, and the small size of the standard language means that writing a useful program of any great complexity in standard, portable Scheme is almost impossible. The R6RS standard specifies a much broader language, in an attempt to broaden its appeal to programmers.

Almost all implementations provide a traditional Lisp-style read–eval–print loop for development and debugging. Many also compile Scheme programs to executable binary. Support for embedding Scheme code in programs written in other languages is also common, as the relative simplicity of Scheme implementations makes it a popular choice for adding scripting capabilities to larger systems developed in languages such as C. The Gambit, Chicken, and Bigloo Scheme interpreters compile Scheme to C, which makes embedding far easier. Further, Bigloo&#x27;s compiler can be configured to generate bytecode for the Java virtual machine (JVM), and has an experimental bytecode generator for .NET.

Some implementations support added features. For example, Kawa and JScheme provide integration with Java classes, and the Scheme to C compilers often make it easy to use external libraries written in C, up to allowing the embedding of C code in the Scheme source code. Another example is Pvts, which offers a set of visual tools that support Scheme learning.

== Usage ==
Scheme is widely used by several schools; in particular, several introductory computer science courses use Scheme in conjunction with the textbook &quot;Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs&quot; (SICP). For the past 12 years, PLT has run the ProgramByDesign (formerly TeachScheme!) project, which has exposed close to 600 high school teachers and thousands of high school students to rudimentary Scheme programming. MIT&#x27;s old introductory programming class 6.001 was taught in Scheme, Although 6.001 has been replaced by more modern courses, SICP continues to be taught at MIT. Likewise, the introductory class at UC Berkeley, CS 61A, was until 2011 taught entirely in Scheme, save minor diversions into Logo to demonstrate dynamic scope. Today, like MIT, Berkeley has replaced the syllabus with a more modern version that is primarily taught in Python 3, but the current syllabus is still based on the old curriculum, and parts of the class are still taught in Scheme.

The textbook &quot;How to Design Programs&quot; by Matthias Felleisen, currently at Northeastern University, is used by some institutes of higher education for their introductory computer science courses. Both Northeastern University and Worcester Polytechnic Institute use Scheme exclusively for their introductory courses Fundamentals of Computer Science (CS2500) and Introduction to Program Design (CS1101), respectively. Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology uses Scheme in its more advanced Programming Language Concepts course. Brandeis University&#x27;s core course, Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs (COSI121b), is also taught exclusively in Scheme by theoretical computer scientist Harry Mairson. Indiana University&#x27;s introductory class, C211, is taught entirely in Scheme. A self-paced version of the course, CS 61AS, continues to use Scheme. The introductory computer science courses at Yale and Grinnell College are also taught in Scheme. Programming Design Paradigms, a mandatory course for the Computer science Graduate Students at Northeastern University, also extensively uses Scheme.
The former introductory computer science course at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, CSCI 1901, also used Scheme as its primary language, followed by a course that introduced students to the Java language; however, following the example of MIT, the department replaced 1901 with the Python-based CSCI 1133, while functional programming is covered in detail in the third-semester course CSCI 2041.

Scheme is/was also used for the following:

* The Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL), which provides a method of specifying SGML stylesheets, uses a Scheme subset.
* The well-known open source raster graphics editor GIMP uses TinyScheme as a scripting language.
* Guile has been adopted by GNU project as its official scripting language, and that implementation of Scheme is embedded in such applications as GNU LilyPond and GnuCash as a scripting language for extensions. Likewise, Guile used to be the scripting language for the desktop environment GNOME, and GNOME still has a project that provides Guile bindings to its library stack. There is a project to incorporate Guile into GNU Emacs, GNU&#x27;s flagship program, replacing the current Emacs Lisp interpreter.
* Elk Scheme is used by Synopsys as a scripting language for its technology CAD (TCAD) tools.
* Shiro Kawai, senior programmer on the movie &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, used Scheme as a scripting language for managing the real-time rendering engine.
* Google App Inventor for Android uses Scheme, where Kawa is used to compile the Scheme code down to bytecodes for the Java virtual machine running on Android devices.

<text>The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) is a nonprofit organisation in the United Kingdom. Its stated purpose is to understand events and abilities commonly described as psychic or paranormal. It describes itself as the &quot;first society to conduct organised scholarly research into human experiences that challenge contemporary scientific models.&quot; It does not, however, since its inception in 1882, hold any corporate opinions: SPR members assert a variety of beliefs with regard to the nature of the phenomena studied.

==Origins==
The Society for Psychical Research (SPR) originated from a discussion between journalist Edmund Rogers and the physicist William F. Barrett in autumn 1881. This led to a conference on 5 and 6 January 1882 at the headquarters of the British National Association of Spiritualists, at which the foundation of the Society was proposed. The committee included Barrett, Rogers, Stainton Moses, Charles Massey, Edmund Gurney, Hensleigh Wedgwood and Frederic W. H. Myers. The SPR was formally constituted on 20 February 1882 with philosopher Henry Sidgwick as its first president.

The SPR was the first organisation of its kind in the world, its stated purpose being &quot;to approach these varied problems without prejudice or prepossession of any kind, and in the same spirit of exact and unimpassioned enquiry which has enabled science to solve so many problems, once not less obscure nor less hotly debated.&quot;

In 1882 Mary Everest Boole became the first female member of the SPR; however, she resigned after six months. Some other early members included the author Jane Barlow, the renowned chemist Sir William Crookes, physicist Sir Oliver Lodge, Nobel laureate Charles Richet, artist Lewis Charles Powles and psychologist William James.

Members of the SPR initiated and organised the International Congresses of Physiological/Experimental psychology.

Areas of study included hypnotism, dissociation, thought-transference, mediumship, Reichenbach phenomena, apparitions and haunted houses and the physical phenomena associated with séances. The SPR were to introduce a number of neologisms which have entered the English language, such as &#x27;telepathy&#x27;, which was coined by Frederic Myers.

The Society is run by a President and a Council of twenty members, and is open to interested members of the public to join. The organisation is based at 1 Vernon Mews, London, with a library and office open to members, and with large book and archival holdings in Cambridge University Library, Cambridgeshire, England. It publishes the peer-reviewed quarterly &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot; (&quot;JSPR&quot;), the irregular &quot;Proceedings&quot; and the magazine &quot;Paranormal Review&quot;. It holds an annual conference, regular lectures and two study days per year and supports the &quot;LEXSCIEN&quot; on-line library project.

==Research==

===Psychical research===

Among the first important works was the two-volume publication in 1886, &quot;Phantasms of the Living&quot;, concerning telepathy and apparitions, co-authored by Gurney, Myers and Frank Podmore. This text, and subsequent research in this area, was received negatively by the scientific mainstream, though Gurney and Podmore provided a defense of the society&#x27;s early work in this area in mainstream publications.

The SPR &quot;devised methodological innovations such as randomized study designs&quot; and conducted &quot;the first experiments investigating the psychology of eyewitness testimony (Hodgson and Davey, 1887), [and] empirical and conceptual studies illuminating mechanisms of dissociation and hypnotism&quot;

In 1894, the &quot;Census of Hallucinations&quot; was published which sampled 17,000 people. Out of these, 1,684 persons reported having experienced a hallucination of an apparition. Such efforts were claimed to have undermined &quot;the notion of dissociation and hallucinations as intrinsically pathological phenomena&quot;.

The SPR investigated many spiritualist mediums such as Eva Carrière and Eusapia Palladino.

During the early twentieth century, the SPR studied a series of automatic scripts and trance utterances from a group of automatic writers, known as the cross-correspondences.

Famous cases investigated by the Society include Borley Rectory and the Enfield Poltergeist.

In 1912 the Society extended a request for a contribution to a special medical edition of its Proceedings to Sigmund Freud. Though according to Ronald W. Clark (1980) &quot;Freud surmised, no doubt correctly, that the existence of any link between the founding fathers of psychoanalysis and investigation of the paranormal would hamper acceptance of psychoanalysis&quot; as would any perceived involvement with the occult. Nonetheless, Freud did respond, contributing an essay titled &quot;A Note on the Unconscious in Psycho-Analysis&quot; to the Medical Supplement to the Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research.

The Society continues to be a leader in its field into the twenty-first century. In 2021, several council members were awarded prizes in the high-profile Bigelow Institute for Consciousness Studies essay contest on the best evidence for life after death. Then editor of the &quot;Magazine of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;, Dr Leo Ruickbie, ranked highest in third place, with Dr David Rousseau and Julie Billingham runners-up, and former President Prof. Chris Roe and Dr Callum Cooper given honorable mentions.

===Exposures of fraud===

Much of the society&#x27;s early work involved investigating, exposing and in some cases duplicating fake phenomena. In the late 19th century, SPR investigations into séance phenomena led to the exposure of many fraudulent mediums.

Richard Hodgson distinguished himself in that area. In 1884, Hodgson was sent by the SPR to India to investigate Helena Blavatsky and concluded that her claims of psychic power were fraudulent. However, in 1985 the original finding of fraud was questioned and reinvestigated by the SPR researcher Vernon Harrison, president of the Royal Photographic Society and an expert at detecting forgery. Harrison determined that &quot;As an investigator, Hodgson is weighed in the balances and found wanting. His case against Madame H. P. Blavatsky is not proven.&quot;

In 1886 and 1887 a series of publications by S. J. Davey, Hodgson and Sidgwick in the SPR journal exposed the slate writing tricks of the medium William Eglinton. Hodgson with his friend, S. J. Davey, had staged fake séances for educating the public (including SPR members). Davey gave sittings under an assumed name, duplicating the phenomena produced by Eglinton, and then proceeded to point out to the sitters the manner in which they had been deceived. Because of this, some spiritualist members such as Stainton Moses resigned from the SPR.

In 1891, Alfred Russel Wallace requested for the Society to properly investigate spirit photography. Eleanor Sidgwick responded with a critical paper in the SPR which cast doubt on the subject and discussed the fraudulent methods that spirit photographers such as Édouard Isidore Buguet, Frederic Hudson and William H. Mumler had utilised.

Due to the exposure of William Hope and other fraudulent mediums, Arthur Conan Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the Society for Psychical Research, as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism. Science historian William Hodson Brock has noted that &quot;By the 1900s most avowed spiritualists had left the SPR and gone back to the BNAS (the London Spiritualist Alliance since 1884), having become upset by the sceptical tone of most of the SPR&#x27;s investigations.&quot;

==Criticism of the SPR==
The Society has been criticized by both spiritualists and skeptics.

===Criticism from spiritualists===
Prominent spiritualists at first welcomed the SPR and cooperated fully, but relations soured when spiritualists discovered that the SPR would not accept outside testimony as proof, and the society accused some prominent mediums of fraud. Spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle resigned from the SPR in 1930, to protest what he regarded as the SPR&#x27;s overly restrictive standards of proof. Psychic investigator and believer in spiritualism Nandor Fodor criticised the SPR for its &quot;strong bias&quot; against physical manifestations of spiritualism.

===Criticism from skeptics===

Skeptics have criticised members of the SPR for having motives liable to impair scientific objectivity. According to SPR critics John Grant and Eric Dingwall (a member of the SPR), early SPR members such as Henry Sidgwick, Frederic W. H. Myers, and William Barrett hoped to cling to something spiritual through psychical research. Myers stated that “[T]he Society for Psychical Research was founded, with the establishment of thought-transference—already rising within measurable distance of proof—as its primary aim.” Defenders of the SPR have stated in reply that “a ‘will to believe’ in post-mortem survival, telepathy and other scientifically unpopular notions, does not necessarily exclude a ‘will to know’ and thus the capacity for thorough self-criticism, methodological rigour and relentless suspicion of errors.”

The skeptic and physicist Victor J. Stenger has written:

Ivor Lloyd Tuckett an author of an early skeptical work on psychical research wrote that although the SPR have collected some valuable work, most of its active members have &quot;no training in psychology fitting them for their task, and have been the victims of pronounced bias, as sometimes they themselves have admitted.&quot; Trevor H. Hall, an ex-member of the Society for Psychical Research, criticised SPR members for their &quot;credulous and obsessive wish... to believe.&quot; Hall also claimed SPR members &quot;lack knowledge of deceptive methods.&quot;

Writer Edward Clodd asserted that the SPR members William F. Barrett and Oliver Lodge had insufficient competence for the detection of fraud and suggested that their spiritualist beliefs were based on magical thinking and primitive superstition. Clodd described the SPR as offering &quot;barbaric spiritual philosophy&quot;, and characterised the language of SPR members as using such terms as &quot;subliminal consciousness&quot; and &quot;telepathic energy,&quot; as a disguise for &quot;bastard supernaturalism.&quot;

A 2004 psychological study involving 174 members of the Society for Psychical Research completed a delusional ideation questionnaire and a deductive reasoning task. The study found that &quot;individuals who reported a strong belief in the paranormal made more errors and displayed more delusional ideation than skeptical individuals&quot;. The study also claims that reasoning abnormalities may have a causal role in the formation of paranormal belief. 

Some skeptical members have resigned from the SPR. Eric Dingwall resigned and wrote &quot;After sixty years&#x27; experience and personal acquaintance with most of the leading parapsychologists of that period I do not think I could name half a dozen whom I could call objective students who honestly wished to discover the truth. The great majority wanted to prove something or other: They wanted the phenomena into which they were inquiring to serve some purpose in supporting preconceived theories of their own.&quot;(1985)

== Presidents ==

The following is a list of presidents:

==Publications==
The Society publishes &quot;Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;, the &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;, and the &quot;Magazine of the Society for Psychical Research&quot; (previously called the &quot;Paranormal Review&quot;), as well as the online &quot;Psi Encyclopedia&quot;.

===&quot;Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;===
First published in 1882 as a public record of the activities of the SPR, the &quot;Proceedings&quot; are now reserved for longer pieces of work, such as Presidential Addresses, and are only occasionally published. The current editor is Dr David Vernon.

===&quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;===
The &quot;Journal of the Society for Psychical Research&quot; has been published quarterly since 1884. It was introduced as a private, members-only periodical to supplement the &quot;Proceedings&quot;. It now focuses on current laboratory and field research, but also includes theoretical, methodological and historical papers on parapsychology. It also publishes book reviews and correspondence. The current editor is Dr David Vernon.

===&quot;Magazine of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;===
The &quot;Magazine of the Society for Psychical Research&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Psi Researcher&quot; and &quot;Paranormal Review&quot;, has been published since 1996, but can be dated back to the first &quot;Bulletin&quot; of 1980. Previous editors have included Dr Nicola J. Holt. The current editor is Dr Leo Ruickbie.

===&quot;Psi Encyclopedia&quot;===
The &quot;Psi Encyclopedia&quot; is a collection of articles and case studies about psi research, involving the scientific investigation of psychic phenomena. A bequest of Nigel Buckmaster enabled the foundation of the encyclopedia.

*Poland – The &quot;Polish Society for Psychical Research&quot; was very active before the second world war.
*Scotland – The &quot;Scottish Society for Psychical Research&quot; is active today.
*Spain – &quot;Sociedad de Investigaciones Psíquicas Iberoamericana&quot; (founded in Madrid in 1895), &quot;Instituto de Metapsiquismo&quot; (Barcelona, founded in 1923), &quot;Sociedad Española de Estudios Metapsíquicos&quot; (Madrid, founded in 1924)
*Sweden – Sällskapet för Parapsykologisk Forskning (the &quot;Swedish Society for Parapsychological Research&quot;) was founded in 1948.
*US – An American branch of the Society was formed as the &quot;American Society for Psychical Research&quot; (ASPR) in 1885, which became independent in 1906. A splinter group, the &quot;Boston Society for Psychical Research&quot; existed from May 1925 to 1941.

<text>A sniper is a military or paramilitary marksman who engages targets from positions of concealment or at distances exceeding the target&#x27;s detection capabilities. Snipers generally have specialized training and are equipped with telescopic sights. Modern snipers use high-precision rifles and high-magnification optics. They often also serve as scouts/observers feeding tactical information back to their units or command headquarters.

In addition to long-range and high-grade marksmanship, military snipers are trained in a variety of special operation techniques: detection, stalking, target range estimation methods, camouflage, tracking, bushcraft, field craft, infiltration, special reconnaissance and observation, surveillance and target acquisition. Snipers need to have complete control of their bodies and senses in order to be effective. They also need to have the skill set to use data from their scope and monitors to adjust their aim to hit targets that are extremely far away. In training, snipers are given charts that they&#x27;re drilled on to ensure they can make last-minute calculations when they are in the field.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;sniper&quot; comes from the verb &quot;to snipe&quot;, which originated in the 1770s among soldiers in British India in reference to shooting snipes, a wader that was considered an extremely challenging game bird for hunters due to its alertness, camouflaging color and erratic flight behavior. Snipe hunters therefore needed to be stealthy in addition to being good trackers and marksmen. In the 18th century, letters sent home by English officers in India referred to a day&#x27;s rough shooting as &quot;going sniping&quot;, as it took a skilled flintlock sportsman a lot of patience and endurance to wing-shoot a snipe in flight. Accomplishing such a shot was regarded as exceptional. During the late 18th century, the term &quot;snipe shooting&quot; was simplified to &quot;sniping&quot;. This evolved to the agent noun &quot;sniper&quot;, first appearing by the 1820s. The term &quot;sniper&quot; was first attested militarily in 1824, becoming commonplace in the First World War.

The older term &quot;sharpshooter&quot; comes from the calque of German word , in use by British newspapers as early as 1801. The word alludes to good marksmanship, itself descendent of the shooting competitions () that took place throughout the year in Munich in the 15th century. Small companies of shooters () from the German states and Swiss cantons would form teams of for such popular competitions; proudly carrying flags depicting a crossbow on one side and a target musket on the other. The earliest known date for the creation of a shooting club formed specifically for the use of firearms comes from Lucerne, Switzerland, where one club has a charter dating from 1466. During the American Civil War, Confederate marksmen equipped with the imported Whitworth rifles were known as the Whitworth Sharpshooters.

Snipers are also called &quot;hunters&quot; in many languages, due to the nature of the craft (with the hunting horn also being a symbol of marksmanship), being called , and . Other words for sniper include , and . Completely different and peculiar is the Italian term , in common use since First World War. The term is derived from Cecco (Beppe), familiarly and mockingly referring to the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I (in Italian Francesco Giuseppe I; Cecco and Beppe are nicknames for Francesco and Giuseppe respectively).

==Modern warfare==


===Military doctrine===
Different countries use different military doctrines regarding snipers in military units, settings, and tactics.

A sniper&#x27;s primary function in modern warfare is to stay concealed at all times and avoid detection. Then from long range, to provide detailed surveillance from a concealed position and, if necessary, to reduce the enemy&#x27;s combat ability by neutralizing high-value targets (especially officers and other key personnel), and in the process, cause disruption, pinning down and demoralizing the enemy. Typical sniper missions include managing intelligence information they gather during reconnaissance, target acquisition and impact feedback for air strikes and artillery, assisting employed combat force with accurate fire support and counter-sniper tactics, killing enemy commanders, selecting targets of opportunity, and even destruction of military equipment, which tend to require use of anti-materiel rifles in the larger calibers such as the .50 BMG, like the Barrett M82, McMillan Tac-50, and Denel NTW-20.

Soviet- and Russian-derived military doctrines include squad-level snipers. Snipers have increasingly been demonstrated as useful by US and UK forces in the recent Iraq campaign in a fire support role to cover the movement of infantry, especially in urban areas.

Military snipers from the US, UK and other countries that adopt their military doctrine are typically deployed in two-man sniper teams consisting of a shooter and a spotter. A common practice is for a shooter and a spotter to take turns to avoid eye fatigue. In most recent combat operations occurring in large densely populated towns, such as Fallujah, Iraq, two teams would be deployed together to increase their security and effectiveness in an urban environment. A sniper team would be armed with a long-range weapon and a rapid-firing shorter-ranged weapon in case of close quarter combat.

The German doctrine of largely independent snipers and emphasis on concealment, developed during the Second World War, has been most influential on modern sniper tactics, and is currently used throughout Western militaries (examples are specialized camouflage clothing, concealment in terrain and emphasis on coup d&#x27;œil).

===Sniper teams===
Sniper rifles are classified as crew-served in the United States military. A sniper team (or sniper cell) consists of a combination of at least one primary weapon operator, (i.e.: the shooter), with other support personnel and force protection elements, such as a &quot;spotter&quot; or a &quot;flanker&quot;. Within the &quot;Table of Organization and Equipment&quot; for both the United States Army and Marine Corps, the shooter does not operate alone, but has a backup shooter trained to fulfill multiple roles in addition to being sniper-qualified in the operation of the main weapon.

The shooter focuses mainly on firing the shot, while the spotter assists in observation of targets, accounts for atmospheric conditions and handles ancillary tasks as immediate security of their location, communication with other parties (e.g. directing artillery fire and close air support). A flanker is an extra teammate who is tasked to act as a sentry observing areas not immediately visible to the sniper and spotter, assisting with the team&#x27;s rear security and perimeter defense, and therefore are usually armed with a faster-firing weapon such as an assault rifle, battle rifle or designated marksman rifle. Both the spotter and flanker carry additional ammunition and associated equipment.

The spotter is responsible for detecting, identifying and assigning priority of targets for the shooter, as well as assessing the outcome of the shot. Using a spotting scope and/or a rangefinder, the spotter will predict the external ballistics and read the wind speed using an anemometer or physical indicators like the mirage caused by ground heat. Also, in conjunction with the shooter, the spotter will calculate the distance, shooting angle (slant range), mil-related correction, interference by atmospheric factors and the required leads for moving targets. It is not unusual for the spotter to be equipped with a ballistic table, a notebook or a tablet computer specifically for performing these calculations.

===Law enforcement applications===

Law enforcement snipers, commonly called police snipers, and military snipers differ in many ways, including their areas of operation and tactics. A police sharpshooter is part of a police operation and usually takes part in relatively short missions. Police forces typically deploy such sharpshooters in hostage scenarios. This differs from a military sniper, who operates as part of a larger army, engaged in warfare. Sometimes as part of a SWAT team, police snipers are deployed alongside negotiators and an assault team trained for close quarters combat. As policemen, they are trained to shoot only as a last resort, when there is a direct threat to life; the police sharpshooter has a well-known rule: &quot;Be prepared to take a life to save a life.&quot; Police snipers typically operate at much shorter ranges than military snipers, generally under and sometimes even less than . Both types of snipers do make difficult shots under pressure, and often perform one-shot kills.
Police units that are unequipped for tactical operations may rely on a specialized SWAT team, which may have a dedicated sniper. Some police sniper operations begin with military assistance. Police snipers placed in vantage points, such as high buildings, can provide security for events. In one high-profile incident commonly referred to as &quot;The Shot Seen Around the World&quot; due to going viral online, Mike Plumb, a SWAT sniper in Columbus, Ohio, prevented a suicide by shooting a revolver out of the individual&#x27;s hand, leaving him unharmed.
The need for specialized training for police sharpshooters was made apparent in 1972 during the Munich massacre when the German police could not deploy specialized personnel or equipment during the standoff at the airport in the closing phase of the crisis, and consequently all of the Israeli hostages were killed. While the German army did have snipers in 1972, the use of army snipers in the scenario was impossible due to the German constitution&#x27;s explicit prohibition of the use of the military in domestic matters. This lack of trained snipers who could be used in civilian roles was later addressed with the founding of the specialized police counter-terrorist unit GSG 9.

===Longest recorded sniper kill===

The longest confirmed sniper kill in combat was achieved by an undisclosed member of the Security Service of Ukraine in November 2023, hitting a Russian soldier at a distance of during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

The previous record holder was a member of the Canadian JTF2 special forces who in June 2017 achieved a hit at a distance of .
In November 2009, Craig Harrison, a Corporal of Horse (CoH) in the Blues and Royals RHG/D of the British Army struck two Taliban machine gunners consecutively south of Musa Qala in Helmand Province in Afghanistan at a range of or 1.54 miles using a L115A3 Long Range Rifle.
The QTU Lapua external ballistics software, using continuous doppler drag coefficient (Cd) data provided by Lapua, predicts that such shots traveling would likely have struck their targets after nearly 6.0 seconds of flight time, having lost 93% of their kinetic energy, retaining of their original velocity, and having dropped or 2.8° from the original bore line. Due to the extreme distances and travel time involved, even a light cross-breeze of would have diverted such shots off target, which would have required compensation.

The calculation assumes a &quot;flat-fire scenario&quot; (a situation where the shooting and target positions are at equal elevation), using British military custom high-pressure .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges, loaded with 16.2 g (250 gr) Lapua LockBase B408 bullets, fired at 936 m/s (3,071 ft/s) muzzle velocity under the following on-site (average) atmospheric conditions: barometric pressure: at sea-level equivalent or on-site, humidity: 25.9%, and temperature: in the region for November 2009, resulting in an air density ρ = 1.0854 kg/m3 at the elevation of Musa Qala. Harrison mentions in reports that the environmental conditions were perfect for long range shooting, &quot;... no wind, mild weather, clear visibility.&quot; In a BBC interview, Harrison reported it took about nine shots for him and his spotter to initially range the target successfully.

==Military history==
Before the development of rifling, firearms were smoothbore and inaccurate over long distance. Barrel rifling was invented at the end of the fifteenth century, but was only employed in large cannons. Over time, rifling, along with other gunnery advances, has increased the performance of modern firearms.

===1543-1600===

Long range marksmanship occurred as early as the mid-sixteenth century.

One example is the Ise-no-kami school of gunnery. It was founded by the Christian feudal lord of the Saiki Domain, Mori Takamasa (毛利高政 1559- 1628). Takamasa had aspired to become a marksman from a young age, and in his prime, he used up a 10-tan sailboat&#x27;s worth of ammunition in just a few years, showing his considerable passion. He is said to have always told people, &quot;You won&#x27;t improve your skills unless you fire that much ammunition.&quot; During the battle of Ulsan Castle in Korea, he was a master of guns, firing at the enemy from a distance of seven cho ( about 770 meters ) with a 278 cm long &quot;焔魔王 - Flaming Demon King&quot; O-zutsu (Matchlock Cannon) throwing the enemy camp into confusion with his accurate shots. 

===1701–1800===

Later &quot;sharpshooting&quot; or &quot;sniping&quot; became implemented in shooting terminology.
For example: in the 1752 Appin Murder, Colin Roy Campbell of Glenure was shot in the back near Duror by an unknown sniper, most likely from within Clan Stewart of Appin, in retaliation for Campbell&#x27;s role in an early version of the Highland Clearances; the mass eviction of Stewart clansmen and their replacement by members of Clan Campbell.

Hunting terminology was quickly adapted to warfare by British soldiers. In a 1772 letter, a soldier described enemies firing very accurately:
On 11 September 1777, during the Battle of Brandywine, British Captain Patrick Ferguson had a tall, distinguished American officer in his rifle&#x27;s iron sights. Ferguson did not take the shot, as he considered shooting anyone in the back dishonourable. Only later, did Ferguson learn that George Washington had been on the battlefield that day.

At the Battles of Saratoga, Morgan&#x27;s Riflemen hid in the trees and used early model rifles to shoot senior British officers. Most notably, Timothy Murphy shot and killed General Simon Fraser of Balnain on 7 October 1777 at a distance of about 400 yards.

In early 1800, Colonel Coote Manningham and Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. William Stewart of the British Army proposed using what they had learned while leading light infantry to establish a special unit of marksmen. Subsequently raised as the &quot;Experimental Corps of Riflemen&quot;, they were armed with the formidable Baker rifle rather than the inaccurate smoothbore muskets used by most troops at that time. Through the combination of a leather wad and tight grooves on the inside of the barrel (rifling), this weapon was far more accurate, though slower to load. On 25 August 1800, three companies, under the command of Stewart, spearheaded an amphibious landing at Ferrol, Spain.

===1801–1900===
The term, &quot;sharp shooter&quot; was in use in British newspapers as early as 1801. In the &quot;Edinburgh Advertiser&quot;, 23 June 1801, can be found the following quote in a piece about the North British Militia; &quot;This Regiment has several Field Pieces, and two companies of Sharp Shooters, which are very necessary in the modern Stile of War&quot;. The term appears even earlier, around 1781, in Continental Europe, translated from the German Scharfschütze.
Scouts in the Ashanti army were made up of professional hunters who used their skill as marksmen to snipe at advancing enemy forces in response to detection by the enemy. They executed this often from a perch high in trees.
The Whitworth rifle was arguably the first long-range sniper rifle in the world. A muzzleloader designed by Sir Joseph Whitworth, a prominent British engineer, it used polygonal rifling instead, which meant that the projectile did not have to bite into grooves as was done with conventional rifling. The Whitworth rifle was far more accurate than the Pattern 1853 Enfield, which had shown some weaknesses during the recent Crimean War. At trials in 1857 which tested the accuracy and range of both weapons, Whitworth&#x27;s design outperformed the Enfield at a rate of about three to one. The Whitworth rifle was capable of hitting the target at a range of 2,000 yards, whereas the Enfield could only manage it at 1,400 yards.

During the Crimean War, the first optical sights were designed to fit onto rifles. Much of this pioneering work was the brainchild of Colonel D. Davidson, using optical sights produced by Chance Brothers of Birmingham. This allowed a marksman to observe and target objects more accurately at a greater distance than ever before. The telescopic sight, or scope, was originally fixed and could not be adjusted, which therefore limited its range.

Despite its success at the trials, the rifle was not adopted by the British Army. However, the Whitworth Rifle Company was able to sell the weapon to the French army, and also to the Confederacy during the American Civil War, where both the Union and Confederate armies employed sharpshooters. The most notable incident was during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House, where on 9 May 1864, Union General John Sedgwick was killed by a Confederate Whitworth sharpshooter at a range of about after saying the enemy &quot;couldn&#x27;t hit an elephant at this distance&quot;.

===Second Boer War===
During the Boer War the latest breech-loading rifled guns with magazines and smokeless powder were used by both sides. The British were equipped with the Lee–Metford rifle, while the Boers had received the latest Mauser rifles from Germany. In the open terrain of South Africa the marksmen were a crucial component to the outcome of the battle.

The first British sniper unit began life as the Lovat Scouts, a Scottish Highland regiment formed in 1899, that earned high praise during the Second Boer War (1899–1902). The unit was formed by Lord Lovat and reported to an American, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the British Army Chief of Scouts under Lord Roberts. Burnham fittingly described these scouts as &quot;half wolf and half jackrabbit.&quot;. Just like their Boer scout opponents, these scouts were well practised in the arts of marksmanship, field craft, map reading, observation, and military tactics. They were skilled woodsmen and practitioners of discretion: &quot;He who shoots and runs away, lives to shoot another day.&quot; They were also the first known military unit to wear a ghillie suit. 
Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard said of them that &quot;keener men never lived&quot;, and that &quot;Burnham was the greatest scout of our time.&quot; Burnham distinguished himself in wars in South Africa, Rhodesia, and in Arizona fighting the Apaches, and his definitive work, &quot;Scouting on Two Continents,&quot; provides a dramatic and enlightening picture of what a sniper was at the time and how he operated.

After the war, this regiment went on to formally become the first official sniper unit, then better known as &quot;sharpshooters&quot;.

===World War I===

During World War I, snipers appeared as deadly sharpshooters in the trenches. At the start of the war, only Imperial Germany had troops that were issued scoped sniper rifles. Although sharpshooters existed on all sides, the Germans specially equipped some of their soldiers with scoped rifles that could pick off enemy soldiers showing their heads out of their trench. At first the French and British believed such hits to be coincidental hits, until the German scoped rifles were discovered. During World War I, the German army received a reputation for the deadliness and efficiency of its snipers, partly because of the high-quality lenses that German industry could manufacture.

During the First World War, the static movement of trench warfare and a need for protection from snipers created a requirement for loopholes both for discharging firearms and for observation. Often a steel plate was used with a &quot;key hole&quot;, which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.


Soon the British army began to train their own snipers in specialized sniper schools. Major Hesketh Hesketh-Prichard was given formal permission to begin sniper training in 1915, and founded the First Army School of Sniping, Observation, and Scouting at Linghem in France in 1916. Starting with a first class of only six, in time he was able to lecture to large numbers of soldiers from different Allied nations, proudly proclaiming in a letter that his school was turning out snipers at three times the rate of any such other school in the world.

He also devised a metal-armoured double loophole that would protect the sniper observer from enemy fire. The front loophole was fixed, but the rear was housed in a metal shutter sliding in grooves. Only when the two loopholes were lined up—a one-to-twenty chance—could an enemy shoot between them. Another innovation was the use of a dummy head to find the location of an enemy sniper. The papier-mâché figures were painted to resemble soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with rubber surgical tubing so the dummy could &quot;smoke&quot; a cigarette and thus appear realistic. Holes punched in the dummy by enemy sniper bullets then could be used for triangulation purposes to determine the position of the enemy sniper, who could then be attacked with artillery fire. He developed many of the modern techniques in sniping, including the use of spotting scopes and working in pairs, and using Kim&#x27;s Game to train observational skills.

In 1920, he wrote his account of his war time activities in his book &quot;&quot;, to which reference is still made by modern authors regarding the subject.

The main sniper rifles used during the First World War were the German Mauser Gewehr 98; the British Pattern 1914 Enfield and Lee–Enfield SMLE Mk III, the Canadian Ross rifle, the American M1903 Springfield, the Italian M1891 Carcano, and the Russian M1891 Mosin–Nagant.

===World War II===
During the interbellum, most nations dropped their specialized sniper units, notably the Germans. Effectiveness and dangers of snipers once again came to the fore during the Spanish Civil War. The only nation that had specially trained sniper units during the 1930s was the Soviet Union. Soviet snipers were trained in their skills as marksmen, in using the terrain to hide themselves from the enemy and the ability to work alongside regular forces. This made the Soviet sniper training focus more on &quot;normal&quot; combat situations than those of other nations.

Snipers reappeared as important factors on the battlefield from the first campaign of World War II. During Germany&#x27;s 1940 campaigns, lone, well-hidden French and British snipers were able to halt the German advance for a considerable amount of time. For example, during the pursuit to Dunkirk, British snipers were able to significantly delay the German infantry&#x27;s advance. This prompted the British once again to increase training of specialized sniper units. Apart from marksmanship, British snipers were trained to blend in with the environment, often by using special camouflage clothing for concealment. However, because the British Army offered sniper training exclusively to officers and non-commissioned officers, the resulting small number of trained snipers in combat units considerably reduced their overall effectiveness.

During the Winter War, Finnish snipers took a heavy toll of the invading Red Army. Simo Häyhä is credited with 505 confirmed kills, most with the Finnish version of the iron-sighted bolt-action Mosin–Nagant. The most successful German sniper was Matthäus Hetzenauer with 345 confirmed kills. In Germany, kills are only confirmed in the presence of an officer, so Hetzenauer&#x27;s estimated kills are many times higher. His longest confirmed kill was reported at . Hetzenauer received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 17 April 1945.

One of the best known battles involving snipers, and the battle that made the Germans reinstate their specialized sniper training, was the Battle of Stalingrad. Their defensive position inside a city filled with rubble meant that Soviet snipers were able to inflict significant casualties on the Wehrmacht troops. Because of the nature of fighting in city rubble, snipers were very hard to spot and seriously dented the morale of the German attackers. The best known of these snipers was probably Vasily Zaytsev, featured in the novel &quot;War of the Rats&quot; and the subsequent film &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;.

German &quot;Scharfschützen&quot; were prepared before the war, equipped with Karabiner 98 and later Gewehr 43 rifles, but there were often not enough of these weapons available, and as such some were armed with captured scoped Mosin–Nagant 1891/30, SVT, Czech Mauser rifles or scoped Gewehr 98 from WW1. The Wehrmacht re-established its sniper training in 1942, drastically increasing the number of snipers per unit with the creation of an additional 31 sniper training companies by 1944. German snipers were at the time the only snipers in the world issued with purpose-manufactured sniping ammunition, known as the &#x27;effect-firing&#x27; sS round. The &#x27;effect-firing&#x27; sS round featured an extra carefully measured propellant charge and seated a heavy 12.8 gram (198 gr) full-metal-jacketed boat-tail projectile of match-grade build quality, lacking usual features such as a seating ring to improve the already high ballistic coefficient of .584 (G1) further. For aiming optics German snipers used the Zeiss Zielvier 4x (ZF39) telescopic sight which had bullet drop compensation in 50 m increments for ranges from 100 m up to 800 m or in some variations from 100 m up to 1000 m or 1200 m. There were ZF42, Zielfernrohr 43 (ZF 4), Zeiss Zielsechs 6x, Zeiss Zielacht 8x and other telescopic sights by various manufacturers like the Ajack 4x, Hensoldt Dialytan 4x and Kahles Heliavier 4x with similar features employed on German sniper rifles. Several different mountings produced by various manufacturers were used for mounting aiming optics to the rifles. In February 1945 the Zielgerät 1229 active infrared aiming device was issued for night sniping with the StG 44 assault rifle.

A total of 428,335 individuals received Red Army sniper training, including Soviet and non-Soviet partisans, with 9,534 receiving the sniping &#x27;higher qualification&#x27;. During World War ІІ, two six-month training courses for women alone trained nearly 55,000 snipers, of which more than two thousand later served in the army. On average there was at least one sniper in an infantry platoon and one in every reconnaissance platoon, including in tank and even artillery units. Some used the PTRD anti-tank rifle with an adapted scope as an early example of an anti-materiel rifle.

In the United States Armed Forces, sniper training was only very elementary and was mainly concerned with being able to hit targets over long distances. Snipers were required to be able to hit a body over 400 meters away, and a head over 200 meters away. There was almost no instruction in blending into the environment. Sniper training varied from place to place, resulting in wide variation in the qualities of snipers. The main reason the US did not extend sniper training beyond long-range shooting was the limited deployment of US soldiers until the Normandy Invasion. During the campaigns in North Africa and Italy, most fighting occurred in arid and mountainous regions where the potential for concealment was limited, in contrast to Western and Central Europe.
The U.S. Army&#x27;s lack of familiarity with sniping tactics proved disastrous in Normandy and the campaign in Western Europe where they encountered well trained German snipers. In Normandy, German snipers remained hidden in the dense vegetation and were able to encircle American units, firing at them from all sides. The American and British forces were surprised by how near the German snipers could approach in safety and attack them, as well as by their ability to hit targets at up to 1,000m. A notable mistake made by inexperienced American soldiers was to lie down and wait when targeted by German snipers, allowing the snipers to pick them off one after another. German snipers often infiltrated Allied lines and sometimes when the front-lines moved, they continued to fight from their sniping positions, refusing to surrender until their rations and munitions were exhausted.

Those tactics were also a consequence of changes in German enlistment. After several years of war and heavy losses on the Eastern Front, the German army was forced to rely more heavily on enlisting teenage soldiers. Due to lack of training in more complex group tactics, and thanks to rifle training provided by the Hitlerjugend, those soldiers were often used as autonomous left-behind snipers. While an experienced sniper would take a few lethal shots and retreat to a safer position, those young boys, due both to a disregard for their own safety and to lack of tactical experience would frequently remain in a concealed position and fight until they ran out of ammunition or were killed or wounded. While this tactic generally ended in the demise of the sniper, giving rise to the nickname &quot;Suicide Boys&quot; that was given to those soldiers, this irrational behavior proved quite disruptive to the Allied forces&#x27; progress. After World War II, many elements of German sniper training and doctrine were copied by other countries.

In the Pacific War, the Empire of Japan trained snipers. In the jungles of Asia and the Pacific Islands, snipers posed a serious threat to U.S., British, and Commonwealth troops. Japanese snipers were specially trained to use the environment to conceal themselves. Japanese snipers used foliage on their uniforms and dug well-concealed hide-outs that were often connected with small trenches. There was no need for long range accuracy because most combat in the jungle took place within a few hundred meters. Japanese snipers were known for their patience and ability to remain hidden for long periods. They almost never left their carefully camouflaged hiding spots. This meant that whenever a sniper was in the area, the location of the sniper could be determined after the sniper had fired a few shots. The Allies used their own snipers in the Pacific, notably the U.S. Marines, who used M1903 Springfield rifles.

Common sniper rifles used during the Second World War include: the Soviet M1891/30 Mosin–Nagant and, to a lesser extent, the SVT-40; the German Mauser Karabiner 98k and Gewehr 43; the British Lee–Enfield No. 4 and Pattern 1914 Enfield; the Japanese Arisaka 97; the American M1903A4 Springfield and M1C Garand. The Italians trained few snipers and supplied them with a scoped Carcano Model 1891.

==Training==

Military sniper training aims to teach a high degree of proficiency in camouflage and concealment, stalking, observation and map reading as well as precision marksmanship under various operational conditions. Trainees typically shoot thousands of rounds over a number of weeks, while learning these core skills.

Snipers are trained to squeeze the trigger straight back with the ball of their finger, to avoid jerking the gun sideways. The most accurate position is prone, with a sandbag supporting the stock, and the stock&#x27;s cheek-piece against the cheek. In the field, a bipod can be used instead. Sometimes a sling is wrapped around the weak arm (or both) to reduce stock movement. Some doctrines train a sniper to breathe deeply before shooting, then hold their lungs empty while they line up and take their shot. Other doctrines assert that exhausting the lungs results in an accelerated heart rate and suggest only a partial exhale before firing. Some go further, teaching their snipers to shoot between heartbeats to minimize barrel motion.

===Accuracy===
The key to sniping is accuracy, which applies to both the weapon and the shooter. The weapon should be able to consistently place shots within tight tolerances. The sniper in turn must use the weapon to accurately place shots under varying conditions.

A sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a bullet&#x27;s trajectory and point of impact, such as range to the target, wind direction, wind velocity, altitude and elevation of the sniper, and the target and ambient temperature. Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can decrease lethality or cause a shot to miss completely.

Snipers zero their weapons at a target range or in the field. This is the process of adjusting the scope so that the bullets&#x27; points-of-impact are at the point-of-aim (centre of scope or scope&#x27;s cross-hairs) for a specific distance. A rifle and scope should retain its zero as long as possible under all conditions to reduce the need to re-zero during missions.

A sandbag can serve as a useful platform for shooting a sniper rifle, although any soft surface such as a rucksack will steady a rifle and contribute to consistency. In particular, bipods help when firing from a prone position, and enable the firing position to be sustained for an extended period of time. Many police and military sniper rifles come equipped with an adjustable bipod. Makeshift bipods known as shooting sticks can be constructed from items such as tree branches or ski poles. Some military snipers use three-legged shooting sticks.

===U.S. military===

Servicemen volunteer for the rigorous sniper training and are accepted on the basis of their aptitude, physical ability, marksmanship, patience and mental stability. Military snipers may be further trained as forward air controllers (FACs) to direct air strikes or forward observers (FOs) to direct artillery or mortar fire.

===Russian Army===
From 2011, the Russian armed forces have run newly developed sniper courses in military district training centres. In place of the Soviet practice of mainly squad sharpshooters, which were often designated during initial training (and of whom only few become snipers per se), these new army snipers are trained intensively for three months (for conscripts) or longer (for contract soldiers). The training program includes theory and practice of countersniper engagements, artillery spotting, and coordination of air support. The first instructors are the graduates of the Solnechnogorsk sniper training centre.

The method of sniper deployment, according to the Ministry of Defence, is likely to be one three-platoon company at the brigade level, with one of the platoons acting independently and the other two supporting the battalions as needed.

==Targeting, tactics, and techniques==


===Range finding===
The range to the target is measured or estimated as precisely as conditions permit and correct range estimation becomes absolutely critical at long ranges, because a bullet travels with a curved trajectory and the sniper must compensate for this by aiming higher at longer distances. If the exact distance is not known the sniper may compensate incorrectly and the bullet path may be too high or low. As an example, for a typical military sniping cartridge such as 7.62×51mm NATO (.308 Winchester) M118 Special Ball round this difference (or &quot;drop&quot;) from is . This means that if the sniper incorrectly estimated the distance as 700 meters when the target was in fact 800 meters away, the bullet will be 200 millimeters lower than expected by the time it reaches the target.

Laser rangefinders may be used, and range estimation is often the job of both parties in a team. One useful method of range finding without a laser rangefinder is comparing the height of the target (or nearby objects) to their size on the mil dot scope, or taking a known distance and using some sort of measure (utility poles, fence posts) to determine the additional distance. The average human head is in width, average human shoulders are apart and the average distance from a person&#x27;s pelvis to the top of their head is .

To determine the range to a target without a laser rangefinder, the sniper may use the mil dot reticle on a scope to accurately find the range. Mil dots are used like a slide rule to measure the height of a target, and if the height is known, the range can be as well. The height of the target (in yards) ×1000, divided by the height of the target (in mils), gives the range in yards. This is only in general, however, as both scope magnification (7×, 40×) and mil dot spacing change. The USMC standard is that 1 mil (that is, 1 milliradian) equals 3.438 MOA (minute of arc, or, equivalently, minute of angle), while the US Army standard is 3.6 MOA, chosen so as to give a diameter of 1 yard at a distance of 1,000 yards (or equivalently, a diameter of 1 meter at a range of 1 kilometer.) Many commercial manufacturers use 3.5, splitting the difference, since it is easier to work with.

It is important to note that angular mil (&quot;mil&quot;) is only an approximation of a milliradian and different organizations use different approximations.

At longer ranges, bullet drop plays a significant role in targeting. The effect can be estimated from a chart, which may be memorized or taped to the rifle, although some scopes come with Bullet Drop Compensator (BDC) systems that only require the range be dialed in. These are tuned to both a specific class of rifle and specific ammunition. Every bullet type and load will have different ballistics. .308 Federal 175 grain (11.3 g) BTHP match shoots at . Zeroed at , a 16.2 MOA adjustment would have to be made to hit a target at . If the same bullet was shot with 168 grain (10.9 g), a 17.1 MOA adjustment would be necessary.

Shooting uphill or downhill is confusing for many because gravity does not act perpendicular to the direction the bullet is traveling. Thus, gravity must be divided into its component vectors. Only the fraction of gravity equal to the cosine of the angle of fire with respect to the horizon affects the rate of fall of the bullet, with the remainder adding or subtracting negligible velocity to the bullet along its trajectory. To find the correct zero, the sniper multiplies the actual distance to the range by this fraction and aims as if the target were that distance away. For example, a sniper who observes a target 500 meters away at a 45-degree angle downhill would multiply the range by the cosine of 45 degrees, which is 0.707. The resulting distance will be 353 meters. This number is equal to the horizontal distance to the target. All other values, such as windage, time-to-target, impact velocity, and energy will be calculated based on the actual range of 500 meters. Recently, a small device known as a cosine indicator has been developed. This device is clamped to the tubular body of the telescopic sight, and gives an indicative readout in numerical form as the rifle is aimed up or down at the target. This is translated into a figure used to compute the horizontal range to the target.

Windage plays a significant role, with the effect increasing with wind speed or the distance of the shot. The slant of visible convections near the ground can be used to estimate crosswinds, and correct the point of aim. All adjustments for range, wind, and elevation can be performed by aiming off the target, called &quot;holding over&quot; or Kentucky windage. Alternatively, the scope can be adjusted so that the point of aim is changed to compensate for these factors, sometimes referred to as &quot;dialing in&quot;. The shooter must remember to return the scope to zeroed position. Adjusting the scope allows for more accurate shots, because the cross-hairs can be aligned with the target more accurately, but the sniper must know exactly what differences the changes will have on the point-of-impact at each target range.

For moving targets, the point-of-aim is ahead of the target in the direction of movement. Known as &quot;leading&quot; the target, the amount of &quot;lead&quot; depends on the speed and angle of the target&#x27;s movement as well as the distance to the target. For this technique, holding over is the preferred method. Anticipating the behavior of the target is necessary to accurately place the shot.

===Hide sites and hiding techniques===
The term &quot;hide site&quot; refers to a covered and concealed position from which a sniper and his team can conduct surveillance or fire at targets. A good hide conceals and camouflages the sniper effectively, provides cover from enemy fire and allows a wide view of the surrounding area.

The main purpose of ghillie suits and hide sites is to break up the outline of a person with a rifle.

Many snipers use ghillie suits to hide and stay hidden. Ghillie suits vary according to the terrain into which the sniper wishes to blend. For example, in dry grassland the sniper will typically wear a ghillie suit covered in dead grass.

===Shot placement===
Shot placement, which is where on the body the sniper is aiming, varies with the type of sniper. Military snipers, who generally do not shoot at targets at less than , usually attempt body shots, aiming at the chest. These shots depend on tissue damage, organ trauma, and blood loss to kill the target. Body shots are used because the chest is a larger target.

Police snipers, who generally shoot at much shorter distances, may attempt a more precise shot at particular parts of body or particular devices: in one incident in 2007 in Marseille, a GIPN sniper took a shot from at the pistol of a police officer threatening to commit suicide, destroying the weapon and preventing the police officer from killing himself.

In a high-risk or hostage-taking situation where a suspect is imminently threatening to kill a hostage, police snipers may take head shots to ensure an instant kill. The snipers aim for the medulla oblongata to sever the spine from the brain. While this is believed to prevent the target from reflexively firing their weapon, there is evidence that any brain-hit is sufficient.

===Target acquisition===
Snipers are trained for the detection, identification, and location of a targeted soldier in sufficient detail to permit the effective employment of lethal and non-lethal means. Since most kills in modern warfare are by other crew-served weapons, reconnaissance is one of the most effective uses of snipers. They use their aerobic conditioning, infiltration skills and excellent long-distance observation equipment (optical scopes) and tactics to approach and observe the enemy. In this role, their rules of engagement typically let them shoot at high-value targets of opportunity, such as enemy officers.

The targets may be personnel or high-value materiel (military equipment and weapons) but most often they target the most important enemy personnel such as officers or specialists (e.g. communications operators) so as to cause maximum disruption to enemy operations. Other personnel they might target include those who pose an immediate threat to the sniper, like dog handlers, who are often employed in a search for snipers. A sniper identifies officers by their appearance and behavior such as symbols of rank, talking to radio operators, sitting as a passenger in a car, sitting in a car with a large radio antenna, having military servants, binoculars/map cases or talking and moving position more frequently. If possible, snipers shoot in descending order by rank, or if rank is unavailable, they shoot to disrupt communications.

Some rifles, such as the Denel NTW-20 and Vidhwansak, are designed for a purely anti-materiel (AM) role, e.g. shooting turbine disks of parked aircraft, missile guidance packages, expensive optics, and the bearings, tubes or wave guides of radar sets. A sniper equipped with the correct rifle can target radar dishes, water containers, the engines of vehicles, and any number of other targets. Other rifles, such as the .50 caliber rifles produced by Barrett and McMillan, are not designed exclusively as AM rifles, but are often employed in such a way, providing the range and power needed for AM applications in a lightweight package compared to most traditional AM rifles. Other calibers, such as the .408 Cheyenne Tactical and the .338 Lapua Magnum, are designed to be capable of limited AM application, but are ideally suited as long range anti-personnel rounds.

===Relocating===
Often in situations with multiple targets, snipers use relocation. After firing a few shots from a certain position, snipers move unseen to another location before the enemy can determine where they are and mount a counter-attack. Snipers will frequently use this tactic to their advantage, creating an atmosphere of chaos and confusion. In other, rarer situations, relocation is used to eliminate the factor of wind.

===Sound masking===
As sniper rifles are often extremely powerful and consequently loud, it is common for snipers to use a technique known as sound masking. When employed by a highly skilled marksman, this tactic can be used as a substitute for a noise suppressor. Very loud sounds in the environment, such as artillery shells air bursting or claps of thunder, can often mask the sound of the shot. This technique is frequently used in clandestine operations, infiltration tactics, and guerrilla warfare.

===Psychological warfare===

Due to the surprise nature of sniper fire, high lethality of aimed shots and frustration at the inability to locate and counterattack snipers, sniper tactics have a significant negative effect on morale. Extensive use of sniper tactics can be used to induce constant stress and fear in opposing forces, making them afraid to move about or leave cover. In many ways, the psychological impact imposed by snipers is quite similar to those of landmines, booby-traps, and IEDs (constant threat, high &quot;per event&quot; lethality, inability to strike back).

Historically, captured snipers are often summarily executed. This happened during World War I and World War II; for example the second Biscari Massacre when 36 suspected snipers were lined up and shot on 14 July 1943.

As a result, if a sniper is in imminent danger of capture, he may discard any items (sniper rifle, laser rangefinder, etc.) which might indicate his status as a sniper. The risk of captured snipers being summarily executed is explicitly referred to in Chapter 6 of US Army doctrine document FM 3-060.11 entitled &quot;SNIPER AND COUNTERSNIPER TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES&quot;:

The negative reputation and perception of snipers can be traced back to the American Revolution, when American &quot;Marksmen&quot; intentionally targeted British officers, an act considered uncivilized by the British Army at the time (this reputation was cemented during the Battle of Saratoga, when Benedict Arnold allegedly ordered his marksmen to target British General Simon Fraser, an act that won the battle and French support). The British side used specially selected sharpshooters as well, often German mercenaries.

To demoralize enemy troops, snipers can follow predictable patterns. During the 26th of July Movement in the Cuban Revolution, the revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro always killed the foremost man in a group of President Batista&#x27;s soldiers. Realizing this, none of Batista&#x27;s men would walk first, as it was suicidal. This effectively decreased the army&#x27;s willingness to search for rebel bases in the forests and mountains. An alternative approach to this psychological process is to kill the second man in the row, leading to the psychological effect of nobody wanting to follow the &quot;leader&quot;.

===Counter-sniper tactics===
The occurrence of sniper warfare has led to the evolution of many counter-sniper tactics in modern military strategies. These aim to reduce the damage caused by a sniper to an army, which can often be harmful to both combat capabilities and morale.

The risk of damage to a chain of command can be reduced by removing or concealing features that would otherwise indicate an officer&#x27;s rank. Modern armies tend to avoid saluting officers in the field, and eliminate rank insignia on battle dress uniforms. Officers can seek maximum cover before revealing themselves as good candidates for elimination through actions such as reading maps or using radios.

Friendly snipers can be used to hunt the enemy sniper. Besides direct observation, defending forces can use other techniques. These include calculating the trajectory of a bullet by triangulation. Traditionally, triangulation of a sniper&#x27;s position was done manually, though radar-based technology has recently become available. Once located, the defenders can attempt to approach the sniper from cover and overwhelm them. The United States military is funding a project known as RedOwl (Robot Enhanced Detection Outpost With Lasers), which uses laser and acoustic sensors to determine the exact direction from which a sniper round has been fired.

The more rounds fired by a sniper, the greater the chance the target has of locating him. Thus, attempts to draw fire are often made, sometimes by offering a helmet slightly out of concealment, a tactic successfully employed in the Winter War by the Finns known as &quot;Kylmä-Kalle&quot; (Cold Charlie). They used a shop mannequin or other doll dressed as a tempting target, such as an officer. The doll was then presented as if it were a real man sloppily covering himself. Usually, Soviet snipers were unable to resist the temptation of an apparently easy kill. Once the angle where the bullet came from was determined, a large caliber gun, such as a Lahti L-39 &quot;Norsupyssy&quot; (&quot;Elephant rifle&quot;) anti-tank rifle was fired at the sniper to kill him.

Other tactics include directing artillery or mortar fire onto suspected sniper positions, the use of smoke screens, placing tripwire-operated munitions, mines, or other booby-traps near suspected sniper positions. Even dummy trip-wires can be placed to hamper sniper movement. If anti-personnel mines are unavailable, it is possible to improvise booby-traps by connecting trip-wires to hand grenades, smoke grenades or flares. Though these may not kill a sniper, they will reveal their location. Booby-trap devices can be placed near likely sniper hides, or along the probable routes to and from positions. Knowledge of sniper field-craft will assist in this task.

The use of canine units had been very successful, especially during the Vietnam War.

==Irregular and asymmetric warfare==

The use of sniping (in the sense of shooting at relatively long range from a concealed position) to murder came to public attention in a number of sensational U.S. criminal cases, including the Austin sniper incident of 1966 (Charles Whitman), the John F. Kennedy assassination (Lee Harvey Oswald), and the Beltway sniper attacks of late 2002 (Lee Boyd Malvo). However, these incidents usually do not involve the range or skill of military snipers; in all three cases the perpetrators had U.S. military training, but in other specialties. News reports will often (inaccurately) use the term sniper to describe anyone shooting with a rifle at another person.

Sniping has been used in asymmetric warfare situations, for example in the Northern Ireland Troubles, where in 1972, the bloodiest year of the conflict, the majority of the soldiers killed were shot by concealed IRA riflemen. There were some instances in the early 1990s of British soldiers and RUC personnel being shot with .50 caliber Barrett rifles by sniper teams collectively known as the South Armagh sniper.

The sniper is particularly suited to combat environments where one side is at a disadvantage. A careful sniping strategy can use a few individuals and resources to thwart the movement or other progress of a much better equipped or larger force. Sniping enables a few persons to instil terror in a much larger regular force – regardless of the size of the force the snipers are attached to. It is widely accepted that sniping, while effective in specific instances, is much more effective as a broadly deployed psychological attack or as a force-multiplier.

Snipers are less likely to be treated mercifully than non-snipers if captured by the enemy. The rationale for this is that ordinary soldiers shoot at each other at &#x27;equal opportunity&#x27; whilst snipers take their time in tracking and killing individual targets in a methodical fashion with a relatively low risk of retaliation.

===War in Iraq===
In 2003, the U.S.-led multinational coalition composed of primarily U.S. and UK troops occupied Iraq and attempted to establish a new government in the country. However, shortly after the initial invasion, violence against coalition forces and among various sectarian groups led to asymmetric warfare with the Iraqi insurgency and civil war between many Sunni and Shia Iraqis.

Through to November 2005 the Army had attributed 28 of 2,100 U.S. deaths to enemy snipers. In 2006, it was claimed that one insurgent sniper, &quot;Juba&quot;, had shot up to 37 American soldiers.

Training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence had among its tips for shooting U.S. troops, &quot;Killing doctors and chaplains is suggested as a means of psychological warfare.&quot;, suggesting that those casualties would demoralize entire units.

===Arab Spring===
Sniper activity was reported during the Arab Spring civil unrest in Libya in 2011, both from anti-governmental and pro-governmental supporters, and in Syria at least from pro-government forces.

==Notable military marksmen and snipers==

Even before firearms were available, soldiers such as archers were specially trained as elite marksmen.

===17th century===
* Lord Brooke, who represented the Parliamentarians in the English Civil War, was the first recorded British sniper victim, killed by a Royalist soldier hiding in a bell tower in Lichfield.

===18th century===
* Timothy Murphy (American Revolutionary War) – killed British General Simon Fraser during the pivotal Battles of Saratoga, hampering the British advance which resulted in their defeat.
* Patrick Ferguson (American Revolutionary War) – developer of the world&#x27;s first breech-loaded military rifle (which advanced sniping and sharpshooting tactics), fought with his Corps of Riflemen (recruited from the 6th and 14th Foot) at the Battle of Brandywine, where he may have passed up a chance to shoot George Washington.

===19th century===
* Napoleonic Wars – Use of Marine sharpshooters in the mast tops was common usage in navies of the period, and Admiral Nelson&#x27;s death at Trafalgar is attributed to the actions of French sharpshooters. The British Army developed the concept of directed fire (as opposed to massive unaimed volleys) and formed Rifle regiments, notably the 95th and the 60th who wore green jackets instead of the usual redcoats. Fighting as Skirmishers, usually in pairs and trusted to choose their own targets, they wrought havoc amongst the French during the Peninsular War.
* British Rifleman Thomas Plunkett (Peninsular War) – shot French General Colbert and one of his aides at a range of between using a Baker rifle.
* Colonel Hiram Berdan (American Civil War) – commanded 1st and 2nd US Sharpshooters, who were trained and equipped Union marksmen with the .52 caliber Sharps Rifle. It has been claimed that Berdan&#x27;s units killed more enemies than any other in the Union Army.
* Jack Hinson (American Civil War) recorded 36 &quot;kills&quot; on his custom-made .50 caliber Kentucky long rifle with iron sights.
* During the American Civil War, an unidentified Confederate sniper shot Major General John Sedgwick during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House probably with a British Whitworth target rifle at the then-incredible distance of minimum . Ben Powell of the 12th South Carolina claimed credit, although his account has been discounted because the general he shot at with a Whitworth rifled musket was mounted, probably Brig Gen. William H. Morris. Union troops from the 6th Vermont claim to have shot an unidentified sharpshooter as they crossed the fields seeking revenge. The shooting of Sedgewick caused administrative delays in the Union&#x27;s attack and led to Confederate victory. Sedgwick ignored advice to take cover, his last words according to urban legend being, &quot;They couldn&#x27;t hit an elephant at this dist-&quot;, whereupon he was shot. In reality, he was shot a few minutes later.
* Major Frederick Russell Burnham – assassinated Mlimo, the Ndebele religious leader, in his cave in Matobo Hills, Rhodesia, effectively ending the Second Matabele War (1896). Burnham started as a cowboy and Indian tracker in the American Old West, but he left the United States to scout in Africa and went on to command the British Army Scouts in the Second Boer War. For his ability to track, even at night, the Africans dubbed him, &quot;He-who-sees-in-the-dark&quot;, but in the press he became more widely known as &quot;England&#x27;s American Scout&quot;.

===20th century===
* Billy Sing (World War I) – An Australian sniper with at least 150 confirmed kills during the Gallipoli Campaign; he may have had close to 300 kills in total at Gallipoli, and went on to fight at the Western Front.

* Finnish Lance Corporal Simo Häyhä, nicknamed &quot;White Death&quot;, was a sniper during the Winter War and is regarded by many as the most effective sniper in the history of warfare, being credited with killing up to 705 Soviet soldiers (505 sniper kills, and estimated 200 sub-machine gun kills) in fewer than 100 days. Häyhä used a White Guard M/28 &quot;Pystykorva&quot; or &quot;Spitz&quot;, variant of the Russian Mosin–Nagant rifle.
* Mikhail Ilyich Surkov has been said to have killed 702 enemy troops, Vladimir Gavrilovich Salbiev had 601 confirmed kills, Vasilij Kvachantiradze had 534, Akhat Akhmetyanov and Ivan Sidorenko had around 500.
* Lieutenant Lyudmila Pavlichenko (World War II) was a female Soviet sniper with 309 confirmed kills, making her the most successful female sniper in history.
* Junior Lieutenant Vasily Zaytsev (World War II) was credited with killing about 200 German soldiers during the Battle of Stalingrad; he is portrayed in the film &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; and in the book &quot;War of the Rats&quot;. Both are fictionalized accounts.
* Semyon Nomokonov killed 367 persons, including a general.
* Gefreiter (Private) Matthäus Hetzenauer was an Austrian sniper in World War II who was credited with 345 confirmed kills on the Eastern Front, the most successful in the Wehrmacht.

* Clive Hulme was a New Zealand recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He is credited with stalking and killing 33 German snipers in the Battle of Crete.
* Ian Robertson served as a sniper with Australia&#x27;s 3RAR after World War II. He became one of the most effective snipers during the Korean War, during which in one instance he killed 30 soldiers in a single morning.
* Roza Shanina was a Soviet sniper during World War II credited with 59 confirmed kills, including twelve soldiers during the Battle of Vilnius.
* Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock achieved 93 confirmed kills during the Vietnam War but believed to have over 200 unconfirmed kills. With a telescopic-scoped .50 caliber M2 Browning heavy machine gun, he set a world record for the longest recorded sniper kill at which stood for 35 years until 2002.
* Chuck Mawhinney (Vietnam War) – 103 confirmed and 216 probable kills.
* Adelbert Waldron (Vietnam War) – achieved 109 confirmed kills.
* Master Sgt. Gary Gordon and Sgt. First Class Randy Shughart (Somalia: &quot;Operation Gothic Serpent&quot;) – were Delta Force snipers who were awarded the Medal of Honor for their attempt to protect the injured crew of a downed helicopter during the Battle of Mogadishu. This action was later dramatized in the film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;.

===21st century===

* British Army CoH Craig Harrison of the Household Cavalry successfully killed two Taliban machine gunners south of Musa Qala in Helmand Province in Afghanistan in November 2009 at a range of , using an L115A3 Long Range Rifle rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum. These were the longest recorded and confirmed sniper kills to that time. 
* Canadian Master Corporal Arron Perry, formerly of the PPCLI (Operation Anaconda, Afghanistan) – briefly held the record for the longest recorded and confirmed sniper kill at in 2002, eclipsing U.S. Marine Gunnery Sergeant Carlos Hathcock&#x27;s previous record established in 1967. Perry used a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) McMillan TAC-50 rifle. A few days later, a new record was achieved by his teammate during the same operation.
* Canadian Corporal Rob Furlong, formerly of the PPCLI (Operation Anaconda, Afghanistan) – achieved a recorded and confirmed sniper kill at in 2002 using a .50 caliber (12.7 mm) McMillan TAC-50 rifle.
* U.S. Navy Chief Chris Kyle of SEAL Team Three, during four deployments to Iraq between 2003 and 2009, had 255 kills, 160 of which are confirmed by the United States Department of Defense, making him the deadliest marksman in US military history. During the Second Battle of Fallujah alone, when U.S. Marines fought running battles in the streets with several thousand insurgents, he killed 40 enemy personnel. For his deadly record as a marksman during his deployment to Ramadi, the insurgents named him &#x27;Al-Shaitan Ramad&#x27; – the Devil of Rahmadi – and put a $20,000 bounty on his head. Kyle was honorably discharged in 2009, and on 2 February 2013, was murdered at a shooting range along with another victim in Texas by a Marine veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Subject of the movie &quot;American Sniper&quot;.
* U.S. Marine Corps Staff Sergeant Steve Reichert – Killed an Iraqi insurgent and possibly injured two more hiding behind a brick wall with a shot from 1 mile in Lutayfiyah, Iraq on 9 April 2004.

During the same engagement Reichert killed an Iraqi machine gunner pinning down a squad of Marines from a distance of .
* U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Jim Gilliland – Previously held the record for the longest recorded confirmed kill with a 7.62×51mm NATO rifle at with a M24, killing an Iraqi insurgent sniper in Ramadi, Iraq on 27 September 2005.
* U.S. Army SGT Christopher Dale Abbott: As part of a U.S. Army counter-IED team in Iraq in 2007–2008, Abbott recorded 22 confirmed kills with an M24 7.62×51mm rifle for a period of only 7 months before being injured and sent out of theater. He and his team were tasked with seeking out insurgents placing IEDs along frequently used supply routes.
* U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Timothy L. Kellner – , Kellner is still active as a sniper in the U.S. Army, with 78 confirmed kills during the Iraq War and 3 in Haiti.

* Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith VC MG of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment was awarded the Medal of Gallantry for his actions in 2006 during Operation Perth in the Chora Valley of Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan. In that action, patrol sniper Roberts-Smith prevented an outnumbered patrol from being overrun by anti-coalition militia with sniper fire. Subsequently, in early 2011, he became the second Australian to be awarded the Victoria Cross on Operation Slipper in Afghanistan.

<text>A sign is an object, quality, event, or entity whose presence or occurrence indicates the probable presence or occurrence of something else. A natural sign bears a causal relation to its object—for instance, thunder is a sign of storm, or medical symptoms a sign of disease. A conventional sign signifies by agreement, as a full stop signifies the end of a sentence; similarly the words and expressions of a language, as well as bodily gestures, can be regarded as signs, expressing particular meanings. The physical objects most commonly referred to as signs (notices, road signs, etc., collectively known as signage) generally inform or instruct using written text, symbols, pictures or a combination of these.
The philosophical study of signs and symbols is called semiotics; this includes the study of semiosis, which is the way in which signs (in the semiotic sense) operate.

==Nature==
Semiotics, epistemology, logic, and philosophy of language are concerned about the nature of signs, what they are and how they signify. The nature of signs and symbols and significations, their definition, elements, and types, is mainly established by Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. According to these classic sources, significance is a relationship between two sorts of things: signs and the kinds of things they signify (intend, express or mean), where one term necessarily causes something else to come to the mind. Distinguishing natural signs and conventional signs, the traditional theory of signs (Augustine) sets the following threefold partition of things:
all sorts of indications, evidences, symptoms, and physical signals, there are signs which are &quot;always&quot; signs (the entities of the mind as ideas and images, thoughts and feelings, constructs and intentions); and there are signs that &quot;have&quot; to get their signification (as linguistic entities and cultural symbols). So, while natural signs serve as the source of signification, the human mind is the agency through which signs signify naturally occurring things, such as objects, states, qualities, quantities, events, processes, or relationships. Human language and discourse, communication, philosophy, science, logic, mathematics, poetry, theology, and religion are only some of fields of human study and activity where grasping the nature of signs and symbols and patterns of signification may have a decisive value. Communication takes place without words but via the mind as a result of signs and symbols; They communicate/pass across/ messages to the human mind through their pictorial representation.

== Types ==
The word &quot;sign&quot; has a variety of meanings in English, including:
* Sun signs in astrology
* Sign or signing, in communication: communicating via hand gestures, such as in sign language.
* Gang signal
* Sign, in Tracking (hunting): also known as Spoor (animal); trace evidence left on the ground after passage.
* A signboard.
* A sign, in common use, is an that a previously observed event is about to occur again
* Sign, in divination and religion: an omen, an event or occurrence believed to foretell the future
* Sign, in ontology and spirituality: a coincidence or surprising event thought to reveal divine will; see synchronicity
* Sign (linguistics): a combination of a concept and a sound-image described by Ferdinand de Saussure
* In mathematics, the sign of a number tells whether it is positive or negative. Also, the sign of a permutation tells whether it is the product of an even or odd number of transpositions.
* Signedness, in computing, is the property that a representation of a number has one bit, the sign bit, which denotes whether the number is non-negative or negative. A number is called signed if it contains a sign bit, otherwise unsigned. See also signed number representation
* Sign, in biology: an indication of some living thing&#x27;s presence
* Medical sign, in medicine: objective evidence of the presence of a disease or disorder, as opposed to a symptom, which is subjective
* Sign (semiotics): the basic unit of meaning
* Information sign: a notice that instructs, advises, informs or warns people
* Traffic sign: a sign that instructs drivers; see also stop sign, speed limit sign, cross walk sign
* Sign, in a writing system: a basic unit. Similar terms which are more specific are character, letter or grapheme
* Commercial signage, including flashing signs, such as on a retail store, factory, or theatre
* Signature, in history: a handwritten depiction observed on a document to show authorship and will
* For marketing or advocacy purposes, a signage refers to the collective use of signs to convey a message.

== Christianity ==

St. Augustine was the first man who synthesized the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. For him a sign is a thing which is used to signify other things and to make them come to mind (&quot;De Doctrina Christiana&quot; (hereafter DDC) 1.2.2; 2.1.1). The most common signs are spoken and written words (DDC 1.2.2; 2.3.4-2.4.5). Although God cannot be fully expressible, Augustine gave emphasis to the possibility of God&#x27;s communication with humans by signs in Scripture (DDC 1.6.6). Augustine endorsed and developed the classical and Hellenistic theories of signs. Among the mainstream in the theories of signs, i.e., that of Aristotle and that of Stoics, the former theory filtered into the works of Cicero (106-43 BC, &quot;De inventione rhetorica&quot; 1.30.47-48) and Quintilian (circa 35–100, &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; 5.9.9-10), which regarded the sign as an instrument of inference. In his commentary on Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De Interpretatione&quot;, Ammonius said, &quot;according to the division of the philosopher Theophrastus, the relation of speech is twofold, first in regard to the audience, to which speech signifies something, and secondly in regard to the things about which the speaker intends to persuade the audience.&quot; If we match DDC with this division, the first part belongs to DDC Book IV and the second part to DDC Books I-III. Augustine, although influenced by these theories, advanced his own theological theory of signs, with whose help one can infer the mind of God from the events and words of Scripture. 

Books II and III of DDC enumerate all kinds of signs and explain how to interpret them. Signs are divided into natural (&quot;naturalia&quot;) and conventional (&quot;data&quot;); the latter is divided into animal (&quot;bestiae&quot;) and human (&quot;homines&quot;); the latter is divided into non-words (&quot;cetera&quot;) and words (&quot;verba&quot;); the latter is divided into spoken words (&quot;voces&quot;) and written words (&quot;litterae&quot;); the latter is divided into unknown signs (&quot;signa ignota&quot;) and ambiguous signs (&quot;signa ambigua&quot;); both the former and the latter are divided respectively into particular signs (&quot;signa propria&quot;) and figurative signs (&quot;signa translata&quot;), among which the unknown figurative signs belong to the pagans.
In addition to exegetical knowledge (Quintilian, &quot;Institutio Oratoria&quot; 1.4.1-3 and 1.8.1-21) which follows the order of reading (&quot;lectio&quot;), textual criticism (&quot;emendatio&quot;), explanation (&quot;enarratio&quot;), and judgment (&quot;iudicium&quot;), one needs to know the original language (Hebrew and Greek) and broad background information on Scripture (DDC 2.9.14-2.40.60).

Augustine&#x27;s understanding of signs includes several hermeneutical presuppositions as important factors. First, the interpreter should proceed with humility, because only a humble person can grasp the truth of Scripture (DDC 2.41.62). Second, the interpreter must have a spirit of active inquiry and should not hesitate to learn and use pagan education for the purpose of leading to Christian learning, because all truth is God&#x27;s truth (DDC 2.40.60-2.42.63). Third, the heart of interpreter should be founded, rooted, and built up in love which is the final goal of the entire Scriptures (DDC 2.42.63).

The sign does not function as its own goal, but its purpose lies in its role as a signification (&quot;res significans&quot;, DDC 3.9.13). God gave signs as a means to reveal himself; Christians need to exercise hermeneutical principles in order to understand that divine revelation. Even if the Scriptural text is obscure, it has meaningful benefits. For the obscure text prevents us from falling into pride, triggers our intelligence (DDC 2.6.7), tempers our faith in the history of revelation (DDC 3.8.12), and refines our mind to be suitable to the holy mysteries (DDC 4.8.22). When interpreting signs, the literal meaning should first be sought, and then the figurative meaning (DDC 3.10.14-3.23.33). Augustine suggests the hermeneutical principle that the obscure Scriptural verse is interpreted with the help of plain and simple verses, which formed the doctrine of &quot;scriptura scripturae interpres&quot; (Scripture is the Interpreter of Scripture) in the Reformation Era. Moreover, he introduces the seven rules of Tyconius the Donatist to interpret the obscure meaning of the Bible, which demonstrates his understanding that all truth belongs to God (DDC 3.3.42-3.37.56). In order to apply Augustine&#x27;s hermeneutics of the sign appropriately in modern times, every division of theology must be involved and interdisciplinary approaches must be taken.

<text>The Standard Alphabet is a Latin-script alphabet developed by Karl Richard Lepsius. Lepsius initially used it to transcribe Egyptian hieroglyphs in his &quot;Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien&quot; and extended it to write African languages, published in 1853, 1854 and 1855, and in a revised edition in 1863. The alphabet was comprehensive but was not used much as it contained a lot of diacritic marks and was difficult to read and typeset at that time. It was, however, influential in later projects such as Ellis&#x27;s Paleotype, and diacritics such as the acute accent for palatalization, under-dot for retroflex, underline for Arabic emphatics, and the click letters continue in modern use.

==Vowels==
Vowel length is indicated by a macron (&quot;ā&quot;) or a breve (&quot;ă&quot;) for long and short vowels, respectively. Open vowels are marked by a line under the letter (&quot;e̱&quot;), while a dot below the letter makes it a close vowel (&quot;ẹ&quot;). Rounded front vowels are written with an umlaut (&quot;ö&quot; and &quot;ü&quot; ), either on top or below, when the space above the letter is needed for vowel length marks (thus &quot;ṳ̄&quot; or &quot;ṳ̆&quot;). Unrounded back vowels are indicated by a &#x27;hook&#x27; (ogonek) on &quot;ę&quot; or &quot;į&quot;. Central vowels may be written as one of these series, or as reduced vowels.

As in the International Phonetic Alphabet, nasal vowels get a tilde (&quot;ã&quot;).

A small circle below a letter is used to mark both the schwa (&quot;e̥&quot;, also &quot;ḁ&quot; etc. for other reduced vowels) and syllabic consonants (&quot;r̥&quot; or &quot;l̥&quot;, for instance).

Diphthongs do not receive any special marking, they are simply juxtaposed (&quot;ai&quot; ). A short sign can be used to distinguish which element of the diphthong is the on- or off-glide (&quot;uĭ, ŭi&quot;) Vowels in hiatus can be indicated with a diaeresis when necessary (&quot;aï&quot; ).

Other vowels are &quot;a&quot; with a subscript &quot;e&quot; for ; &quot;a&quot; with a subscript &quot;o&quot; for , and &quot;o̩&quot; for or maybe . The English syllabic is &quot;ṙ̥&quot;.

Word stress is marked with an acute accent on a long vowel (&quot;á&quot;) and with a grave accent on a short vowel (&quot;à&quot;).

Klemp (p. 56*-58*) interprets the values of Lepsius&#x27;s vowels as follows:

==Consonants==
The Lepsius letters without predictable diacritics are as follows:

Other consonant sounds may be derived from these. For example, palatal and palatalized consonants are marked with an acute accent: &quot;ḱ&quot; , &quot;ǵ&quot; , &quot;ń&quot; , &quot;χ́&quot; , &quot;š́&quot; , &quot;γ́&quot; , &quot;ž́&quot; , &quot;ĺ&quot; , &quot;‘ĺ&quot; , &quot;ı́&quot; , &quot;ṕ&quot; , etc. These can also be written &quot;ky, py&quot; etc.

Labialized velars are written with an over-dot: &quot;ġ&quot; , &quot;n̈&quot; , etc. (A dot on a non-velar letter, as in &quot;ṅ&quot; and &quot;ṙ&quot; in the table above, indicates a guttural articulation.)

Retroflex consonants are marked with an under-dot: &quot;ṭ&quot; , &quot;ḍ&quot; , &quot;ṇ&quot; , &quot;ṣ̌&quot; , &quot;ẓ̌&quot; , &quot;ṛ&quot; , &quot;ḷ&quot; , and &quot;ı̣&quot; .

The Semitic &quot;emphatic&quot; consonants are marked with an underline: &quot;ṯ&quot; , &quot;ḏ&quot; , &quot;s̱&quot; , &quot;ẕ&quot; , &quot;δ̱&quot; , &quot;ḻ&quot; .

Aspiration is typically marked by &quot;h&quot;: &quot;kh&quot; , but a turned apostrophe (Greek &quot;spiritus asper&quot;) is also used: &quot;k̒&quot; , &quot;ģ&quot; . Either convention may be used for voiceless sonorants: &quot;m̒&quot; , &quot;‘l&quot; .

Affricates are generally written as sequences, e.g. &quot;tš&quot; for . But the single letters &quot;č&quot; , &quot;ǰ&quot; , &quot;c̀&quot; , &quot;j̀&quot; , &quot;ț&quot; , and &quot;d̦&quot; are also used.

Implosives are written with a macron: &quot;b̄&quot; , &quot;d̄&quot; , &quot;j̄&quot; , &quot;ḡ&quot; . As with vowels, long (geminate) consonants may also be written with a macron, so this transcription can be ambiguous.

Lepsius typically characterized ejective consonants as tenuis, as they are completely unaspirated, and wrote them with the Greek &quot;spiritus lenis&quot; (&quot;p’&quot;, &quot;t’&quot;, etc.), which may be the source of the modern convention for ejectives in the IPA. However, when his sources made it clear that there was some activity in the throat, he transcribed them as emphatics.

When transcribing consonant letters which are pronounced the same but are etymologically distinct, as in Armenian, diacritics from the original alphabet or roman transliteration may be carried over. Similarly, unique sounds such as Czech &quot;ř&quot; may be carried over into Lepsius transcription. Lepsius used a diacritic &quot;r&quot; under &quot;t᷊&quot; and &quot;d᷊&quot; for some poorly described sounds in Dravidian languages.

Standard capitalization is used. For example, when written in all caps, &quot;γ&quot; becomes &quot;Γ&quot; (as in &quot;AFΓAN&quot; &quot;Afghan&quot;).

==Tones==
Tones are marked with an acute and grave accents (backticks) to the right and near the top or the bottom of the corresponding vowel. The diacritic may be underlined for a lower pitch, distinguishing in all eight possible tones.

Tone is not written directly, but rather needs to be established separately for each language. For example, the acute accent may indicate a high tone, a rising tone, or, in the case of Chinese, any tone called &quot;rising&quot; (上) for historical reasons.

Low rising and falling tones can be distinguished from high rising and falling tones by underlining the accent mark: . The underline also transcribes the Chinese &quot;yin&quot; tones, under the mistaken impression that these tones are actually lower. Two additional tone marks, without any defined phonetic value, are used for Chinese: &quot;level&quot; maˏ (平) and checked maˎ (入); these may also be underlined.

<doc id="28132" wikidata="Q7508375" url="?curid=28132" title="Sidehill gouger">
<text>In American folklore, a Sidehill gouger is a fearsome critter adapted to living on hillsides by having legs on one side of their body shorter than the legs on the opposite side, having evolved to resemble any form of mammals such as pangolins, goats, humans, and bears. This peculiarity allows them to walk on steep hillsides, although only in one direction; when lured or chased into the plain, they are trapped in an endless circular path. Some claim these creatures play a large role in, and in some cases are responsible for, the creation of hoodoos. The creature is variously known as the Sidehill Dodger, Sidehill Hoofer, Side-hill Gazink, Sidehill Ousel, Sidehill Loper, Sidehill Galoot, Sidehill Gouchie, Gyascutus, Sidewinder, Wampus, Boofum, Gudaphro, Hunkus, Rickaboo Racker, Prock, Gwinter, or Cutter Cuss.

Sidehill gougers are mammals who dwell in hillside burrows, and are occasionally depicted as laying eggs. There are usually 6 to 8 pups to a litter. Since the gouger is footed for hillsides, it cannot stand up on level ground. If by accident a gouger falls from a hill, it can easily be captured or starve to death. When a clockwise gouger meets a counter-clockwise gouger, they have to fight to the death since they can only go in one direction. The formation of terracettes has been attributed to gouger activity.

Gougers are said to have migrated to the west from New England, a feat accomplished by a pair of gougers who clung to each other in a fashion comparable to &quot;a pair of drunks going home from town with their longer legs on the outer sides&quot;. 
A Vermont variation is known as the Wampahoofus. It was reported that farmers crossbreed them with their cows so they could graze easily on mountain sides.

Frank C. Whitmore and Nicholas Hotton, in their joint tongue-in-cheek response to an article in &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot;, expounded the taxonomy of sidehill gougers (&quot;Membriinequales declivitous&quot;), noting in particular &quot;the sidehill dodger, which inhabits the Driftless Area of Wisconsin; the dextrosinistral limb ratio approaches unity although the metapodials on the downhill side are noticeably stouter.&quot; A special award, the Order of the Sidehill Gouger, is awarded to worthy members for hard and long standing volunteer efforts by the Alberta Group of the Royal Canadian Air Force Association.

==In popular culture==
* &quot;Deadhead Mile&quot; (2016) by K.N. Johnson (included in the anthology &quot;A Journey of Words&quot;) suggest gougers to be the culprits behind ski trails with dead ends.
* &quot;Sidehill Gouger&quot; (2009) by Canned Games is a puzzle game on Xbox Live for Xbox 360, featuring a young boy hunting the sidehill gougers of his grandfather&#x27;s stories.
* Storyteller John Dashney featured the sidehill gouger (referred to as the &quot;sidehill wowser&quot;) in a story supposedly about his grandfather, who specialized in hunting the creatures to the point of stretching his hounds&#x27; legs to help them chase the creatures better along hillsides. The story details an encounter in which his grandfather stumbled across two gougers at a time, resulting in a harrowing spiral chase up a hill until the opposite-oriented creatures crashed into one another, solving his problem.

<doc id="28134" wikidata="Q169789" url="?curid=28134" title="Second Vatican Council">
<text>The Second Ecumenical Council of the Vatican, commonly known as the or , was the 21st and most recent ecumenical council of the Catholic Church. The council met in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City for four periods (or sessions), each lasting between 8 and 12 weeks, in the autumn of each of the four years 1962 to 1965, although it had been anticipated initially that the work of the Council would have been complete after three sessions.

Pope John XXIII called the council because he felt the Church needed &quot;updating&quot; (in Italian: &quot;aggiornamento&quot;). In order to better connect with people in an increasingly secularized world, some of the Church&#x27;s practices needed to be improved and presented in a more understandable and relevant way. Support for &quot;aggiornamento&quot; won out over resistance to change, and as a result the sixteen magisterial documents produced by the council proposed significant developments in doctrine and practice, notably

* &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, the &quot;Dogmatic Constitution on the Church&quot; on &quot;the universal call to holiness&quot;
** &quot;Apostolicam actuositatem&quot;, a decree on &quot;The Apostolate of the Laity&quot;
** &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot;, a decree &quot;On Eastern Catholic Churches&quot;
* &quot;Dei verbum&quot;, the &quot;Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation&quot; emphasized the study of scripture as &quot;the soul of theology&quot;
* &quot;Sacrosanctum concilium&quot;, the &quot;Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy&quot; to restore &quot;the full and active participation by all the people&quot;
* &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot;, the &quot;Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World&quot;, concerned the promotion of peace, the gift of self, and the Church&#x27;s mission to non-Catholics
** &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot;, a declaration on religious freedom
** &quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot;, a decree on Christian ecumenism 
** &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;, a declaration about non-Christian religions 

The council had a significant impact on the Church due to the scope and variety of issues it addressed. Some of the most notable changes were in performance of the Mass, including that vernacular languages could be authorized as well as Latin.

== Background ==

=== Biblical movement ===
Pope Pius XII&#x27;s 1943 encyclical gave a renewed impetus to Catholic Bible studies and encouraged the production of new Bible translations from the original languages. This led to a pastoral attempt to get ordinary Catholics to re-discover the Bible, to read it, to make it a source of their spiritual life. This found a response in very limited circles. By 1960, the movement was still progressing slowly.

=== and ===
By the 1930s, mainstream theology based on neo-scholasticism and papal encyclicals was being rejected by some theologians as dry and uninspiring. Thus was the movement, called , the return to the sources: basing theology directly on the Bible and the Church Fathers. Some theologians also began to discuss new topics, such as the history of theology, the theology of work, ecumenism, the theology of the laity, and the theology of &quot;earthly realities&quot;.

The writings, whose new style came to be called (&#x27;the new theology&#x27;), attracted Rome&#x27;s attention, and in 1950 Pius XII published , an encyclical &quot;concerning some false opinions threatening to undermine the foundations of Catholic doctrine&quot;. Without citing specific individuals, he criticized those who advocated new schools of theology. It was generally understood that the encyclical was directly against the as well as developments in ecumenism and Bible studies. Some works were placed on the Index of Prohibited Books, and some of the authors were forbidden to teach or to publish. Those who suffered most were Henri de Lubac and Yves Congar , who were unable to teach or publish until the death of Pius XII in 1958. By the early 1960s, other theologians under suspicion included Karl Rahner and the young Hans Küng.

In addition, there was the unfinished business of the First Vatican Council (1869–70). When it had been cut short by the Italian Army&#x27;s entry into Rome at the end of Italian unification, the only topics that had been completed were the theology of the papacy and the relationship of faith and reason, while the theology of the episcopate and of the laity were left unaddressed. The task of the Second Vatican Council in continuing and completing the work of the first was noted by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical letter (1964).

At the same time, the world&#x27;s bishops were challenged by political, social, economic, and technological change. Some of those bishops were seeking new ways of addressing those challenges.

== Beginnings ==
=== Announcement and expectations ===
John XXIII gave notice of his intention to convene an ecumenical council on 25 January 1959, less than three months after his election in October 1958. His announcement in the chapter hall of the Benedictine monastery attached to the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome came as a surprise to the cardinals present.

He had tested the idea only ten days before with one of them, his Cardinal Secretary of State Domenico Tardini, who gave enthusiastic support to the idea. Although the pope later said the idea came to him in a flash in his conversation with Tardini, two cardinals had earlier attempted to interest him in the idea. They were two of the most conservative, Ernesto Ruffini and Alfredo Ottaviani, who had already in 1948 proposed the idea to Pius XII and who put it before John XXIII on 27 October 1958.

Over the course of the next 3 years, the Pope would make many statements describing the results he expected from the council. They formed something like 3 concentric circles:
#For the Catholic Church, he expected a renewal which he described variously as a &quot;new Pentecost&quot;, a &quot;new Springtime&quot;, a new &quot;blossoming&quot;, &quot;a rejuvenation with greater vigour of the Body of Christ that is the Church&quot;. This would be achieved by the &quot;updating&quot; (&quot;aggiornamento&quot;) or &quot;adapting&quot; of Church practices to new circumstances and a restatement of her beliefs in a way that would connect with modern man.
#Within the wider Christian family, he sought progress toward reunion of all Christians.
#For the whole human family, he expected the council to contribute toward resolving major social and economic problems, such as war, hunger, underdevelopment.

Two less solemn statements are attributed to John XXIII about the purpose of the council. One is about opening the windows of the Church to let in some fresh air; the other about shaking off the imperial dust accumulated on the throne of St. Peter. The source for the second statement is Cardinal Léger of Montréal, as reported by Congar. The first statement has been repeated so many times as to be extremely difficult to verify.

Once the officials of the Curia had recovered from their shock at the Pope&#x27;s announcement of a Council, they realized that it could be the culmination of the Church&#x27;s program of resistance to Protestantism, the Enlightenment and all the other perceived errors of the modern world. It was also seen as an opportunity to give the stamp of conciliar infallibility to the teachings of the most recent popes and to the Curia&#x27;s vision of the role of the Church in the modern world, provided the Pope could be convinced to forget about .

On the other side were those theologians and bishops who had been working towards a new way of doing things, some of whom had been silenced and humiliated by the Curia in the 1940s and 1950s. For them, the council came as a &quot;divine surprise&quot;, the opportunity to convince the bishops of the world to turn away from a fortress-like defensive attitude to the modern world and set off in a new direction towards a renewed theology of the Church and of the laity, ecumenism and the reform of the liturgy.

The council was officially summoned by the apostolic constitution on 25 December 1961.

=== Preparation ===

Preparation for the council took over three years, from the summer of 1959 to the autumn of 1962.

The first year was known officially as the &quot;antepreparatory period&quot;. On 17 May 1959, Pope John appointed an Antepreparatory Commission to conduct a vast consultation of the Catholic world concerning topics to be examined at the council. Three groups of people were consulted: the bishops of the world, the Catholic universities and faculties of theology, and the departments of the Curia. By the following summer, 2,049 individuals and institutions had replied with 9,438 individual &quot;vota&quot; (&quot;wishes&quot;). Some were typical of past ways of doing things, asking for new dogmatic definitions or condemnations of errors. Others were in the spirit of &quot;aggiornamento&quot;, asking for reforms and new ways of doing things.

The next two years (known officially as the &quot;preparatory period&quot;) were occupied with preparing the drafts, called &quot;schemas&quot;, that would be submitted to the bishops for discussion at the council. On 5 June 1960, ten Preparatory Commissions were created, to which a total of 871 bishops and experts were appointed. Each preparatory commission had the same area of responsibility as one of the main departments of the Curia and was chaired by the cardinal who headed that department. From the 9,438 proposals, a list of topics was created, and these topics were parcelled out to these commissions according to their area of competence.

Some commissions prepared a separate schema for each topic they were asked to treat, others a single schema encompassing all the topics they were handed. These were the preparatory commissions and the number of schemas they prepared:

Two secretariats – one the offshoot of an existing Vatican office, the other a new body – also had a part in drafting schemas:

The total number of schemas was 70. As most of these preparatory bodies were predominantly conservative, the schemas they produced showed only modest signs of updating. The schemas drafted by the preparatory commission for theology, dominated by officials of the Holy Office (the curial department for theological orthodoxy) showed no signs of &quot;aggiornamento&quot; at all. The two notable exceptions were the preparatory commission for liturgy and the Secretariat for Christian unity, whose schemas were very much in the spirit of renewal.

In addition to these specialist commissions and secretariats, there was a Central Preparatory Commission, to which all the schemas had to be submitted for final approval. It was a large body of 108 members from 57 countries, including two thirds of the cardinals. As a result of its work, 22 schemas were eliminated from the conciliar agenda, mainly because they could be dealt with during a planned revision of the 1917 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; after the council, and a number of schemas were consolidated and merged, with the result that the total number of schemas was whittled down from 70 to 22.

=== Organization ===

Paragraph numbers in this section refer to the Council Regulations published in the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Appropinquante concilio&quot;, of 6 August 1962.

Council Fathers (§1). All the bishops of the world, as well as the heads of the main religious orders of men, were entitled to be &quot;Council Fathers&quot;, that is, full participants with the right to speak and vote. Their number was about 2,900, though some 500 of them would be unable to attend, either for reasons of health or old age, or because the Communist authorities of their country would not let them travel. The Council Fathers in attendance represented 79 countries: 38% were from Europe, 31% from the Americas, 20% from Asia &amp; Oceania, and 10% from Africa. (At Vatican I a century earlier there were 737 Council Fathers, mostly from Europe). At Vatican II, some 250 bishops were native-born Asians and Africans, whereas at Vatican I, there were none at all.

General Congregations (§3, 20, 33, 38–39, 52–63). The Council Fathers met in daily sittings – known as General Congregations – to discuss the schemas and vote on them. These sittings took place in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica every morning until 12:30 Monday to Saturday (except Thursday). The average daily attendance was about 2,200. Stands with tiers of seats for all the Council Fathers had been built on both sides of the central nave of St. Peter&#x27;s. During the first session, a council of presidents, of 10 cardinals, was responsible for presiding over the general assemblies, its members taking turns chairing each day&#x27;s sitting (§4). During the later sessions, this task belonged to a council of 4 Moderators.

All votes required a two-thirds majority. For each schema, after a preliminary discussion there was a vote whether it was considered acceptable in principle, or rejected. If acceptable, debate continued with votes on individual chapters and paragraphs. Bishops could submit amendments, which were then written into the schema if they were requested by many bishops. Votes continued in this way until wide agreement was reached, after which there was a final vote on a document. This was followed some days later by a public session where the Pope promulgated the document as the official teaching of the council, following another, ceremonial, vote of the Council Fathers. There was an unwritten rule that, in order to be considered official Church teaching, a document had to receive an overwhelming majority of votes, somewhere in the area of 90%. This led to many compromises, as well as formulations that were broad enough to be acceptable by people on either side of an issue.

All General Congregations were closed to the public. Council Fathers were under an obligation not to reveal anything that went on in the daily sittings (§26). Secrecy soon broke down, and much information about the daily General Congregations was leaked to the press.

The Pope did not attend General Congregations, but followed the deliberations on closed-circuit television.

Public Sessions (§2, 44–51). These were similar to General Congregations, except that they were open to the press and television, and the Pope was present. There were 10 public sessions in the course of the council: the opening day of each of the council&#x27;s four periods, 5 days when the Pope promulgated Council documents, and the final day of the council.

Commissions (§5–6, 64–70). Much of the detailed work of the council was done in these commissions. Like the preparatory commissions during the preparatory period, they were 10 in number, each covering the same area of Church life as a particular curial department and chaired by the cardinal who headed that department: 
* Commission on the Doctrine of Faith and Morals: president Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani;
* Commission on Bishops and the Governance of Dioceses: president Cardinal Paolo Marella;
* Commission on the Eastern Churches: president Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani;
* Commission on the Discipline of the Sacraments: president Cardinal Benedetto Aloisi Masella;
* Commission for the Discipline of the Clergy and the Christian People: president Cardinal Pietro Ciriaci;
* Commission for Religious: president Cardinal Ildebrando Antoniutti;
* Commission on the Sacred Liturgy: president Cardinal Arcadio Larraona;
* Commission for the Missions: president Cardinal Gregorio Pietro XV Agagianian;
* Commission on Seminaries, Studies, and Catholic Education: president Cardinal Giuseppe Pizzardo;
* Commission for the Lay Apostolate and for the Media: president Cardinal Fernando Cento.
Each commission included 25 Council Fathers (16 elected by the council and 9 appointed by the Pope) as well as consultors (official &quot;periti&quot; appointed by the pope). In addition, the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity, appointed during the preparatory period, continued to exist under its president Cardinal Augustin Bea throughout the 4 years of the council, with the same powers as a commission. The commissions were tasked with revising the schemas as Council Fathers submitted amendments. They met in the afternoons or evenings. Procedure was more informal than in the general assemblies: there was spontaneous debate, sometimes heated, and Latin was not the only language used. Like the General Congregations, they were closed to the public and subject to the same rules of secrecy.

Official &quot;Periti&quot; (§9–10). These experts in theology, canon law and other areas were appointed by the Pope to advise the Council Fathers, and were assigned as consultors to the commissions, where they were an important part in re-writing the council documents. At the beginning of the council, there were 224 official &quot;periti,&quot; but their number would eventually rise to 480. They could attend the debates in the General Congregations, but could not speak. The theologians who had been silenced during the 1940s and 1950s, such as Yves Congar and Henri de Lubac, and some theologians who were under suspicion in Roman circles at the beginning of the 1960s, such as Karl Rahner and Hans Küng, were appointed &quot;periti&quot; because of their expertise. Their appointment served to vindicate their ideas and gave them a platform from which they could work to further their views.

Private &quot;Periti&quot; (§11). Each bishop was allowed to bring along a personal theological adviser of his choice. Known as &quot;private &quot;periti&quot;&quot;, they were not official Council participants and could not attend General Congregations or commission meetings. But like the official &quot;periti&quot;, they gave informal teachings to groups of bishops, bringing them up to date on developments in their particular area of expertise. Karl Rahner, Joseph Ratzinger and Hans Küng first went to the council as some bishop&#x27;s personal theologian, and were later appointed official &quot;periti&quot;. Some notable theologians, such as Edward Schillebeeckx, remained private &quot;periti&quot; for the whole duration of the council.

Observers (§18) . An important innovation was the invitation by Pope John to Orthodox and Protestant Churches to send observers to the council. Eventually 21 denominations or bodies such as the World Council of Churches were represented. The observers were entitled to sit in on all general assemblies (but not the commissions) and they mingled with the Council Fathers during the breaks and let them know their reactions to speeches or to schemas. Pope Paul VI welcomed their participation &quot;with gratitude and respect&quot;. Their presence helped to break down centuries of mistrust.

Lay auditors. While not provided for in the Official Regulations, a small number of lay people were invited to attend as &quot;auditors&quot; beginning with the Second Session. While not allowed to take part in debate, a few of them were asked to address the council about their concerns as lay people. The first auditors were all male, but beginning with the third session, a number of women were also appointed.

=== Main caucuses ===
In the very first weeks of the council proceedings, it became clear to the participants that there were two &quot;tendencies&quot; among the Council Fathers, those who were supporters of &quot;aggiornamento&quot; and renewal, and those who were not. The two tendencies had already appeared in the deliberations of the Central Preparatory Commission before the opening of the council.

In addition to popes John XXIII and Paul VI, these were the prominent contributors at the council:

Prominent Conservative Bishops at the Council

* Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani: secretary of the Holy Office
* Cardinal Michael Browne : professor at the Angelicum and consultor for the Holy Office.
* Cardinal Giuseppe Siri: archbishop of Genoa, president of the Italian Bishops&#x27; Conference.
* Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini: archbishop of Palermo.
* Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre : superior-general of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit; at the council, president of the &quot;Coetus Internationalis Patrum&quot; (&quot;International Group of Fathers&quot;), the bloc of conservative Council Fathers

Prominent Reformist Bishops at the Council

* Cardinal Augustin Bea : president of the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity
* Patriarch Maximos IV Sayegh: patriarch of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church
* Cardinal Achille Liénart: bishop of Lille (France), the senior French bishop
* Cardinal Josef Frings: archbishop of Cologne (Germany), the senior German bishop
* Cardinal Bernardus Alfrink: archbishop of Utrecht (Netherlands), the senior Dutch bishop
* Cardinal Leo Jozef Suenens: archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels (Belgium), the senior Belgian bishop
* Cardinal Franz König, archbishop of Vienna (Austria), the senior Austrian bishop
* Cardinal Giacomo Lercaro: archbishop of Bologna (Italy)
* Cardinal Paul-Émile Léger: archbishop of Montreal (Canada)
* Cardinal Julius Döpfner: archbishop of Munich and Freising (Germany)

== Chronology of the council ==

=== First period: 11 October – 8 December 1962===

==== Opening day ====

John XXIII opened the council on 11 October 1962 in a public session at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica and delivered his opening address &quot;Gaudet Mater Ecclesia&quot; (&quot;Mother Church Rejoices&quot;) before the Council Fathers and representatives of 86 governments or international groups. He criticized the &quot;prophets of doom who are always forecasting disaster&quot; for the church or world. He spoke of the advantage of separation of Church and state but also the challenge to integrate faith with public life.

What is needed at the present time is a new enthusiasm, a new joy and serenity of mind in the unreserved acceptance by all of the entire Christian faith, without forfeiting that accuracy and precision in its presentation which characterized the proceedings of the Council of Trent and the First Vatican Council. What is needed, and what everyone imbued with a truly Christian, Catholic and apostolic spirit craves today, is that this doctrine shall be more widely known, more deeply understood, and more penetrating in its effects on men&#x27;s moral lives. What is needed is that this certain and immutable doctrine, to which the faithful owe obedience, be studied afresh and reformulated in contemporary terms. For this deposit of faith, or truths which are contained in our time-honored teaching is one thing; the manner in which these truths are set forth (with their meaning preserved intact) is something else.

==== Commissions ====
The first working session of the council was on 13 October 1962. That day&#x27;s agenda included the election of members of the 10 conciliar commissions. Each was to have 16 members elected by the Council Fathers and 8 – later 9 – members appointed by the Pope. Most bishops knew very few bishops other than those from their own country, and so did not know whom to vote for. They had been provided with a list of the bishops who had served on the preparatory commissions, as if to suggest that they elect the same people to the conciliar commissions, with the result that Curial forces would dominate the conciliar commissions as they had dominated the preparatory commissions. As the voting was about to begin, Cardinal Liénart, the senior French bishop, rose and proposed that the election be delayed for a few days to allow each national group of bishops to meet and draw up a list of its own members who might be suitable candidates. Cardinal Frings, the senior German bishop, rose to second the motion. There was loud applause and the motion was declared carried. That day&#x27;s sitting was adjourned after only 15 minutes.

For the next few days, Council Fathers met in national groups and drew up lists of candidates. The bishops from the 5 European countries (France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Austria) that spearheaded the renewal movement decided to create a single list, to which a number of renewal-minded bishops from other countries were added, for a total of 109 names. The election took place on 16 October. It brought in new blood: 79 of these 109 were elected to a commission seat and 50% of the members of the very important doctrinal commission were among these 79. In addition 43% of the newly elected commission members had not been on any preparatory commission. This was a first success for renewal.

==== Liturgy schema ====
On 22 October, the first schema to be discussed was the one from the very reform-minded preparatory commission for liturgy. It had 8 chapters:

:1. General Principles
:2. The Eucharistic Mystery [i.e. the Mass]
:3. Sacraments and sacramentals
:4. The Divine Office [i.e. the Liturgy of the Hours]
:5. The Liturgical Year
:6. Liturgical Furnishings
:7. Sacred Music
:8. Sacred Art

It proposed many reforms, including active participation of the congregation, communal singing, a partial replacement of Latin by vernacular languages, communion under both kinds, concelebration, adaptation of liturgy to local cultures and a modest decentralization of liturgical authority to national episcopal conferences. The conservatives objected to all these proposals, especially to the downgrading of Latin. Debate dragged on for 15 days, before the vote was taken on whether the schema was acceptable in principle. To everyone&#x27;s surprise, only 46 (out of 2,215) voted against. A second win for renewal. The schema was now returned to the liturgy commission to deal with many proposed amendments.

==== Schema on revelation ====
This schema from the preparatory theological commission took the conservative position on all questions currently being discussed by theologians. Reformers were particularly opposed to two claims: that there were revealed truths in Tradition that were not contained in Scripture and that every assertion in the Bible was free of error. The debate lasted six days. The dramatic vote on acceptance in principle came on 20 November. The question was phrased in terms of rejection: Should the schema be rejected? Yes: 1,360. No: 822. This was 102 votes short of the two-thirds majority required by Council regulations, and so the council would have to continue discussing a schema that 62% of the participants rejected. Resolution of the impasse came the next day (21 November): Pope John announced the schema would be revised by a special joint commission made up of members of the Doctrinal Commission (representing the conservative tendency) and the Secretariat for Christian Unity (representing the renewal tendency). A third victory for renewal and a crucial turning point at the council.

==== Schema on the modern means of communication ====
This innocuous schema could be boiled down to two propositions that had been said many times before: the Church must use the media to further its mission, and people must be protected against immorality and other dangers presented by the media. There was little interest in pursuing the discussion. On 27 November, the council decided the schema should contain only essential principles, leaving detailed practical matters to be dealt with after the council. The schema was accepted in principle and returned to its commission to be abridged.

==== Schema on Unity with the Eastern Orthodox ====
This schema, drafted by the preparatory commission on the Eastern Churches, was one of three texts that had been prepared on ecumenism. Conservatives thought the schema downplayed the differences between Catholics and Orthodox, while reformers complained it conceived of unity as a return of the Orthodox to the Catholic Church. The Council Fathers avoided voting on the schema at this point, and simply ordered that the schema be merged with the other two documents on Christian unity.

==== Schema on the Church ====
On 1 December, discussion began on the schema everyone was waiting for, that on the Church. There was only one week left before the scheduled end of the First Session. The schema embodied the legalistic view of the Church to be found in current theology manuals. Some important claims: the Church of Christ is identical with the Roman Catholic Church; bishops have no authority over the universal Church except by participation in the universal authority of the pope; talk of a priesthood of the faithful is metaphorical since only clerics are priests &quot;properly so called&quot;. The criticism of the reformers was unrelenting. Karl Rahner and Edward Schillebeeckx wrote detailed criticisms that were circulated among the Council Fathers. Given the renewal tendency manifested in the votes on earlier schemas, the schema on the Church was quite possibly headed for defeat. The day before the scheduled vote on acceptance in principle, Pope John intervened to say there were 2 problems with the schemas so far: too much material and not enough &quot;aggiornamento&quot;. So he was appointing a special commission to supervise the rewriting of all the schemas in order to reduce the amount of material and to better reflect the vision he had outlined in his opening address.

==== End of the First Period ====
So the First Session ended on 8 December, having made little progress with the schemas: only 5 of the 22 had been examined and none had received final approval. Although the Council&#x27;s &quot;procedural slowness&quot; was recognised, it also became clear, to most people&#x27;s surprise, that a majority of participants were in favour of some degree of renewal. The prediction of curialists that the bishops would readily approve all of the schemas and that the council would be over in a matter of weeks was quite mistaken. And as a result, the work of the preparatory commissions would have to be redone in order to better reflect the spirit of renewal the pope had been expecting.

=== Interval between first and second periods ===

==== The Coordinating Commission and the Revision of the Schemas ====
At the end of the First Session, Pope John created a Coordinating Commission to supervise the conciliar commissions in the task of revising all the schemas in order to make them more open to &quot;aggiornamento&quot; and to reduce the amount of material. The commission&#x27;s 7 members included 2 curial cardinals (Cicognani, the secretary of state, and Confalonieri of the Consistorial congregation) and 5 diocesan bishops (cardinals Suenens of Mechelen-Brussels, Döpfner of Munich, Liénart of Lille, Spellman of New York and Urbani of Venice). In the course of the next few months, all of the schemas would be rewritten under the Coordinating Commission&#x27;s supervision. As a result, the number of schemas was reduced from 22 to 15, and they became more renewal-friendly, some of them very much so: &quot;By the time the Council resumed on September 29 [the Coordinating Commission] had accomplished a wonder. It had reduced the number of schema to a manageable size. It had extracted revised texts from almost every commission. [...] In a little more than eight months it had made Vatican II a viable assembly and imparted to it the essential shape by which we know it.&quot;

==== The death of John XXIII and the election of Paul VI ====

Pope John XXIII died of stomach cancer on 3 June 1963, and the council was suspended in accordance with Canon Law until the next pope decided whether or not it would continue. Two weeks later, 82 cardinals met in Rome for the conclave, and on 21 June Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini of Milan, a moderate reformer, was elected pope, taking the name Paul VI. The day after his election, Paul VI announced that the council would continue and that it would be his &quot;chief work&quot;.

==== Reorganization ====
Before the end of the summer, Paul VI decided to reorganize some of the structures of the council. The Coordinating Commission, originally intended to be temporary, was enlarged and made a permanent feature with oversight over the conciliar commissions. Four of its membersrenewal-minded Cardinals Suenens, Döpfner and Lercaro (of Bologna), and moderate curialist Cardinal Agagianianwere given the additional task of chairing the daily General Congregations (instead of the 10-member Council of Presidents) with the title of &quot;Moderators&quot;. Because they were members of the Coordinating Commission that supervised the other commissions and they also chaired the daily General Congregations, these four cardinals, three of whom were enthusiastic reformers, became the organizational linchpins of the council.

Before the beginning of the Second Period of the council, Pope Paul created a new category of Council participants: lay auditors, who sat in on General Congregations, though without the right to speak or vote. He also allowed more information about daily General Congregations to be provided to the press.

=== Second period: 29 September – 4 December 1963 ===

==== Opening ====
In his hour-long Opening Address, Pope Paul reiterated the importance of the council, of Pope John&#x27;s vision, of aggiornamento, and outlined what he considered to be the council&#x27;s four tasks:
* The Church must present the world with a statement of its self-understanding. 
* Aggiornamento must continue, not by breaking with tradition, but by removing what is defective.
* The Church must work towards unity among all Christians. Saying this, he turned to the non-Catholic observers and apologized for any injury the Catholic Church might have caused other Christians.
* The Church must engage in dialogue with the world: &quot;not to conquer but to serve, not to despise but to appreciate, not to condemn but to comfort and save&quot;.

Five schemas were on the agenda for the Second Period, as well as the two accepted in principle during the First Period: Liturgy and Means of Social Communication.

==== Schema on the Church ====
It was practically a new schema compared to the one discussed in the First Period. It now contained much more Biblical imagery than legal language (believers were now called the &quot;People of God&quot; rather than the &quot;subjects of the Church&quot;), and there were 4 chapters instead of 11:

:1. The Mystery of the Church
:2. The Hierarchical Structure of the Church 
:3. The People of God 
:4. The Universal Call to Holiness (an expansion of the former &quot;The States of Perfection&quot;)

After 2 days of debate, it was accepted in principle by a vote of 2,231 to 43.

Chapter 1: The Mystery of the Church

The most important issue in this chapter concerned the relation of the Mystical body of Christ to the Catholic Church and to other Christian denominations. Instead of speaking of membership in the Church, the schema spoke of being &quot;in communion with&quot; the Church: this allowed it to say that non-Catholic Christians were in &quot;imperfect communion&quot; with the Church of Christ. Many elements of sanctification are available outside the Church, and the Holy Spirit works for the sanctification of all the baptized.

Chapter 2: The Hierarchical Structure of the Church

The question of the relation of bishops to the Pope would be the great bone of contention of the Second Session. The traditional view was that bishops derived their authority to govern from the Pope and their authority was limited to their diocese except during an ecumenical Council. The schema proposed that bishops&#x27; authority derived from their ordination, and that all the bishops formed a &quot;College&quot; that, together with the Pope, had authority over the whole Church at all times, but especially during a General Council.

Conservatives argued that this diminished the Pope&#x27;s authority, and therefore went against Vatican I&#x27;s definition of the Pope&#x27;s primacy. The schema said the Church was founded on Peter and the apostles, but the conservatives responded that it was founded on Peter alone, and therefore collegiality – the collegial nature of Church authority – had no basis in Scripture.

Another topic of controversy in the chapter was the proposal that the diaconate be restored as a permanent ordained ministry, and especially the suggestion that it might be open to married men. The prospect of ordained ministers who were married shocked some conservatives.

The debate on Chapter 2 lasted from 4 to 15 October, as the same arguments were stated over and over again. Seeing that the debate was getting bogged down, the moderators met with the Pope to discuss the way forward. It was suggested to extract from the text a series of propositions and to have the Council Fathers vote on them so as to ascertain the &quot;mind of the Council&quot;. The Pope first accepted, then backed down when lobbied by conservatives, then agreed once again. The vote on 5 propositions took place on 30 October:
:1. Episcopal consecration is the highest degree of the sacrament of orders. Yes: 2,123. No: 34
:2. All legitimately consecrated bishops who are in communion with one another and with the Pope form a College of Bishops. Yes: 2,154. No: 104.
:3. This College of Bishops is the successor of the College of the Apostles and, in communion with the Pope, enjoys full and supreme power over the universal Church. Yes: 2,148. No: 336.
:4. The authority of the College of Bishops (united with the Pope) is of divine origin [and not by delegation from the Pope]. Yes: 2,138. No: 408.
:5. It is opportune to consider the restoration of the diaconate as a permanent degree of ordained ministry. Yes: 2,120. No: 525.

Again, lop-sided majorities in favour of renewal, though almost 20% of the Council Fathers voted against proposition 4, and almost 25% against proposition 5. Though collegiality was an idea most of the bishops had never heard of before, they had experienced collegiality at the council itself, and this experience had convinced them of the validity of the idea.

Chapter 3: The People of God

Some of the ideas developed in the chapter were:
* baptism as the basis for the participation of Christians in Christ&#x27;s mission as priest, prophet and king;
* the &quot;sensus fidelium&quot; (the &quot;sense of the faithful&quot;)
* the sanctification of Christians can occur even through their secular pursuits;
* infallibility as a charism of the whole People of God, and not just of the bishops and Pope.

The conservatives said the chapter minimized the difference between laity and clergy, and embraced the Protestant idea of the priesthood of all baptized, when in fact it was only a metaphor.

Chapter 4: The Universal Call to Holiness

Unlike the previous version that focused on the call to holiness of members of religious orders, this new version began with the idea that all Christians were called to holiness and it is only after this that the religious life was described as one way of achieving holiness.

==== Schema on the Virgin Mary ====
This schema produced by the preparatory theological commission was in line with traditional Catholic doctrine: it reasserted the importance of Marian devotion (against those who thought Marian piety was excessive), her perpetual virginity (against those who questioned this), her universal mediation and her central role in redemption (though not the claim that she was co-redeemer). The reformers thought the schema on Mary should be a chapter of the schema on the Church. The conservatives wanted it to remain separate in order to stress her importance. The vote on 29 October was surprisingly close: the proposal to move the schema on Mary into the schema on the Church won by only 40 votes.

==== Schema on Bishops and the Governance of Dioceses ====
This was a relatively short document that dealt with practical matters: the relationship of diocesan bishops to the Curia, to their priests and to religious orders; the role of auxiliary bishops; the division or amalgamation of dioceses; national bishops&#x27; conferences. The theology underpinning the schema was traditional: stress on the primacy of the pope; episcopal authority as a concession by the pope; and of course, nothing about collegiality. This became the main argument of the reformers in favour of having the schema rewritten. Some of them were arguing for the creation of a council of bishops with a rotating membership that would always be in session in Rome to assist the pope in the governance of the Church.

Most of the discussion was about the relation between bishops and the central government of the Church. In the course of this discussion, Cardinal Frings of Cologne delivered a biting criticism of the Curia, arguing that the central administration of the Church had to be thoroughly reformed, especially the Holy Office. Cardinal Ottaviani angrily responded, defending the Curia and the department he headed. This passionate exchange was the most dramatic moment of the Second Session. Cardinal Frings&#x27; speech had been written in part by his personal theologian, Joseph Ratzinger, who would one day become the head of the same Holy Office, renamed in 1967 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.

Other topics that were touched on during the discussion were the status of national episcopal conferences, and the need for bishops to retire at a certain age. No one raised the question of how bishops were appointed.

==== Schemas on Liturgy and Modern Means of Communication ====
The council then brought to a close the discussion of the two schemas approved in principle during the First Period. For the schema on liturgy, matters proceeded quickly and on 22 November, the document that would set in motion the most important liturgical reform in the history of the Church received final approval by a vote of 2,159 to 19.

Many Fathers found the schema on the modern means of communication lackluster and innocuous. Some decided to vote against it for that reason, but many others just wanted to get it out of the way in order to focus on more important matters. So, it received final approval on 25 November by a vote of 1,598 to 503. A quarter of the Fathers vote against it to show their displeasure.

==== Schema on Ecumenism ====
The revised schema on ecumenism from the Secretariat for Christian Unity came before the council on 18 November. It was a hybrid document of 5 chapters, 3 of them on ecumenism, one on non-Christian religions (&quot;especially the Jews&quot;) and one on religious liberty. All 3 topics were controversial.

The 3 chapters on ecumenism (a merger of 3 previous documents) took a very positive view of ecumenism, and said things some bishops had never heard before:

* Catholics must be involved in ecumenical endeavours (a reversal of the pre-conciliar ban on involvement)
* Catholics should acknowledge that faults by Catholics in the past often contributed to separation
* The document contained no call for non-Catholics to &quot;return&quot; to the Catholic Church
* Chapter 3 listed many admirable features of non-Catholic Christians.

Some conservatives spoke out against the text, repeating the Church&#x27;s traditional stand that non-Catholics were in error and should simply return to the true Church. Nevertheless, the chapters on ecumenism were surprisingly well received, and were accepted in principle by a wide margin, with only 86 dissenting voices. Discussion of the 3 chapters on ecumenism took up all the time remaining before the end of the second session, and there was no time left to discuss non-Christian religions or religious freedom.

==== The End of the Second Period ====
At a public session on 4 December, Pope Paul solemnly promulgated the first two documents of the council: the Constitution on Sacred Liturgy (&quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;) and the Decree on the Modern Means of Social Communication (&quot;Inter mirifica&quot;). At the end of his closing speech, he stunned the Council Fathers by announcing that he would undertake a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, the first time in five centuries a Pope had left Italy (except for the time when Napoleon carried off the pope to France as his prisoner).

=== Interval between second and third periods ===

==== Pilgrimage to the Holy Land ====
In early January (4–6 January 1964) Pope Paul went on a three-day pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he met Athenagoras, patriarch of Constantinople and spiritual head of the Eastern Orthodox churches. It was the first meeting between a pope and a patriarch of Constantinople in 600 years. It broke down centuries of suspicion and estrangement, and gave great hope to the ecumenical movement.

==== Revision of the schemas ====
The revision of the schemas continued. By mid-summer, all of the remaining schemas were sent to the Council Fathers in the expectation that the next Session would be the last. The revision of the schema on the Church had been particularly difficult. In mid-summer pope Paul surprised everyone by letting the doctrinal commission know that he would like some changes to the schema. The Commission accepted some changes he wanted but not others, and the pope seemed satisfied. The day before the beginning of the Third Session, the pope received a confidential memorandum from 25 cardinals and 13 superiors-general of religious orders of men, asking him to intervene and prevent the doctrine of collegiality from being accepted at the council.

==== Encyclical on the Church ====
Five weeks before the opening of the Third Session, pope Paul published his first encyclical, &quot;Ecclesiam suam&quot;, on the Church. Some were annoyed that the pope would issue an encyclical on the very subject that was being discussed at the council.

==== Women lay auditors ====
Following a remark by Cardinal Suenens at the end of the second session that women were absent from the council, pope Paul appointed 15 women to be lay auditors during the third Session. Eventually 23 women, including 10 religious, would sit in on debates as official auditors. While 3 of the male auditors would eventually be asked to address the Council Fathers about their concerns as laypeople, none of the women would be asked to speak.

=== Third period: 14 September – 21 November 1964 ===

==== Opening ====
The Third Session opened with a ceremony that most people in the Latin Church had never experienced before: a concelebrated mass. The Pope celebrated mass along with 24 bishops representing 19 different countries. The mass was followed by a long address by the Pope, in which the relationship between the papacy and the episcopal office figured prominently. While granting the importance of strengthening the episcopal function, he defended the authority and prerogatives of the papacy.

Most Council Fathers hoped this would be the final Session of the council. The hope was optimistic since 6 schemas had not finished their course through the conciliar process, and 8 others had not even been examined yet. Seven of these were &quot;practical&quot; schemas whose goal was to update various aspects of the life and practice of the Church. The eighth was the important schema about the Church in the Modern World. It would eventually become clear that a fourth session was necessary.

==== Schema on the Church ====
After being revised during the interval, the schema now had 8 chapters instead of 4.

:1. The Mystery of the Church 
:2. The People of God
:3. The Hierarchical Structure; in particular the Episcopate 
:4. The Laity
:5. The Universal Call to Holiness
:6. The Religious Life
:7. The Pilgrim Church and its Union with the Church in Heaven
:8. The Virgin Mary

The chapter on the People of God had been moved from third to second place, so that the unifying factor (of being the People of God) came before the distinction between clergy (chapter 3) and laity (chapter 4). From the previous chapter on the universal call to holiness, 2 new chapters had been extracted: one on the laity with its own theology (chapter 4) and one on the religious life as one way of responding to the call to holiness (chapter 6). A chapter on the Church in heaven had been added, and the former schema on the Virgin Mary had been adapted to become chapter 8.

In order to make sure chapter 3 reflected as closely as possible the wishes of the Fathers, there would be 39 separate votes on various parts of the chapter and various formulations of its provisions. The voting took place over the course of 8 sittings, from 21 to 30 September. Every formulation but one was accepted with large majorities, including those on collegiality, on the restoration of the diaconate and on admitting married men to the diaconate. The only one voted down was to allow unmarried permanent deacons to marry after ordination.

==== Schema on Bishops ====
The revised schema on bishops was very different from the conservative text discussed at the previous Session. It now began with an affirmation of collegiality, and it proposed, in very general terms, that collegiality be implemented by creating a body of bishops that would meet regularly with the Pope. It also proposed in equally general terms a reform of the Curia.

==== Schemas on religious freedom and non-Christian religions ====

On 23 September, the Council Fathers finally got the opportunity to discuss the 2 texts that had originally been appended to the schema on ecumenism and were now separate schemas.

Religious Freedom

The text on religious freedom proclaimed the right of everyone to freedom of religion. That is, freedom from coercion by the state in matters of religious belief and practice. It was well known that there was strong opposition to this declaration, perhaps even greater than to collegiality. Quite simply, it ran counter to the position the Catholic Church had defended for centuries.

The Church&#x27;s traditional position was that Catholics were entitled to freedom everywhere, but non-Catholics were not entitled to freedom in countries with a Catholic majority. In the mid-20th century, there were still discriminatory laws against Protestants in Spain and some Latin American countries. Protestants claimed the Catholic Church&#x27;s stance on ecumenism could not be taken seriously as long as it supported such restrictions on religious freedom.

The Church&#x27;s basic premise before Vatican II was that Catholicism was the only true religion and, since &quot;error has no rights&quot;, no other religion was entitled to religious freedom. If all religions were treated equally, that would imply they were all of equal value, a position labelled &quot;indifferentism&quot;. If the council was to defend religious freedom, it had to do so in a way that did not imply that all religions were of equal value. The text presented to the Council did this by basing religious freedom on the person&#x27;s duty to obey his/her conscience. From this, it followed that the law must not coerce a person to act against his/her conscience.

The criticism from the conservatives about a declaration of religious freedom was unrelenting: &quot;this represented a reversal of the Church&#x27;s previous teaching... it fostered indifferentism... it was Modernism... it would cause the ruin of the Catholic Church,&quot; said Archbishop Lefebvre.

Support for religious freedom was strongest among the bishops from countries where it was the normal state of affairs, such as the English-speaking world and most Western European countries. The American bishops, who had not played a particularly important role at the council up to this point, made religious freedom &quot;their&quot; cause. Religious freedom was also defended by bishops who lived under communist regimes where the Church suffered persecution. In the mind of supporters, the Church&#x27;s double standard was simply untenable: Catholics could no longer demand freedom for themselves while denying it to others.

Given the ferocity of the opposition, many wondered whether the chapter would ever manage to receive the requisite two-thirds majority.

&quot;On the Jews and non-Christians&quot;

Pope John had wanted the Church to take a stand against all forms of antisemitism. A first statement &quot;On the Jews&quot; had been prepared for the first session, then dropped for political reasons: Arab Christians claimed their governments would interpret it as tilting towards Israel in the Arab-Jewish Middle East conflict, and Christians would suffer for this. A statement on the Jews now returned as part of a broader schema &quot;On the Jews and non-Christians&quot;.

The objective was to reject any theological basis for antisemitism, in particular the centuries-old claim that the Jews were cursed by God because they had refused to accept the Gospel and had killed Christ. Many bishops supported the declaration. As with religious freedom, the Americans were strongly in favour. But some conservatives were unwilling to deviate from the traditional line of thinking. The discussion lasted two days, and on 30 September, the chapter was returned to the Secretariat for Christian Unity for further revision.

Papal Intervention

The normal course of events was suddenly interrupted a week and a half later (19 October). Pope Paul, obviously under pressure from conservatives, let it be known that he wanted the texts on Religious Freedom and on Non-Christian Religions rewritten by a joint commission that would include conservative members of the Doctrinal Commission. The outcry was considerable and eventually the Pope backed down.

==== Schema on Revelation ====
After being rejected in the First Session, the schema on Revelation had not made a return appearance since that remarkable day almost 2 years earlier. A second version had been produced in 1963 but it was considered too bland, and a third version was not ready in time to be introduced during the Second Session. And so on 30 September this third version was presented to the Council Fathers.

Where the original version said there were two separate sources of Revelation – Scripture and Tradition – and that some revealed truths were contained in Tradition alone, the current version took a more nuanced position. It rejected the idea that there were two separate &quot;sources&quot; of Revelation or that Revelation consisted in propositions handed down by God, some in the Bible and others in Tradition. There is only one source, which is God revealing himself. Instead of insisting on the &quot;separateness&quot; of Scripture and Tradition, it insisted on their close connection, without indicating exactly how they were connected. But most importantly, it said nothing about whether Tradition contained revealed truths that were not in the Bible. The conservatives strongly insisted on such a statement. The reformers, on the other hand, thought the issue was not ready to be settled: they wanted to leave it open to further discussion by theologians.

The new text said that Tradition was found not only in the Church&#x27;s teaching, but in its liturgy and in people&#x27;s spiritual experiences. The conservatives thought this too subjective. The schema said that Tradition &quot;progresses&quot;. The conservatives would have none of this. The schema did not state clearly whether the Bible was completely free from error. The conservatives insisted the text should clearly state that it was.

In spite of these objections, it was clear the schema had considerable support. Discussion ended on 6 October, and the text was sent to the doctrinal commission for further revision.

==== Seven New Schemas ====

After 3 weeks of dealing with the schemas already moving through the conciliar process, the Council Fathers then turned to examining the schemas they had not yet seen. They were introduced in rapid succession at a rate of about one a week.

Schema on the Apostolate of the Laity

The theology of the laity had been set out in chapter 4 of the document on the Church. Now, this 5-chapter schema on the Lay Apostolate was meant as the practical application of this theology. Introduced on 6 October, it stated that lay people had their own task of changing the world in accordance with the Gospel, and that this mission was based on their baptism and their participation in the royal priesthood of Christ. They carried out this mission either individually – by bearing witness to the Gospel in their personal lives – or by taking part in Church organizations and movements.

All of this was relatively uncontroversial. There was one divisive issue. The traditional view was that, in performing their mission in the world, the laity always had to be under the direction of the clergy. The &quot;modern&quot; view was that this should not always be the case. Some speakers thought the schema did not insist enough on the laity&#x27;s role as subordinate to the clergy; others claimed it insisted too much on this subordinate role and was &quot;too clerical&quot;.

Debate ended on 13 October. Before the schema was sent off to be revised according to the bishops&#x27; comments, a layman spoke to the bishops about the schema: he was Patrick Keegan, president of the World Federation of Christian Workers. This was the first time a layperson had been asked to express his views on a schema being discussed by the Council Fathers.

Schema on the Ministry and Life of Priests

Introduced on 13 October, the schema sought to give a renewed vision of the task of priests, for example, by insisting that priests should act towards laypeople &quot;not only as pastors and teachers but also as brothers dealing with brothers&quot;. The schema also insisted on the importance of clerical celibacy. While most of the speakers at the council tip-toed around the issue, there was much talk outside the council hall about the future of clerical celibacy. Some speakers mentioned the lack of priests in Latin America and the decline in vocations that was already taking place in Italy and France, and wondered what measures could be taken to reverse the trend.

Schema on the Eastern Churches

The Eastern Catholic Churches were those branches of Catholicism in Eastern Europe and the Middle East – the Maronites, the Melkites, the Copts, the Ukrainians – whose theological, canonical and liturgical traditions were rooted in ancient Greek Christianity. They represented a very small fraction of the total population of the Catholic Church and in the past often had Latin traditions imposed on them. In these Churches decision-making was usually collegial, and the most important of these Churches were headed by a Patriarch.

The schema that was presented to the council on 15 October sought to defend their particular traditions against the inevitable tendency to &quot;Latinize&quot; them. Some thought the schema was still &quot;too Western&quot; but on the whole it was well received by the Council Fathers, and only a few revisions were necessary before it was ready for final approval a few weeks later.

Schema on the Church&#x27;s Missionary Activity

Presented on 6 November, the schema sought to give a renewed vision of the Church&#x27;s missionary activity, by arguing for less control by Rome and greater adaptation to local cultures. It was judged to be too cursory and was sent back to its commission to be expanded.

Schema on the Renewal of Religious Life

The schema called for religious orders to adapt to modern conditions while remaining faithful to their original purpose and spirit. After 2 days of discussion ( 10–12 November) it too was judged to be too brief and was sent back to be expanded.

Schema on Priestly Formation

This schema, introduced on 12 November, presented a renewed vision of the training of priests. It put forward a few innovative proposals: the program of priestly training should be determined by the bishops of each country rather than by Rome (though Rome&#x27;s approval would be required), and the study of Scripture should be the basis for seminary studies. Some conservatives complained that the schema did not insist on the centrality of the theology of Thomas Aquinas in the curriculum. But the bishops&#x27; reception of the document was overwhelmingly positive.

Schema on Christian Education

Introduced on 17 November, four days before the end of the Session, this schema mainly reiterated what the Church had been saying about Catholic education. Coming as it did during the last week of the Third Session, it found itself embroiled in the turbulent events of that week (see below). So the bishops gave it a hasty preliminary approval, to get it out of the way.

==== Schema on the Church in the Modern World ====

On 20 October, the last of the great doctrinal schemas was presented to the Council Fathers. It had had a lengthy genesis and had not been ready before this late date. The idea for a &quot;social&quot; schema, one that discussed the problems of the modern world and the Church&#x27;s willingness to take part in solving them, was born during the interval between the First and Second Periods, and the project had gone through many drafts before it was ready for the Council Fathers. No previous Council had ever attempted such a project: instead of being concerned with internal Church matters, the schema addressed contemporary social problems, such as economic and social justice, and problems of war and peace.

The schema included 4 short chapters of a more theoretical nature giving the theological basis for the Church&#x27;s – and the individual Christian&#x27;s – involvement in social matters, and 5 appendices addressing practical issues:

:Introduction
:Chapter 1: On the human vocation
:Chapter 2: On the Church in service to God and mankind
:Chapter 3: On how Christians should conduct themselves in the world in which they lived
:Chapter 4: On some special responsibilities of Christians in today&#x27;s world
:Conclusion

:Appendix 1: On the human person in society
:Appendix 2: On marriage and the family
:Appendix 3: On the promotion of culture
:Appendix 4: On economic and social issues
:Appendix 5: On human solidarity and peace

Certain themes could be found throughout the document, such as the dignity of the human person, the need for solidarity among people of all racial, ethnic, religious or socioeconomic groups and the obligation of all people to work for a world of greater justice. The schema presented the Church as a beacon of hope in a troubled world and a helpmate for all persons of good will. While the Church had a specific message to present to the world – that of the Gospel – she wanted to play a &quot;servant&quot; role, and was ready to &quot;dialogue&quot; with the modern world in a search for solutions. And she even acknowledged that the world could help the Church be true to herself.

Most speakers welcomed the schema. Few thought it was a bad idea in principle, but there were many suggestions to improve it. From the conservatives: the Church should be talking more about its supernatural mission than about human endeavours, and the schema should contain a condemnation of Marxism. From the reformers: the schema should promote the position of women in society; there should be a strong condemnation of racism; the schema should condemn nuclear war.

The most interesting result of the discussion was the division it created among the reform-minded bishops and theologians. The French loved the document, which reflected typical concerns of recent French theology, while the Germans thought it was too optimistic and discounted the sinfulness of the world. Congar and Daniélou represented the first view, Rahner and Ratzinger the second.

The appendix on marriage and the family caused fireworks. The conservatives were indignant that:
: – the text treated the two traditional ends of marriage (procreation of children and mutual love of the spouses) as if they were of equal importance, while the long-standing position had been that procreation was the &quot;primary&quot; end;
: – the text said the spouses were entitled to decide the number of children they would have;
: – the text did not explicitly reaffirm the recent popes&#x27; condemnation of birth control.

Birth control was the burning issue of the day. In 1963 Pope John had set up a papal commission to study the issue. There was a general understanding that the council should avoid discussing the issue and wait until the papal commission had reported. But that was easier said than done. Various Council Fathers began suggesting that perhaps the time had come to revisit the Church&#x27;s ban on contraception.

After 2 weeks of debate, the schema was returned for revision by the joint Commission that had produced it.

==== &quot;Black Week&quot; ====

At the beginning of the last week of the Third Session (Monday, 16 November), the schemas on the Church and on Ecumenism were ready for final approval that week, and that on Religious Freedom was almost there. But the Council Fathers were about to experience the most dramatic and disturbing week of the whole Council. The reformers nicknamed it &quot;Black Week&quot;.

These three schemas were still being opposed by a dogged group of conservatives. Because they did not have the votes to prevent final approval, their only recourse was to lobby Pope Paul to prevent their adoption in their present form. The pressure on the Pope was unrelenting, and eventually he gave in.

Religious Freedom

The schema on Religious Freedom that the bishops were to vote on had been considerably amended since the earlier debate at the beginning of the current session. The opponents now raised a procedural point: the text was substantially different from the one discussed earlier, and Council Regulations required that there be a new debate on this amended text rather than simply proceed to a vote. The Pope was lobbied by both groups, the reformers insisting the vote should go ahead, the conservatives that it should not. He finally sided with the conservatives, and the Council Fathers were told the schema on Religious Freedom would be postponed until the Fourth Session. While many Council Fathers were furious at the time, in retrospect his decision now seems reasonable.

Ecumenism

As the earlier votes on each of its chapters had shown, the schema on Ecumenism had overwhelming support. But some conservatives had convinced the Pope that some of the wording was dangerous. On 19 November, two days before the end of the session, Pope Paul sent the Council Fathers 19 changes he insisted be made to the schema before he would agree to promulgate it. The changes had little effect on the substance of the schema, but seemed to many people to be petty. Some of them offended the Protestant observers: for instance, in the section listing the positive features of Protestantism, the passage that said Protestants &quot;found&quot; Christ in the Scriptures had to be changed to say they &quot;sought&quot; Christ in the Scriptures. Faced with this ultimatum, the Council Fathers agreed to the changes and the final vote on the schema was again a landslide: 2,054 to 64.

The Church

The most important intervention by Pope Paul concerned chapter 3 of the schema on the Church, the chapter dealing with collegiality. Opponents of the schema argued that it diminished the Pope&#x27;s powers, and Pope Paul came to be convinced of this. So he insisted that a &quot;Nota explicativa praevia&quot; (&quot;Preliminary Explanatory Note&quot;) be added to the schema, saying collegiality did not diminish the Church&#x27;s traditional teaching about the primacy of the Pope. The conservatives were satisfied this note robbed collegiality of all its force, while reformers thought it would have no effect on the way collegiality would be understood after the council. But the note did have two immediate consequences: this last-minute unilateral intervention created great resentment among the reformers and damaged relations between them and the Pope, but it also convinced most of the holdouts to accept the schema. The final vote on the schema on 19 November was almost unanimous: 2,134 to 10.

On the Vatican website, the explanatory note can be found between the main text and the endnotes.

==== The End of the Third Session ====

Saturday, 21 November was the closing day of the Third Session. Three schemas now became official Council documents when they were promulgated by the Pope: the very important Constitution on the Church, the Decree on Ecumenism and the Decree on the Eastern Churches.

During the closing ceremony, Pope Paul delivered a long address in which he expressed satisfaction with the work of the Third Session. Halfway through the address, he began speaking of the Virgin Mary, and then spent the last half of the address on this subject. He announced he was conferring on Mary a new title, that of &quot;Mother of the Church&quot;. This displeased many people: the title was not traditional, it was an obstacle to ecumenism, and it placed Mary above the Church rather than within it. This move capped a week of initiatives by the Pope that frayed relations between him and the Council Fathers. After a very stressful week, everyone was happy to go home.

=== Interval between third and fourth periods ===
==== Trip to India ====
In early December 1964, Pope Paul travelled to India to take part in the International Eucharistic Congress held in Bombay (now Mumbai). By visiting a non-Christian third-world country, he wanted to show the Church&#x27;s openness to non-Christian religions and to the problems of the modern world, two topics being discussed at the council.

==== First liturgical changes ====
The previous September, the &quot;Consilium&quot; for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Liturgy had published the first changes to the celebration of mass, changes to come into effect on 7 March 1965. On that day, Catholics around the world experienced for the first time mass celebrated partly in their own language and &quot;facing the people&quot;. To show his support for these changes, Pope Paul began celebrating mass according to the new rules each Sunday in a different Rome parish.

==== Ongoing revision of the schemas ====
At the end of the third session, 11 schemas remained unfinished and during the interval between the sessions the commissions worked to give them their final form. The schemas that were having the bumpiest ride were those on Revelation, Religious freedom, Non-Christian Religions, and The Church in the Modern World. Cardinal Ritter observed that, &quot;We were stalled by the delaying tactics of a very small minority&quot; in the Curia who were more industrious in communicating with the pope than was the more progressive majority.

=== Fourth period: 14 September – 8 December 1965 ===
The last period of the council opened on 14 September 1965. There were still 11 schemas making their way through the conciliar process. Given the number of schemas, the session was planned to be 12 weeks long, 2 weeks longer than the others.

==== Opening ====
Pope Paul gave a long opening address, extolling the council as a great event in the life of the Church and expressing great support for the Church&#x27;s concern for the fate of the world (echoes of the schema on the Church in the Modern World).

He then made 2 surprising announcements. He planned on creating a body of bishops that would meet occasionally with him in an exercise of collegial responsibility for the whole Church, which was met with great applause. Secondly, he would go to New York to speak at the United Nations about the Church&#x27;s interest in fostering &quot;concord, justice, fraternal love, and peace among all human beings&quot;. More applause. The two announcements buoyed the spirits of the Council Fathers at the beginning of what promised to be a long and possibly difficult Fourth Session.

The very next day, the Pope issued &quot;Apostolica sollicitudo&quot;, the &quot;motu proprio&quot; creating the Synod of Bishops. Enthusiasm waned when it became clear that the Synod would be a purely advisory body completely under the authority of the Pope. Those who thought the Synod of Bishops might one day exercise power over the Curia were disappointed. Some believed the sudden announcement was a preemptive move to forestall any vote by the council in favour of a more powerful episcopal body.

==== Schemas: Religious Freedom, Revelation ====

Religious Freedom

Though a procedural maneuver at the end of the last session had succeeded in prolonging debate on the schema, nothing new was being said. The same arguments were being advanced for and against by the same people as before. After three days of repetitive debate, the vote on whether the schema was acceptable in principle took place 21 September: 1,997 in favour, 224 opposed. Some 10% of the Council Fathers were opposed, but this was far less than was feared.

Revelation

The schema on Revelation returned to the council hall, changed slightly from the previous Session, when it had been approved in principle. It still did not say what the conservatives wanted: a clear statement that Tradition contained revealed truths not found in Scripture. Instead, the schema had adopted a compromise position: &quot;The whole of Catholic doctrine cannot be proved from Scripture alone.&quot; That was not enough for the conservatives. But the time for debating was over: the schema had returned to the council hall only to be voted on. There were multiple votes, ending on 22 September. The schema passed easily, but 1,498 amendments were proposed. And so the schema was returned to the Doctrinal Commission.

As the conservatives realized they could not win in the council hall, they went to the Pope. Two days later, Cardinal Ottaviani, head of the Doctrinal Commission, received a letter from Pope Paul indicating that he wanted the schema to be more specific about Tradition as a &quot;source of revelation&quot;. This created division within the commission, as many were dead set against this, while others did not want to antagonize the Pope. After days of debate, the commission finally settled on the following: &quot;The Church does not draw her certainty for all revealed truths from Scripture alone.&quot; This seemed to satisfy the Pope. After the Commission dealt with all the amendments submitted by the Council Fathers, the schema would return for a final vote later in the session.

==== Schema on the Church in the Modern World ====

On 21 September, the Council Fathers began discussing the schema on the Church in the Modern World. Many changes had been made to the text first seen during the previous session, but they were mainly matters of detail. The 5 appendices of the previous version had been converted to chapters, so it was now a schema of two parts, a more theoretical one of 4 chapters about the vocation of man and the Church&#x27;s role of service for the well-being of mankind, and a more practical one of 5 chapters discussing topics such as marriage, culture, social justice, and war and peace.

The schema was a remarkable document, unique in the history of councils. The Church, it said, sees itself as a partner in cooperation and dialogue with the whole of humanity. All members of the human family must work together for a more humane world. For Christians, &quot;nothing that is genuinely human fails to find an echo in their hearts.&quot; The text went so far as to say that the Church could learn from the secular world. It was a far cry from the condemnations of the errors of the world that were so typical of Church pronouncements.

Among the problems facing the schema was the fact that the Germans thought it was too optimistic. The French and German bishops met to try to come to an understanding. Eventually, many German bishops would accept the schema grudgingly as better than nothing.

The conservatives attacked the schema: the supernatural mission of the Church was being forgotten. Some Fathers wondered if it deserved to be a Constitution, or whether it shouldn&#x27;t be a letter or message to the world. But, after 3 days of discussion the Fathers voted to accept it in principle, and then moved on to study each of its chapters.

The theoretical part of the schema was generally well received. Some bishops wanted an explicit condemnation of communism; as a compromise, the schema referred to previous papal condemnations but did not issue a condemnation of its own.

The chapter about marriage and the family still did not say that procreation was the primary end of marriage. Many bishops were shocked when a Melkite archbishop said the Church should find a way to allow an abandoned spouse to remarry.

Most bishops said nice things about the chapter on culture. A notable speech was given by archbishop Pellegrino of Turin: he called for greater freedom of research in the Church and a less punitive attitude by Church authorities – he was thinking here especially of the Holy Office, headed by Cardinal Ottaviani – towards thinkers who choose to pursue new issues in theology.

The next chapter, on social and economic matters, discussed issues that had been treated by the papal encyclicals that formed what is known as the Social Doctrine of the Church. Some Council Fathers questioned the need for such a chapter, since the papal encyclicals already said everything that needed to be said. But the chapter was well received by most Fathers.

The last chapter was about war and peace. The main issue was whether the availability of nuclear weapons made obsolete the traditional distinction between just and unjust wars. Many speakers thought so: no war that made use of nuclear weapons could be a just war. A related issue was whether it was legitimate to even have nuclear weapons. Many thought it was legitimate to have them (as a deterrent) but not to make use of them. A few American bishops, wanting to defend their country&#x27;s possession of nuclear weapons, organized a campaign urging Council Fathers to vote against the schema&#x27;s position on nuclear arms, but it fizzled out.

The debate on the schema ended on 8 October after 13 days of discussion. The schema now returned to its originating Committee for revision. There were 400 pages of proposed amendments to deal with, and the question was whether the commission could sift through them and return the schema to the full assembly in time for the schema to be accepted before the end of the session.

==== Pope Paul at the United Nations ====

Part way through the debate on the Church in the Modern World, the Council Fathers&#x27; attention turned towards North America, for on 4 October, Pope Paul travelled to New York City to deliver an address to the United Nations. It was the first time a Pope visited the Western Hemisphere. The trip attracted world attention.

His address to the UN – in French – made three points.
* He wanted to express the Catholic Church&#x27;s support for the UN on its 20th anniversary and for its role as an instrument of peaceful cooperation among nations;
* He proclaimed the importance of human rights and the dignity of all persons, and specifically mentioned religious freedom (a message to those back in Rome who were obstructing the schema on religious freedom)
* He spoke of the necessity of world peace and of the horrors of war. The most striking statement in the address was &quot;No more war! War never again!&quot;

==== Schemas: Missions, Education, Non-Christian religions, Priests ====

The missionary activity of the Church

On 8 October, the Council Fathers began discussing the schema on the missions, completely rewritten since the last session. It stressed the importance, in a post-colonial age, of accommodation to local cultures. The basic question was: How to be Catholic without being Western? Some African bishops wanted more autonomy from Roman supervision. The schema was very well received and the discussion lasted only 3 days.

Christian education

For two days ( 13–14 October), the Council Fathers discussed the schema on Christian Education. It said little that was new. Like many other documents issued by Church authorities, it insisted on the importance of Catholic schools. The situation of Catholic schools varied from country to country – some were state-supported, others were not – and so it was difficult to say anything that applied to all of them. Many bishops wanted the schema rewritten, but they were told there was no time for a new text. So after two days of discussion, the schema was accepted without much enthusiasm. Close to 10% of the Council Fathers voted against it, to show their displeasure with its lack of aggiornamento. It is one of the two Vatican II documents considered something of a failure (along with the decree on the Modern Means of Communication). &quot;Even at the last minute, dissatisfaction with the text was widespread and wide-ranging&quot;.

Non-Christian religions

The opposition to this schema that was originally about &quot;the Jews&quot; came from theological conservatives as well as the Arab bishops who feared repercussions from their governments. The Secretariat for Christian Unity decided to win over the Arab bishops, and succeeded in doing so by agreeing to a few textual changes during the interval between the 3rd and 4th sessions. There was also a diplomatic offensive to convince the predominantly Muslim governments in the Middle East that the schema was not just about &quot;the Jews&quot; since there was also a section that had positive things to say about Islam.

The various votes on the revised schema took place on 14 and 15 October. The final vote was 1,763 in favour, 250 opposed, a much better result than could have been imagined a year earlier.

The ministry and life of priests

The last of the schemas, it came before the Council Fathers on 14 October.

Two concepts of the role of priests could be discerned in the debate. The more traditional one was about the priest as sacramental minister with special powers, especially those of consecrating the bread and wine at mass and absolving penitents of their sins. This conception also stressed authority: the priest exercised authority over laypeople, just as the bishop exercised a similar authority over priests. The newer conception, the one advocated in the schema, saw the priest as someone who serves the Church and society through his leadership; in this view, the relation between priests and those they served is closer to one of friendship (&quot;the good shepherd&quot;) and the same is true of the relationship of bishop and priest.

In the first conception, the word &quot;priest&quot; expresses the cultic function performed by the ordained minister. In the second conception, the preferred term is &quot;presbyter&quot;, the term used in the early Church, because it implies more than the sacramental role suggested by &quot;priest&quot;. The presbyter shares in the threefold ministry of Christ: he is prophet (preacher of the Word of God), priest (minister of the sacraments) and king (leader of the community). Instead of the traditional conception that his main function was celebrating mass and hearing confession, the schema stated that his primary duty was proclaiming the Gospel to all.

The one important issue the schema did not address was that of compulsory celibacy for priests of the Latin Church. On 11 October, two days before the schema was to be discussed, Pope Paul preempted the debate by announcing he was withdrawing the issue of celibacy from the conciliar agenda. Bishops who wished to address the issue could send their comments in writing to him. It was expected the Pope would hand the issue to a special committee. But no committee was ever set up, and in 1967 Pope Paul issued &quot;Sacerdotalis caelibatus&quot;, the encyclical maintaining clerical celibacy for Latin priests.

The schema was approved in principle on 16 October, and after further voting on amendments, it received final approval on 12 November.

==== A change of pace ====

By Saturday 16 October, the end of the session&#x27;s fifth week, 5 schemas had received final approval, and the remaining ones had all been accepted in principle. Things were moving along faster than expected. And the Fathers were suffering from Council fatigue. So the sixth week of the session (17–24 October) was declared a holiday from conciliar work, and everyone was able to relax. When the Fathers returned on 25 October, debates were over: since all remaining schemas had been accepted in principle, the only work left for the General Congregations was to vote on the amendments as the schemas were returned by the respective Commissions.

There was a Public Session on 28 October, when the 5 schemas approved so far became documents of Vatican II: the decrees on the renewal of religious life &quot;Perfectae caritatis&quot;, on Christian Education &quot;Gravissimum educationis&quot;, on the pastoral office of bishops &quot;Christus Dominus&quot;, on Priestly Training &quot;Optatam totius&quot;, and the declaration on Non-Christian Religions &quot;Nostra aetate&quot;.

There were no General Congregations during the following week (31 Oct – 7 Nov), because the Commissions were falling behind in their work of sifting through all the proposed amendments and revising the schemas before sending them back to the Council Fathers. So the eighth week of the Fourth Session was devoted exclusively to Commission work, as their members worked feverishly to clear the backlog of amendments.

==== Voting on the last schemas ====

After the Council Fathers&#x27; second one-week break, there were 3 weeks of practically non-stop voting on the 6 remaining schemas: for each one, there were multiple votes on amendments, then on chapters and finally on the whole schema. In the course of those weeks, the six remaining schemas received their final approval.

Last-minute moves were sometimes successful in winning over opponents, sometimes not. On religious freedom, the Pope urged the Secretariat for Christian unity to take into account the wishes of the schema&#x27;s opponents in the hope the final vote might be almost unanimous. The Secretariat made some changes, but the opponents were not swayed and 11% of the Fathers voted against the schema. On the matter of Tradition in the schema on Revelation, the conservatives realized they could do no better than the compromise formula &quot;The Church does not draw her certainty for all revealed truths from Scripture alone&quot;: as a result, many of them chose to accept the schema and there were only 27 negative votes on the day of final approval. For the schema on the Lay Apostolate, the Pope sent 12 amendments to the Commission responsible for the schema. They were basically matters of wording: the Commission accepted some, and dropped others, and the schema was adopted with only 2 negative votes.

As for the schema on the Church in the Modern World, it still avoided saying anything about contraception (because a papal commission was studying the matter). Some conservatives began lobbying the Pope to step in. On 24 November, Cardinal Ottaviani received a letter from Paul VI insisting that the schema had to condemn the use of contraception; leaving the matter open as the schema did would suggest the Church was ready to change its position. The Doctrinal Commission decided to include in the schema references to previous papal rejections of contraception, but not to issue any condemnation of its own. The Pope was satisfied with this solution. Nevertheless, when time came for final approval, the opposition stayed firm: 11% of the Council Fathers still rejected the schema.

In the midst of all this voting, there was another public session on 18 November, and two of the remaining schemas became the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation &quot;Dei verbum&quot; and the decree on the Apostolate of the Laity &quot;Apostolicam actuositatem&quot;.

==== Indulgences ====

One of the issues some bishops wanted discussed at the council was that of indulgences, but the topic never made it onto the conciliar agenda. A month after his being elected pope in the summer of 1963, Paul VI set up a commission to study the issue. The commission produced a report suggesting a mild modernization of the practice of indulgences, but no important changes.
Once it became clear that the workload of the fourth period would be less than originally expected, the Pope decided to use some of the available time to ask the national groups of bishops for their reaction to the report. 10 November and succeeding days were set aside for responses. Eleven national groups delivered oral responses in the council hall, and 12 others written responses. The Italian and Spanish bishops were favourable to the report, while most others were highly critical: they cast doubt on the theological foundation of indulgences, and suggested a complete reform of the system, some even urging outright abolition. Patriarch Maximos IV insisted there was no evidence of indulgences during the first millennium. The presentations were cut short after 2 days. Two years later, Pope Paul would decree a modest reform of the system of indulgences, while insisting on their importance.

==== The Council&#x27;s Final Days ====

On 4 December, Pope Paul took part in an ecumenical prayer service with the hundred or so non-Catholic observers present at the council in the Basilica of Saint Paul outside the Walls. It was the first time a Pope had prayed publicly with non-Catholic Christians, something unthinkable just a few years earlier.

On 6 December, there were speeches at St. Peter&#x27;s thanking everyone who had taken part in the council. Each Council Father received a gold ring to commemorate the historic event. The Pope declared a jubilee from 8 December to Pentecost 1966 (later extended to 8 December 1966) to urge all Catholics to study and accept the decisions of the council and apply them in spiritual renewal. He also issued a &quot;motu proprio&quot; reforming the Holy Office. The reform was fairly minor: the office&#x27;s name was changed to Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and procedures were set in place ensuring that theologians accused of deviating from Church teachings would have a hearing before any action was taken against them (a procedural safeguard that did not exist up to that point).

7 December was the day for the promulgation of the 4 remaining schemas: they became the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot;, the decree on the Ministry and Life of Priests &quot;Presbyterorum ordinis&quot;, the decree on the Missionary Activity of the Church &quot;Ad gentes&quot;, and the declaration on religious freedom &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot;.

Before the promulgation, the Council Fathers witnessed a moving moment in the history of Christianity. A Joint Declaration by Pope Paul and Patriarch Athenagoras of Constantinople was read out, deploring the mutual excommunications of 1054 which resulted in the Great Schism between the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, recognizing the responsibility of both parties for the separation and promising to work for complete communion between the two Churches. This was followed by the reading of the Pope&#x27;s Apostolic Letter lifting the Catholic Church&#x27;s excommunication of the Orthodox in 1054. At the same time, in the Patriarchal cathedral in Istanbul, the Joint Declaration was read out in Greek and the Orthodox excommunication of the Catholics was lifted.

8 December: the final day of the council had arrived. A huge crowd, estimated at 300,000 people, gathered in St. Peter&#x27;s Square for an outdoor mass closing the council. The mass was broadcast worldwide by radio and television. The Pope&#x27;s homily was addressed to all humanity because for the Church &quot;no one is a stranger, no one is excluded, no one is distant&quot;.

Mass was followed by a series of messages (in French) addressed to various categories of people, including heads of government, women, workers, young people, and the poor and sick. The Secretary General of the council then read the Apostolic Letter declaring the council concluded, and instructing that &quot;everything the Council decreed be religiously and devoutly observed by all the faithful&quot;. The Pope gave his blessing to all present and dismissed them: &quot;In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, go in peace&quot;. To which all responded with enthusiasm (and probably relief): &quot;Thanks be to God!&quot;

== Documents of the council ==
Vatican II&#x27;s teaching is contained in sixteen documents: 4 constitutions, 9 decrees and 3 declarations. While the constitutions are clearly the documents of highest importance, &quot;the distinction between decrees and declarations, no matter what it originally meant, has become meaningless&quot;.

For each document, approval of the final text was followed a few days later by the pope&#x27;s promulgation of the document as the Church&#x27;s official teaching. On the day of promulgation, there was a second vote of approval by the Council Fathers: it was &quot;basically ceremonial&quot; since the document&#x27;s final text had already been approved a few days earlier. It is this earlier vote that best indicates the degree of support for, or opposition to, the document. Most documents were approved by overwhelming margins. In only 6 cases were the negative votes in the triple digits. In 3 of these cases (Church and Modern World, Non-Christian Religions and Religious Freedom), 10% to 12% of the Fathers rejected the document on theological grounds. In 2 other cases (Media and Christian Education), the negative votes mostly expressed disappointment in a bland text, rather than opposition.

=== Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy ===

&quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, was the blueprint for an extensive reform of the Western liturgy.

Chapter 1 of the Constitution set out principles to guide this reform:
* The Paschal mystery of Christ&#x27;s death and resurrection is made present to us through the liturgy, which is a communal celebration and not just the action of the priest (SC 7). Each person present participates in it according to his/her role (SC 28, 29).
* Christ is present to us not only under the appearance of bread and wine, but also in the Word of God, in the person of the priest and in the gathered assembly (SC 7).
* &quot;The liturgy is the summit toward which the activity of the Church is directed; at the same time it is the font from which all her power flows&quot; (SC 10).
* &quot;In the restoration and promotion of the sacred liturgy, [...] full and active participation by all the people is the aim to be considered before all else&quot; (SC 14).
* In order to be better understood, the rites should be simplified and a limited use of the vernacular is permitted, but the use of Latin is to be preserved (SC 36).
* There needs to be more reading from holy scripture, and it is to be more varied and suitable (SC 35).
* A certain degree of local adaptation is permissible (SC 37-40).

Chapter 2: Mass. The Eucharist is both the sacrifice of Christ&#x27;s body and blood and a paschal banquet (SC 47). In addition to repeating the need for active participation (SC 47), simplification of the rites (SC 50) and a greater variety of Scripture readings (SC 51), the chapter decrees that certain practices that had disappeared, such as the prayer of the faithful (SC 53), concelebration (SC 57), and communion under both kinds for the laity (SC 55), are to be restored under certain conditions, and that the homily should be a commentary on the Scripture readings (SC 52).

Chapter 3: Sacraments. The rite of each sacrament is to be simplified in order to make its meaning clear (SC 62); the catechumenate is to be restored for adult baptism (SC 64); the link between confirmation and baptism is to be made clear (SC 71); the sacrament then called extreme unction is to become a sacrament for those who are seriously ill (anointing of the sick) and not just of those who are on the point of death (SC 73-5); funerals are to focus on the hope of the resurrection and not on mourning (SC 81), and local cultural practices may be included in the celebration of some sacraments such as weddings (SC 63).

Chapters 4 to 7 provide that the divine office (now called Liturgy of the Hours) is to be adapted to modern conditions by reducing its length for those in active ministry (SC 97), that the calendar is to be revised to give Sunday and the mysteries of Christ priority over saints&#x27; days (SC 108), and that, while traditional music forms such as Gregorian chant (SC 116) and organ music (SC 120) are to be preserved, congregational singing is to be encouraged (SC 114) and the use of other instruments is permissible (SC 120).

The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy launched the most extensive revision of the liturgy in the history of the Church.

The invitation for more active, conscious participation of the laity through Mass in the vernacular did not stop with the constitution on the liturgy. It was taken up by the later documents of the council that called for a more active participation of the laity in the life of the Church. Pope Francis referred to a turn away from clericalism toward a new age of the laity.

=== Dogmatic Constitution on the Church ===

The Dogmatic Constitution on the Church () gave direction to several of the documents that followed it, including those on Ecumenism, on Non-Christian Religions, on Religious Freedom, and on The Church in the Modern World (see below). According to Paul VI, &quot;the most characteristic and ultimate purpose of the teachings of the Council&quot; is the universal call to holiness. John Paul II calls this &quot;an intrinsic and essential aspect of [the council Fathers&#x27;] teaching on the Church&quot;, where &quot;all the faithful of Christ of whatever rank or status, are called to the fullness of the Christian life and to the perfection of charity&quot; (&quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, 40). Francis, in his apostolic letter &quot;Evangelii Gaudium&quot; (17) which laid out the programmatic for his pontificate, said that &quot;on the basis of the teaching of the Dogmatic Constitution &quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;&quot; he would discuss the entire People of God which evangelizes, missionary outreach, the inclusion of the poor in society, and peace and dialogue within society. Francis has also followed the call of the council for a more collegial style of leadership, through synods of bishops and through his personal use of a worldwide advisory council of eight cardinals. A most contentious conclusion that seems to follow from the Bishops&#x27; teaching in the decree is that while &quot;in some sense other Christian communities are institutionally defective,&quot; these communities can &quot;in some cases be more effective as vehicles of grace.&quot; Belgian Bishop Emil de Smedt, commenting on institutional defects that had crept into the Catholic church, &quot;contrasted the hierarchical model of the church that embodied the triad of &#x27;clericalism, legalism, and triumphalism&#x27; with one that emphasized the &#x27;people of God&#x27;, filled with the gifts of the Holy Spirit and radically equal in grace,&quot; that was extolled in &quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;.

=== Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation ===
The council&#x27;s document &quot;Dei Verbum&quot; (&quot;The Word of God&quot;) states the principle active in the other council documents that &quot;The study of the sacred page is, as it were, the soul of sacred theology&quot;. It is said of &quot;Dei Verbum&quot; that &quot;arguably it is the most seminal of all the conciliar documents,&quot; with the fruits of a return to the Bible as the foundation of Christian life and teaching, evident in the other council documents. Joseph Ratzinger, who would become Benedict XVI, said of the emphasis on the Bible in the council that prior to Vatican II the theology manuals continued to confuse &quot;propositions about revelation with the content of revelation. It represented not abiding truths of faith, but rather the peculiar characteristics of post-Reformation polemic.&quot; In spite of the guarded approval of biblical scholarship under Pius XII, scholars suspected of Modernism were silenced right up to Vatican II. The council brought a definitive end to the Counter-Reformation and, in a spirit of &quot;aggiornamento&quot;, reached back &quot;behind St. Thomas himself and the Fathers, to the biblical theology which governs the first two chapters of the Constitution on the Church.&quot; &quot;The documents of the Second Vatican Council are shot through with the language of the Bible. ...The church&#x27;s historical journey away from its earlier focus upon these sources was reversed at Vatican II.&quot; For instance, the council&#x27;s document on the liturgy called for a broader use of liturgical texts, which would now be in the vernacular, along with more enlightened preaching on the Bible explaining &quot;the love affair between God and humankind&quot;. The translation of liturgical texts into vernacular languages, the allowance of communion under both kinds for the laity, and the expansion of Scripture readings during the Mass was resonant with the sensibilities of other Christian denominations, thus making the Second Vatican Council &quot;a milestone for Catholic, Protestants, [and] the Orthodox&quot;.

===Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World===

This document, named for its first words &quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; (&quot;Joy and Hope&quot;), built on &quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;&#x27;s understanding of the Church as the &quot;pilgrim people of God&quot; and as &quot;communion&quot;, aware of the long history of the Church&#x27;s teaching and in touch with what it calls the &quot;signs of the times&quot;. It reflects the understanding that Baptism confers on all the task that Jesus entrusted to the Church, to be on mission to the world in ways that the present age can understand, in cooperation with the ongoing work of the Spirit.

===Decrees and declarations on the Church as People of God===

These seven documents apply the teaching contained in the Constitution on the Church to the various categories of people in the Church – bishops, priests, religious, laity, Eastern Catholics – and to Christian education.

The Pastoral Office of Bishops – The decree &quot;Christus Dominus&quot; (&quot;Christ the Lord&quot;, 1965) deals with practical matters concerning bishops and dioceses, on the basis of the theology of the episcopate found in chapter 3 of &quot;Lumen gentium&quot;, including collegiality. It deals with the 3 levels where a bishop exercises his ministry: the universal Church, his own diocese and the national or regional level.

The universal Church (CD 4-10). Since the doctrine of collegiality holds that bishops share with the pope the governance of the universal Church, the decree proposes that there be a council of bishops from around the world to assist the pope in this governance. (It would later be called the Synod of bishops.) And since the true purpose of the Roman Curia is to serve the bishops, it needs to be reorganized and become more international.

The diocese (CD 11-35). The decree gives a job description of the bishop in his ministry as teacher, sanctifier and shepherd. It discusses his relationship to the main office-holders in the diocese, and deals with such practical matters as the need to redraw diocesan boundaries as a result of shifts in population.

The national or regional level (CD 36-44). The decree stresses the need for an intermediate level between the universal Church and the individual diocese: this is the national (or regional) episcopal conference, an institution that did not exist in all countries at the time.

The Ministry and Life of Priests – The decree &quot;Presbyterorum ordinis&quot; (&quot;The order of priests&quot;, 1965) describes priests as &quot;father and teacher&quot; but also &quot;brothers among brothers with all those who have been reborn at the baptismal font.&quot; Priests must &quot;promote the dignity&quot; of the laity, &quot;willingly listen&quot; to them, acknowledge and diligently foster &quot;exalted charisms of the laity&quot;, and &quot;entrust to the laity duties in the service of the Church, allowing them freedom and room for action.&quot; Also, the human and spiritual needs of priests are discussed in detail.

Priestly Training – The decree &quot;Optatam totius&quot; (&quot;Desired [renewal] of the whole [Church]&quot;, 1965) seeks to adapt the training of priests to modern conditions. While some of the points made in the decree are quite traditional, such as the insistence that seminaries remain the main place for priestly training, there are interesting proposals for adaptation to new conditions. The first is that instead of having the program of formation set for the whole Catholic world by the Congregation for Seminaries and Universities in Rome, the bishops of each country may devise a program that is adapted to the needs of their particular country (though it still needs Rome&#x27;s approval). Another is that training for the priesthood has to integrate 3 dimensions: spiritual, intellectual and pastoral.

Spiritual formation aims to produce a mature minister, and to this end may call on the resources of psychology. There are many proposals for improving intellectual formation: the use of modern teaching methods; a better integration of philosophy and theology; the centrality of Scripture in theological studies; knowledge of other religions. Pastoral formation should be present throughout the course of studies and should include practical experience of ministry. Finally, there should be ongoing formation after ordination.
The Adaptation and Renewal of Religious Life – The decree &quot;Perfectae Caritatis&quot; (&quot;Of perfect charity&quot;, 1965) deals with the adaptation of religious life to modern conditions. The decree presupposes the theology of the religious life found in chapter 6 of the Constitution on the Church (&quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;), to which it adds guidelines for renewal. The two basic principles that should guide this renewal are: &quot;the constant return [...] to the original spirit of the institutes and their adaptation to the changed conditions of our time&quot; (PC 2). The decree deals mainly with religious orders, also known as religious institutes (whose members take vows and live a communal life), but touches also societies of common life (whose members take no vows but live a communal life) and secular institutes (whose members take vows but do not share a communal life).

The decree restates well-known views on the religious life, such as the consecrated life as a life of following Christ, the importance of the three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, and the importance of charity in the life of an order. To these it adds a call for every order, whether contemplative or active, to renew itself, as well as specific proposals for adaptation to new conditions, such as the simplification of the religious habit, the importance of education for members of all religious orders (and not just priests), and the need for poverty not just for individual members but for each order as a whole.

The Apostolate of the Laity – The decree &quot;Apostolicam actuositatem&quot; (&quot;Apostolic Activity&quot;, 1965) declares that the apostolate of the laity is &quot;not only to bring the message and grace of Christ to men but also to penetrate and perfect the temporal order with the spirit of the Gospel&quot;, in every field of life, together or through various groups, with respectful cooperation with the Church&#x27;s hierarchy.

The Eastern Catholic Churches – The decree &quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot; (&quot;Of the Eastern Churches&quot;, 1964) deals with the Eastern Catholic Churches, those communities that are in full union with Rome, but have their own distinctive liturgy, customs (such as married priests) and forms of organization (patriarchs and synods). The decree states that they are not simply different rites (as they were commonly called previously) but are &quot;sui iuris&quot; particular Churches along with the much larger Latin Church, and with the same rights as the Latin Church, including the right to govern themselves according to their traditional organizational practices. The decree affirms certain practices typical of the Eastern Churches, such as the administration of confirmation by priests, as well as the possibility of satisfying Sunday obligation by taking part in the Canonical Hours. It also provides guidelines concerning common worship and shared communion between Eastern Catholics and members of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Christian Education – The declaration &quot;Gravissimum educationis&quot; (&quot;Extreme [importance] of education&quot;, 1965) discusses the importance of education (GE 1), of Christian education (GE 2-7), of Catholic schools (GE 8-9) and of Catholic colleges and universities (GE 10-12). Most everything in the declaration had been said many times before: the Church has the right to establish Catholic schools; parents have the right to choose the education they want for their children, governments have a duty to fund Catholic schools; and Catholics have a duty to support Catholic schools.

Many observers found the declaration disappointing: &quot;Even at the last minute, dissatisfaction with the text was widespread and wide-ranging&quot;. It was called &quot;probably the most inferior document produced by the Council&quot;. But as it was late in the 4th session when everyone was under pressure to bring the council&#x27;s business to a close, most bishops chose to vote for the text, though close to 9% rejected it.

===Decrees and declarations on the Church in the world===
These 5 documents deal with the Church in its relationship with the surrounding world: other religious groups – non-Catholic Christians, non-Christians – missionary outreach, religious freedom, and the media. Three of them – on ecumenism, non-Christian religions and religious freedom – were important advances in the Church&#x27;s teaching.

Mission Activity – The decree &quot;Ad gentes&quot; (&quot;To the Nations&quot;, 1965) treats evangelization as the fundamental mission of the Catholic Church, &quot;to bring good news to the poor.&quot; It includes sections on training missionaries and on forming communities.

Ecumenism – The decree &quot;Unitatis redintegratio&quot; (&quot;Restoration of Unity&quot;, 1964) opens with the statement: &quot;The restoration of unity among all Christians is one of the principal concerns of the Second Vatican Council.&quot; This was a reversal of the Church&#x27;s previous position, one of hostility or, at best, indifference to the ecumenical movement, because the Church claimed the only way unity would come about was if the non-Catholics returned to the true Church. The text produced by the Secretariat for Christian Unity said many things Catholics had not heard before:

Instead of showing hostility or indifference to the ecumenical movement, a movement which originated among Protestant and Orthodox Christians, the decree states it was fostered by the Holy Spirit. Instead of repeating the previous prohibition on Catholics taking part in ecumenical activities, the decree states that a concern for unity is an obligation for all Catholics.

Instead of claiming that disunity is the fault of non-Catholic Christians, the decree states that the Catholic Church must accept its share of the blame and ask for forgiveness. Instead of claiming that the Catholic Church is in no need of reform, the decree states that all Christians, including Catholics, must examine their own faithfulness to Christ&#x27;s will, and undertake whatever internal reforms are called for. Ecumenism requires a new attitude, a &quot;change of heart&quot; (UR 7), an interior conversion, on the part of Catholics.

Instead of claiming that only the Catholic Church has the means of salvation, the decree states that non-Catholic Christians have many of the elements of the true Church and, thanks to these, they can achieve salvation. All baptized are members of Christ&#x27;s body. Catholics must get rid of false images of non-Catholics and come to appreciate the riches of their traditions.

Theological experts from both sides should enter into dialogue, in which each side sets out clearly its understanding of the Gospel. It should be remembered there is a hierarchy of truths, that not all teachings are equally central to the faith. Christians of various traditions should pray together, though intercommunion is still not possible, and undertake actions for the common good of humanity.

The last chapter addresses the situation of the Eastern Orthodox and of Protestants. The Orthodox are very close to the Catholic Church: they have valid sacraments and a valid priesthood, and though their customs and liturgical practices are different, this is not an obstacle to unity. Protestants comprise many denominations and their closeness to the Catholic Church varies according to the denomination; however all of them share with Catholics the belief in Jesus as saviour, the Bible, baptism, worship and the effort to lead a moral life.

This new way of considering the issue of Church unity met with great approval at the council and was adopted with very few dissenting voices.

Relation of the Church to Non-Christian Religions – The declaration &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; (&quot;In our time&quot;, 1965), the shortest of Vatican II&#x27;s documents, is a brief commentary on non-Christian religions, with a special section on the Jews. Pope John wanted the council to condemn antisemitism, including any Catholic teaching that might encourage antisemitism. It was felt the way to avoid stirring up trouble in the Middle East was to include the passage on the Jews within a broader document about non-Christian religions.

Avoiding argument or criticism, the declaration points out some positive features of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam. &quot;The Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is holy and true in these religions&quot;; they often &quot;reflect a ray of that truth which enlightens all men and women&quot; (NA 2).

As for the Jews, the declaration says they are very dear to God: &quot;God does not take back the gifts he bestowed or the choice he made&quot; (NA 4). Jews are not rejected or cursed by God because of the death of Jesus: neither all Jews then, nor any Jew today, can be blamed for the death of Jesus. The Church deplores all hatred and antisemitism. And the declaration ends with a condemnation of all forms of discrimination based on religion or ethnicity.
In [the Declaration], a Council for the first time in history acknowledges the search for the absolute by other men and by whole races and peoples, and honours the truth and holiness in other religions as the work of the one living God. [...] Furthermore, in it the Church gives glory to God for his enduring faithfulness towards his chosen people, the Jews.
Better Jewish-Catholic relations have been emphasized since the council.

Religious Freedom – The declaration &quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; (&quot;Of the Dignity of the Human Person&quot;, 1965), &quot;on the right of the person and of communities to social and civil freedom in matters religious&quot;, is the most striking instance of the council&#x27;s staking out a new position.

Traditional Catholic teaching rejected freedom of religion as a basic human right. The argument: only Catholics have the truth and so they alone are entitled to freedom of belief and of practice. All other religions are in error and, since &quot;error has no rights&quot;, other religions have no right to freedom of belief and practice, and Catholic states have the right to suppress them. While it may be prudent to tolerate the existence of other religions in order to avoid civil unrest, this is merely a favour extended to them, not a matter of right. This double standard became increasingly intolerable to many Catholics. Furthermore, Protestants would not believe in the sincerity of Catholics&#x27; involvement in ecumenism, if they continued to support this double standard. Pope John&#x27;s last encyclical, &quot;Pacem in terris&quot; (April 1963), listed freedom of religion among the basic human rights – the first papal document to support freedom of religion – and he wanted Vatican II to address the issue.

&quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; broke with the traditional position and asserted that every human being was entitled to religious freedom. The argument: belief cannot be coerced. Since the Church wants people&#x27;s religious belief to be genuine, people must be left free to see the truth of what is preached. The declaration also appealed to revelation: Jesus did not coerce people to accept his teaching, but invited them to believe, and so did his immediate followers.

Most Council Fathers supported this position, but 11% of them rejected it on the day of the final vote. If this position was true, they said, then the Church&#x27;s previous teaching was wrong, and this was a conclusion they could not accept. The council&#x27;s position on religious freedom raised in an acute way the issue of the development of doctrine: how can later teachings develop out of earlier ones? And how to tell whether a new position is a legitimate development of previous teaching or is heresy?

The Means of Social Communication – The decree &quot;Inter mirifica&quot; (&quot;Among the wonderful [discoveries]&quot;, 1963) addresses issues concerning the press, cinema, television, and other media of communication. Chapter 1 is concerned with the dangers presented by the media, and insists that media producers should ensure that the media offer moral content, that media consumers should avoid media whose content is not moral, and that parents should supervise their children&#x27;s media consumption. Chapter 2 discusses the usefulness of the media for the Church&#x27;s mission: Catholic press and cinema should be promoted, and suitable persons within the Church should be trained in the use of the media.

&quot;The text [is] generally considered to be one of the weakest of the Council.&quot; Rather than improve it, most Council Fathers preferred approving it as is and moving on to more important matters. Some 25% of the Council Fathers voted against it to express their disappointment.

== Impact of Vatican II ==
=== Vatican II was a record-breaking event ===

Vatican II&#x27;s features &quot;are so extraordinary [...] that they set the council apart from its predecessors almost as a different kind of entity&quot;: 
* Its proportions were massive. “It was not the biggest gathering in the sense of number of people assembled at a given moment. But it was the biggest meeting, that is, a gathering with an agenda on which the sustained participation of all parties was required and which resulted in actual decisions. It was a gathering the likes of which had never been seen before”.
* Its breadth was international. It was the first ecumenical council to be truly “ecumenical” (“world-wide”) since it was the first to be attended by bishops originating from all parts of the world, including some 250 native Asian and African bishops. (At Vatican I a century earlier, Asia and Africa were represented by European missionaries.)
* The scope and variety of issues it addressed was unprecedented: The topics discussed ranged from the most fundamental theological issues (such as the nature of the Church or the nature of Revelation) to eminently practical ones (such as nuns&#x27; habits and music in the liturgy), including topics no general Council had addressed before, such as collaboration of the Catholic Church with the concerns of the secular world and the Church&#x27;s relation to non-Christian religions.
* Its style was novel. It inaugurated a new style of conciliar teaching, a style that was called “pastoral” as it avoided anathemas and condemnations.
* Information could be transmitted almost immediately. It was the first general council in the era of mass-circulation newspapers, radio and television. As a result, information (and reactions) could be reported immediately, something beyond the realm of possibility at other ecumenical councils.

=== Importance of Vatican II ===

Its impact on the Church was huge:
* &quot;It was the most important religious event of the twentieth century&quot;.
* “The Second Vatican Council was the most significant event in the history of Catholicism since the Protestant Reformation”.
* “Vatican II was the single most important event for Catholicism in four centuries, since the Council of Trent”.
* &quot;The sixteen documents of the Second Vatican Council are the most important texts produced by the Catholic Church in the past four hundred years&quot;.

In declaring the period from October 2012 to the end of November 2013 to be a &quot;Year of Faith&quot; to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of Vatican II, pope Benedict XVI wanted it to be

=== Key Developments due to Vatican II ===
According to theologian Adrian Hastings, the key theological and practical developments due to Vatican II are of 3 kinds:

1. New general orientations and basic themes found throughout the documents:
* The Church defined as People of God
* The Eucharist as centre of the Church and its unity
* The primacy of Scripture in theory and in practice
* The beneficial nature of diversity: ecclesial (the Church as a communion of “churches”), liturgical, and theological (diversity “even in the theological elaborations of revealed truth”) 
* Other Christians understood as being in [imperfect] communion with the Church
* The concern for secular human values, with justice and peace.

2. Specific texts that contain a recognizable shift from pre-conciliar teaching:
* The text on the collegiality of bishops (&quot;Lumen Gentium&quot; 22)
* The statement that the unique Church of Christ “subsists” in the Catholic Church (&quot;Lumen Gentium&quot; 8)
* The statement that “the Churches of the East, as much as those of the West, fully enjoy the right to rule themselves” (&quot;Orientalium Ecclesiarum&quot; 5 and &quot;Unitatis Redintegratio&quot; 16)
* The recognition and commendation of the ministry of married priests in the Eastern Churches (&quot;Presbyterorum Ordinis&quot; 16) 
* The recognition that every person has the right to religious freedom (&quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot; 2)
* The condemnation of anti-Semitism (&quot;Nostra aetate&quot; 4)
* The condemnation of mass destruction in war (&quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; 80)
* The statement that “parents themselves should ultimately make the judgment” as to the size of their family (&quot;Gaudium et Spes&quot; 50).

3. Practical decisions requiring new institutions or new behaviour:
* The use of the vernacular in the liturgy
* The restoration of communion under both kinds for the laity
* The restoration of concelebration
* The restoration of the diaconate as a permanent order open to married men
* The [limited] possibility of sharing in the worship (including communion) of a Church other than one’s own
* The instruction to establish national or regional Episcopal Conferences with authority and responsibilities
* The recommendation to establish an agency of the universal Church to “foster progress in needy regions and social justice on the international scene”.

=== Some changes resulting from Vatican II ===

The council addressed relations between the Catholic Church and the modern world. Several changes resulting from the council include the renewal of consecrated life with a revised charism, ecumenical efforts with other Christian denominations, interfaith dialogue with other religions, and the universal call to holiness, which according to Paul VI was &quot;the most characteristic and ultimate purpose of the teachings of the Council&quot;.

According to Pope Benedict XVI, the most important and essential message of the council was &quot;the Paschal Mystery as the center of what it is to be Christian and therefore of the Christian life, the Christian year, the Christian seasons&quot;. Other changes that followed the council included the widespread use of vernacular languages in the Mass instead of Latin, the allowance of communion under both kinds for the laity, the subtle disuse of ornate clerical regalia, the revision of Eucharistic (liturgical) prayers, the abbreviation of the liturgical calendar, the ability to celebrate the Mass (with the officiant facing the congregation), as well as (facing the &quot;East&quot; and the Crucifix), and modern aesthetic changes encompassing contemporary Catholic liturgical music and artwork. With many of these changes resonating with the perspectives of other Christian denominations who sent observers to the Second Vatican Council, it was an ecumenical &quot;milestone for Catholics, Protestants, [and] the Orthodox&quot;. These changes, while praised by many faithful Catholics, remain divisive among those identifying as traditionalist Catholics.

&quot;Dignitatis humanae&quot;, authored largely by United States theologian John Courtney Murray, challenged the council fathers to find &quot;reasons for religious freedom&quot; in which they believed, and drew from scripture scholar John L. McKenzie the comment: &quot;The Church can survive the disorder of development better than she can stand the living death of organized immobility.&quot; 

As a result of the reforms of Vatican II, on 15 August 1972 Paul issued the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ministeria Quaedam&quot; which in effect suppressed the minor orders and replaced them with two instituted ministries, those of lector and acolyte. A major difference was: &quot;Ministries may be assigned to lay Christians; hence they are no longer to be considered as reserved to candidates for the sacrament of orders.&quot;

== Controversies ==
=== Validity of the Council ===

Some Traditionalist Catholics claim that several council statements conflict with established teaching regarding faith, morals and doctrine, and are therefore in error. As a result, they say, Vatican II is invalid.

The largest of the traditionalist groups rejecting the validity of Vatican II is the Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), which recognizes the authority of the Pope but rejects the validity of the Second Vatican Council. In 1988, the SSPX faced a conflict with Pope John Paul II over the consecration of bishops (Écône consecrations), which led to disputed canonical sanctions. This event has been a subject of ongoing debate within the Catholic community regarding the validity of any purported excommunications

Other groups have gone further than the SSPX and have declared that the Holy See has been vacant since the death of Pope Pius XII (sedevacantism) or that all the Pontiffs since Pope John XXIII are popes materially but not formally (sedeprivationism). The most notable of these groups are the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen and the Institute Mater Boni Consilii.

=== Authority of the council&#x27;s teaching ===
Since Vatican II issued no dogmatic definitions or anathemas, in accordance with the wishes of Pope John XXIII expressed particularly in his opening address to the Council, it would be easy to conclude that, apart from where it repeats teaching that was already infallible before the Council, the Council&#x27;s teaching is not binding, and that a Catholic is free to accept it or reject it.

This issue was addressed by Pope Paul VI five weeks after the end of the council in the talk he gave at his general audience of 12 January 1966:

There are those who ask what is the authority, the theological qualification, that the Council wished to attribute to its teachings, knowing that it avoided giving solemn dogmatic definitions engaging the infallibility of the ecclesiastical magisterium. And the answer is known to those who recall the conciliar declaration of March 6, 1964, repeated on November 16, 1964: given the pastoral character of the Council, it avoided proclaiming in an extraordinary way dogmas endowed with the note of infallibility; but it nevertheless endowed its teachings with the authority of the supreme ordinary magisterium, and this ordinaryand obviously authenticmagisterium must be accepted docilely and sincerely by all the faithful, according to the mind of the Council regarding the nature and purposes of the individual documents.

The issue is also addressed by the Code of Canon Law. While the 1917 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot;, in force in the Latin Church at the time of the council, simply stated &quot;An Ecumenical Council enjoys supreme power over the universal Church,&quot; the 1983 &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; states that Catholics may not disregard the teaching of an ecumenical council even if it does not propose its teaching as definitive: 
Although not an assent of faith, a religious submission of the intellect and will must be given to a Doctrine which the Supreme Pontiff or the College of Bishops declares concerning faith or morals when they exercise the authentic Magisterium, even if they do not intend to proclaim it by definitive act; therefore, the Christian faithful are to take care to avoid those things which do not agree with it.

=== &quot;The Spirit of Vatican II&quot; ===
By &quot;the spirit of Vatican II&quot; is often meant promoting teachings and intentions attributed to the Second Vatican Council in ways not limited to literal readings of its documents, spoken of as the &quot;letter&quot; of the council (cf. Saint Paul&#x27;s phrase, &quot;the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life&quot;). However, Cardinal Joseph Zen has pushed back, that &quot;it is nonsense to talk about the spirit of the Council, if you ignore the Documents of the Council.&quot;

Bishop John Tong Hon of Hong Kong used this expression with regard merely to an openness to dialogue with others, saying: &quot;We are guided by the spirit of Vatican II: only dialogue and negotiation can solve conflicts.&quot; 

In contrast, academic Michael Novak who had covered Vatican II as a journalist described it as a spirit that
sometimes soared far beyond the actual, hard-won documents and decisions of Vatican II. ...It was as though the world (or at least the history of the Church) were now to be divided into only two periods, pre-Vatican II and post-Vatican II. Everything &quot;pre&quot; was then pretty much dismissed, so far as its &quot;authority&quot; mattered. For the most extreme, to be a Catholic now meant to believe more or less anything one wished to believe, or at least in the sense in which one personally interpreted it. One could be a Catholic &quot;in spirit&quot;. One could take &quot;Catholic&quot; to mean the &#x27;culture&#x27; in which one was born, rather than to mean a creed making objective and rigorous demands. One could imagine Rome as a distant and irrelevant anachronism, embarrassment, even adversary. Rome as &quot;them&quot;. 
From another perspective, Church historian John W. O&#x27;Malley writes: 
For the new churches it recommended adaptation to local cultures, including philosophical and theological adaptation. It also recommended that Catholic missionaries seek ways of cooperating with missionaries of other faiths and of fostering harmonious relations with them. It asserted that art from every race and country be given scope in the liturgy of the church. More generally, it made clear that the church was sympathetic to the way of life of different peoples and races and was ready to appropriate aspects of different cultural traditions. Though obvious-sounding, these provisions were portentous. Where would they lead?

== Legacy ==

=== Vatican II participants who later became pope ===

<doc id="28135" wikidata="Q9063" url="?curid=28135" title="Slovene language">
<text>Slovene ( or ) or Slovenian ( ; ) is a South Slavic language of the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. Most of its 2.5 million speakers are the inhabitants of Slovenia, the majority of them ethnic Slovenes. As Slovenia is part of the European Union, Slovene is also one of its 24 official and working languages. Its grammar is highly fusional, and it has a dual grammatical number, an archaic feature shared with some other Indo-European languages. Two accentual norms (one characterized by pitch accent) are used. Its flexible word order is often adjusted for emphasis or stylistic reasons, although basically it is an SVO language. It has a T–V distinction: the use of the V-form demonstrates a respectful attitude towards superiors and the elderly, while it can be sidestepped through the passive form.

==Standard Slovene==

Standard Slovene is the national standard language that was formed in the 18th and 19th centuries, based on the Upper and Lower Carniolan dialect groups, more specifically on the language of Ljubljana and adjacent areas. The Lower Carniolan dialect group was the dialect used in the 16th century by Primož Trubar for his writings, while he also used Slovene as spoken in Ljubljana, since he lived in the city for more than 20 years. It was the speech of Ljubljana that Trubar took as a foundation of what later became standard Slovene, with small addition of his native speech, the Lower Carniolan dialect. Trubar&#x27;s choice was also later adopted by other Protestant writers in the 16th century, and ultimately led to the formation of a more standard language. The Upper dialect was also used by most authors during the language revival in the 18th and early 19th centuries, and was also the language spoken by France Prešeren, who, like most Slovene writers and poets, lived and worked in Ljubljana, where the speech was growing closer to the Upper Carniolan dialect group. Unstandardized dialects are better preserved in regions of the Slovene Lands where compulsory schooling was in languages other than Standard Slovene, as was the case with the Carinthian Slovenes in Austria, and the Slovene minority in Italy. For example, the Resian and Torre (Ter) dialects in the Italian Province of Udine differ most from other Slovene dialects.

==Classification==
Slovene is an Indo-European language belonging to the Western subgroup of the South Slavic branch of the Slavic languages, together with Serbo-Croatian. It is close to the Chakavian and especially Kajkavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian, but genealogically more distant from the Shtokavian dialect, the basis for the Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian standard languages. Slovene in general, and Prekmurje Slovene in particular, shares the highest level of mutual intelligibility with transitional Kajkavian dialects of Hrvatsko Zagorje and Međimurje. Furthermore, Slovene shares certain linguistic characteristics with all South Slavic languages, including those of the Eastern subgroup, namely Bulgarian, Macedonian, and Torlakian dialects.

Mutual intelligibility with varieties of Serbo-Croatian is hindered by differences in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, Kajkavian being firmly the most mutually intelligible. Slovene has some commonalities with the West Slavic languages that are not found in other South Slavic languages.

== History ==

===Early history===
Like all Slavic languages, Slovene traces its roots to the same proto-Slavic group of languages that produced Old Church Slavonic. The earliest known examples of a distinct, written dialect connected to Slovene are from the &quot;Freising manuscripts&quot;, known in Slovene as . The consensus estimate of their date of origin is between 972 and 1039 CE (most likely before 1000). These religious writings are among the oldest surviving manuscripts in any Slavic language.

The &quot;Freising manuscripts&quot; are a record of a proto-Slovene that was spoken in a more scattered territory than modern Slovene, which included most of the present-day Austrian states of Carinthia and Styria, as well as East Tyrol, the Val Pusteria in South Tyrol, and some areas of Upper and Lower Austria.

By the 15th century, most of the northern areas were gradually Germanized: the northern border of the Slovene-speaking territory stabilized on the line going from north of Klagenfurt to south of Villach and east of Hermagor in Carinthia, while in Styria it was more or less identical with the current Austrian-Slovenian border.

This linguistic border remained almost unchanged until the late 19th century, when a second process of Germanization took place, mostly in Carinthia. Between the 9th and 12th century, proto-Slovene spread into northern Istria and in the areas around Trieste.

During most of the Middle Ages, Slovene was a vernacular language of the peasantry, although it was also spoken in most of the towns on Slovenian territory, together with German or Italian. Although during this time German emerged as the spoken language of the nobility, Slovene had some role in the courtly life of the Carinthian, Carniolan, and Styrian nobility as well. This is proved by the survival of certain ritual formulas in Slovene (such as the ritual installation of the Dukes of Carinthia). The words (&#x27;God be With You, Queen Venus!&#x27;), with which Bernhard von Spanheim greeted the poet Ulrich von Liechtenstein, who was travelling around Europe in guise of Venus, upon his arrival in Carinthia in 1227 (or 1238), is another example of some level of Slovene knowledge among high nobility in the region.

The first printed Slovene words, (meaning &#x27;old justice&#x27; or &#x27;old laws&#x27;), appeared in 1515 in Vienna in a poem of the German mercenaries who suppressed the Slovene peasant revolt: the term was presented as the peasants&#x27; motto and battle cry. Standard Slovene emerged in the second half of the 16th century, thanks to the works of Slovene Lutheran authors, who were active during the Protestant Reformation. The most prominent authors from this period are Primož Trubar, who wrote the first books in Slovene; Adam Bohorič, the author of the first Slovene grammar; and Jurij Dalmatin, who translated the entire Bible into Slovene.

From the high Middle Ages up to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, in the territory of present-day Slovenia, German was the language of the elite, and Slovene was the language of the common people. During this period, German had a strong influence on Slovene; many Germanisms are preserved in contemporary colloquial Slovene. Many Slovene scientists before the 1920s also wrote in foreign languages, mostly German, which was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of science throughout Central Europe at the time.

===Recent history===
During the rise of Romantic nationalism in the 19th century, the cultural movements of Illyrism and Pan-Slavism brought words from Serbo-Croatian, specifically Croatian dialects, and Czech into standard Slovene, mostly to replace words previously borrowed from German. Most of these innovations have remained, although some were dropped in later development. In the second half of the 19th century, many nationalist authors made an abundant use of Serbo-Croatian words: among them were Fran Levstik and Josip Jurčič, who wrote the first novel in Slovene in 1866. This tendency was reversed in the Fin de siècle period by the first generation of modernist Slovene authors (most notably the writer Ivan Cankar), who resorted to a more &quot;pure&quot; and simple language without excessive Serbo-Croatian borrowings.

During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in the 1920s and 1930s, the influence of Serbo-Croatian increased again. This was opposed by the younger generations of Slovene authors and intellectuals; among the fiercest opponents of an excessive Serbo-Croatian influence on Slovene were the intellectuals associated with the leftist journal &quot;Sodobnost&quot;, as well as some younger Catholic activists and authors. After 1945, numerous Serbo-Croatian words that had been used in the previous decades were dropped. The result was that a Slovene text from the 1910s is frequently closer to modern Slovene than a text from the 1920s and 1930s.

Between 1920 and 1941, the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was defined as &quot;Serbo-Croato-Slovene&quot;, which was in practice merely Serbo-Croatian. In Slovenia, however, Slovene remained in use in education and administration. Many state institutions used only Serbo-Croatian, and a Slovene–Serbo-Croatian bilingualism was applied in many spheres of public life in Slovenia. For example, at post offices, on railways, and in administrative offices, Serbo-Croatian was used alongside Slovene. However, state employees were expected to be able to speak Slovene in Slovenia.

During the same time, western Slovenia (the Slovenian Littoral and the western districts of Inner Carniola) was under Italian administration and subjected to a violent policy of Fascist Italianization; the same policy was applied to Slovene speakers in Venetian Slovenia, Gorizia, and Trieste. Between 1923 and 1943, all public use of Slovene in these territories was strictly prohibited, and Slovene-language activists were persecuted by the state.

After the Carinthian Plebiscite of 1920, a less severe policy of Germanization took place in the Slovene-speaking areas of southern Carinthia which remained under Austrian administration. After the Anschluss of 1938, the use of Slovene was strictly forbidden in Carinthia as well. This accelerated a process of language shift in Carinthia, which continued throughout the second half of the 20th century: according to the Austro-Hungarian census of 1910, around 21% of inhabitants of Carinthia spoke Slovene in their daily communication; by 1951, this figure had dropped to less than 10%, and by 2001 to a mere 2.8%.

During World War II, Slovenia was divided among the Axis Powers of Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, and Hungary. Each of the occupying powers tried to either discourage or entirely suppress Slovene.

Following World War II, Slovenia became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Slovene was one of the official languages of the federation. In the territory of Slovenia, it was commonly used in almost all areas of public life. One important exception was the Yugoslav army, where Serbo-Croatian was used exclusively, even in Slovenia.

National independence has further fortified the language: since 1991, when Slovenia gained independence, Slovene has been used as an official language in all areas of public life. In 2004, it became one of the official languages of the European Union upon the admission of Slovenia.

Nonetheless, the post-breakup influence of Serbo-Croatian on Slovene continued to a lesser extent, most prominently in slang in colloquial language.

Joža Mahnič, a literary historian and president of the publishing house , said in February 2008 that Slovene is a language rich enough to express everything, including the most sophisticated and specialised texts. In February 2010, Janez Dular, a prominent Slovene linguist, commented that, although Slovene is not an endangered language, its scope has been shrinking, especially in science and higher education.

== Geographic distribution ==
The language is spoken by about 2.5 million people, mainly in Slovenia, but also by Slovene national minorities in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy (around 90,000 in Venetian Slovenia, Resia Valley, Canale Valley, Province of Trieste, and in those municipalities of the Province of Gorizia bordering Slovenia), in southern Carinthia, some parts of Styria in Austria (25,000), and in the western part of Croatian Istria bordering Slovenia. It is also spoken in Rijeka and Zagreb (11,800-13,100), in southwestern Hungary (3–5,000), in Serbia (5,000), and by the Slovene diaspora throughout Europe and the rest of the world (around 300,000), particularly in the United States (most notably Ohio, home to an estimated 3,400 speakers), Canada, Argentina, Australia, and South Africa.

==Dialects==

Slovene is sometimes characterized as the most diverse Slavic language in terms of its dialects, with different degrees of mutual intelligibility. Accounts of the number of dialects range from as few as seven dialects, often considered dialect groups or dialect bases that are further subdivided into as many as 50 dialects. Other sources characterize the number of dialects as nine or eight. The Slovene proverb &quot;Every village has its own voice&quot; () depicts the differences in dialects.

The Prekmurje dialect used to have a written norm of its own at one point. The Resian dialects have an independent written norm that is used by their regional state institutions. Speakers of those two dialects have considerable difficulties with being understood by speakers of other varieties of Slovene, needing to code-switch to Standard Slovene. Other dialects are mutually intelligible when speakers avoid the excessive usage of regionalisms.

Regionalisms are mostly limited to culinary and agricultural expressions, although there are many exceptions. Some loanwords have become so deeply rooted in the local language that people have considerable difficulties in finding a standard expression for the dialect term (for instance, meaning a type of custard cake is in Standard Slovene, but the latter term is very rarely used in speech, being considered inappropriate for non-literary registers). Southwestern dialects incorporate many calques and loanwords from Italian, whereas eastern and northwestern dialects are replete with lexemes of German origin. Usage of such words hinders intelligibility between dialects and is greatly discouraged in formal situations.

==Phonology==

Slovene has a phoneme set consisting of 21 consonants and 8 vowels.

=== Consonants ===
Slovene has 21 distinctive consonant phonemes.

All voiced obstruents are devoiced at the end of words unless immediately followed by a word beginning with a vowel or a voiced consonant. In consonant clusters, the voicing distinction is neutralized and all consonants assimilate the voicing of the rightmost segment, i.e., the final consonant in the cluster. In this context, , , and may occur as voiced allophones of , , and , respectively (e.g., ).

 has several allophones depending on context.
* Before a vowel, pronunciation is labiodental, (also described as ).
* After a vowel, pronunciation is bilabial and forms a diphthong.
* At the beginning of a syllable, before a consonant (e.g., in &quot;all&quot;), the pronunciation varies more widely by speaker and area. Many speakers convert into a full vowel in this position. For those speakers who retain a consonantal pronunciation, it is pronounced before a voiced consonant and before a voiceless consonant. Thus, may be pronounced as disyllabic or monosyllabic .

The sequences , , and occur only before a vowel. Before a consonant or word-finally, they are reduced to , , and , respectively. This is reflected in the spelling in the case of , but not for and .

Under certain (somewhat unpredictable) circumstances, at the end of a syllable may become , merging with the allophone of in that position.

=== Vowels ===
Slovene has an eight-vowel (or, according to Peter Jurgec, nine-vowel) system, in comparison to the five-vowel system of Serbo-Croatian.

== Grammar ==
===Nouns===

Slovene nouns retain six of the seven Slavic noun cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, locative, and instrumental. There is no distinct vocative; the nominative is used in that role. Nouns, adjectives, and pronouns have three numbers: singular, dual, and plural.

Nouns in Slovene are either masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. In addition, there is a distinction between animate and inanimate nouns. This is only relevant for masculine nouns and only in the singular, at odds with some other Slavic languages, e.g., Russian, for which it is also relevant in the plural for all genders. Animate nouns have an accusative singular form that is identical to the genitive, while for inanimate nouns the accusative singular is the same as the nominative. Animacy is based mostly on semantics and is less rigid than gender. Generally speaking, a noun is animate if it refers to something that is generally thought to have free will or the ability to move of its own accord. This includes all nouns for people and animals. All other nouns are inanimate, including plants and other non-moving life forms, and also groups of people or animals. However, there are some nouns for inanimate objects that are generally animate, which mostly include inanimate objects that are named after people or animals. This includes:
* Dead people or animals
* Makes of cars
* Certain diseases (named after animals)
* Certain devices (named after animals or people)
* Works of art (named after their creator)
* Chess pieces and playing cards (named for the people they represent)
* Wines and mushrooms (named as demonyms)

===Definiteness===
There are no definite or indefinite articles as in English (&quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;) or German (). A noun is described without articles; the grammatical gender is shown by the ending of the word. It is enough to say (&#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;the barge&#x27;), (&#x27;Noah&#x27;s ark&#x27;). The gender is known in this case to be feminine. In declensions, endings are normally changed; see below. If one would like to somehow distinguish between the definiteness or indefiniteness of a noun, one would say (&#x27;that/precise/exact barge&#x27;) for &#x27;the barge&#x27; and (&#x27;some/a barge&#x27;) for &#x27;a barge&#x27;.

The definiteness of a noun phrase can also be discerned through the ending of the accompanying adjective. One should say (&#x27;[exactly that] red tent&#x27;) or (&#x27;[a] red tent&#x27;). This difference is observable only for masculine nouns in nominative or accusative case. Because of the lack of article in Slovene and audibly insignificant difference between the masculine adjective forms, most dialects do not distinguish between definite and indefinite variants of the adjective, leading to hypercorrection when speakers try to use Standard Slovene.

===T–V distinction===
Slovene, like most other European languages, has a T–V distinction, or two forms of &#x27;you&#x27; for formal and informal situations. Although informal address using the 2nd person singular form (known as ) is officially limited to friends and family, talk among children, and addressing animals, it is increasingly used among the middle generation to signal a relaxed attitude or lifestyle instead of its polite or formal counterpart using the 2nd person plural form (known as ).

An additional nonstandard but widespread use of a singular participle combined with a plural auxiliary verb (known as ) signals a somewhat more friendly and less formal attitude while maintaining politeness:

* (&#x27;You did not see him&#x27;: both the auxiliary verb and the participle are plural masculine. Standard usage.)
* (&#x27;You did not see him&#x27;: the auxiliary verb is plural but the participle is singular masculine/feminine. Nonstandard usage.)

The use of nonstandard forms () might be frowned upon by many people and would not likely be used in a formal setting.

The use of the 3rd person plural (&#x27;they&#x27;) form (known as in both direct address and indirect reference; this is similar to using in German) as an ultra-polite form is now archaic or dialectal. It is associated with servant-master relationships in older literature, the child-parent relationship in certain conservative rural communities, and parishioner-priest relationships.

== Vocabulary ==

===Numbers===
===Foreign words===
Foreign words used in Slovene are of various types depending on the assimilation they have undergone. The types are:
* (loanword)fully assimilated; e.g., (&#x27;pizza&#x27;).
* (foreign word)partly assimilated, either in writing and syntax or in pronunciation; e.g., &quot;jazz&quot;, &quot;wiki&quot;.
* (half-quoted word or phrase) – partly assimilated, either in writing and syntax or in pronunciation; e.g., &quot;Shakespeare&quot;, but in genitive case.
* (quoted word or phrase)kept as in original, although pronunciation may be altered to fit into speech flow; e.g., &quot;first lady&quot; in all cases.
The loanwords are mostly from German and Italian, while the more recently borrowed and less assimilated words are typically from English.

== Writing system ==

This alphabet () was derived in the mid-1840s from the system created by the Croatian linguist Ljudevit Gaj. Intended for the Serbo-Croatian language (in all its varieties), it was patterned on the Czech alphabet of the 1830s. Before that was, for example, written as , , or ; as , , , or ; sometimes as as a relic from the now-modern Russian yery character, which is itself usually transliterated as ; as ; as ; as ; as , , or .

The standard Slovene orthography, employed in almost all situations, uses only the letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet plus , , and . The letters , , , and are not included:

The orthography thus underdifferentiates several phonemic distinctions:

* Stress, vowel length and tone are not distinguished, except with optional diacritics when it is necessary to distinguish between similar words with a different meaning.
* The two distinct mid-vowels are also not distinguished, both written as simply and .
* The schwa is also written as . However, the combination is written as simply between consonants and is thus distinguishable.
* Vocalized &quot;l&quot; is written also as , but cannot be predictably distinguished from in that position.

In the tonemic varieties of Slovene, the ambiguity is even greater: in a final syllable can stand for any of (although is rare; and Slovene, except in some dialects, does not distinguished tonemic accentuation).

The reader is expected to gather the interpretation of the word from the context, as in these examples:
** gȍł &quot;naked&quot;
** gọ̑l &quot;goal&quot;
** jésen &quot;ash tree&quot;
** jesẹ̑n &quot;autumn&quot;
** kọ́t &quot;angle&quot;
** kot &quot;as&quot;
** med &quot;between&quot;
** mẹ̑d &quot;honey&quot;
** pọ̑l &quot;pole&quot;
** pọ̑ł &quot;half&quot;
** prȅcej &quot;at once&quot; (archaic)
** precẹ̑j or precȅj &quot;a great deal (of)&quot;

===Diacritics===

To compensate for the shortcomings of the standard orthography, Slovene also uses standardized diacritics or accent marks to denote stress, vowel length, and pitch accent, much like the closely related Serbo-Croatian. However, as in Serbo-Croatian, use of such accent marks is restricted to dictionaries, language textbooks, and linguistic publications. In normal writing, the diacritics are almost never used, except in a few minimal pairs where real ambiguity could arise.

Two different and mutually-incompatible systems of diacritics are used. The first is the simpler non-tonemic system, which can be applied to all Slovene dialects. It is more widely used and is the standard representation in dictionaries such as SSKJ. The tonemic system also includes tone as part of the representation. However, neither system reliably distinguishes schwa from the front mid-vowels, nor vocalised l from regular l . Some sources, such as Maks Pleteršnik&#x27;s 1894/95 dictionary, write these as &quot;ə&quot; and &quot;ł&quot;, respectively, but this is not as common.

====Non-tonemic diacritics====
In the non-tonemic system, the distinction between the two mid-vowels is indicated, as well as the placement of stress and the length of vowels:

* Long stressed vowels are notated with an acute diacritic: (IPA: ).
* However, the rarer long stressed low-mid vowels and are notated with a circumflex: .
* Short stressed vowels are notated with a grave: (IPA: ). Some systems may also include for .

====Tonemic diacritics====
The tonemic system uses the diacritics somewhat differently from the non-tonemic system. The high-mid vowels and are written with a subscript dot, while the low-mid vowels and are written as plain .

Pitch accent and vowel length is indicated by four diacritical marks:

* The acute ( ´ ) indicates long and low pitch: (IPA: ).
* The inverted breve (  ̑ ) indicates long and high pitch: (IPA: ).
* The grave ( ` ) indicates short and low pitch. This occurs only on (IPA: ), optionally written as .
* The double grave (  ̏ ) indicates short and high pitch: (IPA: ). is also used for , optionally written as .

The schwa vowel is written ambiguously as , but its accentuation will sometimes distinguish it: a long vowel mark can never appear on a schwa, while a grave accent can appear only on a schwa. Thus, only and unstressed are truly ambiguous.

==Regulation==
Standard Slovene spelling and grammar are defined by the Orthographic Committee and the Fran Ramovš Institute of the Slovene Language, which are both part of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (, SAZU). The newest reference book of standard Slovene spelling (and to some extent also grammar) is the (&quot;SP2001&quot;; Slovene Normative Guide). The latest printed edition was published in 2001 (reprinted in 2003 with some corrections) and contains more than 130,000 dictionary entries. In 2003, an electronic version was published.

The official dictionary of modern Slovene, which was also prepared by SAZU, is (&quot;SSKJ&quot;; Standard Slovene Dictionary). It was published in five volumes by Državna Založba Slovenije between 1970 and 1991 and contains more than 100,000 entries and subentries with accentuation, part-of-speech labels, common collocations, and various qualifiers. In the 1990s, an electronic version of the dictionary was published and is available online.

The SAZU considers SP2001 to be the normative source on Slovene. When dictionary entries in SP2001 and SSKJ differ, the SP2001 entry takes precedence. SP2001 is called a Spelling Dictionary by the European Network of e-Lexicography.

<doc id="28136" wikidata="Q9058" url="?curid=28136" title="Slovak language">
<text>Slovak ( ; endonym: or ), is a West Slavic language of the Czech–Slovak group, written in Latin script. It is part of the Indo-European language family, and is one of the Slavic languages, which are part of the larger Balto-Slavic branch. Spoken by approximately 5 million people as a native language, primarily ethnic Slovaks, it serves as the official language of Slovakia and one of the 24 official languages of the European Union.

Slovak is closely related to Czech, to the point of very high mutual intelligibility, as well as to Polish. Like other Slavic languages, Slovak is a fusional language with a complex system of morphology and relatively flexible word order. Its vocabulary has been extensively influenced by Latin and German, as well as other Slavic languages.

==History==

The Czech–Slovak group developed within West Slavic in the high medieval period, and the standardization of Czech and Slovak within the Czech–Slovak dialect continuum emerged in the early modern period. In the later mid-19th century, the modern Slovak alphabet and written standard became codified by Ľudovít Štúr and reformed by Martin Hattala. The Moravian dialects spoken in the western part of the country along the border with the Czech Republic are also sometimes classified as Slovak, although some of their western variants are closer to Czech; they nonetheless form the bridge dialects between the two languages.

==Geographic distribution and status==

Slovak language is primarily spoken in Slovakia. The country&#x27;s constitution declared it the official language of the state (štátny jazyk):
 

Constitution of Slovakia, Article 6.

Beside that, national minorities and ethnic groups also have explicit permission to use their distinct languages. Slovakia is a country with established Language policy concerning its official language.

===Regulation===
Standard Slovak () is defined by an Act of Parliament on the State Language of the Slovak Republic (language law). According to this law, the Ministry of Culture approves and publishes the codified form of Slovak based on the judgment of specialised Slovak linguistic institutes and specialists in the area of the state language. This is traditionally the Ľudovít Štúr Institute of Linguistics, which is part of the Slovak Academy of Sciences. In practice, the Ministry of Culture publishes a document that specifies authoritative reference books for standard Slovak usage, which is called the codification handbook (). The current regulations were published on 15 March 2021. There are four such publications:
* &quot;, 2013; (orthographic rules)
* &quot;, 2020; (dictionary)
* &quot;, 2009; (pronunciation)
* &quot;, 1966; (morphology)

Slovak speakers are also found in the Slovak diaspora in the United States, the Czech Republic, Argentina, Serbia, Ireland, Romania, Poland, Canada, Hungary, Germany, Croatia, Israel, the United Kingdom, Australia, Austria, Ukraine, Norway, and other countries to a lesser extent. 

Slovak language is one of the official languages of Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.

*Békéscsaba, &#x27;Szlovák Gimnázium, Általános Iskola, Óvoda és Kollégium&#x27;

*Kovačica, &#x27;Gimnazija Mihailo Pupin&#x27; 
*Nădlac, &#x27;Liceul Teoretic Jozef Gregor Tajovský&#x27;

==Dialects==

There are many Slovak dialects, which are divided into the following four basic groups:
*Western Slovak dialects (Trenčín, Trnava, Nitra, Záhorie)
*Central Slovak dialects (in Liptov, Orava, Turiec, Tekov, Hont, Novohrad, Gemer and around Zvolen.)
*Eastern Slovak dialects (in Spiš, Šariš, Zemplín and Abov)

*Lowland (dolnozemské) Slovak dialects (outside Slovakia in the Pannonian Plain in Serbian Vojvodina, and in southeastern Hungary, western Romania, and the Croatian part of Syrmia)

The fourth group of dialects is often not considered a separate group, but a subgroup of Central and Western Slovak dialects (see e.g. Štolc, 1968), but it is currently undergoing changes due to contact with surrounding languages (Serbo-Croatian, Romanian, and Hungarian) and long-time geographical separation from Slovakia (see the studies in &quot;Zborník Spolku vojvodinských slovakistov&quot;, e.g. Dudok, 1993).

The dialect groups differ mostly in phonology, vocabulary, and tonal inflection. Syntactic differences are minor. Central Slovak forms the basis of the present-day standard language. Not all dialects are fully mutually intelligible. It may be difficult for an inhabitant of the western Slovakia to understand a dialect from eastern Slovakia and the other way around.

The dialects are fragmented geographically, separated by numerous mountain ranges. The first three groups already existed in the 10th century. All of them are spoken by the Slovaks outside Slovakia, and central and western dialects form the basis of the lowland dialects (see above).

The western dialects contain features common with the Moravian dialects in the Czech Republic, the southern central dialects contain a few features common with South Slavic languages, and the eastern dialects a few features common with Polish and the East Slavonic languages (cf. Štolc, 1994). Lowland dialects share some words and areal features with the languages surrounding them (Serbo-Croatian, Hungarian, and Romanian).

==Phonology==
Slovak contains 15 vowel phonemes (11 monophthongs and four diphthongs) and 29 consonants. 

The phoneme /æ/ is marginal and often merges with /e/; the two are normally only distinguished in higher registers. 

Vowel length is phonemic in Slovak and both short and long vowels have the same quality. In addition, Slovak, unlike Czech, employs a &quot;rhythmic law&quot; which forbids two long vowels from following one another within the same word. In such cases the second vowel is shortened. For example, adding the locative plural ending to the root creates , not . This law also applies to diphthongs; for example, the adjective meaning &quot;white&quot; is , not (compare Czech ).

Slovak has final devoicing; when a voiced consonant () is at the end of a word before a pause, it is devoiced to its voiceless counterpart (, respectively). For example, is pronounced and is pronounced .

Consonant clusters containing both voiced and voiceless elements are entirely voiced if the last consonant is a voiced one, or voiceless if the last consonant is voiceless. For example, is pronounced and is pronounced . This rule applies also over the word boundary. For example, (to come home) and (more strawberries). The voiced counterpart of &quot; is , and the unvoiced counterpart of &quot; is .

==Orthography==
Slovak uses the Latin script with small modifications that include the four diacritics (ˇ, ´, ¨, ˆ) placed above certain letters ()

&quot;Italic&quot; letters (Q and W) are used in loanwords and foreign names.

The primary principle of Slovak spelling is the phonemic principle. The secondary principle is the morphological principle: forms derived from the same stem are written in the same way even if they are pronounced differently. An example of this principle is the assimilation rule (see below). The tertiary principle is the etymological principle, which can be seen in the use of &quot;i&quot; after certain consonants and of &quot;y&quot; after other consonants, although both &quot;i&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are usually pronounced the same way.

Finally, the rarely applied grammatical principle is present when, for example, the basic singular form and plural form of masculine adjectives are written differently with no difference in pronunciation (e.g. = nice – singular versus = nice – plural). Such spellings are most often remnants of differences in pronunciation that were present in Proto-Slavic (in Polish, where the vowel merger did not occur, and and in Czech and are pronounced differently).

Most loanwords from foreign languages are respelt using Slovak principles either immediately or later. For example, &quot;weekend&quot; is spelled , &quot;software&quot; – , &quot;gay&quot; – (both not exclusively), and &quot;quality&quot; is spelled . Personal and geographical names from other languages using Latin alphabets keep their original spelling unless a fully Slovak form of the name exists (e.g. for &quot;London&quot;).

Slovak features some heterophonic homographs (words with identical spelling but different pronunciation and meaning), the most common examples being (beautiful) versus (beautifully).

==Grammar==
===Syntax===
The main features of Slovak syntax are as follows:
*The verb (predicate) agrees in person and number with its subject.

Some examples include the following:
:. (The+singer+feminine suffix is+singing.)
:(, where -∅ is (the empty) third-person-singular ending)

:. (Singer+feminine suffix +plural suffix are+singing.)
:(; is a third-person-plural ending, and /j/ is a hiatus sound)

:. (We the+singer+feminine suffix +plural suffix are+singing.)
:(, where is the first-person-plural ending)
:and so forth.
*Adjectives, pronouns and numerals agree in person, gender and case with the noun to which they refer.
*Adjectives precede their noun. Botanic or zoological terms are exceptions (e.g. , literally &quot;cat wild&quot;, ) as is the naming of Holy Spirit () in a majority of churches.

Word order in Slovak is relatively free, since strong inflection enables the identification of grammatical roles (subject, object, predicate, etc.) regardless of word placement. This relatively free word order allows the use of word order to convey topic and emphasis.

Some examples are as follows:
:. = That big man opens a store there today. ( = that; = big; = man; = there; = today; = opens; = store) – The word order does not emphasize any specific detail, just general information.
:. = That big man is today opening a store there. – This word order emphasizes the place ( = there).
:. = Today over there a store is being opened by that big man. – This word order focuses on the person who is opening the store ( = that; = big; = man).
:. = The store over there is today being opened by that big man. – Depending on the intonation the focus can be either on the store itself or on the person.

The unmarked order is subject–verb–object. Variation in word order is generally possible, but word order is not completely free.
In the above example, the noun phrase cannot be split up, so that the following combinations are not possible:
:. ...

And the following sentence is stylistically infelicitous:
:. (Only possible in a poem or other forms of artistic style.)

The regular variants are as follows: 
: 
: 
: 

===Morphology===

====Articles====
Slovak, like every major Slavic language other than Bulgarian and Macedonian, does not have articles. The demonstrative pronoun in masculine form (that one) or in feminine and in neuter respectively, may be used in front of the noun in situations where definiteness must be made explicit.

====Nouns, adjectives, pronouns====

Slovak nouns are inflected for case and number. There are six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, and instrumental. The vocative is purely optional and most of the time unmarked. It is used mainly in spoken language and in some fixed expressions: mum (nominative) vs. mum! (vocative), , dad (N) vs. , dad! (V), Mr., sir vs. sir (when addressing someone e.g. in the street). There are two numbers: singular and plural. Nouns have inherent gender. There are three genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter. Adjectives and pronouns must agree with nouns in case, number, and gender.

====Numerals====
The numerals 0–10 have unique forms, with numerals 1–4 requiring specific gendered representations. Numerals 11–19 are formed by adding to the end of each numeral. The suffix is used to create numerals 20, 30 and 40; for numerals 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, is used. Compound numerals (21, 1054) are combinations of these words formed in the same order as their mathematical symbol is written (e.g. 21 = , literally &quot;twenty-one&quot;).

The numerals are as follows:
Some higher numbers: (200) , (300) , (900) , (1,000) , (1,100) , (2,000) , (100,000) , (200,000) , (1,000,000) , (1,000,000,000) .

Counted nouns have two forms. The most common form is the plural genitive (e.g. = five houses or = one hundred two women), while the plural form of the noun when counting the amounts of 2–4, etc., is usually the nominative form without counting (e.g. = two houses or = two women) but gender rules do apply in many cases.

====Verbs====
Verbs have three major conjugations. Three persons and two numbers (singular and plural) are distinguished. Subject personal pronouns are omitted unless they are emphatic.

*Some imperfective verbs are created from the stems of perfective verbs to denote repeated or habitual actions. These are considered separate lexemes. One example is as follows: to hide (perfective) = , to hide (habitual) = .
*Historically, two past tense forms were utilized. Both are formed analytically. The second of these, equivalent to the pluperfect, is not widely used in the modern language, being rather considered archaic. Examples for two related verbs are as follows:
: (I hid / I have hidden); (I had hidden)
*One future tense exists. For imperfective verbs, it is formed analytically; for perfective verbs, it is identical to the present tense. Some examples are as follows:
:
*Two conditional forms exist. Both are formed analytically from the past tense:
: (I would hide), (I would have hidden)
*The passive voice is formed either as in English (copula + passive participle) or using the reflexive pronoun &#x27;sa&#x27;:
:
*The passive participle (= ~ed (one), the &quot;third form&quot;) is formed using the suffixes - / - / -:
:
*The active present participle (= ~ing (one)) is formed using the suffixes - / - / -
:
*The transgressive (=(while/by) ...ing) is formed using the suffixes - / - / -.
: (by hiding (perfective))
: ((while/during) hiding)
*The active past participle (= ~ing (in the past)) was formerly formed using the suffix -, but is no longer used.
*The gerund (= the (process of) ...ing) is formed using the suffix -:
:

====Conjugations====
Several conjugation paradigms exist as follows:








===Adverbs===
Adverbs are formed by replacing the adjectival ending with the ending - or - / -. Sometimes both - and - are possible. Examples include the following:
: (high) – (highly)
: (nice) – (nicely)
: (friendly) – (in a friendly manner)
: (fast) – (quickly)

The comparative of adverbs is formed by replacing the adjectival ending with a comparative/superlative ending - or -, whence the superlative is formed with the prefix &quot;naj-.&quot; Examples include the following:
: (fast) – (faster) – (fastest): (quickly) – (more quickly) – (most quickly)

====Prepositions====
Each preposition is associated with one or more grammatical cases. The noun governed by a preposition must agree with the preposition in the given context. The preposition always calls for the genitive case, but some prepositions such as can call for different cases depending on the intended sense of the preposition.

:from friends = (genitive case of )
:around the square = (locative case of )
:up to the square = (accusative case of )

==Vocabulary==
Slovak is a descendant of Proto-Slavic, itself a descendant of Proto-Indo-European. It is closely related to the other West Slavic languages, primarily to Czech and Polish. Czech also influenced the language in its later development. The highest number of borrowings in the old Slovak vocabulary come from Latin, German, Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Greek (in that order). Recently, it is also influenced by English.

===Czech===
Although most dialects of Czech and Slovak are mutually intelligible (see Comparison of Slovak and Czech), eastern Slovak dialects are less intelligible to speakers of Czech and closer to Polish and East Slavic, and contact between speakers of Czech and speakers of the eastern dialects is limited.

Since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia it has been permitted to use Czech in TV broadcasting and during court proceedings (Administration Procedure Act 99/1963 Zb.). From 1999 to August 2009, the Minority Language Act 184/1999 Z.z., in its section (§) 6, contained the variously interpreted unclear provision saying that &quot;When applying this act, it holds that the use of the Czech language fulfills the requirement of fundamental intelligibility with the state language&quot;; the state language is Slovak and the Minority Language Act basically refers to municipalities with more than 20% ethnic minority population (no such Czech municipalities are found in Slovakia). Since 1 September 2009 (due to an amendment to the State Language Act 270/1995 Z.z.) a language &quot;fundamentally intelligible with the state language&quot; (i.e. the Czech language) may be used in contact with state offices and bodies by its native speakers, and documents written in it and issued by bodies in the Czech Republic are officially accepted. Regardless of its official status, Czech is used commonly both in Slovak mass media and in daily communication by Czech natives as an equal language.

Czech and Slovak have a long history of interaction and mutual influence well before the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, a state which existed until 1993. Literary Slovak shares significant orthographic features with Czech, as well as technical and professional terminology dating from the Czechoslovak period, but phonetic, grammatical, and vocabulary differences do exist.

===Other Slavic languages===
Slavic language varieties are relatively closely related, and have had a large degree of mutual influence, due to the complicated ethnopolitical history of their historic ranges. This is reflected in the many features Slovak shares with neighboring language varieties. Standard Slovak shares high degrees of mutual intelligibility with many Slavic varieties. Despite this closeness to other Slavic varieties, significant variation exists among Slovak dialects. In particular, eastern varieties differ significantly from the standard language, which is based on central and western varieties.

Eastern Slovak dialects have the greatest degree of mutual intelligibility with Polish of all the Slovak dialects, followed by Rusyn, but both Eastern Slovak and Rusyn lack familiar technical terminology and upper register expressions. Polish and Sorbian also differ quite considerably from Czech and Slovak in upper registers, but non-technical and lower register speech is readily intelligible. Some mutual intelligibility occurs with spoken Rusyn, Ukrainian, and even Russian (in this order), although their orthographies are based on the Cyrillic script.

===Latin===
* : (stick)
* : (monastery)
* : (church)
* : (shirt)
* : (blot, stain)
* : (school)
* : (cupboard)
* : (title)

Greetings:

 is commonly used as a greeting or upon parting in Slovak-speaking regions and some German-speaking regions, particularly Austria. is also commonly used upon parting in these regions. Both and are used in colloquial, informal conversation.

===Hungarian===
Hungarians and Slovaks have had language interaction ever since the settlement of Hungarians in the Carpathian area. Hungarians also adopted many words from various Slavic languages related to agriculture and administration, and a number of Hungarian loanwords are found in Slovak. Some examples are as follows:

<doc id="28142" wikidata="Q27521" url="?curid=28142" title="Supercluster">
<text>A supercluster is a large group of smaller galaxy clusters or galaxy groups; they are among the largest known structures in the universe. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group galaxy group (which contains more than 54 galaxies), which in turn is part of the Virgo Supercluster, which is part of the Laniakea Supercluster, which is part of the Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex. The large size and low density of superclusters means that they, unlike clusters, expand with the Hubble expansion. The number of superclusters in the observable universe is estimated to be 10 million.

==Existence==
The existence of superclusters indicates that the galaxies in the Universe are not uniformly distributed; most of them are drawn together in groups and clusters, with groups containing up to some dozens of galaxies and clusters up to several thousand galaxies. Those groups and clusters and additional isolated galaxies in turn form even larger structures called superclusters.

Their existence was first postulated by George Abell in his 1958 Abell catalogue of galaxy clusters. He called them &quot;second-order clusters&quot;, or clusters of clusters.

Superclusters form massive structures of galaxies, called &quot;filaments&quot;, &quot;supercluster complexes&quot;, &quot;walls&quot; or &quot;sheets&quot;, that may span between several hundred million light-years to 10 billion light-years, covering more than 5% of the observable universe. These are the largest structures known to date. Observations of superclusters can give information about the initial condition of the universe, when these superclusters were created. The directions of the rotational axes of galaxies within superclusters are studied by those who believe that they may give insight and information into the early formation process of galaxies in the history of the Universe.
Interspersed among superclusters are large voids of space where few galaxies exist. Superclusters are frequently subdivided into groups of clusters called galaxy groups and clusters.

Although superclusters are supposed to be the largest structures in the universe according to the Cosmological principle, larger structures have been observed in surveys, including the Sloan Great Wall.

<text>Salicylic acid is an organic compound with the formula HOC6H4COOH. A colorless (or white), bitter-tasting solid, it is a precursor to and a metabolite of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). It is a plant hormone, and has been listed by the EPA Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Substance Inventory as an experimental teratogen. The name is from Latin for willow tree, from which it was initially identified and derived. It is an ingredient in some anti-acne products. Salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates.

== Uses ==
=== Medicine ===
Salicylic acid as a medication is commonly used to remove the outermost layer of the skin. As such, it is used to treat warts, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, ringworm, dandruff, and ichthyosis.

Similar to other hydroxy acids, salicylic acid is an ingredient in many skincare products for the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, acanthosis nigricans, ichthyosis, and warts.

===Uses in manufacturing===
Salicylic acid is used as a food preservative, a bactericide, and an antiseptic.

Salicylic acid is used in the production of other pharmaceuticals, including 4-aminosalicylic acid, sandulpiride, and landetimide (via salethamide). It is also used in picric acid production.

Salicylic acid has long been a key starting material for making acetylsalicylic acid (ASA or aspirin). ASA is prepared by the acetylation of salicylic acid with the acetyl group from acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride. ASA is the standard to which all the other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are compared. In veterinary medicine, this group of drugs is mainly used for treatment of inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders.

Bismuth subsalicylate, a salt of bismuth and salicylic acid, &quot;displays anti-inflammatory action (due to salicylic acid) and also acts as an antacid and mild antibiotic&quot;. It is an active ingredient in stomach-relief aids such as Pepto-Bismol and some formulations of Kaopectate.

Other derivatives include methyl salicylate, used as a liniment to soothe joint and muscle pain, and choline salicylate, which is used topically to relieve the pain of mouth ulcers. Aminosalicylic acid is used to induce remission in ulcerative colitis, and has been used as an antitubercular agent often administered in association with isoniazid.

Sodium salicylate is a useful phosphor in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral range, with nearly flat quantum efficiency for wavelengths between 10 and 100 nm. It fluoresces in the blue at 420 nm. It is easily prepared on a clean surface by spraying a saturated solution of the salt in methanol followed by evaporation.

==Mechanism of action==
Salicylic acid modulates COX-1 enzymatic activity to decrease the formation of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Salicylate may competitively inhibit prostaglandin formation.

Salicylic acid, when applied to the skin surface, works by causing the cells of the epidermis to slough off more readily, preventing pores from clogging up, and allowing room for new cell growth. Salicylic acid inhibits the oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) competitively with NADH and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid to the phenolic acceptor.

The wound-healing retardation action of salicylates is probably due mainly to its inhibitory action on mucopolysaccharide synthesis.

==Safety==

If high concentrations of salicylic ointment are used topically, high levels of salicylic acid can enter the blood, requiring hemodialysis to avoid further complications.

Cosmetic applications of the drug pose no significant risk. Even in a worst-case use scenario in which one was using multiple salicylic acid-containing topical products, the aggregate plasma concentration of salicylic acid was well below what was permissible for acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Since oral aspirin (which produces much higher salicylic acid plasma concentrations than dermal salicylic acid applications) poses no significant adverse pregnancy outcomes in terms of frequency of stillbirth, birth defects or developmental delay, use of salicylic acid containing cosmetics is safe for pregnant women. Salicylic acid is present in most fruits and vegetables as for example in greatest quantities in berries and in beverages like tea.

==Production and chemical reactions==
===Biosynthesis===
Salicylic acid is biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine. In &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot;, it can be synthesized via a phenylalanine-independent pathway.

===Chemical synthesis===
Commercial vendors prepare sodium salicylate by treating sodium phenolate (the sodium salt of phenol) with carbon dioxide at high pressure (100atm) and high temperature (115°C) – a method known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction. Acidifying the product with sulfuric acid gives salicylic acid:

At the laboratory scale, it can also be prepared by the hydrolysis of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) or methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen) with a strong acid or base; these reactions reverse those chemicals&#x27; commercial syntheses.

===Reactions===
Upon heating, salicylic acid converts to phenyl salicylate:

Further heating gives xanthone.

Salicylic acid as its conjugate base is a chelating agent, with an affinity for iron(III).

Salicylic acid slowly degrades to phenol and carbon dioxide at 200–230 °C: 

All isomers of chlorosalicylic acid and of dichlorosalicylic acid are known. 5-Chlorosalicylic acid is produced by direct chlorination of salicylic acid.

==History==

Willow has long been used for medicinal purposes. Dioscorides, whose writings were highly influential for more than 1,500 years, used &quot;Itea&quot; (which was possibly a species of willow) as a treatment for &quot;painful intestinal obstructions&quot;, birth control, for &quot;those who spit blood&quot;, to remove calluses and corns and, externally, as a &quot;warm pack for gout&quot;. William Turner, in 1597, repeated this, saying that willow bark, &quot;being burnt to ashes, and steeped in vinegar, takes away corns and other like risings in the feet and toes&quot;. Some of these cures may describe the action of salicylic acid, which can be derived from the salicin present in willow. It is, however, a modern myth that Hippocrates used willow as a painkiller.

Hippocrates, Galen, Pliny the Elder, and others knew that decoctions containing salicylate could ease pain and reduce fevers.

It was used in Europe and China to treat these conditions. This remedy is mentioned in texts from Ancient Egypt, Sumer, and Assyria.

The Cherokee and other Native Americans use an infusion of the bark for fever and other medicinal purposes. In 2014, archaeologists identified traces of salicylic acid on seventh-century pottery fragments found in east-central Colorado.

Edward Stone, a vicar from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, England, reported in 1763 that the bark of the willow was effective in reducing a fever.
An extract of willow bark, called salicin, after the Latin name for the white willow (&quot;Salix alba&quot;), was isolated and named by German chemist Johann Andreas Buchner in 1828. A larger amount of the substance was isolated in 1829 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist. Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, was able to convert the substance into a sugar and a second component, which on oxidation becomes salicylic acid.
Salicylic acid was also isolated from the herb meadowsweet (&quot;Filipendula ulmaria&quot;, formerly classified as &quot;Spiraea ulmaria&quot;) by German researchers in 1839. Their extract caused digestive problems such as gastric irritation, bleeding, diarrhea, and even death when consumed in high doses.

In 1874 the Scottish physician Thomas MacLagan experimented with salicin as a treatment for acute rheumatism, with considerable success, as he reported in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in 1876. Meanwhile, German scientists tried sodium salicylate with less success and more severe side effects.

In 1979, salicylates were found to be involved in induced defenses of tobacco against tobacco mosaic virus. In 1987, salicylic acid was identified as the long-sought signal that causes thermogenic plants, such as the voodoo lily, &quot;Sauromatum guttatum&quot;, to produce heat.

== Dietary sources ==
Salicylic acid occurs in plants as free salicylic acid and its carboxylated esters and phenolic glycosides. Several studies suggest that humans metabolize salicylic acid in measurable quantities from these plants. High-salicylate beverages and foods include beer, coffee, tea, numerous fruits and vegetables, sweet potato, nuts, and olive oil. Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, sugar, breads and cereals have low salicylate content.

Some people with sensitivity to dietary salicylates may have symptoms of allergic reaction, such as bronchial asthma, rhinitis, gastrointestinal disorders, or diarrhea, so may need to adopt a low-salicylate diet.

==Plant hormone==
Salicylic acid is a phenolic phytohormone, and is found in plants with roles in plant growth and development, photosynthesis, transpiration, and ion uptake and transport. Salicylic acid is involved in endogenous signaling, mediating plant defense against pathogens. It plays a role in the resistance to pathogens (i.e. systemic acquired resistance) by inducing the production of pathogenesis-related proteins and other defensive metabolites. SA&#x27;s defense signaling role is most clearly demonstrated by experiments which do away with it: Delaney et al. 1994, Gaffney et al. 1993, Lawton et al. 1995, and Vernooij et al. 1994 each use &quot;Nicotiana tabacum&quot; or &quot;Arabidopsis&quot; expressing &quot;nahG&quot;, for salicylate hydroxylase. Pathogen inoculation did not produce the customarily high SA levels, SAR was not produced, and no pathogenesis-related (PR) genes were expressed in systemic leaves. Indeed, the subjects were more susceptible to virulent and even normally avirulent pathogens.

Exogenously, salicylic acid can aid plant development via enhanced seed germination, bud flowering, and fruit ripening, though too high of a concentration of salicylic acid can negatively regulate these developmental processes.

The volatile methyl ester of salicylic acid, methyl salicylate, can also diffuse through the air, facilitating plant-plant communication. Methyl salicylate is taken up by the stomata of the nearby plant, where it can induce an immune response after being converted back to salicylic acid.

=== Signal transduction ===
A number of proteins have been identified that interact with SA in plants, especially salicylic acid binding proteins (SABPs) and the NPR genes (nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related genes), which are putative receptors.

<text>Seaborgium is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Sg and atomic number 106. It is named after the American nuclear chemist Glenn T. Seaborg. As a synthetic element, it can be created in a laboratory but is not found in nature. It is also radioactive; the most stable known isotopes have half lives on the order of several minutes.

In the periodic table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and belongs to the group 6 elements as the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that seaborgium behaves as the heavier homologue to tungsten in group 6. The chemical properties of seaborgium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 6 elements.

In 1974, a few atoms of seaborgium were produced in laboratories in the Soviet Union and in the United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established seaborgium as the official name for the element. It is one of only two elements named after a living person at the time of naming, the other being oganesson, element 118.

==Introduction==
==History==
Following claims of the observation of elements 104 and 105 in 1970 by Albert Ghiorso et al. at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a search for element 106 using oxygen-18 projectiles and the previously used californium-249 target was conducted. Several 9.1 MeV alpha decays were reported and are now thought to originate from element 106, though this was not confirmed at the time. In 1972, the HILAC accelerator received equipment upgrades, preventing the team from repeating the experiment, and data analysis was not done during the shutdown. This reaction was tried again several years later, in 1974, and the Berkeley team realized that their new data agreed with their 1971 data, to the astonishment of Ghiorso. Hence, element 106 could have actually been discovered in 1971 if the original data was analyzed more carefully.

Two groups claimed discovery of the element. Evidence of element 106 was first reported in 1974 by a Russian research team in Dubna led by Yuri Oganessian, in which targets of lead-208 and lead-207 were bombarded with accelerated ions of chromium-54. In total, fifty-one spontaneous fission events were observed with a half-life between four and ten milliseconds. After having ruled out nucleon transfer reactions as a cause for these activities, the team concluded that the most likely cause of the activities was the spontaneous fission of isotopes of element 106. The isotope in question was first suggested to be seaborgium-259, but was later corrected to seaborgium-260.

: + → + 2 

A few months later in 1974, researchers including Glenn T. Seaborg, Carol Alonso and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California, Berkeley, and E. Kenneth Hulet from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, also synthesized the element by bombarding a californium-249 target with oxygen-18 ions, using equipment similar to that which had been used for the synthesis of element 104 five years earlier, observing at least seventy alpha decays, seemingly from the isotope seaborgium-263m with a half-life of seconds. The alpha daughter rutherfordium-259 and granddaughter nobelium-255 had previously been synthesised and the properties observed here matched with those previously known, as did the intensity of their production. The cross-section of the reaction observed, 0.3 nanobarns, also agreed well with theoretical predictions. These bolstered the assignment of the alpha decay events to seaborgium-263m.

: + → + 4 → + → + 

A dispute thus arose from the initial competing claims of discovery, though unlike the case of the synthetic elements up to element 105, neither team of discoverers chose to announce proposed names for the new elements, thus averting an element naming controversy temporarily. The dispute on discovery, however, dragged on until 1992, when the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG), formed to put an end to the controversy by making conclusions regarding discovery claims for elements 101 to 112, concluded that the Soviet synthesis of seaborgium-260 was not convincing enough, &quot;lacking as it is in yield curves and angular selection results&quot;, whereas the American synthesis of seaborgium-263 was convincing due to its being firmly anchored to known daughter nuclei. As such, the TWG recognised the Berkeley team as official discoverers in their 1993 report.

Seaborg had previously suggested to the TWG that if Berkeley was recognised as the official discoverer of elements 104 and 105, they might propose the name &quot;kurchatovium&quot; (symbol Kt) for element 106 to honour the Dubna team, which had proposed this name for element 104 after Igor Kurchatov, the former head of the Soviet nuclear research programme. However, due to the worsening relations between the competing teams after the publication of the TWG report (because the Berkeley team vehemently disagreed with the TWG&#x27;s conclusions, especially regarding element 104), this proposal was dropped from consideration by the Berkeley team. After being recognized as official discoverers, the Berkeley team started deciding on a name in earnest:

Seaborg&#x27;s son Eric remembered the naming process as follows:

The name &quot;seaborgium&quot; and symbol &quot;Sg&quot; were announced at the 207th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in March 1994 by Kenneth Hulet, one of the co-discovers. However, IUPAC resolved in August 1994 that an element could not be named after a living person, and Seaborg was still alive at the time. Thus, in September 1994, IUPAC recommended a set of names in which the names proposed by the three laboratories (the third being the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany) with competing claims to the discovery for elements 104 to 109 were shifted to various other elements, in which &quot;rutherfordium&quot; (Rf), the Berkeley proposal for element 104, was shifted to element 106, with &quot;seaborgium&quot; being dropped entirely as a name.

This decision ignited a firestorm of worldwide protest for disregarding the historic discoverer&#x27;s right to name new elements, and against the new retroactive rule against naming elements after living persons; the American Chemical Society stood firmly behind the name &quot;seaborgium&quot; for element 106, together with all the other American and German naming proposals for elements 104 to 109, approving these names for its journals in defiance of IUPAC. At first, IUPAC defended itself, with an American member of its committee writing: &quot;Discoverers don&#x27;t have a right to name an element. They have a right to suggest a name. And, of course, we didn&#x27;t infringe on that at all.&quot; However, Seaborg responded:

Bowing to public pressure, IUPAC proposed a different compromise in August 1995, in which the name &quot;seaborgium&quot; was reinstated for element 106 in exchange for the removal of all but one of the other American proposals, which met an even worse response. Finally, IUPAC rescinded these previous compromises and made a final, new recommendation in August 1997, in which the American and German proposals for elements 104 to 109 were all adopted, including &quot;seaborgium&quot; for element 106, with the single exception of element 105, named &quot;dubnium&quot; to recognise the contributions of the Dubna team to the experimental procedures of transactinide synthesis. This list was finally accepted by the American Chemical Society, which wrote:

Seaborg commented regarding the naming:

Seaborg died a year and a half later, on 25 February 1999, at the age of 86.

==Isotopes==

Superheavy elements such as seaborgium are produced by bombarding lighter elements in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of seaborgium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of elements with higher atomic numbers.

Depending on the energies involved, fusion reactions that generate superheavy elements are separated into &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;. In hot fusion reactions, very light, high-energy projectiles are accelerated toward very heavy targets (actinides), giving rise to compound nuclei at high excitation energy (~40–50 MeV) that may either fission or evaporate several (3 to 5) neutrons. In cold fusion reactions, the produced fused nuclei have a relatively low excitation energy (~10–20 MeV), which decreases the probability that these products will undergo fission reactions. As the fused nuclei cool to the ground state, they require emission of only one or two neutrons, and thus, allows for the generation of more neutron-rich products. The latter is a distinct concept from that of where nuclear fusion claimed to be achieved at room temperature conditions (see cold fusion).

Seaborgium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing the decay of heavier elements. Thirteen different isotopes of seaborgium have been reported with mass numbers 258–269 and 271, four of which, seaborgium-261, −263, −265, and −267, have known metastable states. All of these decay only through alpha decay and spontaneous fission, with the single exception of seaborgium-261 that can also undergo electron capture to dubnium-261.

There is a trend toward increasing half-lives for the heavier isotopes, though even–odd isotopes are generally more stable than their neighboring even–even isotopes, because the odd neutron leads to increased hindrance of spontaneous fission; among known seaborgium isotopes, alpha decay is the predominant decay mode in even–odd nuclei whereas fission dominates in even–even nuclei. Three of the heaviest known isotopes, 267Sg, 269Sg, and 271Sg, are also the longest-lived, having half-lives on the order of several minutes. Some other isotopes in this region are predicted to have comparable or even longer half-lives. Additionally, 263Sg, 265Sg, 265mSg, and 268Sg have half-lives measured in seconds. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives measured in milliseconds, with the exception of the shortest-lived isotope, 261mSg, with a half-life of only 9.3 microseconds.

The proton-rich isotopes from 258Sg to 261Sg were directly produced by cold fusion; all heavier isotopes were produced from the repeated alpha decay of the heavier elements hassium, darmstadtium, and flerovium, with the exceptions of the isotopes 263mSg, 264Sg, 265Sg, and 265mSg, which were directly produced by hot fusion through irradiation of actinide targets.

==Predicted properties==
Very few properties of seaborgium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that seaborgium (and its parents) decays very quickly. A few singular chemistry-related properties have been measured, but properties of seaborgium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.

===Physical===
Seaborgium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a body-centered cubic crystal structure, similar to its lighter congener tungsten. Early predictions estimated that it should be a very heavy metal with density around 35.0 g/cm3, but calculations in 2011 and 2013 predicted a somewhat lower value of 23–24 g/cm3.

===Chemical===
Seaborgium is the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the periodic table, below chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. All the members of the group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten is the last of the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in metallic bonding. As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only positive oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable, and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium.

This stabilisation of the highest oxidation state occurs in the early 6d elements because of the similarity between the energies of the 6d and 7s orbitals, since the 7s orbitals are relativistically stabilised and the 6d orbitals are relativistically destabilised. This effect is so large in the seventh period that seaborgium is expected to lose its 6d electrons before its 7s electrons (Sg, [Rn]5f146d47s2; Sg+, [Rn]5f146d37s2; Sg2+, [Rn]5f146d37s1; Sg4+, [Rn]5f146d2; Sg6+, [Rn]5f14). Because of the great destabilisation of the 7s orbital, SgIV should be even more unstable than WIV and should be very readily oxidised to SgVI. The predicted ionic radius of the hexacoordinate Sg6+ ion is 65 pm, while the predicted atomic radius of seaborgium is 128 pm. Nevertheless, the stability of the highest oxidation state is still expected to decrease as LrIII &gt; RfIV &gt; DbV &gt; SgVI. Some predicted standard reduction potentials for seaborgium ions in aqueous acidic solution are as follows:

Seaborgium should form a very volatile hexafluoride (SgF6) as well as a moderately volatile hexachloride (SgCl6), pentachloride (SgCl5), and oxychlorides SgO2Cl2 and SgOCl4. SgO2Cl2 is expected to be the most stable of the seaborgium oxychlorides and to be the least volatile of the group 6 oxychlorides, with the sequence MoO2Cl2 &gt; WO2Cl2 &gt; SgO2Cl2. The volatile seaborgium(VI) compounds SgCl6 and SgOCl4 are expected to be unstable to decomposition to seaborgium(V) compounds at high temperatures, analogous to MoCl6 and MoOCl4; this should not happen for SgO2Cl2 due to the much higher energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, despite the similar Sg–Cl bond strengths (similarly to molybdenum and tungsten).

Molybdenum and tungsten are very similar to each other and show important differences to the smaller chromium, and seaborgium is expected to follow the chemistry of tungsten and molybdenum quite closely, forming an even greater variety of oxoanions, the simplest among them being seaborgate, , which would form from the rapid hydrolysis of , although this would take place less readily than with molybdenum and tungsten as expected from seaborgium&#x27;s greater size. Seaborgium should hydrolyse less readily than tungsten in hydrofluoric acid at low concentrations, but more readily at high concentrations, also forming complexes such as SgO3F− and : complex formation competes with hydrolysis in hydrofluoric acid.

==Experimental chemistry==
Experimental chemical investigation of seaborgium has been hampered due to the need to produce it one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions. The isotope 265Sg and its isomer 265mSg are advantageous for radiochemistry: they are produced in the 248Cm(22Ne,5n) reaction.

In the first experimental chemical studies of seaborgium in 1995 and 1996, seaborgium atoms were produced in the reaction 248Cm(22Ne,4n)266Sg, thermalised, and reacted with an O2/HCl mixture. The adsorption properties of the resulting oxychloride were measured and compared with those of molybdenum and tungsten compounds. The results indicated that seaborgium formed a volatile oxychloride akin to those of the other group 6 elements, and confirmed the decreasing trend of oxychloride volatility down group 6:

:Sg + + 2 HCl → + 

In 2001, a team continued the study of the gas phase chemistry of seaborgium by reacting the element with O2 in a H2O environment. In a manner similar to the formation of the oxychloride, the results of the experiment indicated the formation of seaborgium oxide hydroxide, a reaction well known among the lighter group 6 homologues as well as the pseudohomologue uranium.

:2 Sg + 3 → 2 

Predictions on the aqueous chemistry of seaborgium have largely been confirmed. In experiments conducted in 1997 and 1998, seaborgium was eluted from cation-exchange resin using a HNO3/HF solution, most likely as neutral SgO2F2 or the anionic complex ion [SgO2F3]− rather than . In contrast, in 0.1 M nitric acid, seaborgium does not elute, unlike molybdenum and tungsten, indicating that the hydrolysis of [Sg(H2O)6]6+ only proceeds as far as the cationic complex [Sg(OH)4(H2O)]2+ or [SgO(OH)3(H2O)2]+, while that of molybdenum and tungsten proceed to neutral [MO2(OH)2].

The only other oxidation state known for seaborgium other than the group oxidation state of +6 is the zero oxidation state. Similarly to its three lighter congeners, forming chromium hexacarbonyl, molybdenum hexacarbonyl, and tungsten hexacarbonyl, seaborgium has been shown in 2014 to also form seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6. Like its molybdenum and tungsten homologues, seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a volatile compound that reacts readily with silicon dioxide.

== Absence in nature ==

Searches for long-lived primordial nuclides of seaborgium in nature have all yielded negative results. One 2022 study estimated the concentration of seaborgium atoms in natural tungsten (its chemical homolog) is less than atom(Sg)/atom(W).
