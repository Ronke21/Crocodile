<text>The Seattle Mariners are an American professional baseball team based in Seattle. The Mariners compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West Division. The team joined the American League as an expansion team in 1977, playing their home games in the Kingdome. Since July , the Mariners&#x27; home ballpark has been T-Mobile Park, located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle.

The &quot;Mariners&quot; name originates from the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle. They are nicknamed the M&#x27;s, a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992. They adopted their current team colors – navy blue, northwest green (teal), and silver – prior to the 1993 season, after having been royal blue and gold since the team&#x27;s inception; the original colors continue to be used in alternate uniforms. Their mascot is the Mariner Moose.

The Mariners did not field a winning team until 1991, and further success eluded them until the late 90s, the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Hall of Fame players Edgar Martínez, Ken Griffey Jr., and Randy Johnson, the Mariners clinched their first playoff berth in when they won their first division championship and defeated the New York Yankees in the ALDS. Martínez&#x27;s walk-off double in Game 5 drove Griffey in from first base to win the game in the 11th inning, clinched a series win for the Mariners, served as a powerful impetus to preserve baseball in Seattle, and has since become an iconic moment in team history. They would later win their second division title in 1997.

After Griffey, Johnson, and Alex Rodriguez all left the team, the Mariners, bolstered by the signing of Ichiro Suzuki, won 116 games in 2001, which set the American League record for most wins in a single season and tied the 1906 Chicago Cubs for the Major League record for most wins in a single season. The team would not make the postseason again until 2022, which was the longest active drought in the four major North American sports.

As of 2024, the franchise has finished with a losing record in 30 of 48 seasons. The Mariners are the only active MLB franchise never to have appeared in the World Series, currently holding the longest active World Series appearance drought in MLB.

==History==

The Mariners were created as a result of a lawsuit. In , in the aftermath of the Seattle Pilots&#x27; purchase and relocation to Milwaukee as the Milwaukee Brewers by Bud Selig, the city of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington (represented by then-state Attorney General and future U.S. Senator Slade Gorton) sued the American League for breach of contract. Confident that Major League Baseball would return to Seattle within a few years, King County built the multi-purpose Kingdome, which would become home to the National Football League&#x27;s expansion Seattle Seahawks in 1976. The name &quot;Mariners&quot; was chosen by club officials in August 1976 from over 600 names submitted by 15,000 entrants in a name-the-team contest. The name was submitted by Roger Szmodis of Bellevue, Washington. However, when the Mariners attempted to reach Szmodis about the prize he had won as a result of his entry being chosen, they were unable to make contact with him, with all efforts to track the man down for years being unsuccessful.

The first home run in team history was hit on April 10, 1977, by designated hitter Juan Bernhardt.

That year, pitcher Diego Seguí, in his last major league season, became the only player to play for both the Pilots and the Mariners. The Mariners finished with a 64–98 record, matching the 1969 Pilots&#x27; record. The team was able to avoid last place in the AL West by half a game. The Mariners would not post a winning record or finish above 4th place in any of their first 14 seasons. In 1979, Seattle hosted the 50th Major League Baseball All-Star Game. After the 1981 season, the Mariners were sold to California businessman George Argyros, who in turn sold the team in 1989 to a group led by radio station magnate Jeff Smulyan for $76 million. Smulyan proposed moving the team to Tampa Bay, Florida, or another market in 1992 before he put the team up for sale. Nintendo of America bought the team in 1992; Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi, who held a 49 percent share of the franchise, had never been to a baseball game but sought to thank the city for its role in the company&#x27;s success.

Before the 1993 season, the Mariners hired manager Lou Piniella, who had led the Cincinnati Reds to victory in the 1990 World Series. Mariner fans embraced Piniella, and he would helm the team from through , winning two American League Manager of the Year Awards during his tenure. Piniella was selected by the Seattle Pilots in the 1968 expansion draft but did not play for Seattle, being traded in April 1969 to the Kansas City Royals, where he earned AL Rookie of the Year honors that year.

The Mariners club finished with a record of 116–46, leading all of Major League Baseball in winning percentage for the duration of the season and easily winning the American League West division title. In doing so, the team broke the 1998 New York Yankees&#x27; American League single-season record of 114 wins and matched the all-time MLB single-season record for wins set by the Chicago Cubs. At the end of the season, Ichiro Suzuki won the AL MVP, AL Rookie of the Year, and one of three outfield Gold Glove Awards, becoming the first player since the Fred Lynn in 1975 to win all three in the same season. The Mariners advanced through the postseason but lost to the Yankees in the 2001 ALCS.

The Mariners had a 93-win season in but failed to make the postseason and did not make significant roster changes; manager Lou Piniella was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays during the offseason. The team repeated with 93 wins in 2003 and also did not qualify for the playoffs. On October 22, the Mariners announced the hiring of Jack Zduriencik, formerly scouting director of the Milwaukee Brewers, as their general manager. Weeks later, on November 18, the team named Oakland Athletics bench coach Don Wakamatsu as its new manager. Wakamatsu and Zduriencik hired an entirely new coaching staff for 2009, which included former World Series MVP John Wetteland as bullpen coach. The off-season also saw a litany of roster moves, headlined by a 12-player, 3-team trade that sent All-Star closer J. J. Putz to the New York Mets and brought 5 players, including prospect Mike Carp and outfielder Endy Chávez from New York and outfielder Franklin Gutiérrez from the Cleveland Indians, to Seattle. Many of the moves, like the free-agent signing of Mike Sweeney, were made in part with the hope of squelching the clubhouse infighting that plagued the Mariners in 2008. It also saw the return of Seattle favorite Griffey Jr. The 2009–10 offseason was highlighted by the trade for 2008 American League Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee from the Philadelphia Phillies, the signing of third baseman Chone Figgins and the contract extension of star pitcher Félix Hernández.

Griffey Jr. announced his retirement on June 2, 2010, after 22 MLB seasons. After its busy offseason and high expectations, the team flopped in 2010, finishing with the worst record in the American League. The Mariners fired Wakamatsu along with several coaches on August 9, 2010. Daren Brown, the manager of the Triple-A affiliate Tacoma Rainiers, took over as interim manager. Dave Niehaus, the Mariners&#x27; play-by-play announcer since the team&#x27;s inception, died of a heart attack on November 10, 2010, at the age of 75. In memory of Niehaus, Seattle rapper Macklemore wrote a tribute song called &quot;My Oh My&quot; in December 2010. He performed the song at the Mariners&#x27; Opening Day game on April 8, .

The Mariners hired former Cleveland manager Eric Wedge as their new manager on October 19, 2010. On April 21, 2012, Philip Humber of the Chicago White Sox threw the third perfect game in White Sox history against the Mariners in Seattle. It was the 21st perfect game in MLB history. Mariners starter Kevin Millwood and five relievers combined to throw the tenth combined no-hitter in MLB history, and the first in team history, on June 8, 2012. The six pitchers used in a no-hitter tied a major league record, first set by the Houston Astros in 2003. Félix Hernández pitched the first perfect game in team history, shutting down the Tampa Bay Rays 1–0 at Safeco Field on August 15, 2012. It was the 23rd perfect game in Major League Baseball history. The Mariners became the first team in Major League Baseball to be involved in two perfect games in one season.

Zduriencik was fired on August 28, 2015. Jerry Dipoto, a former general manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, was hired as the Mariners&#x27; new general manager one month later. On October 9, 2015, manager Lloyd McClendon was fired. Scott Servais was named the new Mariners&#x27; manager on October 23, 2015.

Nintendo announced on April 27, 2016, that it would sell its controlling stake in the Mariners to First Avenue Entertainment limited partnership, led by John W. Stanton. Nintendo retained a 10 percent ownership share of the team after the sale was completed in August 2016. The franchise was valued at $1.4 billion at the time and included Root Sports Northwest, the team&#x27;s regional television network.

The Stanton/Dipoto/Servais era was characterized by two competitive phases. In the first phase, the organization tried to contend for a championship with the existing core of Robinson Cano, Félix Hernández, Nelson Cruz, and Kyle Seager. The team came close but ultimately missed the playoffs each year from 2016 to 2018. Following the 2018 season, the organization pivoted to a rebuild, trading off their most valuable players in return for prospects. Following a fallow period of 2019–20, the team returned to contention in 2021, winning 90 games but falling short of the playoffs. In 2022, with a new core including Julio Rodriguez, J. P. Crawford, Cal Raleigh, Luis Castillo, George Kirby, and Logan Gilbert, the team reached the postseason for the first time since 2001. This broke what was at the time the longest playoff drought of any team in the big 4 North American sports. Rodriguez also won the American League Rookie of the Year Award. In 2023, the team won 88 games but finished one game out of a playoff spot. In August 2024, Servais was fired and replaced by the team&#x27;s former catcher Dan Wilson as manager. The team again missed the playoffs by one game.

==Uniforms==
=== 1977–1980 ===
The Mariners&#x27; original colors were blue and gold, the color scheme previously used by the Seattle Pilots and its successor Milwaukee Brewers. For the first four seasons, they wore white pullover jerseys at home with the team name in front and numbers on the left chest. The &quot;M&quot; in &quot;Mariners&quot; was shaped to resemble a trident. On the road, they wore baby blue pullover jerseys with the city name in front and numbers on the left chest. The lettering colors were blue with gold trim, though in the 1977 season the trim on the road jersey was white and the &quot;Seattle&quot; wordmark appeared smaller. The trident logo was added to the left sleeve prior to the 1979 season.

The cap was all-blue and featured the gold trident logo with white trim.
===1981–1986===
The Mariners made some subtle changes to the uniform in 1981. The trident logo was replaced by blue and gold racing stripes on the shoulders, and the lettering received an extra blue outline. The number font also changed from rounded to block style. In 1985, the road jersey color was changed to grey.

The cap logo also featured a slight update of the trident logo, changing its color to blue, along with additional outlines and a white star background, a logo first used for the 1979 All-Star Game.

=== 1987–1992 ===
In 1987, the Mariners changed its uniform style to traditional buttoned tops and belted pants. Both uniforms incorporated blue piping and a block &quot;Mariners&quot; wordmark in blue with gold and blue outlines. The numbers remained blue, but eliminated the trim outlines.

The cap logo was changed to a gold &quot;S.&quot;

===1993–present===
The Mariners donned their current uniforms in . The white home uniform originally featured &quot;Mariners&quot; in navy with trim in a dark shade of cyan called &quot;Northwest Green&quot; and featured the &quot;compass rose&quot; logo atop the &quot;M.&quot; The grey road uniform originally featured &quot;Seattle&quot; in navy with Northwest Green and white trim; in 2001, the compass rose logo was added in the middle of the &quot;S.&quot; In 2015, a silver inline was added to the wordmark of both uniforms, which was also applied to the block letters and numbers. The primary logo is applied to the left sleeve.

From 1997 to 2000, the Mariners also wore sleeveless versions of their primary uniforms, accompanied with a navy undershirt.

The Mariners have also worn Northwest Green alternate uniforms at different points in their history. The original version was unveiled in 1994 and had &quot;Mariners&quot; in silver with navy and white trim. The next season, the white trim was removed to improve visibility. The Mariners did not wear green uniforms from 1997 to 2010, after which it became a regular part of their uniform rotation. Formerly worn on Friday home games, the Northwest Green alternates are currently worn on select Saturday home games and on road games in which the home team wears either navy or black uniforms.

The navy alternate uniform originally replaced the Northwest Green alternate in 1997 and featured the team name in silver with Northwest Green and navy trim. In 1999, the alternates were updated to feature the city name with the &quot;S&quot; behind the compass rose logo and silver piping; this became their road alternate the following season after a corresponding home navy alternate was introduced. In 2003, the silver piping was removed and the letter and number fonts were changed to match the wordmark. In 2012, after the Northwest Green home alternates were brought back, the navy uniforms were tweaked anew, this time with the city name in front and stylized serifed letters instead of the normal block letters. In 2024, the names were changed to block lettering. It is now worn on most road games, though they have also donned them at home on occasion.

A navy blue cap that features a ball and compass rose &quot;S&quot; logo is paired with the home white, road gray, and navy blue jerseys. A variation of this cap with a Northwest Green brim is worn with the home alternate jersey. In 1994, the Mariners also wore Northwest Green caps with navy brims, and in 1997 the team wore a navy cap with grey brims.

In January 2015, the team announced a new alternate uniform to be worn for Sunday home games. This cream-colored &quot;fauxback&quot; uniform features the current logo and lettering style in a royal blue and gold color scheme, a throwback to the original team colors. Unlike the rest of the uniform set, the back of the jersey does not display the player name. The cap features the current cap logo in the throwback colors.

In January 2019, the Mariners announced a new home and away uniform to be worn during spring training. The jersey has a design similar to their home white jerseys but features a powder blue throwback to the team colors during the 1980s. The cap has the usual navy blue color, but with a logo that features the signature compass rose and with a large M in the center.

For the 2023 season, MLB and Nike have instituted a &quot;four plus one&quot; model for team uniforms, consisting of a home uniform, away uniform, two alternate uniforms, and a City Connect uniform featuring &quot;color schemes and logos that pay homage to a team’s city.&quot; The Mariners confirmed that they will replace the gray jerseys with the navy blue jerseys as their standard away uniforms for the 2023 season. The team will also stop using the powder blue jerseys during spring training. The choice to remove the gray and powder blue jerseys was based on feedback from players and fans, according to Kevin Martinez, the Mariners senior vice president of marketing and communications.

The Mariners&#x27; City Connect uniform is a visual nod to Seattle&#x27;s baseball history. The jersey includes a sleeve patch featuring Mount Rainier and the letters &quot;PNW&quot;, an acronym for Pacific Northwest. The jersey also includes the inaugural colors of the team and the word &quot;Seattle&quot; across the chest lettering reminiscent of the Seattle Pilots. The jersey is paired with a cap that has new design of the trident logo and black pants. This uniform is primarily worn during Friday home games.

==Spring training==
The Peoria Sports Complex in Peoria, Arizona has been the Mariners&#x27; home spring training facility since 1994. The complex is shared with the San Diego Padres. On March 25, 2013, in a 16–0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds, the Mariners broke the team record for total home runs during a spring training season with 52.

==Season records==
&quot;This is a partial list listing the past 24 completed regular seasons. For the full season records, see here.&quot;

==T-Mobile Park==
T-Mobile Park (known as &quot;Safeco Field&quot; from 1999 to 2018) has been home to the Seattle Mariners since the first game vs. the San Diego Padres on July 15, 1999. There were 44,607 people in attendance that night.

===Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame===
Mariners then-chairman and CEO John Ellis announced on June 14, 1997, the creation of a Mariners Hall of Fame. The Mariners operate the hall of fame, which honors players, staff, and other individuals that greatly contributed to the history and success of the Mariners franchise. It is located at the Baseball Museum of the Pacific Northwest in T-Mobile Park. The most recent Mariners Hall of Fame member, Félix Hernández, was inducted August 12, 2023.

==Retired numbers==
The Mariners criteria for retiring a uniform number is more selective than the standards for the Mariners Hall of Fame. To be eligible to have one&#x27;s number retired, in addition to the criteria outlined for the Mariners&#x27; Hall of Fame, the former Mariners should have either:      a) been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and been in a Mariners uniform for at least five years, or       b) come close to such election and have spent substantially his entire career with the Mariners. Eligibility shall not commence until after the former player has been voted on once for the National Baseball Hall of Fame, which for effectively means six years after retirement.

Ken Griffey Jr.&#x27;s No. 24 was retired at the beginning of the 2016 season, with the retirement ceremony taking place on August 6, 2016. Griffey was elected to the Hall of Fame in January of that year.

Edgar Martínez&#x27;s No. 11 was retired during the 2017 season, with the retirement ceremony taking place on August 12, 2017. Martínez played his entire career with the Mariners and first appeared on the Hall of Fame ballot in . His No. 11 was retired in 2017, predating his 2019 election to the Hall of Fame and seemingly establishing the 58.6% of the vote he received that year as sufficiently &quot;close&quot; to election to satisfy the criteria. The number 11 was not issued to anyone after Martínez&#x27;s retirement as a player in 2004 until his return to the Mariners as hitting coach in 2015.

Jackie Robinson&#x27;s No. 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball on April 15, 1997.

=== Potential retired numbers ===
Currently, only three other players have definitively met the requirements to have their number retired, Randy Johnson, Adrián Beltré, and Ichiro Suzuki.

Johnson played 10 seasons with the Mariners, from 1989 until mid-1998, and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2015. His number 51 was withheld from players until 2001, when it was issued to Ichiro Suzuki upon his request. Suzuki wore that number for his entire career in Japan. No other player wore the number following Suzuki&#x27;s 2012 trade to the Yankees. Suzuki once again wore number 51 when he rejoined the Mariners in 2018 until he retired the following year.

Beltré, who spent five seasons in a Mariner uniform (2005–2009), was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2024. Beltré wore number 5 during his first year with the team, then number 29 during his last four. Both numbers have been reissued multiple times since Beltré left Seattle, with Cade Marlowe currently wearing number 5 and Cal Raleigh wearing number 29. The Mariners have not indicated any plans to retire Beltré&#x27;s number.

Suzuki became eligible to have number 51 retired in 2025, as he was voted into the Hall of Fame that same year. Following his election to the Hall of Fame, the Mariners announced that his number will officially be retired in a pregame ceremony on August 9, 2025. He has continued to wear the number after retiring, including during spring training in 2020 and 2022 as well as when throwing out a ceremonial first pitch in 2022.

Lou Piniella&#x27;s number 14 was not given to any uniformed personnel after Piniella&#x27;s 2002 departure until it was issued to third base coach Manny Acta beginning in 2016. Piniella has been on the Hall of Fame ballot three times (2016, 2018, and 2023), and he was one vote short in the latter two ballots from being inducted.

The Mariners have not reissued number 19 since Jay Buhner left the team after 2001.

Number 00 is presumed off-limits, because the Mariner Moose has worn it since 1997. Outfielder Jeffrey Leonard was the last player to wear 00 for the M&#x27;s, in 1990. From 1990 to 1996, the Moose wore the last two digits of the year of the current season.

==Culture==
===&quot;Louie Louie&quot;===
From the 1990 season through the 2021 season, as part of the seventh-inning stretch, after the crowd was led in singing &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&quot; or &quot;God Bless America&quot; the public address system played the Kingsmen&#x27;s version of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. The song was a regional hit in the Northwest, covered by many local bands for nearly a decade until the Portland-based Kingsmen recorded their version in 1963. In 1985, the song&#x27;s regional importance was publicized by a campaign to make it the official state song of Washington. The tradition to play the song during the seventh inning stretch began as an attempt for the then new ownership group to put its stamp on the team, and was solidified on June 2, 1990, when the Kingsmen performed the song in the middle of the seventh inning live from atop a dugout. That game, Randy Johnson threw the first no-hitter in Mariners history.

For the 2022 season, the Mariners replaced &quot;Louie Louie&quot; with the Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis song &quot;Can&#x27;t Hold Us&quot;. The elimination of the traditional &quot;Louie Louie&quot; has been a source of contention amongst some across the northwest, according to local news media.

===Buhner Buzz Cut Night===
In 1994, the Mariners started a promotion called &quot;Buhner Buzz Cut Night.&quot; Inspired by Jay Buhner&#x27;s shaved head, any fan who was willing to have their head shaved before the game—or was already bald—would receive a free ticket to the game and a T-shirt with a slogan, such as &quot;Bald is Buhnerful&quot; or &quot;Take Me Out To The Bald Game.&quot; Hair 10 inches or longer was collected for charity. The promotion continued until Buhner&#x27;s retirement in 2001, with a year&#x27;s hiatus in 2000, and is still remembered by fans today. The club revived the promotion for its 30th anniversary in 2024, with Buhner giving catcher Cal Raleigh a buzz cut.

===Rally Fries===

Rally Fries are a baseball tradition started by Mariners broadcaster Mike Blowers in 2007. During a game against the Cincinnati Reds, a fan tried to catch a foul ball along the right-field line but in turn spilled his tray of french fries along the track. While chatting on the air and seeing the mishap, Blowers&#x27; partner, Dave Sims, suggested that he should send a new tray of fries to the fan. Blowers agreed, and sent his intern to deliver a plate of fries to the man.

At the Mariners&#x27; next game, fans made signs and boards asking Blowers for fries as well. Coincidentally, every time the fries were delivered, the Mariners seem to score or rally from a deficit, and thus the &quot;Rally Fries&quot; were created. This became so popular with the fans that signs were even seen when the Mariners were the visiting team, although on August 1, 2009, Blowers established that he only gives out fries at home games.

Generally, Blowers would select a person or a group of people that appealed to him, whether it was through fans wearing elaborate costumes or waving funny signs and boards. The fries were usually delivered from Ivar&#x27;s, a Seattle-based seafood restaurant with a location at T-Mobile Park. The amount of fries given out varied with the size of the winning group of fans. The winners were generally selected around the 5th or 6th inning, although potential candidates were shown in almost every inning beforehand.

Sims confirmed in 2012 that the Rally Fries promotion had ended.

=== JROD Squad ===
The JROD Squad honors Mariners center fielder Julio Rodríguez. The location varies, although it is usually in seats in center field. Fans buying tickets to the JROD Squad section (referred to collectively as &quot;JROD&#x27;s Squad&quot;) receive a T-shirt showing a replica of a gold chain Rodriguez wears around his neck. Rodriguez often interacts with the JROD Squad, waving to them and throwing them balls at the end of innings.

=== Previous fan sections ===

====Area 51====
When Ichiro Suzuki played right field for the Mariners, seats in right field were often informally called Area 51, a nod to Suzuki&#x27;s uniform number (51) and the top-secret government site in Nevada of the same name.

====King&#x27;s Court====
As the 2011 season progressed, the Mariners&#x27; marketing staff came up with an idea to encourage the growing fanbase of star pitcher &quot;King&quot; Félix Hernández. Every Hernandez start at T-Mobile Park was accompanied by the King&#x27;s Court, a designated cheering section for fans to sing, chant, and cheer while donning yellow T-shirts and &quot;K&quot; cards supplied by the team. It was located in the lower seating area along the third baseline. The team encouraged other activities, such as dressing like Larry Bernandez, Hernandez&#x27;s alter ego from a Mariners TV commercial, and awarding fans wearing costumes with a turkey leg.

The Supreme Court was a special event where the King&#x27;s Court section was extended to the entirety of T-Mobile Park. The first Supreme Court was Hernandez&#x27;s first home game following his perfect game in 2012. Following opening day 2012, it occurred each year at Hernandez&#x27;s first home game of each season.

The King&#x27;s Court ended following Hernandez&#x27;s departure from the Mariners at the end of the 2019 season.

====Maple Grove====
During the 2017 season, fans created the Maple Grove, a celebration of Canadian pitcher James Paxton and inspired by the King&#x27;s Court. At home games where Paxton started, a group of fans sat under a Maple Grove banner, typically in the left-field bleachers. A potted maple tree was also present in their section, provided by the Mariners. The Grove dubbed the tree &quot;Stick Rizzs,&quot; referencing long-time broadcaster Rick Rizzs.

When Paxton got to two strikes on a batter, the Grove held up “Eh” Cards, a tip of the cap to Paxton&#x27;s home country of Canada and a nod to the &quot;K&quot; (for strikeout) cards held up in King&#x27;s Court. Variant cards have also been produced for special occasions, such as when a planned Paxton start turned into a Hernández start (a King&#x27;s Grove, with &quot;K&#x27;eh&quot; cards to cheer for Hernández). Other special cards celebrated Paxton reaching 300 strikeouts, and a tribute to broadcaster Angie Mentink (&quot;A&quot; cards, to show support after she had publicly disclosed her breast cancer diagnosis). An &quot;Eh&quot; card is now part of the Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s collection.

The Maple Grove differed from the King&#x27;s Court in that it was created and organized by fans, while the Court was promoted by the Mariners&#x27; marketing team. When asked, Paxton stated that fans creating the Maple Grove was really special to him and that he never imagined that something of the sort would ever be done for him. The Grove continued until Paxton was traded to the Yankees following the 2018 season.

==Rivalries==
=== Divisional ===
The Mariners also held a longstanding divisional rivalry with the Oakland Athletics as they would often battle for playoff contention or lead of the division through the early 2000s. Following the realignment of the division in 2013, the Mariners have also built a recent rivalry with the Houston Astros as both teams have handily fought for control of the division.

====Los Angeles Angels====
The Los Angeles Angels have maintained an off-and-on rivalry with the Mariners as both teams have often fought for control of the division or a playoff berth. Both teams often clashed for playoff positions during the early 2000s as the Mariners boasted a 116 win team in 2001 while the Angels managed to win the World Series in 2002. Despite both teams encountering a decline through the decade, regular matchups often developed into clashes for relevance in the division. Recently, both teams had been fighting for their own respective position in search of the postseason as both sides have been bolstered with such talents as Julio Rodríguez and Ty France for Seattle or Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout for the Angels The two teams have met 717 times with the Angels leading the series 388–329, both teams have yet to meet in the postseason. In 2022, tensions were heightened after Angels pitcher Andrew Wantz intentionally hit Mariners batter Jesse Winker with a pitch, leading to a major brawl that resulted in several players receiving suspensions.

====Houston Astros====
The Mariners and Houston Astros have fought for control of the division in recent years. The 2022 season saw the Mariners return to the playoffs, winning their first series since 2001. The Mariners and Astros faced off in the ALDS, with Houston sweeping the Mariners in 3 games. Recent animosity among players has included brawls and inside pitches. The series is lopsided in favor of the Astros, which lead the all-time regular season series 127–89 and have a perfect 3–0 record against Seattle in the postseason.

===Interleague===
====The Vedder Cup====
An unusual rivalry exists between the Mariners and the National League&#x27;s San Diego Padres. Often called the Eddie Vedder Cup due to both Seattle and San Diego being hometowns for Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder, though he is a fan of the Chicago Cubs. The two teams have played each other every season since interleague play began in 1997, excluding 2017. Following the introduction of interleague play, one of the 15 naturalized rivalries designated included Seattle and San Diego. The rivalry often involved both teams in the depths of playoff failure, as the Padres failed to win a single playoff series between 1999 and 2019, while the Mariners had failed to make the playoffs from 2002 to 2021, thus forcing both teams to regularly compete for draft picks and prospects. The teams also share the Peoria Sports Complex in Peoria, Arizona as their spring training facility. Very little on the surface initially linked any animosity between the two teams, as they play in separate leagues and both cities lie approximately 1,250 miles apart. Both teams often took pride in competing for draft prospects due to the lack of success on both sides, as the Padres have made two appearances in the World Series while the Mariners currently remain the only franchise in MLB not to win a pennant. The rivalry often exists with more respect between the two teams and fans alike, as more of a humorous contest for both sides.

==Minor league affiliations==
The Seattle Mariners farm system consists of six minor league affiliates.

==Radio and television==
The Mariners&#x27; flagship radio station is KIRO-AM, which previously broadcast Mariners contests from 1985 to 2002. Former flagship stations include KOMO, from 2003 to 2008, and KVI from 1977 to 1984. Television rights are held by Root Sports Northwest, which the Mariners own. In the past, Mariners games appeared in Seattle on over-the-air stations KING, KIRO, KTZZ, and KSTW. Selected Mariners games are also available on Canadian television due to an agreement between Root Sports Northwest and Rogers Sportsnet Pacific.

Since 2013, Rick Rizzs and Aaron Goldsmith have called games on the radio. The television broadcasts were anchored by play-by-play announcer Dave Sims, until his departure in November 2024, and color commentator and former Mariners third baseman Mike Blowers. Seattle radio personality Matt Pitman hosts the post-game show on the Mariners&#x27; radio network, along with clubhouse reporter Shannon Drayer. Steve Guasch is the Spanish-language radio broadcaster.

The Mariners&#x27; broadcast team for 2010 featured Dave Niehaus and Rizzs—back for their 32nd and 23rd seasons with the club, respectively—as well as Sims and Blowers. For the first three innings of each game, Niehaus worked the television broadcast with Blowers while Rizzs and Sims handled radio duties; after the third inning, Niehaus and Sims traded places. Niehaus, who broadcast for the Mariners since their inaugural season of 1977, died on November 10, 2010. For the 2011 season, Dave Niehaus&#x27; duties in the broadcast booth were filled by a collection of former Mariners broadcasters such as Ron Fairly, Ken Levine, and Ken Wilson and former Mariners&#x27; players including Dave Valle, Dan Wilson, Jay Buhner, and Dave Henderson.

Tom Hutyler has been the Mariners&#x27; public address announcer since 1987, first at the Kingdome and now at T-Mobile Park. When KOMO AM was the Mariners&#x27; flagship radio station, Hutyler occasionally hosted the post-game radio show.

<text>In computing, source code, or simply code or source, is a plain text computer program written in a programming language. A programmer writes the human readable source code to control the behavior of a computer.

Since a computer, at base, only understands machine code, source code must be translated before a computer can execute it. The translation process can be implemented three ways. Source code can be converted into machine code by a compiler or an assembler. The resulting executable is machine code ready for the computer. Alternatively, source code can be executed without conversion via an interpreter. An interpreter loads the source code into memory. It simultaneously translates and executes each statement. A method that combines compilation and interpretation is to first produce bytecode. Bytecode is an intermediate representation of source code that is quickly interpreted.

==Background==
The first programmable computers, which appeared at the end of the 1940s, were programmed in machine language (simple instructions that could be directly executed by the processor). Machine language was difficult to debug and was not portable between different computer systems. Initially, hardware resources were scarce and expensive, while human resources were cheaper. As programs grew more complex, programmer productivity became a bottleneck. This led to the introduction of high-level programming languages such as Fortran in the mid-1950s. These languages abstracted away the details of the hardware, instead being designed to express algorithms that could be understood more easily by humans. As instructions distinct from the underlying computer hardware, software is therefore relatively recent, dating to these early high-level programming languages such as Fortran, Lisp, and Cobol. The invention of high-level programming languages was simultaneous with the compilers needed to translate the source code automatically into machine code that can be directly executed on the computer hardware. 

Source code is the form of code that is modified directly by humans, typically in a high-level programming language. Object code can be directly executed by the machine and is generated automatically from the source code, often via an intermediate step, assembly language. While object code will only work on a specific platform, source code can be ported to a different machine and recompiled there. For the same source code, object code can vary significantly—not only based on the machine for which it is compiled, but also based on performance optimization from the compiler.

== Organization ==

Most programs do not contain all the resources needed to run them and rely on external libraries. Part of the compiler&#x27;s function is to link these files in such a way that the program can be executed by the hardware.

Software developers often use configuration management to track changes to source code files (version control). The configuration management system also keeps track of which object code file corresponds to which version of the source code file.

== Purposes ==
===Estimation===
The number of lines of source code is often used as a metric when evaluating the productivity of computer programmers, the economic value of a code base, effort estimation for projects in development, and the ongoing cost of software maintenance after release.

===Communication===
Source code is also used to communicate algorithms between people e.g., code snippets online or in books.

Computer programmers may find it helpful to review existing source code to learn about programming techniques. The sharing of source code between developers is frequently cited as a contributing factor to the maturation of their programming skills. Some people consider source code an expressive artistic medium.

Source code often contains comments—blocks of text marked for the compiler to ignore. This content is not part of the program logic, but is instead intended to help readers understand the program.

Companies often keep the source code confidential in order to hide algorithms considered a trade secret. Proprietary, secret source code and algorithms are widely used for sensitive government applications such as criminal justice, which results in black box behavior with a lack of transparency into the algorithm&#x27;s methodology. The result is avoidance of public scrutiny of issues such as bias.
===Modification===

Access to the source code (not just the object code) is essential to modifying it. Understanding existing code is necessary to understand how it works and before modifying it. The rate of understanding depends both on the code base as well as the skill of the programmer. Experienced programmers have an easier time understanding what the code does at a high level. Software visualization is sometimes used to speed up this process. 

Many software programmers use an integrated development environment (IDE) to improve their productivity. IDEs typically have several features built in, including a source-code editor that can alert the programmer to common errors. Modification often includes code refactoring (improving the structure without changing functionality) and restructuring (improving structure and functionality at the same time). Nearly every change to code will introduce new bugs or unexpected ripple effects, which require another round of fixes. 

Code reviews by other developers are often used to scrutinize new code added to a project. The purpose of this phase is often to verify that the code meets style and maintainability standards and that it is a correct implementation of the software design. According to some estimates, code review dramatically reduce the number of bugs persisting after software testing is complete. Along with software testing that works by executing the code, static program analysis uses automated tools to detect problems with the source code. Many IDEs support code analysis tools, which might provide metrics on the clarity and maintainability of the code. Debuggers are tools that often enable programmers to step through execution while keeping track of which source code corresponds to each change of state.

===Compilation and execution===
Source code files in a high-level programming language must go through a stage of preprocessing into machine code before the instructions can be carried out. After being compiled, the program can be saved as an object file and the loader (part of the operating system) can take this saved file and execute it as a process on the computer hardware. Some programming languages use an interpreter instead of a compiler. An interpreter converts the program into machine code at run time, which makes them 10 to 100 times slower than compiled programming languages.

==Quality==
Software quality is an overarching term that can refer to a code&#x27;s correct and efficient behavior, its reusability and portability, or the ease of modification. It is usually more cost-effective to build quality into the product from the beginning rather than try to add it later in the development process. Higher quality code will reduce lifetime cost to both suppliers and customers as it is more reliable and easier to maintain. 

Maintainability is the quality of software enabling it to be easily modified without breaking existing functionality. Following coding conventions such as using clear function and variable names that correspond to their purpose makes maintenance easier. Use of conditional loop statements only if the code could execute more than once, and eliminating code that will never execute can also increase understandability. Many software development organizations neglect maintainability during the development phase, even though it will increase long-term costs. Technical debt is incurred when programmers, often out of laziness or urgency to meet a deadline, choose quick and dirty solutions rather than build maintainability into their code. A common cause is underestimates in software development effort estimation, leading to insufficient resources allocated to development. A challenge with maintainability is that many software engineering courses do not emphasize it. Development engineers who know that they will not be responsible for maintaining the software do not have an incentive to build in maintainability.

== Copyright and licensing ==

The situation varies worldwide, but in the United States before 1974, software and its source code was not copyrightable and therefore always public domain software. In 1974, the US Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) decided that &quot;computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author&#x27;s original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright&quot;.

Proprietary software is rarely distributed as source code. Although the term open-source software literally refers to public access to the source code, open-source software has additional requirements: free redistribution, permission to modify the source code and release derivative works under the same license, and nondiscrimination between different uses—including commercial use. The free reusability of open-source software can speed up development.

<doc id="27667" wikidata="Q107" url="?curid=27667" title="Space">
<text>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as &quot;spacetime&quot;. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.

In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as &quot;curved&quot;, rather than &quot;flat&quot;, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.

== Philosophy of space ==

Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the &quot;Timaeus&quot; of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called &quot;khôra&quot; (i.e. &quot;space&quot;), or in the &quot;Physics&quot; of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of &quot;topos&quot; (i.e. place), or in the later &quot;geometrical conception of place&quot; as &quot;space &quot;qua&quot; extension&quot; in the &quot;Discourse on Place&quot; (&quot;Qawl fi al-Makan&quot;) of the 11th-century Arab polymath Alhazen. Many of these classical philosophical questions were discussed in the Renaissance and then reformulated in the 17th century, particularly during the early development of classical mechanics.

Isaac Newton viewed space as absolute, existing permanently and independently of whether there was any matter in it. In contrast, other natural philosophers, notably Gottfried Leibniz, thought that space was in fact a collection of relations between objects, given by their distance and direction from one another. In the 18th century, the philosopher and theologian George Berkeley attempted to refute the &quot;visibility of spatial depth&quot; in his &quot;Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision&quot;. Later, the metaphysician Immanuel Kant said that the concepts of space and time are not empirical ones derived from experiences of the outside world—they are elements of an already given systematic framework that humans possess and use to structure all experiences. Kant referred to the experience of &quot;space&quot; in his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; as being a subjective &quot;pure &quot;a priori&quot; form of intuition&quot;.

=== Galileo ===
Galilean and Cartesian theories about space, matter, and motion are at the foundation of the Scientific Revolution, which is understood to have culminated with the publication of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; in 1687. Newton&#x27;s theories about space and time helped him explain the movement of objects. While his theory of space is considered the most influential in physics, it emerged from his predecessors&#x27; ideas about the same.

As one of the pioneers of modern science, Galileo revised the established Aristotelian and Ptolemaic ideas about a geocentric cosmos. He backed the Copernican theory that the universe was heliocentric, with a stationary Sun at the center and the planets—including the Earth—revolving around the Sun. If the Earth moved, the Aristotelian belief that its natural tendency was to remain at rest was in question. Galileo wanted to prove instead that the Sun moved around its axis, that motion was as natural to an object as the state of rest. In other words, for Galileo, celestial bodies, including the Earth, were naturally inclined to move in circles. This view displaced another Aristotelian idea—that all objects gravitated towards their designated natural place-of-belonging.

=== René Descartes ===
Descartes set out to replace the Aristotelian worldview with a theory about space and motion as determined by natural laws. In other words, he sought a metaphysical foundation or a mechanical explanation for his theories about matter and motion. Cartesian space was Euclidean in structure—infinite, uniform and flat. It was defined as that which contained matter; conversely, matter by definition had a spatial extension so that there was no such thing as empty space.

The Cartesian notion of space is closely linked to his theories about the nature of the body, mind and matter. He is famously known for his &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; (I think therefore I am), or the idea that we can only be certain of the fact that we can doubt, and therefore think and therefore exist. His theories belong to the rationalist tradition, which attributes knowledge about the world to our ability to think rather than to our experiences, as the empiricists believe. He posited a clear distinction between the body and mind, which is referred to as the Cartesian dualism.

=== Leibniz and Newton ===

Following Galileo and Descartes, during the seventeenth century the philosophy of space and time revolved around the ideas of Gottfried Leibniz, a German philosopher–mathematician, and Isaac Newton, who set out two opposing theories of what space is. Rather than being an entity that independently exists over and above other matter, Leibniz held that space is no more than the collection of spatial relations between objects in the world: &quot;space is that which results from places taken together&quot;. Unoccupied regions are those that &quot;could&quot; have objects in them, and thus spatial relations with other places. For Leibniz, then, space was an idealised abstraction from the relations between individual entities or their possible locations and therefore could not be continuous but must be discrete.
Space could be thought of in a similar way to the relations between family members. Although people in the family are related to one another, the relations do not exist independently of the people.
Leibniz argued that space could not exist independently of objects in the world because that implies a difference between two universes exactly alike except for the location of the material world in each universe. But since there would be no observational way of telling these universes apart then, according to the identity of indiscernibles, there would be no real difference between them. According to the principle of sufficient reason, any theory of space that implied that there could be these two possible universes must therefore be wrong.
Newton took space to be more than relations between material objects and based his position on observation and experimentation. For a relationist there can be no real difference between inertial motion, in which the object travels with constant velocity, and non-inertial motion, in which the velocity changes with time, since all spatial measurements are relative to other objects and their motions. But Newton argued that since non-inertial motion generates forces, it must be absolute. He used the example of water in a spinning bucket to demonstrate his argument. Water in a bucket is hung from a rope and set to spin, starts with a flat surface. After a while, as the bucket continues to spin, the surface of the water becomes concave. If the bucket&#x27;s spinning is stopped then the surface of the water remains concave as it continues to spin. The concave surface is therefore apparently not the result of relative motion between the bucket and the water. Instead, Newton argued, it must be a result of non-inertial motion relative to space itself. For several centuries the bucket argument was considered decisive in showing that space must exist independently of matter.

=== Kant ===

In the eighteenth century the German philosopher Immanuel Kant published his theory of space as &quot;a property of our mind&quot; by which &quot;we represent to ourselves objects as outside us, and all as in space&quot; in the Critique of Pure Reason On his view the nature of spatial predicates are &quot;relations that only attach to the form of intuition alone, and thus to the subjective constitution of our mind, without which these predicates could not be attached to anything at all.&quot; This develops his theory of knowledge in which knowledge about space itself can be both &quot;a priori&quot; and &quot;synthetic&quot;.
According to Kant, knowledge about space is &quot;synthetic&quot; because any proposition about space cannot be true &quot;merely&quot; in virtue of the meaning of the terms contained in the proposition. In the counter-example, the proposition &quot;all unmarried men are bachelors&quot; &quot;is&quot; true by virtue of each term&#x27;s meaning. Further, space is &quot;a priori&quot; because it is the form of our receptive abilities to receive information about the external world. For example, someone without sight can still perceive spatial attributes via touch, hearing, and smell. Knowledge of space itself is &quot;a priori&quot; because it belongs to the subjective constitution of our mind as the form or manner of our intuition of external objects.

=== Non-Euclidean geometry ===
Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; contained five postulates that form the basis for Euclidean geometry. One of these, the parallel postulate, has been the subject of debate among mathematicians for many centuries. It states that on any plane on which there is a straight line &quot;L1&quot; and a point &quot;P&quot; not on &quot;L1&quot;, there is exactly one straight line &quot;L2&quot; on the plane that passes through the point &quot;P&quot; and is parallel to the straight line &quot;L1&quot;. Until the 19th century, few doubted the truth of the postulate; instead debate centered over whether it was necessary as an axiom, or whether it was a theory that could be derived from the other axioms. Around 1830 though, the Hungarian János Bolyai and the Russian Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky separately published treatises on a type of geometry that does not include the parallel postulate, called hyperbolic geometry. In this geometry, an infinite number of parallel lines pass through the point &quot;P&quot;. Consequently, the sum of angles in a triangle is less than 180° and the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its diameter is greater than pi. In the 1850s, Bernhard Riemann developed an equivalent theory of elliptical geometry, in which no parallel lines pass through &quot;P&quot;. In this geometry, triangles have more than 180° and circles have a ratio of circumference-to-diameter that is less than pi.

=== Gauss and Poincaré ===

Although there was a prevailing Kantian consensus at the time, once non-Euclidean geometries had been formalised, some began to wonder whether or not physical space is curved. Carl Friedrich Gauss, a German mathematician, was the first to consider an empirical investigation of the geometrical structure of space. He thought of making a test of the sum of the angles of an enormous stellar triangle, and there are reports that he actually carried out a test, on a small scale, by triangulating mountain tops in Germany.

Henri Poincaré, a French mathematician and physicist of the late 19th century, introduced an important insight in which he attempted to demonstrate the futility of any attempt to discover which geometry applies to space by experiment. He considered the predicament that would face scientists if they were confined to the surface of an imaginary large sphere with particular properties, known as a sphere-world. In this world, the temperature is taken to vary in such a way that all objects expand and contract in similar proportions in different places on the sphere. With a suitable falloff in temperature, if the scientists try to use measuring rods to determine the sum of the angles in a triangle, they can be deceived into thinking that they inhabit a plane, rather than a spherical surface. In fact, the scientists cannot in principle determine whether they inhabit a plane or sphere and, Poincaré argued, the same is true for the debate over whether real space is Euclidean or not. For him, which geometry was used to describe space was a matter of convention. Since Euclidean geometry is simpler than non-Euclidean geometry, he assumed the former would always be used to describe the &#x27;true&#x27; geometry of the world.

=== Einstein ===

In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity, which led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as &quot;spacetime&quot;. In this theory, the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers—which has the result that two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. Moreover, an observer will measure a moving clock to tick more slowly than one that is stationary with respect to them; and objects are measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.

Subsequently, Einstein worked on a general theory of relativity, which is a theory of how gravity interacts with spacetime. Instead of viewing gravity as a force field acting in spacetime, Einstein suggested that it modifies the geometric structure of spacetime itself. According to the general theory, time goes more slowly at places with lower gravitational potentials and rays of light bend in the presence of a gravitational field. Scientists have studied the behaviour of binary pulsars, confirming the predictions of Einstein&#x27;s theories. Non-Euclidean geometry is usually used to describe spacetime.

== Mathematics ==
In modern mathematics spaces are defined as sets with some added structure. They are typically topological spaces, in which a concept of neighbourhood is defined, frequently by means of a distance (metric spaces). The elements of a space are often called &quot;points&quot;, but they can have other names such as vectors in vector spaces and functions in function spaces.

== Physics ==
Space is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics, meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because nothing more fundamental is known at the present. On the other hand, it can be related to other fundamental quantities. Thus, similar to other fundamental quantities (like time and mass), space can be explored via measurement and experiment.

Today, our three-dimensional space is viewed as embedded in a four-dimensional spacetime, called Minkowski space (see special relativity). The idea behind spacetime is that time is hyperbolic-orthogonal to each of the three spatial dimensions.

=== Relativity ===
Before Albert Einstein&#x27;s work on relativistic physics, time and space were viewed as independent dimensions. Einstein&#x27;s discoveries showed that due to relativity of motion our space and time can be mathematically combined into one object–spacetime. It turns out that distances in space or in time separately are not invariant with respect to Lorentz coordinate transformations, but distances in Minkowski space along spacetime intervals are—which justifies the name.

In addition, time and space dimensions should not be viewed as exactly equivalent in Minkowski space. One can freely move in space but not in time. Thus, time and space coordinates are treated differently both in special relativity (where time is sometimes considered an imaginary coordinate) and in general relativity (where different signs are assigned to time and space components of spacetime metric).

Furthermore, in Einstein&#x27;s general theory of relativity, it is postulated that spacetime is geometrically distorted – &quot;curved&quot; – near to gravitationally significant masses.

One consequence of this postulate, which follows from the equations of general relativity, is the prediction of moving ripples of spacetime, called gravitational waves. While indirect evidence for these waves has been found (in the motions of the Hulse–Taylor binary system, for example) experiments attempting to directly measure these waves are ongoing at the LIGO and Virgo collaborations. LIGO scientists reported the first such direct observation of gravitational waves on 14 September 2015.

=== Cosmology ===
Relativity theory leads to the cosmological question of what shape the universe is, and where space came from. It appears that space was created in the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. The overall shape of space is not known, but space is known to be expanding very rapidly due to the cosmic inflation.

== Spatial measurement ==
The measurement of &quot;physical space&quot; has long been important. Although earlier societies had developed measuring systems, the International System of Units, (SI), is now the most common system of units used in the measuring of space, and is almost universally used.

Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard meter or simply meter, is defined as the distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of exactly 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition coupled with present definition of the second is based on the special theory of relativity in which the speed of light plays the role of a fundamental constant of nature.

== Geographical space ==
Geography is the branch of science concerned with identifying and describing places on Earth, utilizing spatial awareness to try to understand why things exist in specific locations. Cartography is the mapping of spaces to allow better navigation, for visualization purposes and to act as a locational device. Geostatistics apply statistical concepts to collected spatial data of Earth to create an estimate for unobserved phenomena.

Geographical space is often considered as land, and can have a relation to ownership usage (in which space is seen as property or territory). While some cultures assert the rights of the individual in terms of ownership, other cultures will identify with a communal approach to land ownership, while still other cultures such as Australian Aboriginals, rather than asserting ownership rights to land, invert the relationship and consider that they are in fact owned by the land. Spatial planning is a method of regulating the use of space at land-level, with decisions made at regional, national and international levels. Space can also impact on human and cultural behavior, being an important factor in architecture, where it will impact on the design of buildings and structures, and on farming.

Ownership of space is not restricted to land. Ownership of airspace and of waters is decided internationally. Other forms of ownership have been recently asserted to other spaces—for example to the radio bands of the electromagnetic spectrum or to cyberspace.

Public space is a term used to define areas of land as collectively owned by the community, and managed in their name by delegated bodies; such spaces are open to all, while private property is the land culturally owned by an individual or company, for their own use and pleasure.

Abstract space is a term used in geography to refer to a hypothetical space characterized by complete homogeneity. When modeling activity or behavior, it is a conceptual tool used to limit extraneous variables such as terrain.

== In psychology ==

Psychologists first began to study the way space is perceived in the middle of the 19th century. Those now concerned with such studies regard it as a distinct branch of psychology. Psychologists analyzing the perception of space are concerned with how recognition of an object&#x27;s physical appearance or its interactions are perceived, see, for example, visual space.

Other, more specialized topics studied include amodal perception and object permanence. The perception of surroundings is important due to its necessary relevance to survival, especially with regards to hunting and self preservation as well as simply one&#x27;s idea of personal space.

Several space-related phobias have been identified, including agoraphobia (the fear of open spaces), (the fear of celestial space) and claustrophobia (the fear of enclosed spaces).

The understanding of three-dimensional space in humans is thought to be learned during infancy using unconscious inference, and is closely related to hand-eye coordination. The visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions is called depth perception.

== In the social sciences ==
Space has been studied in the social sciences from the perspectives of Marxism, feminism, postmodernism, postcolonialism, urban theory and critical geography. These theories account for the effect of the history of colonialism, transatlantic slavery and globalization on our understanding and experience of space and place. The topic has garnered attention since the 1980s, after the publication of Henri Lefebvre&#x27;s &quot;The Production of Space .&quot; In this book, Lefebvre applies Marxist ideas about the production of commodities and accumulation of capital to discuss space as a social product. His focus is on the multiple and overlapping social processes that produce space.

In his book &quot;The Condition of Postmodernity,&quot; David Harvey describes what he terms the &quot;time-space compression.&quot; This is the effect of technological advances and capitalism on our perception of time, space and distance. Changes in the modes of production and consumption of capital affect and are affected by developments in transportation and technology. These advances create relationships across time and space, new markets and groups of wealthy elites in urban centers, all of which annihilate distances and affect our perception of linearity and distance.

In his book &quot;Thirdspace,&quot; Edward Soja describes space and spatiality as an integral and neglected aspect of what he calls the &quot;trialectics of being,&quot; the three modes that determine how we inhabit, experience and understand the world. He argues that critical theories in the Humanities and Social Sciences study the historical and social dimensions of our lived experience, neglecting the spatial dimension. He builds on Henri Lefebvre&#x27;s work to address the dualistic way in which humans understand space—as either material/physical or as represented/imagined. Lefebvre&#x27;s &quot;lived space&quot; and Soja&#x27;s &quot;thirdspace&quot; are terms that account for the complex ways in which humans understand and navigate place, which &quot;firstspace&quot; and &quot;Secondspace&quot; (Soja&#x27;s terms for material and imagined spaces respectively) do not fully encompass.

Postcolonial theorist Homi Bhabha&#x27;s concept of Third Space is different from Soja&#x27;s Thirdspace, even though both terms offer a way to think outside the terms of a binary logic. Bhabha&#x27;s Third Space is the space in which hybrid cultural forms and identities exist. In his theories, the term hybrid describes new cultural forms that emerge through the interaction between colonizer and colonized.

<text>Spanish cuisine () consists of the traditions and practices of Spanish cooking. It features considerable regional diversity, with significant differences among the traditions of each of Spain&#x27;s regional cuisines.

Olive oil (of which Spain is the world&#x27;s largest producer) is extensively used in Spanish cuisine. It forms the base of many vegetable sauces (known in Spanish as &quot;sofritos&quot;). Herbs most commonly used include parsley, oregano, rosemary and thyme. The use of garlic has been noted as common in Spanish cooking. The most used meats in Spanish cuisine include chicken, pork, lamb and veal. Fish and seafood are also consumed on a regular basis. Tapas and pinchos are snacks and appetizers commonly served in bars and cafes.

== History ==
=== Antiquity ===
Authors such as Strabo wrote about the aboriginal people of Spain using nuts and acorns as staple foods. The extension of vineyards along the Mediterranean seemed to be due to the colonization of Greeks and Phoenicians, who also introduced the production of olive oil. Spain became the largest producer of olive oil in the world. The growing of crops of the so-called &quot;tríada mediterránea&quot; (the &quot;Mediterranean triad&quot;: wheat, grapes, and olives) underpinned the staple meal products for the inhabitants of the south of the Iberian Peninsula during the Roman Era (bread, wine and oil).

=== Middle Ages ===
The Visigoths&#x27; limited but lasting contributions to Spanish cuisine included the spread of the consumption of fermented milk and the preference for avoiding mixing water and wine.

Rice was possibly introduced for the first time by Byzantines in the Iberian Peninsula by the 6th century. After the Muslim conquest of the Iberian peninsula in the 8th century, Arabs expanded rice cultivation, bringing new irrigation techniques originally from the Indian subcontinent that also allowed for the cultivation of crops such as sugar cane, watermelon, lemon and oranges. Other ingredients possibly introduced in the Iberian Peninsula during the Hispano-Muslim period include sorghum, spinach, eggplant, peach, apricot and saffron. The most famous Spanish dish, paella, uses two ingredients that were probably popularized during the Al-Andalus period: rice and saffron.
Moors also developed the basis for the art of pastry-making and introduced &quot;escabeche&quot;, a food preservation technique relying on vinegar. Dishes like &quot;ajo blanco&quot;, &quot;alboronía&quot;, &quot;alajú&quot;, &quot;hallulla&quot;, &quot;albóndigas&quot;, &quot;mojama&quot;, &quot;arrope&quot;, were some of the many legacies of Moorish cuisine. Although Muslim religion did not allow alcoholic drinks, the consumption of wine was widespread as the Qur&#x27;anic precepts never got to overrule the preexisting traditions. There are many accounts of the &quot;drinking chats&quot; of Abd al-Rahman II, Abd al-Rahman III and Almanzor.

Observing the &quot;kashrut&quot; regulations, Jews and &quot;judaizantes&quot; opted for blood-drained meat without fat, outright rejecting bacon. &quot;Potajes&quot; were an important part of the Jewish cuisine in the Middle Ages, most notably &quot;adafina&quot; (a local name for a &quot;ḥamin&quot; dish) along with other Jewish culinary legacies in Spain. &quot;Almodrote&quot; (a formerly popular sauce preparation out of vogue since the late 17th century) was a Sephardic recipe in origin.

The history of cookbooks in Spain can be traced back to works such as the &#x27; (1324) and Ruperto de Nola&#x27;s &#x27; (1520), both written in the Catalan language. Other of the earliest cooking books in pre-modern Iberia are the &quot;&quot; by Murcia-born Ibn Razīn al-Tujībī and the anonymous &quot;Kitāb al-Ṭabikh fī al-Maghrib wa al-Andalus fī ʽAṣr al-Muwaḥḥidīn, li-muʽallif majhūl&quot;, written in Arabic.

=== Modern era ===

The arrival of Europeans in the Americas in 1492 initiated the advent of new culinary elements, such as tomatoes, potatoes, maize, bell peppers, spicy peppers, paprika, vanilla and cocoa. Spain was where chocolate was first mixed with sugar to temper its natural bitterness. Other ingredients traveled to the Americas, such as rice, grapes, olives, and many types of cereals.

Influenced by Arabic &quot;harisa&quot;, grain-based soups such as &quot;farinetes&quot; (along the Mediterranean coast) and, similarly, &quot;gachas&quot; (in the Central Plateau) were customary in Early Modern Spain.

Foreign visitors noted with disdain the Spaniards&#x27; use of olive oil and lard for cooking rather than their preferred butter. The latter was barely available and, according to the 17th-century account of Madame d&#x27;Aulnoy, on the rare occasions that it was, would come &quot;from afar, preserved in pig&#x27;s tripes and full of worms&quot;. Butter was only produced locally in places such as Galicia, Asturias and Soria, or was imported, preserved in potassium nitrate, (the so-called &quot;Flanders&#x27; butter&quot;).

By the 18th century, many American ingredients, such as peppers and tomatoes, had been fully incorporated into Spanish cuisine. Contemporary foreign visitors, such as French ambassador Jean-François de Bourgoing, judged negatively this change happening in Spain by the late part of the century: &quot;Spanish cooking, which they have inherited, is not generally pleasing to foreigners. Spaniards like strong condiments such as pepper, tomato sauce, hot peppers and saffron, which color or infect nearly all their dishes.&quot;

Spain was the bridge for the Columbian exchange between the rest of Europe and the New World. Many traditional Spanish dishes such as &quot;tortilla de patata&quot; (an omelette made with potatoes), would not be possible without the Columbian exchange. &quot;Gazpacho&quot;, &quot;salmorejo&quot;, and &quot;pan con tomate&quot; are made with tomatoes, which traveled from the New World to the Old World.

For most of the 19th century, the aristocracy consumed a set of dishes that was largely an imitation of French cuisine. That was the available cuisine at the time, together with the degeneration of regional cuisines. One positive foreign take on the Spanish dishes—opposing the largely negative views of other foreign commentators—was that of Richard Ford, who was fond of Spanish specialties such as sherry and ham.

Modern Spanish cuisine was gestated in the late-19th to early-20th century, with gastronomes and writers such as Mariano Pardo de Figueroa (Dr. Thebussem), José Castro y Serrano, Ángel Muro, Emilia Pardo Bazán, and Dionisio Pérez, some of whom put effort into developing the idea of a &quot;national cuisine&quot; recognisable by Spaniards as their own.

Keen on participating in the Spanish nation-building process, Dr. Thebussem, in an autochthonous example of culinary nationalism, proposed to the King&#x27;s Chef that the &quot;olla podrida&quot; (a rustic stew typically made of meat, legumes and other vegetables) should be served at official banquets as a national dish. This could be considered an important step in the process of straying away from the French cooking paradigm, which was dominant in the 19th century in Europe. &quot;Olla podrida&quot; had been previously ridiculed in foreign (most notably French) satires.

Although the new foodscape built in opposition to the French centralist culinary model accounted for the awareness of the distinctive regional singularities, subsequent food writers in the country would continue to cope with the tension between the Spanish peripheral and centralist foodscapes.

The influential cooking book &quot;1080 recetas de cocina&quot; by Simone Ortega (first published in 1972) became a hit in Spain, remaining as of 2019 the third best-selling book ever in the history of the country after &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and the Bible. This was not a book exclusively of Spanish traditional recipes, but also included French recipes, bringing an exotic penchant to Spanish homes.

Televised cooking shows started in the country in 1984 with &quot;Con las manos en la masa&quot;.

== Meal routines ==
A continental-style breakfast (&quot;desayuno&quot;) may be taken just after waking up, or before entering the workplace. Common products taken during breakfast include coffee, milk, chocolate drink, biscuits (most notably Marie biscuits), &quot;magdalenas&quot;, toast (featuring ingredients such as oil, tomato and butter), and churros.

Due to the large time span between breakfast and lunch, it is not uncommon to halt the working schedule to take a mid-morning snack.

Lunch (&quot;el almuerzo&quot; or &quot;la comida&quot;, literally meaning &quot;the meal&quot;), the large midday meal in Spain, contains several courses, especially in restaurants. In some regions of Spain, the word &quot;almuerzo&quot; refers to the mid-morning snack, instead of lunch. Lunch usually starts around 2:00–2:30 p.m. and finishes around 3:00–3:30 p.m., and is usually followed by &quot;sobremesa&quot;, which refers to the table talk that Spanish people undertake. Menus are organized according to these courses and include five or six choices in each course. At home, Spanish meals contain one or two courses and a dessert. The content of this meal is usually a soup dish, salad, a meat or a fish dish, and a dessert such as fruit, yoghurt or something sweet. &quot;Tapas&quot; may also be typically served before or during lunch.

According to a 2017 report, the Spanish government has taken steps to shorten the traditional long lunch break in an effort to end the workday earlier. Most businesses shut down for two or three hours for lunch, then resume the working day until dinner time in the evening.

&quot;La cena&quot;, meaning both dinner or supper, is taken between 8:30 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. It typically consists of one course and dessert. Due to the large time span between lunch and dinner, an afternoon snack, &quot;la merienda&quot;, equivalent to afternoon tea, may take place at about 6:00 p.m. At &quot;merienda&quot;, people typically drink coffee, eat something sweet, or eat a sandwich or a piece of fruit.

Some country-wide staple dishes common throughout Spain include &quot;croquetas&quot; (croquettes), &quot;paella&quot; (a rice dish from the Valencian community), &quot;ensaladilla rusa&quot; (Olivier salad), &quot;gazpacho&quot; (a vegetable cold soup), and &quot;tortilla de patatas&quot; (Spanish omelette). There is a disagreement in Spanish society when it comes to preferring onion as an ingredient in the Spanish omelette, often accompanied by highly opinionated views on either side.

&quot;Tapas&quot; (appetizers), taken before lunch or dinner, or during them, are common. It is also common for &quot;tapas&quot; to be provided as a complimentary appetizer in bars and cafes when ordering a drink. Aside from some of the aforementioned specialties, other signature &quot;tapas&quot; include: &quot;mejillones en escabeche&quot; (marinated mussels), &quot;gildas&quot;, &quot;albóndigas&quot; (meatballs), &quot;callos&quot;, &quot;torreznos,&quot; or &quot;raxo de cerdo&quot;.

== Regional cuisines ==
=== Andalusia ===


Andalusian cuisine is twofold: rural and coastal. Of all the Spanish regions, this region uses the most olive oil in its cuisine. The Andalusian dish that has possibly achieved the most international fame is &quot;gazpacho&quot;, a cold soup made with chopped vegetables, such as tomatoes and green peppers, vinegar, water, salt, olive oil, and bread (crumbs). Other cold soups include &quot;poleá&quot;, &quot;zoque&quot; and &quot;salmorejo&quot;.

Eating olives as a snack is common. Meat dishes include &quot;flamenquín&quot;, &quot;pringá&quot;, oxtail stew, and &quot;menudo gitano&quot; (also called Andalusian tripe). Hot soups include &quot;sopa de gato&quot; (made with bread), &quot;caldillo de perro&quot; (fish soup with orange juice) and &quot;migas canas&quot;. Fish dishes include &quot;pescaíto frito&quot;, &quot;soldaditos de Pavía&quot;, and &quot;parpandúa&quot;.

Cured meats include serrano ham and ibérico ham. Typical drinks in the area include anise, wine (such as Malaga, Jerez, and Pedro Ximénez), and sherry brandy.

=== Aragon ===
Aragonese cuisine has a rural origin. One of its most famous dishes is &quot;asado de ternasco&quot; (roast lamb), in which lamb is cooked with garlic, salt, olive oil, laurel leaves, thyme, and parsley. Pork dishes are also very popular, among them, &#x27;. Popular Aragonese recipes made with bread are &quot;migas de Pastor&quot;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;.

Legumes are very important to Aragonese dishes, but the most popular vegetables are borage and thistle, as well as the famed &#x27;. &#x27; and ham from Huesca are frequently used cured meats. Among the cheeses, &#x27; is notable. Fruit-based cuisine includes &#x27; (English: &#x27;fruits of Aragon&#x27;, candied fruits covered in chocolate) and maraschino cherries. &quot;Melocotón con vino&quot; consists of &quot;&quot;, a regional peach variant, infused in red wine with sugar and cinnamon.

Other sweet Aragonese specialities are &quot;trenza de Almudevar&quot;, &quot;tortas de alma&quot;, &#x27; (a type of nougat), &#x27;, and &quot;Españoletas&quot; (a kind of local cookie).

The prevalence of peaches in Aragonese cuisine extends to drinks. &quot;Sopeta&quot; is a traditional beverage emerging from sliced peach, white wine and sugar. The best-known wines of Aragon are those from Cariñena, Somontano (Huesca), Calatayud, and Campo de Borja.

=== Asturias ===

Asturian cuisine has a long and rich history, deeply rooted in Celtic traditions of Atlantic Europe. One of its most famous dishes is &quot;fabada asturiana&quot;. &quot;Fabada&quot; is the traditional stew of the region, made with white beans, sausages (such as &quot;chorizo&quot; and &#x27;), and pork. A well-known recipe is &quot;fabes con almejas&quot; (beans with clams). Asturian beans (&quot;fabes&quot;) can also be cooked with hare, partridge, prawns, or octopus. Another known recipe is &#x27; (made with white beans, kale, potatoes, and a variety of sausages and bacon) and &quot;&quot;.

Pork-based foods such as &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; (chorizo-stuffed bread rolls) are popular. Common meat dishes include &#x27; (roasted veal), &quot;cachopo&quot; (a crunchy, crumb-coated veal steak stuffed with ham and cheese), and &quot;&quot;. Fish and seafood play an important role in Asturian cuisine. The Cantabrian Sea provides a rich variety of species, including tuna, hake and sardines.

Asturian cheeses are very popular in the rest of Spain. Among them, the most representative is Cabrales cheese, a pungent, blue cheese developed in the regions near the Picos de Europa. Other popular cheese types are &quot;gamonéu&quot; &quot;afuega&#x27;l pitu&quot;, and &quot;. These are usually enjoyed with the local cider, a low-alcohol drink made of Asturian apples with a distinctive sourness.

Asturian cider, &quot;, made of a special type of apple, is traditionally poured &quot;escanciada&quot; from a certain height, usually over the head of the waiter/server. When the cider falls into the glass from above, the drink &quot;breaks&quot;, becoming aerated and bubbly. It is consumed immediately after being served, in consecutive, tiny shots.

Notable desserts are &#x27; (similar to &quot;crêpes&quot;, usually filled with cream or apple jam), rice pudding (white rice cooked with milk, lemon zest and sugar), and &#x27; (puff pastry cakes filled with almond mash and covered with sugar glaze).

=== Balearic Islands ===
Balearic cuisine has purely Mediterranean characteristics due to its location. The islands have been conquered several times throughout their history by the French and the English, which left some culinary influences. Some well-known food items are the &quot;sobrassada&quot;, &#x27;, mahón cheese, &quot;gin de Menorca&quot; (&quot;pelota&quot;), and mayonnaise. Among the dishes are &quot;tumbet&quot;, &#x27;, and roasted suckling pig. Popular desserts include &quot;ensaïmada&quot;, &quot;tambor d&#x27;ametlla&quot;, and &quot;suspiros de Manacor&quot;.

=== Basque Country ===
The cuisine of the Basque Country has a wide and varied range of ingredients and preparations. The dining culture is strong among the inhabitants of this region. Highlights include meat and fish dishes. Among fish, cod (&quot;bacalao&quot;) is produced in various preparations, such as &quot;bacalao al pil pil&quot; and &#x27;. Also popular are anchovies, bream, and bonito. Among the most famous dishes is &#x27; (stuffed king crab). Common meat dishes include beef steaks, pork loin with milk, fig leaf quail, and marinated goose.

&quot;Txakoli&quot; or &quot;chacolí&quot; (a white wine characterised by its high acidity and a lesser-than-average alcohol content) is a staple drink from the Basque Country, produced in Álava, Guipúzcoa and Biscay. Basque cider is popular following the apple harvest and is served in cider houses and bars.

=== Canary Islands ===

The Canary Islands have a unique cuisine due to their geographical location in the Atlantic Ocean. The Canary Islands were part of the trading routes to the Americas, hence creating a melting pot of different culinary traditions. Fish (fresh or salted) and potatoes are among the most common staple foods in the islands. The consumption of cheese, fruits, and pork also characterizes Canarian cuisine. The islands&#x27; close proximity to continental Africa influences the climate and creates a range of warm temperatures that in modern times have fostered the agriculture of tropical and semitropical crops: bananas, yams, mangoes, avocados, and persimmons. These crops are heavily used in Canarian cuisine.

The aboriginal people, Guanches, based their diet on &quot;gofio&quot; (a type of flour made of different toasted grains), shellfish, and goat and pork products. &quot;Gofio&quot; is still consumed in the islands and has become part of the traditional cuisine.

A sauce called &quot;mojo&quot; is very common throughout the islands. It has been adapted and developed in many ways, so that it may complement various main dishes. Fish dishes usually require a &quot;green &quot;mojo&quot;&quot; made from coriander or parsley, while roasted meats require a red variety made from chilli peppers that are commonly known as &quot;mojo picón&quot;.

Some classic dishes in the Canary Islands include &quot;papas arrugadas&quot;, &quot;almogrote&quot;, &quot;frangollo&quot;, rabbit in &quot;salmorejo&quot; sauce, and stewed goat.

Some popular desserts are &quot;truchas&quot; (pastries filled with sweet potato or pumpkin), roasted &quot;gofio&quot; (a &quot;gofio&quot;-based dough with nuts and honey), &quot;príncipe Alberto&quot; (a mousse-like preparation with almonds, coffee, and chocolate), and &quot;quesillo&quot; (a variety of flan made with condensed milk).

Wineries are common in the islands. However, only Malvasia wine from Lanzarote has gained international recognition.

=== Cantabria ===

A popular Cantabrian dish is &quot;cocido montañés&quot; (highlander stew): a rich stew made with beans, cabbage, and pork. Seafood is widely used and bonito is present in the typical &quot;sorropotún&quot; or &quot;&quot; (tuna pot). Recognized quality meats include Tudanca veal and game meat.

Cantabrian pastries include &quot;sobaos&quot; and &quot;quesadas pasiegas&quot;. Dairy products include Cantabrian cream cheese, smoked cheeses, &quot;picón Bejes-Tresviso&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

As for alcohol, &quot;orujo&quot; is the Cantabrian pomace brandy. Cider (&quot;sidra&quot;) and &quot;chacoli&quot; wine are also favorites. Cantabria has two wines labelled &quot;denominación de origen calificada&quot; (&#x27;denomination of qualified origin&#x27;): Costa de Cantabria and Liébana.

=== Castile-La Mancha ===

In Castilla-La Mancha, the culinary habits reflect the origin of foods eaten by shepherds and peasants. Wheat and grains are a dominant product and ingredient—they are used in bread, soups, &quot;gazpacho manchego&quot;, crumbs, and porridge. One of the most abundant ingredients in Manchego cuisine is garlic, leading to dishes such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;ajo puerco&quot;, and garlic marinade.

Some traditional recipes are &quot;gazpacho manchego&quot;, &quot;pisto manchego&quot;, and &#x27;. Also popular in this region is &#x27;, a kind of foie gras. Manchego cheese is also renowned.

Because its lands are dry, and thus unable to sustain large amounts of cattle living on grass, an abundance of small animals, such as rabbit and especially birds (pheasant, quail, partridge, squab), can be found. This has led to game meat being incorporated into traditional dishes, such as &quot;conejo al Ajillo&quot; (rabbit in garlic sauce), &quot;&quot; (marinated partridge) or &quot;huevos de codorniz&quot; (quail eggs).

=== Castile and León ===

In Castile and León, characteristic dishes include &quot;morcilla&quot; (a black pudding made with special spices), &#x27;, &quot;sopa de ajo&quot; (garlic soup), &quot;cochinillo asado&quot; (roast piglet), &quot;lechazo&quot; (roast lamb), and &quot;chuletón de Ávila&quot; (Ávila rib steak). Other foods include &quot;botillo del Bierzo&quot;, &quot;hornazo&quot; from Salamanca, &#x27; (a cured ham from Guijuelo, Salamanca), &#x27;, other sausages, Serrada cheese (made from sheep&#x27;s milk), &#x27;, and Ribera del Duero wines.

Major wines in Castilian–Leonese cuisine include the robust wine of Toro, reds from Ribera del Duero, whites from Rueda, and clarets from Cigales.

=== Catalonia ===

The extensive cuisine of Catalonia has rural origins and features foods from three climates: coastal, mountains, and the interiors. Some famous dishes include &quot;escudella&quot;, &quot;pa amb tomàquet&quot;, bean omelette, &quot;&quot;, &quot;samfaina&quot;, thyme soup, &quot;caragols a la llauna&quot;, and the bomba de Barceloneta. Notable sauces are romesco sauce, aioli, bouillabaisse of Catalan origin, and &quot;picada&quot;.

Cured pork cuisine includes &quot;botifarra&quot; (white and black) and the &quot;fuet&quot; of Vic. Fish dishes include &quot;&quot; (fish stew), cod stew, and &quot;arròs negre&quot;. Among the vegetable dishes, the most famous are &quot;calçots&quot; and &quot;escalivada&quot; (roasted vegetables). Desserts include Catalan cream, &quot;carquinyolis&quot;, &quot;panellets&quot;, &quot;tortell&quot;, and &quot;neules&quot;.

=== Extremadura ===


The cuisine of Extremadura is simple at heart, with dishes based on those prepared by shepherds. It is very similar to the cuisine of Castilla. Extremaduran cuisine is abundant in pork; it is said that the region is one of the best for breeding pigs in Spain thanks to the acorns that grow in their fields. Iberian pig herds raised in the fields of Montánchez are characterized by dark skin and thin legs. This breed of pig is found exclusively in Southwestern Iberia, both in Spain and Portugal. Iberian pork products such as sausages are common and often added to stews (&#x27;), as well as &#x27; (pork liver pâté seasoned with paprika, garlic and other spices).

Other meat dishes include lamb stew or goat stew (&quot;caldereta de cordero&quot; and &quot;caldereta de cabrito&quot;). Additionally, meat dishes can include game meats, such as wild boar, partridge, pheasant, or venison.

Distinctive cheeses from the region include the so-called &quot;quesos de torta&quot; (sheep milk cheeses typically curdled with the infusion of thistle). Both the torta of La Serena and the torta of El Casar enjoy a protected designation of origin. Among the desserts are &quot;leche frita&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;pestiños&quot; (fritters), as well as many sweets that have their origins in convents.

Cod preparations are well-known, and tench is among the most traditional freshwater fish, with fish and vegetable dishes such as &quot;moje de peces&quot; or &quot;escarapuche&quot;.

Soups are often bread-based and are served in both hot and cold forms. Pennyroyal mint is sometimes used to season &quot;gazpachos&quot; or soups such as &quot;sopa de poleo&quot;. Extremaduran &quot;ajoblanco&quot; (&quot;ajoblanco extremeño&quot;) is a cold soup, which is different from Andalusian &quot;ajoblanco&quot; since it contains egg yolk in the emulsion and vegetables but no almonds.

The northeastern &quot;comarca&quot; of La Vera produces &quot;&quot;, a smoked paprika highly valued all over Spain and extensively used in Extremaduran cuisine.

The region is also known for its &quot;vino de pitarra&quot; tradition (homemade wine made in small earthenware vessels).

=== Galicia ===

Galician cuisine is well known throughout Spain because of emigration to other regions. Similar to neighbouring Asturias, Galicia shares some culinary traditions in stews and soups with the Celtic nations of Atlantic Europe. One of the most noted Galician dishes is soup. Also notable in this region is pork with turnip tops, a popular component of the Galician carnival meal &quot;laconadas&quot;. Another recipe is &quot;&quot; (a chestnut broth), which is commonly consumed during winter. Pork products are also popular. Cattle raising is very common in Galicia, consequently red meat is consumed often, typically with potatoes.

The simplicity and authenticity of Galician cooking methods were praised in the early 20th century by the prominent gastronome Manuel Puga e Parga (also known as &quot;Picadillo&quot;), who praised dishes such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;caldeiradas&quot; (fish stew), in opposition to the perceived sophistication of the French cuisine.

Galician seafood dishes are well-known and rich in variety. Among these are &quot;empanadas&quot;, octopus, scallops, crab, and barnacles. In the city of Santiago de Compostela, located along an ancient pilgrim trail from the Pyrenees, it was customary for travelers to eat scallops upon first arriving in the city.

Among the many dairy products is &quot;queso de tetilla&quot;.

The &quot;queimadas&quot; (a folkloric preparation of &quot;orujo&quot;) consists of mixing alcoholic beverages with peels of orange or lemon, sugar or coffee beans, prepared in a nearly ritual ceremony involving the &quot;flambé&quot; of the beverage. Sweets that are famous throughout the Iberian Peninsula are the &quot;tarta de Santiago&quot; and &quot; (crêpes).

=== La Rioja ===
La Rioja is recognized for its use of meats such as pork and cold cuts, which are produced after the traditional slaughter. Lamb is perhaps the second most popular meat product in this region (&quot;). Veal is common in mountainous areas. The most famous dishes are Rioja style potatoes and &quot;fritada&quot;. Another well-known dish is &quot;caparrones&quot; (Rioja stew). Lesser-known dishes are Holy lunch and &quot;ajo huevo&quot; (garlic eggs). &quot;Pimientos asados&quot; (roasted peppers) is a notable vegetable dish.

La Rioja is famously known in Spain for its red wine, so most of these dishes are served with wine. Rioja wine has designated origin status.

=== Madrid ===
Madrid did not gain its own identity in the Court until 1561 when Philip II moved the capital to Madrid. Since then, due to immigration, many of Madrid&#x27;s culinary dishes have been made from modifications to dishes from other Spanish regions. Madrid, due to the influx of visitors from the nineteenth century onwards, was one of the first cities to introduce the concept of the restaurant, hosting some of the earliest examples.

=== Murcia ===

The cuisine of the region of Murcia has two sides with the influence of Manchego cuisine. The region of Murcia is famous for its varied fruit production. Among the most outstanding dishes are: &quot;tortilla murciana&quot;, &quot;zarangollo&quot;, &quot;mojete&quot;, &quot;aubergine a la crème&quot;, and &quot;pipirrana&quot;. A typical sauce of this area is &quot;ajo cabañil&quot;, used to accompany meat dishes.

Regional dishes include &quot;michirones&quot; (beans cooked with bay leaves, hot peppers and garlic), &quot;olla gitana&quot;, &quot;cocido murciano con pelotas&quot;, and &quot;sopa de mondongo&quot;.

Some meat products from Murcia are &quot;morcilla&quot; (black pudding), which is flavored with oregano, and &quot;pastel murciano&quot;, made with ground beef. Among fish and seafood are the golden salt, Mar Menor prawns, and baked octopus. Rice dishes are common and include &quot;caldero&quot;, &quot;arroz empedrado&quot;, &quot;paella Valenciana (rice with rabbit and snails)&quot;, &quot;arroz de escribano&quot;, and &quot;arroz viudo&quot;.

Confectionery products include &quot;exploradores&quot; and &quot;pastel de Cierva&quot;, typical in Murcia gastronomy and found in almost every pastry shop in Murcia. They are both sweet and savoury at the same time. &quot;Paparajotes&quot; is another dessert, made from lemon leaves.

This region also has wine appellations of origin, such as the wines from Jumilla, Bullas and Yecla.

=== Navarra ===
The gastronomy of Navarra has many similarities with Basque cuisine. Some of its flag dishes are &quot;trucha a la navarra&quot; (Navarra-style trout), &quot;ajoarriero&quot;, cordero en chilindrón, and &quot;relleno&quot;. There are also recipes such as Carlists eggs (omelet).

Salted products are common and include &quot;chorizo de Pamplona&quot;, &quot;Bacalao al ajoarriero&quot;, stuffing and sausage. The lamb and beef have, at present, designations of origin.

=== Valencia ===

The cuisine of Valencia has two aspects: rural and coastal. A popular and famous Valencia creation is &quot;paella&quot;, a rice dish cooked in a circular pan and topped with vegetables and meats (originally rabbit and chicken). Dishes such as &quot;arroz con costra&quot;, &quot;arròs negre&quot;, &quot;fideuá&quot;, &quot;arròz al horn (arròs al forn&quot; in the Valencian language&quot;)&quot;, and rice with beans and turnips are also common in the city.

Coastal towns supply the region with fish, leading to popular dishes like &quot;all i pebre&quot; (fish stew), typical of the Albufera.

The desserts in this region include coffee liqueur, chocolate Alicante, &quot;arnadí&quot;, and &quot;horchata&quot;, the last two being of Muslim origin. Notably, during Christmas, nougat is made in Alicante and Jijona. Another well-known dessert is &quot;peladillas&quot; (almonds wrapped in a thick layer of caramel).

<text>Santiago de Compostela, simply Santiago, or Compostela, in the province of A Coruña, is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia, in northwestern Spain. The city has its origin in the shrine of Saint James the Great, now the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, as the destination of the Way of St. James, a leading Catholic pilgrimage route since the 9th century. In 1985, the city&#x27;s Old Town was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Santiago de Compostela has a very mild climate for its latitude with heavy winter rainfall courtesy of its relative proximity to the prevailing winds from Atlantic low-pressure systems.

==Toponym==
According to Richard Fletcher scholars now agree that the origin of the name Compostela comes from the Latin &quot;compositum tella&quot;, meaning a well-ordered burial ground, possibly referring to an ancient burial ground on the site of the Church of Santiago de Compostela that pre-dates the Christian building.

 is the local Galician evolution of Vulgar Latin &quot;Sanctus Iacobus&quot; &quot;Saint James&quot;. According to folk etymology &quot;Compostela&quot; derives from the (&#x27;field of the star&#x27;).

==City==

According to a medieval legend, the remains of the apostle James, son of Zebedee were brought to Galicia for burial, where they were lost. Eight hundred years later the light of a bright star guided a shepherd, Pelagius the Hermit, who was watching his flock at night to the burial site in Santiago de Compostela. This site was originally called Mount and its physical topography leads prevalent seaborne winds to clear the cloud deck immediately overhead. The shepherd quickly reported his discovery to the bishop of Iria, Theodemir. The bishop declared that the remains were those of the apostle James and immediately notified King Alfonso II in Oviedo. To honour St. James, the cathedral was built on the spot where his remains were said to have been found. The legend, which included numerous miraculous events, enabled the Catholic faithful to bolster support for their stronghold in northern Spain during the Christian crusades against the Moors, but also led to the growth and development of the city.

Along the western side of the &quot;Praza do Obradoiro&quot; is the elegant 18th-century Pazo de Raxoi, now the city hall. Across the square is the Pazo de Raxoi (Raxoi&#x27;s Palace), the town hall, and on the right from the cathedral steps is the Hostal dos Reis Católicos, founded in 1492 by the Catholic Monarchs, Isabella of Castille and Ferdinand II of Aragon, as a pilgrims&#x27; hospice (now a Parador). The Obradoiro façade of the cathedral, the best known, is depicted on the Spanish euro coins of 1 cent, 2 cents, and 5 cents (€0.01, €0.02, and €0.05).

Santiago is the site of the University of Santiago de Compostela, established in the early 16th century. The main campus can be seen best from an alcove in the large municipal park in the centre of the city.

Within the old town there are many narrow winding streets full of historic buildings. The new town all around it has less character though some of the older parts of the new town have some big flats in them.

Santiago de Compostela has a substantial nightlife. Both in the new town ( in Galician, in Spanish or ) and the old town (, , trade-branded as &quot;zona monumental&quot;), a mix of middle-aged residents and younger students maintain a lively presence until the early hours of the morning. Radiating from the centre of the city, the historic cathedral is surrounded by paved granite streets, tucked away in the old town, and separated from the newer part of the city by the largest of many parks throughout the city, .

Santiago gives its name to one of the four military orders of Spain: Santiago, Calatrava, Alcántara and Montesa.

One of the most important economic centres in Galicia, Santiago is the seat for organisations like Association for Equal and Fair Trade Pangaea.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification, Santiago de Compostela has a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with mild to warm and somewhat dry summers and mild, wet winters. The prevailing winds from the Atlantic and the surrounding mountains combine to give Santiago some of Spain&#x27;s highest rainfall: about annually. The winters are mild, despite being far inland and at an altitude of frosts are only common in December, January and February, with an average of just 13 days per year. Snow is uncommon, with 2-3 snowy days per year. Temperatures above are very exceptional.

==Administration==
The city is governed by a mayor–council form of government. Following the 2023 Spanish local elections the mayor of Santiago is Goretti Sanmartín, of BNG.

===2015 city council elections results===

==Population==
The population of the city in 2019 was 96,260 inhabitants, while the metropolitan area reaches 178,695.

In 2010 there were 4,111 foreigners living in the city, representing 4.3% of the total population. The main nationalities are Brazilians (11%), Portuguese (8%) and Colombians (7%).

By language, according to 2008 data, 21.17% of the population always speak in Galician, 15% always speak in Spanish, 31% mostly in Galician and the 32.17% mostly in Spanish. According to a Xunta de Galicia 2010 study the 38.5% of the city primary and secondary education students had Galician as their mother tongue.

==History==



The area of Santiago de Compostela was a Roman cemetery by the 4th century and was occupied by the Suebi in the early 5th century, when they settled in Galicia and Portugal during the initial collapse of the Roman Empire. The area was later attributed to the bishopric of Iria Flavia in the 6th century, in the partition usually known as Parochiale Suevorum, ordered by King Theodemar. In 585, the settlement was annexed along with the rest of Suebi Kingdom by Leovigild as the sixth province of the Visigothic Kingdom.

Possibly raided from 711 to 739 by the Arabs, the bishopric of Iria was incorporated into the Kingdom of Asturias . At some point between 818 and 842, during the reign of Alfonso II of Asturias, bishop Theodemar of Iria (d. 847) claimed to have found some remains which were attributed to Saint James the Greater. This discovery was accepted in part because Pope Leo III and Charlemagne—who had died in 814—had acknowledged Asturias as a kingdom and Alfonso II as king, and had also crafted close political and ecclesiastic ties. Around the place of the discovery a new settlement and centre of pilgrimage emerged, which was known to the author Usuard in 865 and which was called &quot;Compostella&quot; by the 10th century.

The devotion to Saint James of Compostela was just one of many arising throughout northern Iberia during the 10th and 11th centuries, as rulers encouraged their own region-specific devotions, such as Saint Eulalia in Oviedo and Saint Aemilian in Castile. After the centre of Asturian political power moved from Oviedo to León in 910, Compostela became more politically relevant, and several kings of Galicia and of León were acclaimed by the Galician noblemen and crowned and anointed by the local bishop at the cathedral, among them Ordoño IV in 958, Bermudo II in 982, and Alfonso VII in 1111, by which time Compostela had become capital of the Kingdom of Galicia. Later, 12th-century kings were also sepulchered in the cathedral, namely Fernando II and Alfonso IX, last of the Kings of León and Galicia before both kingdoms were united with the Kingdom of Castile.

During this same 10th century and in the first years of the 11th century Viking raiders tried to assault the town—Galicia is known in the Nordic sagas as &quot;Jackobsland&quot; or &quot;Gallizaland&quot;—and bishop Sisenand II, who was killed in battle against them in 968, ordered the construction of a walled fortress to protect the sacred place. In 997 Compostela was assaulted and partially destroyed by Ibn Abi Aamir (known as al-Mansur), Andalusian leader accompanied in his raid by Christian lords, who all received a share of the booty. However, the Andalusian commander showed no interest in the alleged relics of St James. In response to these challenges bishop Cresconio, in the mid-11th century, fortified the entire town, building walls and defensive towers.

According to some authors, by the middle years of the 11th century the site had already become a pan-European &quot;place of peregrination&quot;, while others maintain that the devotion to Saint James was before 11-12th centuries an essentially Galician affair, supported by Asturian and Leonese kings to win over faltering Galician loyalties. Santiago would become in the course of the following century a main Catholic shrine second only to Rome and Jerusalem. In the 12th century, under the impulse of bishop Diego Gelmírez, Compostela became an archbishopric, attracting a large and multinational population. Under the rule of this prelate, the townspeople rebelled, headed by the local council, beginning a secular tradition of confrontation by the people of the city—who fought for self-government—against the local bishop, the secular and jurisdictional lord of the city and of its fief, the semi-independent (&quot;land of Saint James&quot;). The culminating moment in this confrontation was reached in the 14th century, when the new prelate, the Frenchman Bérenger de Landore, treacherously executed the counselors of the city in his castle of &quot;A Rocha Forte&quot; (&quot;the strong rock, castle&quot;), after inviting them for talks.

Santiago de Compostela was captured and sacked by the French during the Napoleonic Wars; as a result, the remains attributed to the apostle were lost for near a century, hidden inside a cist in the crypts of the cathedral of the city.

The excavations conducted in the cathedral during the 19th and 20th centuries uncovered a Roman &quot;cella memoriae&quot; or martyrium, around which grew a small cemetery in Roman and Suevi times which was later abandoned. This &quot;martyrium&quot;, which proves the existence of an old Christian holy place, has been sometimes attributed to Priscillian, although without further proof.

==Economy==
Santiago&#x27;s economy, although still heavily dependent on public administration (i.e. being the headquarters of the autonomous government of Galicia), cultural tourism, industry, and higher education through its university, is becoming increasingly diversified. New industries such as timber transformation (FINSA), the automotive industry (UROVESA), and telecommunications and electronics (Blusens and Televés) have been established. Banco Gallego, a banking institution owned by Novacaixagalicia, has its headquarters in downtown &quot;rúa do Hórreo&quot;.

Tourism is very important thanks to the Way of St. James, particularly in Holy Compostelan Years (when the Feast of Saint James falls on a Sunday). Following the Xunta&#x27;s considerable investment and hugely successful advertising campaign for the Holy Year of 1993, the number of pilgrims completing the route has been steadily rising. More than 272,000 pilgrims made the trip during the course of the Holy Year of 2010. Following 2010, the next Holy Year will not be for another 11 years when St James feast day again falls on a Sunday. Outside of Holy Years, the city still receives a remarkable number of pilgrims. In 2013, 215,880 people completed the pilgrimage. In 2014, there were 237,983 persons. In 2015, there were 262,513 persons and in 2016, there were 277,854 persons.

Editorial Compostela owns daily newspaper &quot;El Correo Gallego&quot;, a local TV, and a radio station. Galician-language online news portal &quot;Galicia Hoxe&quot; is also based in the city. Televisión de Galicia, the public broadcaster corporation of Galicia, has its headquarters in Santiago.

==Way of St. James==

During medieval times, the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage emerged as one of the most significant Christian journeys in Europe, attracting thousands of pilgrims seeking spiritual redemption and fulfillment. Believed to be the final resting place of Saint James the Apostle, the pilgrimage route traversed many countries and scenic locations. The pilgrimage not only fostered spiritual growth but also facilitated cultural exchange, as towns along the route thrived with the influx of visitors, leading to the construction of churches, and further development of the towns. This sacred journey symbolized a profound devotion to faith, enduring trials, and the hope of divine grace. A symbol of the Pilgrimage is the scallop shell, as seen in a sculpture, depicted below, in Santo Domingo de Silos, in which Jesus is shown as a pilgrim with a satchel that is embroidered with the scallop shell. The Scallop shell comes from a legend about St. James’s arrival: he frightened a horse, scaring it into the sea, and the horse reemerged with the shell covering itself.

Santiago de Compostela’s pilgrimage, known as the Camino de Santiago, is one of the world&#x27;s most significant and historical Christian pilgrimages. This sacred journey leads to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in the Galicia region of northwest Spain, where the remains of Saint James the Apostle are believed to be buried. The pilgrimage dates back to the Middle Ages and continues to draw thousands of pilgrims annually from all corners of the globe. Participants embark on various routes, the most popular being the Camino Francés, traversing hundreds of kilometers on foot, by bicycle, or even on horseback. The journey is not just a physical challenge but also a profound spiritual and introspective experience, offering a sense of community, personal reflection, and fulfillment. Along the way, pilgrims pass through diverse landscapes and historic towns and encounter symbols of faith and support. 

The legend that St. James found his way to the Iberian Peninsula and had preached there is one of a number of early traditions concerning the missionary activities and final resting places of the apostles of Jesus. Although the 1884 Bull of Pope Leo XIII &quot;Omnipotens Deus&quot; accepted the authenticity of the relics at Compostela, the Vatican remains uncommitted as to whether the relics are those of Saint James the Greater, while continuing to promote the more general benefits of pilgrimage to the site. Pope Benedict XVI undertook a ceremonial pilgrimage to the site on his visit to Spain in 2010.

===Establishment of the shrine===
The 1,000-year-old pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James in the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral is known in English as the Way of St. James and in Spanish as the . Over 200,000 pilgrims travel to the city each year from points all over Europe and other parts of the world. The pilgrimage has been the subject of many books, television programmes, and films, notably Brian Sewell&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Pilgrim&quot; produced for the British television channel Channel 5 and the Martin Sheen/Emilio Estevez collaboration &quot;The Way&quot;.
===Legends===
According to a tradition that can be traced back at least to the 12th century, when it was recorded in the &quot;Codex Calixtinus&quot;, Saint James decided to return to the Holy Land after preaching in Galicia. There he was beheaded, but his disciples got his body to Jaffa, where they found a marvelous stone ship which miraculously conducted them and the apostle&#x27;s body to Iria Flavia, back in Galicia. There, the disciples asked the local pagan queen &quot;Loba&quot; (&#x27;She-wolf&#x27;) for permission to bury the body; she, annoyed, decided to deceive them, sending them to pick a pair of oxen she allegedly had by the &quot;Pico Sacro&quot;, a local sacred mountain where a dragon dwelt, hoping that the dragon would kill the Christians, but as soon as the beast attacked the disciples, at the sight of the cross, the dragon exploded. Then the disciples marched to collect the oxen, which were actually wild bulls which the queen used to punish her enemies; but again, at the sight of the Christian&#x27;s cross, the bulls calmed down, and after being subjected to a yoke they carried the apostle&#x27;s body to the place where now Compostela is. The legend was again referred with minor changes by the Czech traveller Jaroslav Lev of Rožmitál, in the 15th century.

The relics were said to have been later rediscovered in the 9th century by a hermit named Pelagius, who after observing strange lights in a local forest went for help after the local bishop, Theodemar of Iria, in the west of Galicia. The legend affirms that Theodemar was then guided to the spot by a star, drawing upon a familiar myth-element, hence &quot;Compostela&quot; was given an etymology as a corruption of Campus Stellae, &quot;Field of Stars.&quot;

In the 15th century, the red banner which guided the Galician armies to battle, was still preserved in the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, in the centre Saint James riding a white horse and wearing a white cloak, sword in hand: The legend of the miraculous armed intervention of Saint James, disguised as a white knight to help the Christians when battling the Muslims, was a recurrent myth during the High Middle Ages.

===Pre-Christian legends===
As the lowest-lying land on that stretch of coast, the city&#x27;s site took on added significance. Legends supposed of Celtic origin made it the place where the souls of the dead gathered to follow the sun across the sea. Those unworthy of going to the Land of the Dead haunted Galicia as the &quot;Santa Compaña&quot; or &quot;Estadea&quot;.

===In popular culture===

Santiago de Compostela is featured prominently in the 1988 historical fiction novel &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Rifles&quot;, by Bernard Cornwell, which takes place during the French Invasion of Galicia, January 1809, during the Napoleonic Wars.

The music video for &quot;Una Cerveza&quot;, by Ráfaga, is set in the historic part of Santiago de Compostela.

A pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela provides the narrative framework of the Luis Buñuel film La Voie lactée (The Milky Way).

A mystic pilgrimage was portrayed in the autobiography and romance The Pilgrimage (&quot;O Diário de um Mago&quot;) of Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho, published in 1987.

<doc id="27672" wikidata="Q192520" url="?curid=27672" title="Sailing">
<text>Sailing employs the wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft on the surface of the &quot;water&quot; (sailing ship, sailboat, raft, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on &quot;ice&quot; (iceboat) or on &quot;land&quot; (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often part of a larger plan of navigation.

From prehistory until the second half of the 19th century, sailing craft were the primary means of maritime trade and transportation; exploration across the seas and oceans was reliant on sail for anything other than the shortest distances. Naval power in this period used sail to varying degrees depending on the current technology, culminating in the gun-armed sailing warships of the Age of Sail. Sail was slowly replaced by steam as the method of propulsion for ships over the latter part of the 19th century – seeing a gradual improvement in the technology of steam through a number of developmental steps. Steam allowed scheduled services that ran at higher average speeds than sailing vessels. Large improvements in fuel economy allowed steam to progressively outcompete sail in, ultimately, all commercial situations, giving ship-owning investors a better return on capital.

In the 21st century, most sailing represents a form of recreation or sport. Recreational sailing or yachting can be divided into racing and cruising. Cruising can include extended offshore and ocean-crossing trips, coastal sailing within sight of land, and daysailing.

Sailing relies on the physics of sails as they derive power from the wind, generating both lift and drag. On a given course, the sails are set to an angle that optimizes the development of wind power, as determined by the apparent wind, which is the wind as sensed from a moving vessel. The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder of a sailing craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels of a land sailing craft which are steering the course. This combination of forces means that it is possible to sail an upwind course as well as downwind. The course with respect to the true wind direction (as would be indicated by a stationary flag) is called a point of sail. Conventional sailing craft cannot derive wind power on a course with a point of sail that is too close into the wind.

==History==
Throughout history, sailing was a key form of propulsion that allowed for greater mobility than travel over land. This greater mobility increased capacity for exploration, trade, transport, warfare, and fishing, especially when compared to overland options.

Until the significant improvements in land transportation that occurred during the 19th century, if water transport was an option, it was faster, cheaper and safer than making the same journey by land. This applied equally to sea crossings, coastal voyages and use of rivers and lakes. Examples of the consequences of this include the large grain trade in the Mediterranean during the classical period. Cities such as Rome were totally reliant on the delivery by sailing ships of the large amounts of grain needed. It has been estimated that it cost less for a sailing ship of the Roman Empire to carry grain the length of the Mediterranean than to move the same amount 15 miles by road. Rome consumed about 150,000 tons of Egyptian grain each year over the first three centuries AD.

A similar but more recent trade, in coal, was from the mines situated close to the River Tyne to London – which was already being carried out in the 14th century and grew as the city increased in size. In 1795, 4,395 cargoes of coal were delivered to London. This would have needed a fleet of about 500 sailing colliers (making 8 or 9 trips a year). This quantity had doubled by 1839. (The first steam-powered collier was not launched until 1852 and sailing colliers continued working into the 20th century.) 

=== Exploration and research ===

The earliest image suggesting the use of sail on a boat may be on a piece of pottery from Mesopotamia, dated to the 6th millennium BCE. The image is thought to show a bipod mast mounted on the hull of a reed boat – no sail is depicted. The earliest representation of a sail, from Egypt, is dated to circa 3100 BCE. The Nile is considered a suitable place for early use of sail for propulsion. This is because the river&#x27;s current flows from south to north, whilst the prevailing wind direction is north to south. Therefore, a boat of that time could use the current to go north – an unobstructed trip of 750 miles – and sail to make the return trip. Evidence of early sailors has also been found in other locations, such as Kuwait, Turkey, Syria, Minoa, Bahrain, and India, among others.

Austronesian peoples used sails from some time before 2000 BCE. Their expansion from what is now Southern China and Taiwan started in 3000 BCE. Their technology came to include outriggers, catamarans, and crab claw sails, which enabled the Austronesian Expansion at around 3000 to 1500 BCE into the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, and thence to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. Since there is no commonality between the boat technology of China and the Austronesians, these distinctive characteristics must have been developed at or some time after the beginning of the expansion. They traveled vast distances of open ocean in outrigger canoes using navigation methods such as stick charts. The windward sailing capability of Austronesian boats allowed a strategy of sailing to windward on a voyage of exploration, with a return downwind either to report a discovery or if no land was found. This was well suited to the prevailing winds as Pacific islands were steadily colonized.

By the time of the Age of Discovery—starting in the 15th century—square-rigged, multi-masted vessels were the norm and were guided by navigation techniques that included the magnetic compass and making sightings of the sun and stars that allowed transoceanic voyages.

During the Age of Discovery, sailing ships figured in European voyages around Africa to China and Japan; and across the Atlantic Ocean to North and South America. Later, sailing ships ventured into the Arctic to explore northern sea routes and assess natural resources. In the 18th and 19th centuries sailing vessels made Hydrographic surveys to develop charts for navigation and, at times, carried scientists aboard as with the voyages of James Cook and the Second voyage of HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; with naturalist Charles Darwin.

=== Commerce ===
In the early 1800s, fast blockade-running schooners and brigantines—Baltimore Clippers—evolved into three-masted, typically ship-rigged sailing vessels with fine lines that enhanced speed, but lessened capacity for high-value cargo, like tea from China. Masts were as high as and were able to achieve speeds of , allowing for passages of up to per 24 hours. Clippers yielded to bulkier, slower vessels, which became economically competitive in the mid 19th century. Sail plans with just fore-and-aft sails (schooners), or a mixture of the two (brigantines, barques and barquentines) emerged. Coastal top-sail schooners with a crew as small as two managing the sail handling became an efficient way to carry bulk cargo, since only the fore-sails required tending while tacking and steam-driven machinery was often available for raising the sails and the anchor.

Iron-hulled sailing ships represented the final evolution of sailing ships at the end of the Age of Sail. They were built to carry bulk cargo for long distances in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were the largest of merchant sailing ships, with three to five masts and square sails, as well as other sail plans. They carried bulk cargoes between continents. Iron-hulled sailing ships were mainly built from the 1870s to 1900, when steamships began to outpace them economically because of their ability to keep a schedule regardless of the wind. Steel hulls also replaced iron hulls at around the same time. Even into the twentieth century, sailing ships could hold their own on transoceanic voyages such as Australia to Europe, since they did not require bunkerage for coal nor fresh water for steam, and they were faster than the early steamers, which usually could barely make . Ultimately, the steamships&#x27; independence from the wind and their ability to take shorter routes, passing through the Suez and Panama Canals, made sailing ships uneconomical.

=== Naval power ===

Until the general adoption of carvel-built ships that relied on an internal skeleton structure to bear the weight of the ship and for gun ports to be cut in the side, sailing ships were just vehicles for delivering fighters to the enemy for engagement. Early Phoenician, Greek, Roman galleys would ram each other, then pour onto the decks of the opposing force and continue the fight by hand, meaning that these galleys required speed and maneuverability. This need for speed translated into longer ships with multiple rows of oars along the sides, known as biremes and triremes. Typically, the sailing ships during this time period were the merchant ships.

By 1500, Gun ports allowed sailing vessels to sail alongside an enemy vessel and fire a broadside of multiple cannon. This development allowed for naval fleets to array themselves into a line of battle, whereby, warships would maintain their place in the line to engage the enemy in a parallel or perpendicular line.

== Modern applications ==

While the use of sailing vessels for commerce or naval power has been supplanted with engine-driven vessels, there continue to be commercial operations that take passengers on sailing cruises. Modern navies also employ sailing vessels to train cadets in seamanship. Recreation or sport accounts for the bulk of sailing in modern boats.

=== Recreation ===
Recreational sailing can be divided into two categories, day-sailing, where one gets off the boat for the night, and cruising, where one stays aboard.

Day-sailing primarily affords experiencing the pleasure of sailing a boat. No destination is required. It is an opportunity to share the experience with others. A variety of boats with no overnight accommodations, ranging in size from to over , may be regarded as day sailors.

Cruising on a sailing yacht may be either near-shore or passage-making out of sight of land and entails the use of sailboats that support sustained overnight use. Coastal cruising grounds include areas of the Mediterranean and Black Seas, Northern Europe, Western Europe and islands of the North Atlantic, West Africa and the islands of the South Atlantic, the Caribbean, and regions of North and Central America. Passage-making under sail occurs on routes through oceans all over the world. Circular routes exist between the Americas and Europe, and between South Africa and South America. There are many routes from the Americas, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia to island destinations in the South Pacific. Some cruisers circumnavigate the globe.

=== Sport ===

Sailing as a sport is organized on a hierarchical basis, starting at the yacht club level and reaching up into national and international federations; it may entail racing yachts, sailing dinghies, or other small, open sailing craft, including iceboats and land yachts. Sailboat racing is governed by World Sailing with most racing formats using the Racing Rules of Sailing. It entails a variety of different disciplines, including:
*Oceanic racing, held over long distances and in open water, often last multiple days and include world circumnavigation, such as the Vendée Globe and The Ocean Race.
*Fleet racing, featuring multiple boats in a regatta that comprises multiple races or heats.
*Match racing comprises two boats competing against each other, as is done with the America&#x27;s Cup, vying to cross a finish line, first.
*Team racing between two teams of three boats each in a format analogous to match racing.
*Speed sailing to set new records for different categories of craft with oversight by the World Sailing Speed Record Council.
*Sail boarding has a variety of disciplines particular to that sport.
==Navigation==
===Point of sail===

A sailing craft&#x27;s ability to derive power from the wind depends on the point of sail it is on—the direction of travel under sail in relation to the true wind direction over the surface. The principal points of sail roughly correspond to 45° segments of a circle, starting with 0° directly into the wind. For many sailing craft, the arc spanning 45° on either side of the wind is a &quot;no-go&quot; zone, where a sail is unable to mobilize power from the wind. Sailing on a course as close to the wind as possible—approximately 45°—is termed &quot;close-hauled&quot;. At 90° off the wind, a craft is on a &quot;beam reach&quot;. At 135° off the wind, a craft is on a &quot;broad reach&quot;. At 180° off the wind (sailing in the same direction as the wind), a craft is &quot;running downwind&quot;.

In points of sail that range from close-hauled to a broad reach, sails act substantially like a wing, with lift predominantly propelling the craft. In points of sail from a broad reach to down wind, sails act substantially like a parachute, with drag predominantly propelling the craft. For craft with little forward resistance, such as ice boats and land yachts, this transition occurs further off the wind than for sailboats and sailing ships.

Wind direction for points of sail always refers to the &quot;true wind&quot;—the wind felt by a stationary observer. The &quot;apparent wind&quot;—the wind felt by an observer on a moving sailing craft—determines the motive power for sailing craft.

====Effect on apparent wind====

True wind velocity (VT) combines with the sailing craft&#x27;s velocity (VB) to give the &quot;apparent wind velocity&quot; (VA), the air velocity experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. Apparent wind velocity provides the motive power for the sails on any given point of sail. It varies from being the true wind velocity of a stopped craft in irons in the no-go zone, to being faster than the true wind speed as the sailing craft&#x27;s velocity adds to the true windspeed on a reach. It diminishes towards zero for a craft sailing dead downwind.

The speed of sailboats through the water is limited by the resistance that results from hull drag in the water. Ice boats typically have the least resistance to forward motion of any sailing craft. Consequently, a sailboat experiences a wider range of apparent wind angles than does an ice boat, whose speed is typically great enough to have the apparent wind coming from a few degrees to one side of its course, necessitating sailing with the sail sheeted in for most points of sail. On conventional sailboats, the sails are set to create lift for those points of sail where it&#x27;s possible to align the leading edge of the sail with the apparent wind.

For a sailboat, point of sail affects lateral force significantly. The higher the boat points to the wind under sail, the stronger the lateral force, which requires resistance from a keel or other underwater foils, including daggerboard, centerboard, skeg and rudder. Lateral force also induces heeling in a sailboat, which requires resistance by weight of ballast from the crew or the boat itself and by the shape of the boat, especially with a catamaran. As the boat points off the wind, lateral force and the forces required to resist it become less important.
On ice boats, lateral forces are countered by the lateral resistance of the blades on ice and their distance apart, which generally prevents heeling.

===Course under sail===
Wind and currents are important factors to plan on for both offshore and inshore sailing. Predicting the availability, strength and direction of the wind is key to using its power along the desired course. Ocean currents, tides and river currents may deflect a sailing vessel from its desired course.

If the desired course is within the no-go zone, then the sailing craft must follow a zig-zag route into the wind to reach its waypoint or destination. Downwind, certain high-performance sailing craft can reach the destination more quickly by following a zig-zag route on a series of broad reaches.

Negotiating obstructions or a channel may also require a change of direction with respect to the wind, necessitating changing of tack with the wind on the opposite side of the craft, from before.

Changing tack is called &quot;tacking&quot; when the wind crosses over the bow of the craft as it turns and &quot;jibing&quot; (or &quot;gybing&quot;) if the wind passes over the stern.

====Upwind====
A sailing craft can sail on a course anywhere outside of its no-go zone. If the next waypoint or destination is within the arc defined by the no-go zone from the craft&#x27;s current position, then it must perform a series of tacking maneuvers to get there on a zigzag route, called &quot;beating to windward&quot;. The progress along that route is called the &quot;course made good&quot;; the speed between the starting and ending points of the route is called the &quot;speed made good&quot; and is calculated by the distance between the two points, divided by the travel time. The limiting line to the waypoint that allows the sailing vessel to leave it to leeward is called the &quot;layline&quot;. Whereas some Bermuda-rigged sailing yachts can sail as close as 30° to the wind, most 20th-Century square riggers are limited to 60° off the wind. Fore-and-aft rigs are designed to operate with the wind on either side, whereas square rigs and kites are designed to have the wind come from one side of the sail only.

Because the lateral wind forces are highest when sailing close-hauled, the resisting water forces around the vessel&#x27;s keel, centerboard, rudder and other foils must also be highest in order to limit sideways motion or leeway. Ice boats and land yachts minimize lateral motion with resistance from their blades or wheels.

=====Changing tack by tacking=====
&quot;Tacking&quot; or &quot;coming about&quot; is a maneuver by which a sailing craft turns its bow into and through the wind (referred to as &quot;the eye of the wind&quot;) so that the apparent wind changes from one side to the other, allowing progress on the opposite tack. The type of sailing rig dictates the procedures and constraints on achieving a tacking maneuver. Fore-and-aft rigs allow their sails to hang limp as they tack; square rigs must present the full frontal area of the sail to the wind, when changing from side to side; and windsurfers have flexibly pivoting and fully rotating masts that get flipped from side to side.
====Downwind====

A sailing craft can travel directly downwind only at a speed that is less than the wind speed. However, some sailing craft such as iceboats, sand yachts, and some high-performance sailboats can achieve a higher downwind velocity made good by traveling on a series of broad reaches, punctuated by jibes in between. It was explored by sailing vessels starting in 1975 and now extends to high-performance skiffs, catamarans and foiling sailboats.

Navigating a channel or a downwind course among obstructions may necessitate changes in direction that require a change of tack, accomplished with a jibe.

=====Changing tack by jibing=====

&quot;Jibing&quot; or &quot;gybing&quot; is a sailing maneuver by which a sailing craft turns its stern past the eye of the wind so that the apparent wind changes from one side to the other, allowing progress on the opposite tack. This maneuver can be done on smaller boats by pulling the tiller towards yourself (the opposite side of the sail). As with tacking, the type of sailing rig dictates the procedures and constraints for jibing. Fore-and-aft sails with booms, gaffs or sprits are unstable when the free end points into the eye of the wind and must be controlled to avoid a violent change to the other side; square rigs as they present the full area of the sail to the wind from the rear experience little change of operation from one tack to the other; and windsurfers again have flexibly pivoting and fully rotating masts that get flipped from side to side.

=== Wind and currents ===

Winds and oceanic currents are both the result of the sun powering their respective fluid media. Wind powers the sailing craft and the ocean bears the craft on its course, as currents may alter the course of a sailing vessel on the ocean or a river.
*&quot;Wind&quot; – On a global scale, vessels making long voyages must take atmospheric circulation into account, which causes zones of westerlies, easterlies, trade winds and high-pressure zones with light winds, sometimes called horse latitudes, in between. Sailors predict wind direction and strength with knowledge of high- and low-pressure areas, and the weather fronts that accompany them. Along coastal areas, sailors contend with diurnal changes in wind direction—flowing off the shore at night and onto the shore during the day. Local temporary wind shifts are called &quot;lifts&quot;, when they improve the sailing craft&#x27;s ability travel along its &quot;rhumb line&quot; in the direction of the next waypoint. Unfavorable wind shifts are called &quot;headers&quot;.
*&quot;Currents&quot; – On a global scale, vessels making long voyages must take major ocean current circulation into account. Major oceanic currents, like the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean and the Kuroshio Current in the Pacific Ocean require planning for the effect that they will have on a transiting vessel&#x27;s track. Likewise, tides affect a vessel&#x27;s track, especially in areas with large tidal ranges, like the Bay of Fundy or along Southeast Alaska, or where the tide flows through straits, like Deception Pass in Puget Sound. Mariners use tide and current tables to inform their navigation. Before the advent of motors, it was advantageous for sailing vessels to enter or leave port or to pass through a strait with the tide.

==Trimming==

Trimming refers to adjusting the lines that control sails, including the sheets that control angle of the sails with respect to the wind, the halyards that raise and tighten the sail, and to adjusting the hull&#x27;s resistance to heeling, yawing or progress through the water.

=== Sails ===

In their most developed version, square sails are controlled by two each of: sheets, braces, clewlines, and reef tackles, plus four buntlines, each of which may be controlled by a crew member as the sail is adjusted. Towards the end of the Age of Sail, steam-powered machinery reduced the number of crew required to trim sail.

Adjustment of the angle of a fore-and-aft sail with respect to the apparent wind is controlled with a line, called a &quot;sheet&quot;. On points of sail between close-hauled and a broad reach, the goal is typically to create flow along the sail to maximize power through lift. Streamers placed on the surface of the sail, called tell-tales, indicate whether that flow is smooth or turbulent. Smooth flow on both sides indicates proper trim. A jib and mainsail are typically configured to be adjusted to create a smooth laminar flow, leading from one to the other in what is called the &quot;slot effect&quot;.

On downwind points of sail, power is achieved primarily with the wind pushing on the sail, as indicated by drooping tell-tales. Spinnakers are light-weight, large-area, highly curved sails that are adapted to sailing off the wind.

In addition to using the sheets to adjust the angle with respect to the apparent wind, other lines control the shape of the sail, notably the outhaul, halyard, boom vang and backstay. These control the curvature that is appropriate to the windspeed, the higher the wind, the flatter the sail. When the wind strength is greater than these adjustments can accommodate to prevent overpowering the sailing craft, then reducing sail area through reefing, substituting a smaller sail or by other means.

====Reducing sail====
Reducing sail on square-rigged ships could be accomplished by exposing less of each sail, by tying it off higher up with reefing points. Additionally, as winds get stronger, sails can be furled or removed from the spars, entirely until the vessel is surviving hurricane-force winds under &quot;bare poles&quot;.

On fore-and-aft rigged vessels, reducing sail may furling the jib and by reefing or partially lowering the mainsail, that is reducing the area of a sail without actually changing it for a smaller sail. This results both in a reduced sail area but also in a lower centre of effort from the sails, reducing the heeling moment and keeping the boat more upright.

There are three common methods of reefing the mainsail:
*Slab reefing, which involves lowering the sail by about one-quarter to one-third of its full length and tightening the lower part of the sail using an outhaul or a pre-loaded reef line through a cringle at the new clew, and hook through a cringle at the new tack.
*In-boom roller-reefing, with a horizontal foil inside the boom. This method allows for standard- or full-length horizontal battens.
*In-mast (or on-mast) roller-reefing. This method rolls the sail up around a vertical foil either inside a slot in the mast, or affixed to the outside of the mast. It requires a mainsail with either no battens, or newly developed vertical battens.

===Hull===
Hull trim has three aspects, each tied to an axis of rotation, they are controlling:

* Heeling (rotation about the longitudinal axis or leaning to either port or starboard)
* Helm force (rotation about the vertical axis)
* Hull drag (rotation about the horizontal axis amidships)

Each is a reaction to forces on sails and is achieved either by weight distribution or by management of the center of force of the underwater foils (keel, daggerboard, etc.), compared with the center of force on the sails.

==== Heeling ====

A sailing vessel heels when the boat leans over to the side in reaction to wind forces on the sails. 

A sailing vessel&#x27;s form stability (derived from the shape of the hull and the position of the center of gravity) is the starting point for resisting heeling. Catamarans and iceboats have a wide stance that makes them resistant to heeling. Additional measures for trimming a sailing craft to control heeling include:

* Ballast in the keel, which counteracts heeling as the boat rolls.
* Shifting of weight, which might be crew on a trapeze or moveable ballast across the boat.
* Reducing sail
* Adjusting the depth of underwater foils to control their lateral resistance force and center of resistance

==== Helm force ====
The alignment of center of force of the sails with center of resistance of the hull and its appendices controls whether the craft will track straight with little steering input, or whether correction needs to be made to hold it away from turning into the wind (a weather helm) or turning away from the wind (a lee helm). A center of force behind the center of resistance causes a weather helm. The center of force ahead of the center of resistance causes a lee helm. When the two are closely aligned, the helm is neutral and requires little input to maintain course.

==== Hull drag ====
Fore-and-aft weight distribution changes the cross-section of a vessel in the water. Small sailing craft are sensitive to crew placement. They are usually designed to have the crew stationed midships to minimize hull drag in the water.

==Other aspects of seamanship==
Seamanship encompasses all aspects of taking a sailing vessel in and out of port, navigating it to its destination, and securing it at anchor or alongside a dock. Important aspects of seamanship include employing a common language aboard a sailing craft and the management of lines that control the sails and rigging.

=== Nautical terms ===

Nautical terms for elements of a vessel: starboard (right-hand side), port or larboard (left-hand side), forward or fore (frontward), aft or abaft (rearward), bow (forward part of the hull), stern (aft part of the hull), beam (the widest part). Spars, supporting sails, include masts, booms, yards, gaffs and poles. Moveable lines that control sails or other equipment are known collectively as a vessel&#x27;s running rigging. Lines that raise sails are called &quot;halyards&quot; while those that strike them are called &quot;downhauls&quot;. Lines that adjust (trim) the sails are called &quot;sheets&quot;. These are often referred to using the name of the sail they control (such as &quot;main sheet&quot; or &quot;jib sheet&quot;). &quot;Guys&quot; are used to control the ends of other spars such as spinnaker poles. Lines used to tie a boat up when alongside are called &quot;docklines&quot;, &quot;docking cables&quot; or &quot;mooring warps&quot;. A &quot;rode&quot; is what attaches an anchored boat to its anchor. Other than starboard and port, the sides of the boat are defined by their relationship to the wind. The terms to describe the two sides are Windward and leeward. The windward side of the boat is the side that is upwind while the leeward side is the side that is downwind. 

=== Management of lines ===
The following knots are commonly used to handle ropes and lines on sailing craft:
* Bowline – forms a loop at the end of a rope or line, useful for lassoing a piling.
* Cleat hitch – affixes a line to a cleat, used with docking lines.
* Clove hitch – two half hitches, used for tying onto a post or hanging a fender.
* Figure-eight – a stopper knot, prevents a line from sliding past the opening in a fitting.
* Rolling hitch – a friction hitch onto a line or a spar that pulls in one direction and slides in the other.
* Sheet bend – joins two rope ends, when improvising a longer line.
* Reef knot or square knot – used for reefing or storing a sail by tying two ends of a line together.

Lines and halyards are typically coiled neatly for stowage and reuse.

==Sail physics==
The physics of sailing arises from a balance of forces between the wind powering the sailing craft as it passes over its sails and the resistance by the sailing craft against being blown off course, which is provided in the water by the keel, rudder, underwater foils and other elements of the underbody of a sailboat, on ice by the runners of an iceboat, or on land by the wheels of a sail-powered land vehicle.

Forces on sails depend on wind speed and direction and the speed and direction of the craft. The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the &quot;apparent wind&quot;—the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into drag—the force component in the direction of the apparent wind—and lift—the force component normal (90°) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind (&quot;angle of attack&quot;), lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Depending on the angle of attack of a set of sails with respect to the apparent wind, each sail is providing motive force to the sailing craft either from lift-dominant attached flow or drag-dominant separated flow. Additionally, sails may interact with one another to create forces that are different from the sum of the individual contributions of each sail, when used alone.

===Apparent wind velocity===
The term &quot;velocity&quot; refers both to speed and direction. As applied to wind, &quot;apparent wind velocity&quot; (VA) is the air velocity acting upon the leading edge of the most forward sail or as experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. In nautical terminology, wind speeds are normally expressed in knots and wind angles in degrees. All sailing craft reach a constant &quot;forward velocity&quot; (VB) for a given &quot;true wind velocity&quot; (VT) and &quot;point of sail&quot;. The craft&#x27;s point of sail affects its velocity for a given true wind velocity. Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from the wind in a &quot;no-go&quot; zone that is approximately 40° to 50° away from the true wind, depending on the craft. Likewise, the directly downwind speed of all conventional sailing craft is limited to the true wind speed. As a sailboat sails further from the wind, the apparent wind becomes smaller and the lateral component becomes less; boat speed is highest on the beam reach. To act like an airfoil, the sail on a sailboat is sheeted further out as the course is further off the wind. As an iceboat sails further from the wind, the apparent wind increases slightly and the boat speed is highest on the broad reach. In order to act like an airfoil, the sail on an iceboat is sheeted in for all three points of sail.

===Lift and drag on sails===

&quot;Lift&quot; on a sail, acting as an airfoil, occurs in a direction &quot;perpendicular&quot; to the incident airstream (the apparent wind velocity for the headsail) and is a result of pressure differences between the windward and leeward surfaces and depends on the angle of attack, sail shape, air density, and speed of the apparent wind. The lift force results from the average pressure on the windward surface of the sail being higher than the average pressure on the leeward side. These pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved airflow. As air follows a curved path along the windward side of a sail, there is a pressure gradient perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside. To generate lift, a sail must present an &quot;angle of attack&quot; between the chord line of the sail and the apparent wind velocity. The angle of attack is a function of both the craft&#x27;s point of sail and how the sail is adjusted with respect to the apparent wind.

As the lift generated by a sail increases, so does lift-induced drag, which together with parasitic drag constitute total &quot;drag&quot;, which acts in a direction &quot;parallel&quot; to the incident airstream. This occurs as the angle of attack increases with sail trim or change of course and causes the lift coefficient to increase up to the point of aerodynamic stall along with the lift-induced drag coefficient. At the onset of stall, lift is abruptly decreased, as is lift-induced drag. Sails with the apparent wind behind them (especially going downwind) operate in a stalled condition.

Lift and drag are components of the total aerodynamic force on sail, which are resisted by forces in the water (for a boat) or on the traveled surface (for an iceboat or land sailing craft). Sails act in two basic modes; under the &quot;lift-predominant&quot; mode, the sail behaves in a manner analogous to a &quot;wing&quot; with airflow attached to both surfaces; under the &quot;drag-predominant&quot; mode, the sail acts in a manner analogous to a &quot;parachute&quot; with airflow in detached flow, eddying around the sail.

====Lift predominance (wing mode)====
Sails allow progress of a sailing craft to windward, thanks to their ability to generate lift (and the craft&#x27;s ability to resist the lateral forces that result). Each sail configuration has a characteristic coefficient of lift and attendant coefficient of drag, which can be determined experimentally and calculated theoretically. Sailing craft orient their sails with a favorable angle of attack between the entry point of the sail and the apparent wind even as their course changes. The ability to generate lift is limited by sailing too close to the wind when no effective angle of attack is available to generate lift (causing luffing) and sailing sufficiently off the wind that the sail cannot be oriented at a favorable angle of attack to prevent the sail from stalling with flow separation.

====Drag predominance (parachute mode)====
When sailing craft are on a course where the angle between the sail and the apparent wind (the angle of attack) exceeds the point of maximum lift, separation of flow occurs. Drag increases and lift decreases with increasing angle of attack as the separation becomes progressively pronounced until the sail is perpendicular to the apparent wind, when lift becomes negligible and drag predominates. In addition to the sails used upwind, spinnakers provide area and curvature appropriate for sailing with separated flow on downwind points of sail, analogous to parachutes, which provide both lift and drag.

====Wind variation with height and time====

Wind speed increases with height above the surface; at the same time, wind speed may vary over short periods of time as gusts.

Wind shear affects sailing craft in motion by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. Wind shear occurs because of friction above a water surface slowing the flow of air. The ratio of wind at the surface to wind at a height above the surface varies by a power law with an exponent of 0.11-0.13 over the ocean. This means that a wind at 3 m above the water would be approximately at above the water. In hurricane-force winds with at the surface the speed at would be This suggests that sails that reach higher above the surface can be subject to stronger wind forces that move the centre of effort on them higher above the surface and increase the heeling moment. Additionally, apparent wind direction moves aft with height above water, which may necessitate a corresponding twist in the shape of the sail to achieve attached flow with height.

Gusts may be predicted by the same value that serves as an exponent for wind shear, serving as a gust factor. So, one can expect gusts to be about 1.5 times stronger than the prevailing wind speed (a 10-knot wind might gust up to 15 knots). This, combined with changes in wind direction suggest the degree to which a sailing craft must adjust sail angle to wind gusts on a given course.

== Hull physics ==

Waterborne sailing craft rely on the design of the hull and keel to provide minimal forward drag in opposition to the sails&#x27; propulsive power and maximum resistance to the sails&#x27; lateral forces. In modern sailboats, drag is minimized by control of the hull&#x27;s shape (blunt or fine), appendages, and slipperiness. The keel or other underwater foils provide the lateral resistance to forces on the sails. Heeling increases both drag and the ability of the boat to track along its desired course. Wave generation for a displacement hull is another important limitation on boat speed.

=== Drag ===
Drag from its form is described by a prismatic coefficient, Cp = displaced volume of the vessel divided by waterline length times maximum displaced section area—the maximum value of Cp = 1.0 being for a constant displace cross section area, as would be found on a barge. For modern sailboats, values of 0.53 ≤ Cp ≤ 0.6 are likely because of the tapered shape of the submerged hull towards both ends. Reducing interior volume allows creating a finer hull with less drag. Because a keel or other underwater foil produces lift, it also produces drag, which increases as the boat heels. Wetted area of the hull affects total the amount of friction between the water and the hull&#x27;s surface, creating another component of drag.

=== Lateral resistance ===
Sailboats use some sort of underwater foil to generate lift that maintains the forward direction of the boat under sail. Whereas sails operate at angles of attack between 10° and 90° incident to the wind, underwater foils operate at angles of attack between 0° and 10° incident to the water passing by. Neither their angle of attack nor surface is adjustable (except for moveable foils) and they are never intentionally stalled, while making way through the water. Heeling the vessel away from perpendicular into the water significantly degrades the boat&#x27;s ability to point into the wind.

=== Hull speed and beyond ===
Hull speed is the speed at which the wavelength of a vessel&#x27;s bow wave is equal to its waterline length and is proportional to the square root of the vessel&#x27;s length at the waterline. Applying more power does not significantly increase the speed of a displacement vessel beyond hull speed. This is because the vessel is climbing up an increasingly steep bow wave with the addition of power without the wave propagating forward faster.

Planing and foiling vessels are not limited by hull speed, as they rise out of the water without building a bow wave with the application of power. Long narrow hulls, such as those of catamarans, surpass hull speed by piercing through the bow wave. Hull speed does not apply to sailing craft on ice runners or wheels because they do not displace water.

<text>The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is an Internet standard communication protocol for electronic mail transmission. Mail servers and other message transfer agents use SMTP to send and receive mail messages. User-level email clients typically use SMTP only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying, and typically submit outgoing email to the mail server on port 587 or 465 per . For retrieving messages, IMAP (which replaced the older POP3) is standard, but proprietary servers also often implement proprietary protocols, e.g., Exchange ActiveSync.

SMTP&#x27;s origins began in 1980, building on concepts implemented on the ARPANET since 1971. It has been updated, modified and extended multiple times. The protocol version in common use today has extensible structure with various extensions for authentication, encryption, binary data transfer, and internationalized email addresses. SMTP servers commonly use the Transmission Control Protocol on port number 25 (between servers) and 587 (for submission from authenticated clients), both with or without encryption.

==History==

=== Predecessors to SMTP ===
Various forms of one-to-one electronic messaging were used in the 1960s. Users communicated using systems developed for specific mainframe computers. As more computers were interconnected, especially in the U.S. Government&#x27;s ARPANET, standards were developed to permit exchange of messages between different operating systems. 

Mail on the ARPANET traces its roots to 1971: the Mail Box Protocol, which was not implemented, but is discussed in ; and the SNDMSG program, which Ray Tomlinson of BBN adapted that year to send messages across two computers on the ARPANET. A further proposal for a Mail Protocol was made in RFC 524 in June 1973, which was not implemented.

The use of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for &quot;network mail&quot; on the ARPANET was proposed in RFC 469 in March 1973. Through RFC 561, RFC 680, RFC 724, and finally RFC 733 in November 1977, a standardized framework for &quot;electronic mail&quot; using FTP mail servers on was developed.

SMTP grew out of these standards developed during the 1970s. Ray Tomlinson discussed network mail among the International Network Working Group in &quot;INWG Protocol note 2&quot;, written in September 1974. INWG discussed protocols for electronic mail in 1979, which was referenced by Jon Postel in his early work on Internet email. Postel first proposed an Internet Message Protocol in 1979 as part of the Internet Experiment Note (IEN) series.

=== Original SMTP ===
In 1980, Postel and Suzanne Sluizer published which proposed the Mail Transfer Protocol as a replacement for the use of the FTP for mail. of May 1981 removed all references to FTP and allocated port 57 for TCP and UDP, an allocation that has since been removed by IANA. In November 1981, Postel published &quot;Simple Mail Transfer Protocol&quot;.

The SMTP standard was developed around the same time as Usenet, a one-to-many communication network with some similarities.

SMTP became widely used in the early 1980s. At the time, it was a complement to the Unix to Unix Copy Program (UUCP), which was better suited for handling email transfers between machines that were intermittently connected. SMTP, on the other hand, works best when both the sending and receiving machines are connected to the network all the time. Both used a store and forward mechanism and are examples of push technology. Though Usenet&#x27;s newsgroups were still propagated with UUCP between servers, UUCP as a mail transport has virtually disappeared along with the &quot;bang paths&quot; it used as message routing headers.

Sendmail, released with 4.1cBSD in 1983, was one of the first mail transfer agents to implement SMTP. Over time, as BSD Unix became the most popular operating system on the Internet, Sendmail became the most common MTA (mail transfer agent).

The original SMTP protocol supported only unauthenticated unencrypted 7-bit ASCII text communications, susceptible to trivial man-in-the-middle attack, spoofing, and spamming, and requiring any binary data to be encoded to readable text before transmission. Due to absence of a proper authentication mechanism, by design every SMTP server was an open mail relay. The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) reported that 55% of mail servers were open relays in 1998, but less than 1% in 2002. Because of spam concerns most email providers blocklist open relays, making original SMTP essentially impractical for general use on the Internet.

=== Modern SMTP ===
In November 1995, defined Extended Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (ESMTP), which established a general structure for all existing and future extensions which aimed to add-in the features missing from the original SMTP. ESMTP defines consistent and manageable means by which ESMTP clients and servers can be identified and servers can indicate supported extensions. 

Message submission () and SMTP-AUTH () were introduced in 1998 and 1999, both describing new trends in email delivery. Originally, SMTP servers were typically internal to an organization, receiving mail for the organization &quot;from the outside&quot;, and relaying messages from the organization &quot;to the outside&quot;. But as time went on, SMTP servers (mail transfer agents), in practice, were expanding their roles to become message submission agents for mail user agents, some of which were now relaying mail &quot;from the outside&quot; of an organization. (e.g. a company executive wishes to send email while on a trip using the corporate SMTP server.) This issue, a consequence of the rapid expansion and popularity of the World Wide Web, meant that SMTP had to include specific rules and methods for relaying mail and authenticating users to prevent abuses such as relaying of unsolicited email (spam). Work on message submission () was originally started because popular mail servers would often rewrite mail in an attempt to fix problems in it, for example, adding a domain name to an unqualified address. This behavior is helpful when the message being fixed is an initial submission, but dangerous and harmful when the message originated elsewhere and is being relayed. Cleanly separating mail into submission and relay was seen as a way to permit and encourage rewriting submissions while prohibiting rewriting relay. As spam became more prevalent, it was also seen as a way to provide authorization for mail being sent out from an organization, as well as traceability. This separation of relay and submission quickly became a foundation for modern email security practices.

As this protocol started out purely ASCII text-based, it did not deal well with binary files, or characters in many non-English languages. Standards such as Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) were developed to encode binary files for transfer through SMTP. Mail transfer agents (MTAs) developed after Sendmail also tended to be implemented 8-bit clean, so that the alternate &quot;just send eight&quot; strategy could be used to transmit arbitrary text data (in any 8-bit ASCII-like character encoding) via SMTP. Mojibake was still a problem due to differing character set mappings between vendors, although the email addresses themselves still allowed only ASCII. 8-bit-clean MTAs today tend to support the 8BITMIME extension, permitting some binary files to be transmitted almost as easily as plain text (limits on line length and permitted octet values still apply, so that MIME encoding is needed for most non-text data and some text formats). In 2012, the codice_1 extension was created to support UTF-8 text, allowing international content and addresses in non-Latin scripts like Cyrillic or Chinese.

Many people contributed to the core SMTP specifications, among them Jon Postel, Eric Allman, Dave Crocker, Ned Freed, Randall Gellens, John Klensin, and Keith Moore.

==Mail processing model==
Email is submitted by a mail client (mail user agent, MUA) to a mail server (mail submission agent, MSA) using SMTP on TCP port 587. Most mailbox providers still allow submission on traditional port 25. The MSA delivers the mail to its mail transfer agent (MTA). Often, these two agents are instances of the same software launched with different options on the same machine. Local processing can be done either on a single machine, or split among multiple machines; mail agent processes on one machine can share files, but if processing is on multiple machines, they transfer messages between each other using SMTP, where each machine is configured to use the next machine as a smart host. Each process is an MTA (an SMTP server) in its own right.

The boundary MTA uses DNS to look up the MX (mail exchanger) record for the recipient&#x27;s domain (the part of the email address on the right of codice_2). The MX record contains the name of the target MTA. Based on the target host and other factors, the sending MTA selects a recipient server and connects to it to complete the mail exchange.

Message transfer can occur in a single connection between two MTAs, or in a series of hops through intermediary systems. A receiving SMTP server may be the ultimate destination, an intermediate &quot;relay&quot; (that is, it stores and forwards the message) or a &quot;gateway&quot; (that is, it may forward the message using some protocol other than SMTP). Per section 2.1, each hop is a formal handoff of responsibility for the message, whereby the receiving server must either deliver the message or properly report the failure to do so.

Once the final hop accepts the incoming message, it hands it to a mail delivery agent (MDA) for local delivery. An MDA saves messages in the relevant mailbox format. As with sending, this reception can be done using one or multiple computers, but in the diagram above the MDA is depicted as one box near the mail exchanger box. An MDA may deliver messages directly to storage, or forward them over a network using SMTP or other protocol such as Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP), a derivative of SMTP designed for this purpose.

Once delivered to the local mail server, the mail is stored for batch retrieval by authenticated mail clients (MUAs). Mail is retrieved by end-user applications, called email clients, using Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), a protocol that both facilitates access to mail and manages stored mail, or the Post Office Protocol (POP) which typically uses the traditional mbox mail file format or a proprietary system such as Microsoft Exchange/Outlook or Lotus Notes/Domino. Webmail clients may use either method, but the retrieval protocol is often not a formal standard.

SMTP defines message &quot;transport&quot;, not the message &quot;content&quot;. Thus, it defines the mail &quot;envelope&quot; and its parameters, such as the envelope sender, but not the header (except &quot;trace information&quot;) nor the body of the message itself. STD 10 and define SMTP (the envelope), while STD 11 and define the message (header and body), formally referred to as the Internet Message Format.

==Protocol overview==
SMTP is a connection-oriented, text-based protocol in which a mail sender communicates with a mail receiver by issuing command strings and supplying necessary data over a reliable ordered data stream channel, typically a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection. An &quot;SMTP session&quot; consists of commands originated by an SMTP client (the initiating agent, sender, or transmitter) and corresponding responses from the SMTP server (the listening agent, or receiver) so that the session is opened, and session parameters are exchanged. A session may include zero or more SMTP transactions. An &quot;SMTP transaction&quot; consists of three command/reply sequences:

# MAIL command, to establish the return address, also called return-path, reverse-path, bounce address, mfrom, or envelope sender.
# RCPT command, to establish a recipient of the message. This command can be issued multiple times, one for each recipient. These addresses are also part of the envelope.
# DATA to signal the beginning of the &quot;message text&quot;; the content of the message, as opposed to its envelope. It consists of a &quot;message header&quot; and a &quot;message body&quot; separated by an empty line. DATA is actually a group of commands, and the server replies twice: once to the &quot;DATA command&quot; itself, to acknowledge that it is ready to receive the text, and the second time after the end-of-data sequence, to either accept or reject the entire message.

Besides the intermediate reply for DATA, each server&#x27;s reply can be either positive (2xx reply codes) or negative. Negative replies can be permanent (5xx codes) or transient (4xx codes). A reject is a permanent failure and the client should send a bounce message to the server it received it from. A drop is a positive response followed by message discard rather than delivery.

The initiating host, the SMTP client, can be either an end-user&#x27;s email client, functionally identified as a mail user agent (MUA), or a relay server&#x27;s mail transfer agent (MTA), that is an SMTP server acting as an SMTP client, in the relevant session, in order to relay mail. Fully capable SMTP servers maintain queues of messages for retrying message transmissions that resulted in transient failures.

A MUA knows the &quot;outgoing mail&quot; SMTP server from its configuration. A relay server typically determines which server to connect to by looking up the MX (Mail eXchange) DNS resource record for each recipient&#x27;s domain name. If no MX record is found, a conformant relaying server (not all are) instead looks up the A record. Relay servers can also be configured to use a smart host. A relay server initiates a TCP connection to the server on the &quot;well-known port&quot; for SMTP: port 25, or for connecting to an MSA, port 587. The main difference between an MTA and an MSA is that connecting to an MSA requires SMTP Authentication.

===SMTP vs mail retrieval===
SMTP is a delivery protocol only. In normal use, mail is &quot;pushed&quot; to a destination mail server (or next-hop mail server) as it arrives. Mail is routed based on the destination server, not the individual user(s) to which it is addressed. Other protocols, such as the Post Office Protocol (POP) and the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are specifically designed for use by individual users retrieving messages and managing mailboxes. To permit an intermittently-connected mail server to &quot;pull&quot; messages from a remote server on demand, SMTP has a feature to initiate mail queue processing on a remote server (see Remote Message Queue Starting below). POP and IMAP are unsuitable protocols for relaying mail by intermittently-connected machines; they are designed to operate after final delivery, when information critical to the correct operation of mail relay (the &quot;mail envelope&quot;) has been removed.

===Remote Message Queue Starting===
Remote Message Queue Starting enables a remote host to start processing of the mail queue on a server so it may receive messages destined to it by sending a corresponding command. The original codice_3 command was deemed insecure and was extended in with the codice_4 command which operates more securely using an authentication method based on Domain Name System information.

==Outgoing mail SMTP server==
An email client needs to know the IP address of its initial SMTP server and this has to be given as part of its configuration (usually given as a DNS name). This server will deliver outgoing messages on behalf of the user.

===Outgoing mail server access restrictions===
Server administrators need to impose some control on which clients can use the server. This enables them to deal with abuse, for example spam. Two solutions have been in common use:

* In the past, many systems imposed usage restrictions by the &quot;location&quot; of the client, only permitting usage by clients whose IP address is one that the server administrators control. Usage from any other client IP address is disallowed.
* Modern SMTP servers typically offer an alternative system that requires authentication of clients by credentials before allowing access.

====Restricting access by location====
Under this system, an ISP&#x27;s SMTP server will not allow access by users who are outside the ISP&#x27;s network. More precisely, the server may only allow access to users with an IP address provided by the ISP, which is equivalent to requiring that they are connected to the Internet using that same ISP. A mobile user may often be on a network other than that of their normal ISP, and will then find that sending email fails because the configured SMTP server choice is no longer accessible.

This system has several variations. For example, an organisation&#x27;s SMTP server may only provide service to users on the same network, enforcing this by firewalling to block access by users on the wider Internet. Or the server may perform range checks on the client&#x27;s IP address. These methods were typically used by corporations and institutions such as universities which provided an SMTP server for outbound mail only for use internally within the organisation. However, most of these bodies now use client authentication methods, as described below.

Where a user is mobile, and may use different ISPs to connect to the internet, this kind of usage restriction is onerous, and altering the configured outbound email SMTP server address is impractical. It is highly desirable to be able to use email client configuration information that does not need to change.

====Client authentication====
Modern SMTP servers typically require authentication of clients by credentials before allowing access, rather than restricting access by location as described earlier. This more flexible system is friendly to mobile users and allows them to have a fixed choice of configured outbound SMTP server. SMTP Authentication, often abbreviated SMTP AUTH, is an extension of the SMTP in order to log in using an authentication mechanism.

===Ports===
Communication between mail servers generally uses the standard TCP port 25 designated for SMTP.

Mail &quot;clients&quot; however generally don&#x27;t use this, instead using specific &quot;submission&quot; ports. Mail services generally accept email submission from clients on one of:

* 587 (Submission), as formalized in (previously )
* 465 This port was deprecated after , until the issue of .

Port 2525 and others may be used by some individual providers, but have never been officially supported.

Many Internet service providers now block all outgoing port 25 traffic from their customers. Mainly as an anti-spam measure, but also to cure for the higher cost they have when leaving it open, perhaps by charging more from the few customers that require it open.

==SMTP transport example==
A typical example of sending a message via SMTP to two mailboxes (&quot;alice&quot; and &quot;theboss&quot;) located in the same mail domain (&quot;example.com&quot;) is reproduced in the following session exchange. (In this example, the conversation parts are prefixed with &quot;S:&quot; and &quot;C:&quot;, for &quot;server&quot; and &quot;client&quot;, respectively; these labels are not part of the exchange.)

After the message sender (SMTP client) establishes a reliable communications channel to the message receiver (SMTP server), the session is opened with a greeting by the server, usually containing its fully qualified domain name (FQDN), in this case &quot;smtp.example.com&quot;. The client initiates its dialog by responding with a codice_5 command identifying itself in the command&#x27;s parameter with its FQDN (or an address literal if none is available).

 S: 220 smtp.example.com ESMTP Postfix
 C: HELO relay.example.org
 S: 250 Hello relay.example.org, I am glad to meet you
 C: MAIL FROM:&lt;bob@example.org&gt;
 S: 250 Ok
 C: RCPT TO:&lt;alice@example.com&gt;
 S: 250 Ok
 C: RCPT TO:&lt;theboss@example.com&gt;
 S: 250 Ok
 C: DATA
 S: 354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;
 C: 
 C: 
 C: 
 C: 
 C: 
 C:
 C: Hello Alice.
 C: This is a test message with 5 header fields and 4 lines in the message body.
 C: Your friend,
 C: Bob
 C: .
 S: 250 Ok: queued as 12345
 C: QUIT
 S: 221 Bye
 {The server closes the connection}

The client notifies the receiver of the originating email address of the message in a codice_6 command. This is also the return or bounce address in case the message cannot be delivered. In this example the email message is sent to two mailboxes on the same SMTP server: one for each recipient listed in the codice_7 and codice_8 header fields. The corresponding SMTP command is codice_9. Each successful reception and execution of a command is acknowledged by the server with a result code and response message (e.g., codice_10).

The transmission of the body of the mail message is initiated with a codice_11 command after which it is transmitted verbatim line by line and is terminated with an end-of-data sequence. This sequence consists of a new-line (codice_12), a single full stop (codice_13), followed by another new-line (codice_12). Since a message body can contain a line with just a period as part of the text, the client sends &quot;two&quot; periods every time a line starts with a period; correspondingly, the server replaces every sequence of two periods at the beginning of a line with a single one. Such escaping method is called &quot;dot-stuffing&quot;.

The server&#x27;s positive reply to the end-of-data, as exemplified, implies that the server has taken the responsibility of delivering the message. A message can be doubled if there is a communication failure at this time, e.g. due to a power outage: Until the sender has received that codice_10 reply, it must assume the message was not delivered. On the other hand, after the receiver has decided to accept the message, it must assume the message has been delivered to it. Thus, during this time span, both agents have active copies of the message that they will try to deliver. The probability that a communication failure occurs exactly at this step is directly proportional to the amount of filtering that the server performs on the message body, most often for anti-spam purposes. The limiting timeout is specified to be 10 minutes.

The codice_16 command ends the session. If the email has other recipients located elsewhere, the client would codice_16 and connect to an appropriate SMTP server for subsequent recipients after the current destination(s) had been queued. The information that the client sends in the codice_5 and codice_6 commands are added (not seen in example code) as additional header fields to the message by the receiving server. It adds a codice_20 and codice_21 header field, respectively.

Some clients are implemented to close the connection after the message is accepted (codice_22), so the last two lines may actually be omitted. This causes an error on the server when trying to send the codice_23 reply.

==SMTP Extensions==
===Extension discovery mechanism===
Clients learn a server&#x27;s supported options by using the codice_24 greeting, as exemplified below, instead of the original codice_5. Clients fall back to codice_5 only if the server does not support codice_24 greeting.

Modern clients may use the ESMTP extension keyword codice_28 to query the server for the maximum message size that will be accepted. Older clients and servers may try to transfer excessively sized messages that will be rejected after consuming network resources, including connect time to network links that is paid by the minute.

Users can manually determine in advance the maximum size accepted by ESMTP servers. The client replaces the codice_5 command with the codice_24 command.
 S: 220 smtp2.example.com ESMTP Postfix
 C: EHLO bob.example.org
 S: 250-smtp2.example.com Hello bob.example.org [192.0.2.201]
 S: 250-SIZE 14680064
 S: 250-PIPELINING
 S: 250 HELP
Thus &quot;smtp2.example.com&quot; declares that it can accept a fixed maximum message size no larger than 14,680,064 octets (8-bit bytes).

In the simplest case, an ESMTP server declares a maximum codice_28 immediately after receiving an codice_24. According to , however, the numeric parameter to the codice_28 extension in the codice_24 response is optional. Clients may instead, when issuing a codice_6 command, include a numeric estimate of the size of the message they are transferring, so that the server can refuse receipt of overly-large messages.

===Binary data transfer===
Original SMTP supports only a single body of ASCII text, therefore any binary data needs to be encoded as text into that body of the message before transfer, and then decoded by the recipient. Binary-to-text encodings, such as uuencode and BinHex were typically used.

The 8BITMIME command was developed to address this. It was standardized in 1994 as It facilitates the transparent exchange of e-mail messages containing octets outside the seven-bit ASCII character set by encoding them as MIME content parts, typically encoded with Base64.

===Mail delivery mechanism extensions===

===On-Demand Mail Relay===

On-Demand Mail Relay (ODMR) is an SMTP extension standardized in that allows an intermittently-connected SMTP server to receive email queued for it when it is connected.

===Internationalization extension===
Original SMTP supports email addresses composed of ASCII characters only, which is inconvenient for users whose native script is not Latin based, or who use diacritic not in the ASCII character set. This limitation was alleviated via extensions enabling UTF-8 in address names. introduced experimental codice_36 command and later was superseded by that introduced codice_1 command. These extensions provide support for multi-byte and non-ASCII characters in email addresses, such as those with diacritics and other language characters such as Greek and Chinese.

Current support is limited, but there is strong interest in broad adoption of and the related RFCs in countries like China that have a large user base where Latin (ASCII) is a foreign script.

===Extensions===
Like SMTP, ESMTP is a protocol used to transport Internet mail. It is used as both an inter-server transport protocol and (with restricted behavior enforced) a mail submission protocol.

The main identification feature for ESMTP clients is to open a transmission with the command codice_24 (Extended HELLO), rather than codice_5 (Hello, the original standard). A server will respond with success (code 250), failure (code 550) or error (code 500, 501, 502, 504, or 421), depending on its configuration. An ESMTP server returns the code 250 OK in a multi-line reply with its domain and a list of keywords to indicate supported extensions. A RFC 821 compliant server returns error code 500, allowing ESMTP clients to try either codice_5 or codice_16.

Each service extension is defined in an approved format in subsequent RFCs and registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The first definitions were the RFC 821 optional services: codice_42, codice_43 (Send or Mail), codice_44 (Send and Mail), codice_45, codice_46, and codice_3. The format of additional SMTP verbs was set and for new parameters in codice_48 and codice_49.

Some relatively common keywords (not all of them corresponding to commands) used today are:
* codice_50 – 8 bit data transmission, 
* codice_51 – Authenticated codice_3 for On-Demand Mail Relay, 
* codice_53 – Authenticated SMTP, 
* codice_54 – Chunking, 
* codice_55 – Delivery status notification, (See Variable envelope return path)
* codice_4 – Extended version of remote message queue starting command codice_3, 
* codice_46 – Supply helpful information, 
* codice_59 – Command pipelining, 
* codice_28 – Message size declaration, 
* codice_61 – Transport Layer Security, (2002)
* codice_1 – Allow UTF-8 encoding in mailbox names and header fields, 
* codice_36 – Allow UTF-8 encoding in mailbox names and header fields, (deprecated)

The ESMTP format was restated in (superseding RFC 821) and updated to the latest definition in in 2008. Support for the codice_24 command in servers became mandatory, and codice_5 designated a required fallback.

Non-standard, unregistered, service extensions can be used by bilateral agreement, these services are indicated by an codice_24 message keyword starting with &quot;X&quot;, and with any additional parameters or verbs similarly marked.

SMTP commands are case-insensitive. They are presented here in capitalized form for emphasis only. An SMTP server that requires a specific capitalization method is a violation of the standard.

====8BITMIME====
At least the following servers advertise the 8BITMIME extension:
* Apache James (since 2.3.0a1)
* Citadel (since 7.30)
* Courier Mail Server
* Gmail
* IceWarp
* IIS SMTP Service
* Kerio Connect
* Lotus Domino
* Microsoft Exchange Server (as of Exchange Server 2000)
* Novell GroupWise
* OpenSMTPD
* Oracle Communications Messaging Server
* Postfix
* Sendmail (since 6.57)

The following servers can be configured to advertise 8BITMIME, but do not perform conversion of 8-bit data to 7-bit when connecting to non-8BITMIME relays:
* Exim and qmail do not translate eight-bit messages to seven-bit when making an attempt to relay 8-bit data to non-8BITMIME peers, as is required by the RFC. This does not cause problems in practice, since virtually all modern mail relays are 8-bit clean.
* Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 advertises 8BITMIME by default, but relaying to a non-8BITMIME peer results in a bounce. This is allowed by .

====SMTP-AUTH====

The SMTP-AUTH extension provides an access control mechanism. It consists of an authentication step through which the client effectively logs into the mail server during the process of sending mail. Servers that support SMTP-AUTH can usually be configured to require clients to use this extension, ensuring the true identity of the sender is known. The SMTP-AUTH extension is defined in .

SMTP-AUTH can be used to allow legitimate users to relay mail while denying relay service to unauthorized users, such as spammers. It does not necessarily guarantee the authenticity of either the SMTP envelope sender or the &quot;From:&quot; header. For example, spoofing, in which one sender masquerades as someone else, is still possible with SMTP-AUTH unless the server is configured to limit message from-addresses to addresses this AUTHed user is authorized for.

The SMTP-AUTH extension also allows one mail server to indicate to another that the sender has been authenticated when relaying mail. In general this requires the recipient server to trust the sending server, meaning that this aspect of SMTP-AUTH is rarely used on the Internet.

====SMTPUTF8====
Supporting servers include:
* Postfix (version 3.0 and later)
* Momentum (versions 4.1 and 3.6.5, and later)
* Sendmail (experimental support in 8.17.1)
* Exim (experimental as of the 4.86 release, quite mature in 4.96)
* CommuniGate Pro as of version 6.2.2
* Courier-MTA as of version 1.0
* Halon as of version 4.0
* Microsoft Exchange Server as of protocol revision 14.0
* Haraka and other servers.
* Oracle Communications Messaging Server as of release 8.0.2.

===Security extensions===
Mail delivery can occur both over plain text and encrypted connections, however the communicating parties might not know in advance of other party&#x27;s ability to use secure channel.

====STARTTLS or &quot;Opportunistic TLS&quot;====

The STARTTLS extensions enables supporting SMTP servers to notify connecting clients that it supports TLS encrypted communication and offers the opportunity for clients to upgrade their connection by sending the STARTTLS command. Servers supporting the extension do not inherently gain any security benefits from its implementation on its own, as upgrading to a TLS encrypted session is dependent on the connecting client deciding to exercise this option, hence the term &quot;opportunistic&quot; TLS.

STARTTLS is effective only against passive observation attacks, since the STARTTLS negotiation happens in plain text and an active attacker can trivially remove STARTTLS commands. This type of man-in-the-middle attack is sometimes referred to as STRIPTLS, where the encryption negotiation information sent from one end never reaches the other. In this scenario both parties take the invalid or unexpected responses as indication that the other does not properly support STARTTLS, defaulting to traditional plain-text mail transfer. Note that STARTTLS is also defined for IMAP and POP3 in other RFCs, but these protocols serve different purposes: SMTP is used for communication between message transfer agents, while IMAP and POP3 are for end clients and message transfer agents.

In 2014 the Electronic Frontier Foundation began &quot;STARTTLS Everywhere&quot; project that, similarly to &quot;HTTPS Everywhere&quot; list, allowed relying parties to discover others supporting secure communication without prior communication. The project stopped accepting submissions on 29 April 2021, and EFF recommended switching to DANE and MTA-STS for discovering information on peers&#x27; TLS support.

 officially declared plain text obsolete and recommend always using TLS for mail submission and access, adding ports with implicit TLS.

==== DANE for SMTP ====
 introduced the ability for DNS records to declare the encryption capabilities of a mail server. Utilising DNSSEC, mail server operators are able to publish a hash of their TLS certificate, thereby mitigating the possibility of unencrypted communications.

Microsoft expects to enable full SMTP DANE support for Exchange Online customers by the end of 2024. 

====SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security====
A newer 2018 called &quot;SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (MTA-STS)&quot; aims to address the problem of active adversaries by defining a protocol for mail servers to declare their ability to use secure channels in specific files on the server and specific DNS TXT records. The relying party would regularly check existence of such record, and cache it for the amount of time specified in the record and never communicate over insecure channels until record expires. Note that MTA-STS records apply only to SMTP traffic between mail servers while communications between a user&#x27;s client and the mail server are protected by Transport Layer Security with SMTP/MSA, IMAP, POP3, or HTTPS in combination with an organizational or technical policy. Essentially, MTA-STS is a means to extend such a policy to third parties.

In April 2019 Google Mail announced support for MTA-STS.

====SMTP TLS Reporting====
Protocols designed to securely deliver messages can fail due to misconfigurations or deliberate active interference, leading to undelivered messages or delivery over unencrypted or unauthenticated channels. &quot;SMTP TLS Reporting&quot; describes a reporting mechanism and format for sharing statistics and specific information about potential failures with recipient domains. Recipient domains can then use this information to both detect potential attacks and diagnose unintentional misconfigurations.

In April 2019 Google Mail announced support for SMTP TLS Reporting.

==Spoofing and spamming==

The original design of SMTP had no facility to authenticate senders, or check that servers were authorized to send on their behalf, with the result that email spoofing is possible, and commonly used in email spam and phishing.

Occasional proposals are made to modify SMTP extensively or replace it completely. One example of this is Internet Mail 2000, but neither it, nor any other has made much headway in the face of the network effect of the huge installed base of classic SMTP. 

Instead, mail servers now use a range of techniques, such as stricter enforcement of standards such as , DomainKeys Identified Mail, Sender Policy Framework and DMARC, DNSBLs and greylisting to reject or quarantine suspicious emails.

<text>A shuttlecock (also called a birdie or shuttle, or ball) is a high-drag projectile used in the sport of badminton. It has an open conical shape formed by feathers or plastic (or a synthetic alternative) embedded into a rounded cork (or rubber) base. The shuttlecock&#x27;s shape makes it extremely aerodynamically stable. Regardless of initial orientation, it will turn to fly cork first, and remain in the cork-first orientation.

==Origins==
The object resembles a hawk&#x27;s lure, used from ancient times in the training of hunting birds. It is frequently shortened to shuttle. The &quot;shuttle&quot; part of the name is derived from its back-and-forth motion during the game, resembling the shuttle of a 14th-century loom, while the &quot;cock&quot; part of the name is derived from the resemblance of the feathers to those on a rooster.

==Specifications==
A regulation standard shuttlecock weighs around . It has 16 feathers with each feather in length, and the diameter of the cork is . The diameter of the circle that the feathers make is around .

==Construction and materials==
A shuttlecock is formed from 16 or so overlapping feathers, usually goose or duck, embedded into a rounded cork base. Feathers are plucked from the wings of a live goose or duck, a method which has been deemed cruel by animal rights activists in recent years. The cork is covered with thin leather. To ensure satisfactory flight properties, it is considered preferable to use feathers from right or left wings only in each shuttlecock, and not mix feathers from different wings, as the feathers from different wings are shaped differently. Badminton companies make shuttlecock corks by sandwiching polyurethane between corks and/or using a whole piece of natural cork. With the first method, the cork becomes misshaped after use, while the cork in the latter method changes very little after use. This is because the structure of the shuttlecock is more durable when made with a single piece of natural cork.

===Feather or synthetic shuttlecocks===
The feathers are brittle; shuttlecocks break easily and often need to be replaced several times during a game. For this reason, synthetic shuttlecocks have been developed that replace the feathers with a plastic skirt. Players often refer to synthetic shuttlecocks as &quot;plastics&quot; and feathered shuttlecocks as &quot;feathers&quot;. Feather shuttles need to be properly humidified for at least 4 hours prior to play in order to fly the correct distance at the proper speed and to last longer. Properly humidified feathers flex during play, enhancing the shuttle&#x27;s speed change and durability. Dry feathers are brittle and break easily, causing the shuttle to wobble. Saturated feathers are &#x27;mushy&#x27;, making the feather cone narrow too much when strongly hit, which causes the shuttle to fly overly far and fast. Typically a humidification box is used, or a small moist sponge is inserted in the feather end of the closed shuttle tube container, avoiding any water contact with the cork of the shuttle. Shuttles are tested prior to play to make sure they fly true and at the proper speed, and cover the proper distance. Different weights of shuttles are used to compensate for local atmospheric conditions. Both humidity and height above sea level affect shuttle flight. World Badminton Federation Rules say the shuttle should reach the far doubles service line plus or minus half the width of the tram. According to manufacturers proper shuttles will generally travel from the back line of the court to just short of the long doubles service line on the opposite side of the net, with a full underhand hit from an average player.

The cost of good quality feathers is similar to that of good quality plastics, but plastics are far more durable, typically lasting many matches without any impairment to their flight. Feather shuttles are easily damaged and should be replaced every three or four games or sooner if they are damaged and do not fly straight. Damaged shuttles interfere with play as any impairment may misdirect the flight of the shuttlecock.

Most experienced and skillful players greatly prefer feathers, and serious tournaments or leagues are always played using feather shuttlecocks of the highest quality.

The playing characteristics of plastics and feathers are substantially different. Plastics fly more slowly on initial impact, but slow down less towards the end of their flight. While feathers tend to drop straight down on a clear shot, plastics never quite return to a straight drop, falling more on a diagonal. Feather shuttles may come off the strings at speeds in excess of 565 km/h (351 mph) but slow down faster as they drop. 
Furthermore, feathered shuttlecocks are recorded as having a constant drag coefficient. Contrarily, championship-grade synthetic shuttlecocks show less consistency with this factor. This shows that feathered shuttlecocks have a capacity for a higher standard speed range at which the game is typically played that synthetics cannot quite reach. This impacts the feel of the bird during the game for players, especially in the case of deformation of the shuttlecock. A feathered shuttlecock will still feel dull and heavy while in play because of the feathers, but a synthetic cannot maintain energy in flight in the same manner.

<text>A soldering iron is a hand tool used in soldering. It supplies heat to melt solder so that it can flow into the joint between two workpieces.

A soldering iron is composed of a heated metal tip (the &quot;bit&quot;) and an insulated handle. Heating is often achieved electrically, by passing an electric current (supplied through an electrical cord or battery cables) through a resistive heating element. Cordless irons can be heated by combustion of gas stored in a small tank, often using a catalytic heater rather than a flame. Simple irons, less commonly used today than in the past, were simply a large copper &quot;bit&quot; on a handle, heated in a flame.

Solder melts at approximately . Soldering irons are designed to reach a temperature range of . 

Soldering irons are most often used for installation, repairs, and limited production work in electronics assembly. High-volume production lines use other soldering methods. Large irons may be used for soldering joints in sheet metal objects. Less common uses include pyrography (burning designs into wood) and plastic welding (as an alternative to ultrasonic welding).

==History==

Before the development of electric soldering irons, the typical soldering iron consisted of a copper block, with an appropriately shaped point, supported on an iron rod and held in a wood handle. Immediately before use, the iron was heated over a fire or in a charcoal brazier, and it had to be reheated whenever it became too cool for use. Soldering irons were primarily used by tinsmiths and coppersmiths to work with thin sheet metal.

A large copper block was required in order to have sufficient thermal capacity to provide
useful heat after removal from the fire, and copper is expensive. This led to the development of
soldering irons that had a small copper tip attached to an inexpensive cast-iron block. Some irons even had removable and replaceable copper tips.

The first electric soldering iron had a very lightweight platinum tip heated by electric current flowing through the tip itself. By 1889, electric soldering irons were being developed with a resistance wire wrapped around the back end of the copper head and enclosed in a protective shell. Alternatively, the heating element could be enclosed in a relatively light-weight hollow copper head. 

In 1894, the American Electrical Heater Company began manufacturing electrical soldering irons on a large scale in Detroit. They started producing them and shortly after American Electrical Heater Company released their line of soldering irons. In 1905, &quot;Scientific American Magazine,&quot; published a tutorial on making a soldering iron that
clearly explains how early irons were made.

In 1921, a German company founded by Ernst Sachs developed an electrical soldering iron similar to American Electrical Heater Company iron. in 1926, William Alferink applied for a patent for the first soldering station.

== Actual &quot;Form factor&quot; of soldering irons ==

In 1946, Carl E. Weller applied for a patent for his soldering gun that could heat instantaneously and began production of the &quot;Speedy Iron&quot; in Pennsylvania. It was manufactured through the Weller Manufacturing Company, and this product was the first instantaneous thermal soldering gun. Few years later, they released to the market a soldering iron on with self-adjusting temperature. In 1951, the company WEN Products began manufacturing its own instantaneous soldering iron. After a three years trial Weller won for patent infringement.

In 1960 Weller got the patent for the soldering iron &quot;Magnastat&quot;, renewed in 1964 and 1971. This iron could control the temperature by using a temperature-sensitive magnetic tip. The &quot;Magnastat&quot; became a best seller and it was included it in the W-TCP soldering station in 1967. In fact, within the patent, as a complementary description, it defines what today has become the &quot;de facto&quot;, the redundancy is worth it, &quot;form factor&quot; of the vast majority of current Japanese and Chinese irons: Hakko, Baku, etc... The now-expired patent, which even Weller has stopped using on some models, described an outer tube holding the coated copper tip, clamped with a nut to the handle.

== Types ==
=== Simple iron ===
For electrical and electronics work, a low-power iron, a power rating between 15 and 35 watts, is used. Higher ratings are available, but do not run at higher temperature; instead there is more heat available for making soldered connections to things with large thermal capacity, for example, a metal chassis. Some irons are temperature-controlled, running at a fixed temperature in the same way as a soldering station, with higher power available for joints with large heat capacity. Simple irons run at an uncontrolled temperature determined by thermal equilibrium; when heating something large their temperature drops.

A variation is the Scope soldering iron, common in Australia, which operates from a low-voltage source such as transformer or battery, and heats in seconds when the user pushes the thumb-guard, which then acts as a heat controller.

=== Cordless iron ===
Small irons heated by a battery, or by combustion of a gas such as butane in a small self-contained tank, can be used when electricity is unavailable or cordless operation is required. The operating temperature of these irons is not regulated directly; gas irons may change power by adjusting gas flow. Gas-powered irons may have interchangeable tips including different size soldering tips, hot knife for cutting plastics, miniature blow-torch with a hot flame, and small hot air blower for such applications as shrinking heat shrink tubing.

=== Temperature-controlled soldering iron ===

Simple soldering irons reach a temperature determined by thermal equilibrium, dependent upon power input and cooling by the environment and the materials it comes into contact with. The iron temperature will drop when in contact with a large mass of metal such as a chassis; a small iron will lose too much temperature to solder a large connection. More advanced irons for use in electronics have a mechanism with a temperature sensor and method of temperature control to keep the tip temperature steady; more power is available if a connection is large. Temperature-controlled irons may be free-standing, or may comprise a head with heating element and tip, controlled by a base called a soldering station, with control circuitry and temperature adjustment and sometimes display.

A variety of means are used to control temperature. The simplest of these is a variable power control, much like a light dimmer, which changes the equilibrium temperature of the iron without automatically measuring or regulating the temperature. Another type of system uses a thermostat, often inside the iron&#x27;s tip, which automatically switches power on and off to the element. A thermal sensor such as a thermocouple may be used in conjunction with circuitry to monitor the temperature of the tip and adjust power delivered to the heating element to maintain a desired temperature. In some models, the firmware for the control circuitry is free software that can be modified by the end-user.

Another approach is to use magnetized soldering tips which lose their magnetic properties at a specific temperature, the Curie point. As long as the tip is magnetic, it closes a switch to supply power to the heating element. When it exceeds the design temperature it opens the contacts, cooling until the temperature drops enough to restore magnetisation. More complex Curie-point irons circulate a high-frequency AC current through the tip, using magnetic physics to direct heating only where the surface of the tip drops below the Curie point.

=== Soldering station ===

A soldering station has a temperature control and consists of an electrical power supply, control circuitry with provision for user adjustment of temperature and display, and a soldering iron or soldering head with a tip temperature sensor. The station will normally have a stand for the hot iron when not in use, and a wet sponge for cleaning. It is most commonly used for soldering electronic components. Other functions may be combined; for example a rework station, mainly for surface-mount components may have a hot air gun, vacuum pickup tool, and a soldering head; a desoldering station will have a desoldering head with vacuum pump for desoldering through-hole components, and a soldering iron head.

=== Soldering tweezers ===

For soldering and desoldering small surface-mount components with two terminals, such as some links, resistors, capacitors, and diodes, soldering tweezers can be used; they can be either free-standing or controlled from a soldering station. The tweezers have two heated tips mounted on arms whose separation can be manually varied by squeezing gently against spring force, like simple tweezers; the tips are applied to the two ends of the component. The main purpose of the soldering tweezers is to melt solder in the correct place; components are usually moved by simple tweezers or vacuum pickup.

=== Hot knife ===
A hot knife is a form of soldering iron equipped with a double-edged blade that is situated on a heating element. These tools can reach temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit (538 degrees Celsius) allowing for cuts of fabric and foam materials without worry of fraying or beading. Hot knives can be utilized in automotive, marine, and carpeting applications, as well as other industrial and personal uses.

== Stands ==
A soldering iron stand keeps the iron away from flammable materials, and often also comes with a cellulose sponge and flux pot for cleaning the tip. Some soldering irons for continuous and professional use come as part of a &quot;soldering station,&quot; which allows the exact temperature of the tip to be adjusted, kept constant, and sometimes displayed.

== Tips ==

Most soldering irons for electronics have interchangeable tips, also known as &quot;bits&quot;, that vary in size and shape for different types of work. Common tip shapes include: &quot;bevel&quot;, &quot;chisel&quot;, and &quot;conical&quot;. An example of a more specialist tip is spoon or gull wing, which features concavity. See the image for renderings of a few different tip shapes and some of the names given to them.

Pyramid tips with a triangular flat face and chisel tips with a wide flat face are useful for soldering sheet metal. Fine conical or tapered chisel tips are typically used for electronics work. Tips may be straight or have a bend. Concave or wicking tips with a chisel face with a concave well in the flat face to hold a small amount of solder are available. Tip selection depends upon the type of work and access to the joint; soldering of 0.5mm pitch surface-mount ICs, for example, is quite different from soldering a through-hole connection to a large area. A concave tip well is said to help prevent bridging of closely spaced leads; different shapes are recommended to correct bridging that has occurred. Due to patent restrictions not all manufacturers offer concave tips everywhere; in particular there are restrictions in the USA.

Older and very cheap irons typically use a bare copper tip, which is shaped with a file or sandpaper. This dissolves gradually into the solder, suffering pitting and erosion of the shape. Copper tips are sometimes filed when worn down. Iron-plated copper tips have become increasingly popular since the 1980s. Because iron is not readily dissolved by molten solder, the plated tip is more durable than a bare copper one, though it will eventually wear out and need replacing. This is especially important when working at the higher temperatures needed for modern lead-free solders. Solid iron and steel tips are seldom used because they store less heat, conduct it poorly, and rusting can break the heating element.

Iron-plated tips may feature a layer of nickel between the copper core and the iron surface. A nickel-chrome outer plating may be used further back from the very tip, as solder does not stick well to this material: this avoids solder wetting parts of the tip where it would be unwanted.

Some tips have a heater and a thermocouple-based temperature sensor embedded to facilitate a more precise temperature control (TS100 and T12, for instance).

== Cleaning ==
When the iron tip oxidises and burnt flux accumulates on it, solder no longer wets the tip, impeding heat transfer and making soldering difficult or impossible; tips must be periodically cleaned in use. Such problems happen with all kinds of solder, but are much more severe with the lead-free solders which have become widespread in electronics work, which require higher temperatures than solders containing lead. Exposed iron plating oxidises; if the tip is kept tinned with molten solder oxidation is inhibited. A clean unoxidised tip is tinned by applying a little solder and flux.

A wet small sponge, often supplied with soldering equipment, can be used to wipe the tip. For lead-free solder a slightly more aggressive cleaning, with brass shavings, can be used. Soldering flux will help to remove oxide; the more active the flux the better the cleaning, although acidic flux used on circuit boards that is not carefully cleaned off will cause corrosion. A tip which is cleaned but not retinned is susceptible to oxidation.

Soldering iron tips are made of a copper core plated various metals including iron. The copper is used for heat transfer and the other platings are for durability. Copper is very easily corroded, eating away the tip, particularly in lead-free work; iron is not. Cleaning tips requires the removal of oxide without damaging the iron plating and exposing the copper to rapid corrosion. The use of solder already containing a small amount of copper can slow corrosion of copper tips.

In cases of severe oxidation not removable by gentler methods, abrasion with something hard enough to remove oxide but not so hard as to scratch the iron plating can be used. A brass wire scourer, brush, or wheel on a bench grinder, can be used with care. Sandpaper and other tools may be used but are likely to damage the plating.

== Safety precautions ==

=== Electro-static Discharge ===
Not all soldering irons are ESD-safe.

Although some manufacturers&#x27; mains-powered models are built with the element shaft (and hence the tip) electrically connected to ground via the iron&#x27;s mains lead, other models&#x27; tips may float at arbitrary voltages unless an additional grounding wire is used.

=== Lead Exposure ===
Melting the solder can release toxic fumes, particularly solder with higher proportions of lead. It is recommended to work in a well-ventilated area; to avoid inhaling the toxic fumes; and to wash hands with soap after operating with a soldering iron. It is also recommended to use lead-free solder to mitigate the risks of lead exposure.

=== High Temperature ===
When operating, the iron can reach temperatures in the range of 200-480°C. Never touch the heating element, since doing so while hot will cause one to contract skin burns. Make sure to switch off the device and hold it on the soldering stand when not in use - placing it directly on the workbench may cause it to make contact and damage the surface and nearby objects. Ensure that the cleaning sponge is wet while in operation.

=== Solder Ejection ===
Sometimes, molten solder can &quot;spit&quot; or spatter, ejecting out from the wire and potentially causing damage to eyes and skin. This is caused by air pockets. Always wear appropriate eye protection, like safety goggles and fireproof clothing (like 100% cotton), covering the arms and legs and wear toe-closed shoes.

<text>A supernova (: supernovae or supernovas) is a powerful and luminous explosion of a star. A supernova occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star, or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. The original object, called the &quot;progenitor&quot;, either collapses to a neutron star or black hole, or is completely destroyed to form a diffuse nebula. The peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months.

The last supernova directly observed in the Milky Way was Kepler&#x27;s Supernova in 1604, appearing not long after Tycho&#x27;s Supernova in 1572, both of which were visible to the naked eye. The remnants of more recent supernovae have been found, and observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the Milky Way on average about three times every century. A supernova in the Milky Way would almost certainly be observable through modern astronomical telescopes. The most recent naked-eye supernova was SN 1987A, which was the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way.

Theoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a white dwarf, or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star&#x27;s core.
* In the re-ignition of a white dwarf, the object&#x27;s temperature is raised enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. Possible causes are an accumulation of material from a binary companion through accretion, or by a stellar merger.
* In the case of a massive star&#x27;s sudden implosion, the core of a massive star will undergo sudden collapse once it is unable to produce sufficient energy from fusion to counteract the star&#x27;s own gravity, which must happen once the star begins fusing iron, but may happen during an earlier stage of metal fusion.

Supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light. This drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium, sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant. Supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium. The expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars. Supernovae are a major source of cosmic rays. They might also produce gravitational waves.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;supernova&quot; has the plural form &quot;supernovae&quot; () or &quot;supernovas&quot; and is often abbreviated as SN or SNe. It is derived from the Latin word , meaning , which refers to what appears to be a temporary new bright star. Adding the prefix &quot;super-&quot; distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae, which are far less luminous. The word &quot;supernova&quot; was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky, who began using it in astrophysics lectures in 1931. Its first use in a journal article came the following year in a publication by Knut Lundmark, who may have coined it independently.

==Observation history==

Compared to a star&#x27;s entire history, the visual appearance of a supernova is very brief, sometimes spanning several months, so that the chances of observing one with the naked eye are roughly once in a lifetime. Only a tiny fraction of the 100 billion stars in a typical galaxy have the capacity to become a supernova, the ability being restricted to those having high mass and those in rare kinds of binary star systems with at least one white dwarf.

===Early discoveries===
The earliest record of a possible supernova, known as HB9, was likely viewed by an unknown prehistoric people of the Indian subcontinent and recorded on a rock carving in the Burzahama region of Kashmir, dated to . Later, SN 185 was documented by Chinese astronomers in 185 AD. The brightest recorded supernova was SN 1006, which was observed in AD 1006 in the constellation of Lupus. This event was described by observers in China, Japan, Iraq, Egypt and Europe. The widely observed supernova SN 1054 produced the Crab Nebula.

Supernovae SN 1572 and SN 1604, the latest Milky Way supernovae to be observed with the naked eye, had a notable influence on the development of astronomy in Europe because they were used to argue against the Aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the Moon and planets was static and unchanging. Johannes Kepler began observing SN 1604 at its peak on 17 October 1604, and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later. It was the second supernova to be observed in a generation, after Tycho Brahe observed SN 1572 in Cassiopeia.

There is some evidence that the youngest known supernova in our galaxy, G1.9+0.3, occurred in the late 19th century, considerably more recently than Cassiopeia A from around 1680. Neither was noted at the time. In the case of G1.9+0.3, high extinction from dust along the plane of the galactic disk could have dimmed the event sufficiently for it to go unnoticed. The situation for Cassiopeia A is less clear; infrared light echoes have been detected showing that it was not in a region of especially high extinction.


===Telescope findings===
With the development of the astronomical telescope, observation and discovery of fainter and more distant supernovae became possible. The first such observation was of SN 1885A in the Andromeda Galaxy. A second supernova, SN 1895B, was discovered in NGC 5253 a decade later. Early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of novae was performed during the 1920s. These were variously called &quot;upper-class Novae&quot;, &quot;Hauptnovae&quot;, or &quot;giant novae&quot;. The name &quot;supernovae&quot; is thought to have been coined by Walter Baade and Zwicky in lectures at Caltech in 1931. It was used, as &quot;super-Novae&quot;, in a journal paper published by Knut Lundmark in 1933, and in a 1934 paper by Baade and Zwicky. By 1938, the hyphen was no longer used and the modern name was in use.

American astronomers Rudolph Minkowski and Fritz Zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in 1941. During the 1960s, astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernovae could be used as standard candles, hence indicators of astronomical distances. Some of the most distant supernovae observed in 2003 appeared dimmer than expected. This supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Techniques were developed for reconstructing supernovae events that have no written records of being observed. The date of the Cassiopeia A supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae, while the age of supernova remnant RX J0852.0-4622 was estimated from temperature measurements and the gamma ray emissions from the radioactive decay of titanium-44.

The most luminous supernova ever recorded is ASASSN-15lh, at a distance of 3.82 gigalight-years. It was first detected in June 2015 and peaked at , which is twice the bolometric luminosity of any other known supernova. The nature of this supernova is debated and several alternative explanations, such as tidal disruption of a star by a black hole, have been suggested.

SN 2013fs was recorded three hours after the supernova event on 6 October 2013, by the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory. This is among the earliest supernovae caught after detonation, and it is the earliest for which spectra have been obtained, beginning six hours after the actual explosion. The star is located in a spiral galaxy named NGC 7610, 160 million light-years away in the constellation of Pegasus.

The supernova SN 2016gkg was detected by amateur astronomer Victor Buso from Rosario, Argentina, on 20 September 2016. It was the first time that the initial &quot;shock breakout&quot; from an optical supernova had been observed. The progenitor star has been identified in Hubble Space Telescope images from before its collapse. Astronomer Alex Filippenko noted: &quot;Observations of stars in the first moments they begin exploding provide information that cannot be directly obtained in any other way.&quot;

===Discovery programs===
Because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy, occurring about three times a century in the Milky Way, obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies. Today, amateur and professional astronomers are finding about two thousand every year, some when near maximum brightness, others on old astronomical photographs or plates. Supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy. Normally, when they are discovered, they are already in progress. To use supernovae as standard candles for measuring distance, observation of their peak luminosity is required. It is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum. Amateur astronomers, who greatly outnumber professional astronomers, have played an important role in finding supernovae, typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs.

Toward the end of the 20th century, astronomers increasingly turned to computer-controlled telescopes and CCDs for hunting supernovae. While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. The Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project uses a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. Neutrinos are subatomic particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.

Supernova searches fall into two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of the expansion of the universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3, where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum&#x27;s frequency shift. 

High redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves. These are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate Hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions. Supernova spectroscopy, used to study the physics and environments of supernovae, is more practical at low than at high redshift. Low redshift observations also anchor the low-distance end of the Hubble curve, which is a plot of distance versus redshift for visible galaxies.

As survey programmes rapidly increase the number of detected supernovae, collated collections of observations (light decay curves, astrometry, pre-supernova observations, spectroscopy) have been assembled. The Pantheon data set, assembled in 2018, detailed 1048 supernovae. In 2021, this data set was expanded to 1701 light curves for 1550 supernovae taken from 18 different surveys, a 50% increase in under 3 years.

==Naming convention==
Supernova discoveries are reported to the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams, which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova. The name is formed from the prefix &quot;SN&quot;, followed by the year of discovery, suffixed with a one or two-letter designation. The first 26 supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;Z&quot;. Next, pairs of lower-case letters are used: &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;ab&quot;, and so on. Hence, for example, &quot;SN 2003C&quot; designates the third supernova reported in the year 2003. The last supernova of 2005, SN 2005nc, was the 367th (14 × 26 + 3 = 367). Since 2000, professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundred supernovae each year (572 in 2007, 261 in 2008, 390 in 2009; 231 in 2013).

Historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred: SN 185, SN 1006, SN 1054, SN 1572 (called &quot;Tycho&#x27;s Nova&quot;) and SN 1604 (&quot;Kepler&#x27;s Star&quot;). Since 1885 the additional letter notation has been used, even if there was only one supernova discovered that year (for example, SN 1885A, SN 1907A, etc.); this last happened with SN 1947A. &quot;SN&quot;, for SuperNova, is a standard prefix. Until 1987, two-letter designations were rarely needed; since 1988, they have been needed every year. Since 2016, the increasing number of discoveries has regularly led to the additional use of three-letter designations. After zz comes aaa, then aab, aac, and so on. For example, the last supernova retained in the Asiago Supernova Catalogue  when it was terminated on 31 December 2017 bears the designation SN 2017jzp.

==Classification==
Astronomers classify supernovae according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra. If a supernova&#x27;s spectrum contains lines of hydrogen (known as the Balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum) it is classified &quot;Type II&quot;; otherwise it is &quot;Type I&quot;. In each of these two types there are subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve (a graph of the supernova&#x27;s apparent magnitude as a function of time).

===Type I===
Type I supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra, with type Ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line. Type I supernovae without this strong line are classified as type Ib and Ic, with type Ib showing strong neutral helium lines and type Ic lacking them. Historically, the light curves of type I supernovae were seen as all broadly similar, too much so to make useful distinctions. While variations in light curves have been studied, classification continues to be made on spectral grounds rather than light-curve shape.

A small number of type Ia supernovae exhibit unusual features, such as non-standard luminosity or broadened light curves, and these are typically categorised by referring to the earliest example showing similar features. For example, the sub-luminous SN 2008ha is often referred to as SN 2002cx-like or class Ia-2002cx.

A small proportion of type Ic supernovae show highly broadened and blended emission lines which are taken to indicate very high expansion velocities for the ejecta. These have been classified as type Ic-BL or Ic-bl.

Calcium-rich supernovae are a rare type of very fast supernova with unusually strong calcium lines in their spectra. Models suggest they occur when material is accreted from a helium-rich companion rather than a hydrogen-rich star. Because of helium lines in their spectra, they can resemble type Ib supernovae, but are thought to have very different progenitors.

===Type II===

The supernovae of type II can also be sub-divided based on their spectra. While most type II supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second, some, such as SN 2005gl, have relatively narrow features in their spectra. These are called type IIn, where the &quot;n&quot; stands for &quot;narrow&quot;.

A few supernovae, such as SN 1987K and SN 1993J, appear to change types: they show lines of hydrogen at early times, but, over a period of weeks to months, become dominated by lines of helium. The term &quot;type IIb&quot; is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with types II and Ib.

Type II supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves. The most common type shows a distinctive &quot;plateau&quot; in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes. These are called type II-P referring to the plateau. Less common are type II-L supernovae that lack a distinct plateau. The &quot;L&quot; signifies &quot;linear&quot; although the light curve is not actually a straight line.

Supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated peculiar, or &quot;pec&quot;.

===Types III, IV and V===
Zwicky defined additional supernovae types based on a very few examples that did not cleanly fit the parameters for type I or type II supernovae. SN 1961i in NGC 4303 was the prototype and only member of the type III supernova class, noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen Balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum. SN 1961f in NGC 3003 was the prototype and only member of the type IV class, with a light curve similar to a type II-P supernova, with hydrogen absorption lines but weak hydrogen emission lines. The type V class was coined for SN 1961V in NGC 1058, an unusual faint supernova or supernova impostor with a slow rise to brightness, a maximum lasting many months, and an unusual emission spectrum. The similarity of SN 1961V to the Eta Carinae Great Outburst was noted. Supernovae in M101 (1909) and M83 (1923 and 1957) were also suggested as possible type IV or type V supernovae.

These types would now all be treated as peculiar type II supernovae (IIpec), of which many more examples have been discovered, although it is still debated whether SN 1961V was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an impostor.

==Current models==
Supernova type codes, as summarised in the table above, are &quot;taxonomic&quot;: the type number is based on the light observed from the supernova, not necessarily its cause. For example, type Ia supernovae are produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors, while the spectrally similar type Ib/c are produced from massive stripped progenitor stars by core collapse.

===Thermal runaway===
A white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorised to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites the core. The dominant mechanism by which type Ia supernovae are produced remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how type Ia supernovae are produced, type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high redshift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.

====Normal type Ia====
There are several means by which a supernova of this type can form, but they share a common underlying mechanism. If a carbon-oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.44 solar masses (for a non-rotating star), it would no longer be able to support the bulk of its mass through electron degeneracy pressure and would begin to collapse. However, the current view is that this limit is not normally attained; increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit (to within about 1%) before collapse is initiated. In contrast, for a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf will typically form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of the star&#x27;s mass will be ejected during the collapse.
Within a few seconds of the collapse process, a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion, releasing enough energy (1–) to unbind the star in a supernova. An outwardly expanding shock wave is generated, with matter reaching velocities on the order of 5,000–20,000 km/s, or roughly 3% of the speed of light. There is also a significant increase in luminosity, reaching an absolute magnitude of −19.3 (or 5 billion times brighter than the Sun), with little variation.

The model for the formation of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a red giant. The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion. At this point, it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. Eventually, the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant. Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass. The exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event remain unclear.

Type Ia supernovae produce a characteristic light curve—the graph of luminosity as a function of time—after the event. This luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel-56 through cobalt-56 to iron-56. The peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal type Ia supernovae, having a maximum absolute magnitude of about −19.3. This is because typical type Ia supernovae arise from a consistent type of progenitor star by gradual mass acquisition, and explode when they acquire a consistent typical mass, giving rise to very similar supernova conditions and behaviour. This allows them to be used as a secondary standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies.

A second model for the formation of type Ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars, with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. This is sometimes referred to as the double-degenerate model, as both stars are degenerate white dwarfs. Due to the possible combinations of mass and chemical composition of the pair there is much variation in this type of event, and, in many cases, there may be no supernova at all, in which case they will have a less luminous light curve than the more normal SN type Ia.

====Non-standard type Ia====
Abnormally bright type Ia supernovae occur when the white dwarf already has a mass higher than the Chandrasekhar limit, possibly enhanced further by asymmetry, but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy. This super-Chandrasekhar-mass scenario can occur, for example, when the extra mass is supported by differential rotation.

There is no formal sub-classification for non-standard type Ia supernovae. It has been proposed that a group of sub-luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as type Iax. This type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star.

One specific type of supernova originates from exploding white dwarfs, like type Ia, but contains hydrogen lines in their spectra, possibly because the white dwarf is surrounded by an envelope of hydrogen-rich circumstellar material. These supernovae have been dubbed type Ia/IIn, type Ian, type IIa and type IIan.

The quadruple star HD 74438, belonging to the open cluster IC 2391 the Vela constellation, has been predicted to become a non-standard type Ia supernova.

===Core collapse===

Very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity; passing this threshold is the cause of all types of supernova except type Ia. The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova. However, if the release of gravitational potential energy is insufficient, the star may instead collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy.

Core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms: exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit; electron capture; pair-instability; or photodisintegration.
* When a massive star develops an iron core larger than the Chandrasekhar mass it will no longer be able to support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole.
* Electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate O/Ne/Mg core (8–10 solar mass progenitor star) removes support and causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion, with very similar results.
* Electron-positron pair production in a large post-helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion, resulting in a pair-instability supernova.
* A sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma-rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly, which will cause a complete collapse of the core.

The table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars, the types of stars in which they occur, their associated supernova type, and the remnant produced. The metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium, as compared to the Sun. The initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event, given in multiples of the Sun&#x27;s mass, although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much lower.

Type IIn supernovae are not listed in the table. They can be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars, possibly even by type Ia white dwarf ignitions, although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants (including LBVs). The narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material. It appears that a significant proportion of supposed type IIn supernovae are supernova impostors, massive eruptions of LBV-like stars similar to the Great Eruption of Eta Carinae. In these events, material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material.

====Detailed process====
When a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity, it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching 70,000 km/s (0.23&quot;c&quot;), resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density. What follows depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core, with low-mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars, higher-mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes, and non-degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion.

The initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay, photodisintegration and electron capture, which causes a burst of electron neutrinos. As the density increases, neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core. The inner core eventually reaches typically 30 km in diameter with a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus, and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse. If the core mass is more than about 15 solar masses then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova.

In lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about 100 billion kelvin, 6,000 times the temperature of the Sun&#x27;s core. At this temperature, neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavours are efficiently formed by thermal emission. These thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron-capture neutrinos. About 1046 joules, approximately 10% of the star&#x27;s rest mass, is converted into a ten-second burst of neutrinos, which is the main output of the event. The suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls in the outer core within milliseconds as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements. A process that is is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around 1044 joules (1 foe) from the neutrino pulse, producing the visible brightness, although there are other theories that could power the explosion.

Some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star, and, for cores beyond about , there is sufficient fallback to form a black hole. This fallback will reduce the kinetic energy created and the mass of expelled radioactive material, but in some situations, it may also generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma-ray burst or an exceptionally luminous supernova.

The collapse of a massive non-degenerate core will ignite further fusion. When the core collapse is initiated by pair instability (photons turning into electron-positron pairs, thereby reducing the radiation pressure) oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may be halted. For core masses of , the collapse halts and the star remains intact, but collapse will occur again when a larger core has formed. For cores of around , the fusion of oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is disrupted, causing a supernova. At the upper end of the mass range, the supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long-lived due to many solar masses of ejected 56Ni. For even larger core masses, the core temperature becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into a black hole.

====Type II====
Stars with initial masses less than about never develop a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs. Stars with at least (possibly as much as ) evolve in a complex fashion, progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores. The star becomes layered like an onion, with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in larger shells. Although popularly described as an onion with an iron core, the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen-neon(-magnesium) cores. These super-AGB stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae, although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors.

If core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a hydrogen envelope, the result is a type II supernova. The rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity. Extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a supernova of type II. At low metallicity, all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova.

Stars with an initial mass up to about 90 times the Sun, or a little less at high metallicity, result in a type II-P supernova, which is the most commonly observed type. At moderate to high metallicity, stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a type II-L supernova. At very low metallicity, stars of around will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with type II characteristics but a very large mass of ejected 56Ni and high luminosity.

====Type Ib and Ic====

These supernovae, like those of type II, are massive stars that undergo core collapse. Unlike the progenitors of type II supernovae, the stars which become types Ib and Ic supernovae have lost most of their outer (hydrogen) envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion. These stars are known as Wolf–Rayet stars, and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass-loss rates. Observations of type Ib/c supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of Wolf–Rayet stars. Alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions. Binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae, with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed.

Type Ib supernovae are the more common and result from Wolf–Rayet stars of type WC which still have helium in their atmospheres. For a narrow range of masses, stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become WO stars with very little helium remaining, and these are the progenitors of type Ic supernovae.

A few percent of the type Ic supernovae are associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB), though it is also believed that any hydrogen-stripped type Ib or Ic supernova could produce a GRB, depending on the circumstances of the geometry. The mechanism for producing this type of GRB is the jets produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at the collapsing core of the star. The jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell, producing a super-luminous supernova.

Ultra-stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped (almost) all the way to the metal core, via mass transfer in a close binary. As a result, very little material is ejected from the exploding star (c. ). In the most extreme cases, ultra-stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores, barely above the Chandrasekhar mass limit. SN 2005ek might be the first observational example of an ultra-stripped supernova, giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve. The nature of ultra-stripped supernovae can be both iron core-collapse and electron capture supernovae, depending on the mass of the collapsing core. Ultra-stripped supernovae are believed to be associated with the second supernova explosion in a binary system, producing for example a tight double neutron star system.

In 2022 a team of astronomers led by researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science reported the first supernova explosion showing direct evidence for a Wolf-Rayet progenitor star. SN 2019hgp was a type Icn supernova and is also the first in which the element neon has been detected.

==== Electron-capture supernovae ====
In 1980, a &quot;third type&quot; of supernova was predicted by Ken&#x27;ichi Nomoto of the University of Tokyo, called an electron-capture supernova. It would arise when a star &quot;in the transitional range (~8 to 10 solar masses) between white dwarf formation and iron core-collapse supernovae&quot;, and with a degenerate O+Ne+Mg core, imploded after its core ran out of nuclear fuel, causing gravity to compress the electrons in the star&#x27;s core into their atomic nuclei, leading to a supernova explosion and leaving behind a neutron star. In June 2021, a paper in the journal &quot;Nature Astronomy&quot; reported that the 2018 supernova SN 2018zd (in the galaxy NGC 2146, about 31 million light-years from Earth) appeared to be the first observation of an electron-capture supernova. The 1054 supernova explosion that created the Crab Nebula in our galaxy had been thought to be the best candidate for an electron-capture supernova, and the 2021 paper makes it more likely that this was correct.

===Failed supernovae===

The core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible supernova. This happens if the initial core collapse cannot be reversed by the mechanism that produces an explosion, usually because the core is too massive. These events are difficult to detect, but large surveys have detected possible candidates. The red supergiant N6946-BH1 in NGC 6946 underwent a modest outburst in March 2009, before fading from view. Only a faint infrared source remains at the star&#x27;s location.

===Light curves===

The ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep them hot. The source of this energy—which can maintain the optical supernova glow for months—was, at first, a puzzle. Some considered rotational energy from the central pulsar as a source. Although the energy that initially powers each type of supernovae is delivered promptly, the light curves are dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta. The intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late 1960s, and this has since been demonstrated as correct for most supernovae. It was not until SN 1987A that direct observation of gamma-ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei.

It is now known by direct observation that much of the light curve (the graph of luminosity as a function of time) after the occurrence of a type II Supernova, such as SN 1987A, is explained by those predicted radioactive decays. Although the luminous emission consists of optical photons, it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light. The radioactive decay of 56Ni through its daughters 56Co to 56Fe produces gamma-ray photons, primarily with energies of and , that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times (several weeks) to late times (several months). Energy for the peak of the light curve of SN1987A was provided by the decay of 56Ni to 56Co (half-life 6 days) while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the 77.3-day half-life of 56Co decaying to 56Fe. Later measurements by space gamma-ray telescopes of the small fraction of the 56Co and 57Co gamma rays that escaped the SN 1987A remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources.
The late-time decay phase of visual light curves for different supernova types all depend on radioactive heating, but they vary in shape and amplitude because of the underlying mechanisms, the way that visible radiation is produced, the epoch of its observation, and the transparency of the ejected material. The light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths. For example, at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial event, but that breakout is hardly detectable optically.

The light curves for type Ia are mostly very uniform, with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity. Their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of ejected nickel-56 (half-life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half-life 77 days). These radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence. Modern studies of cosmology rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of type Ia, which are the &quot;standard candles&quot; of cosmology but whose diagnostic and gamma rays were first detected only in 2014. The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted. The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half-life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation. After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission from the remaining cobalt-56 becomes dominant, although this portion of the light curve has been little-studied.

Type Ib and Ic light curves are similar to type Ia although with a lower average peak luminosity. The visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation, but there is a much lower mass of the created nickel-56. The peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type Ib/c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm. The most luminous type Ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity. The source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole, which also produce gamma-ray bursts.

The light curves for type II supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type I, on the order of 0.05 magnitudes per day, excluding the plateau phase. The visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months, due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star. In the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised. The majority of type II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines, emitting visible light and becoming more transparent. This is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type I supernovae, due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen.

In type II-L the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere, sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output. In type IIb supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted (thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star) that the light curve is closer to a type I supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks.

Type IIn supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material. Their light curves are generally very broad and extended, occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a superluminous supernova. These light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material. This only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact, indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs.

Large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models. Average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy, but can broadly be specified for each supernova type.

Notes:
===Asymmetry===

A long-standing puzzle surrounding type II supernovae is why the remaining compact object receives a large velocity away from the epicentre; pulsars, and thus neutron stars, are observed to have high peculiar velocities, and black holes presumably do as well, although they are far harder to observe in isolation. The initial impetus can be substantial, propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of 500 km/s or greater. This indicates an expansion asymmetry, but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object a puzzle. Proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing star, asymmetric ejection of matter during neutron star formation, and asymmetrical neutrino emissions.

One possible explanation for this asymmetry is large-scale convection above the core. The convection can create radial variations in density giving rise to variations in the amount of energy absorbed from neutrino outflow. However analysis of this mechanism predicts only modest momentum transfer. Another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets, propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star, and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star. These jets might play a crucial role in the resulting supernova. (A similar model is used for explaining long gamma-ray bursts.) The dominant mechanism may depend upon the mass of the progenitor star.

Initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in type Ia supernovae through observation. This result may mean that the initial luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle. However, the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time. Early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarisation of the emitted light.

===Energy output===

Although supernovae are primarily known as luminous events, the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side-effect. Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total energy released during the event.

There is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova. In type Ia white dwarf detonations, most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta. In core collapse supernovae, the vast majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission, and while some of this apparently powers the observed destruction, 99%+ of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse.

Standard type Ia supernovae derive their energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. The details of the energetics are still not fully understood, but the result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy. Around half a solar mass of that mass is 56Ni generated from silicon burning. 56Ni is radioactive and decays into 56Co by beta plus decay (with a half life of six days) and gamma rays. 56Co itself decays by the beta plus (positron) path with a half life of 77 days into stable 56Fe. These two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type Ia supernovae. In combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material, they produce the rapidly declining light curve.

Core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type Ia supernovae, but the total energy released is far higher, as outlined in the following table.

In some core collapse supernovae, fallback onto a black hole drives relativistic jets which may produce a brief energetic and directional burst of gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected material. This is one scenario for producing high-luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type Ic hypernovae and long-duration gamma-ray bursts. If the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub-luminous.

When a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material, it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation. Even though the initial energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay. This type of event may cause type IIn hypernovae.

Although pair-instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type II-P, the nature after core collapse is more like that of a giant type Ia with runaway fusion of carbon, oxygen and silicon. The total energy released by the highest-mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low, hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy released is very high. The cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected from their cores can be orders of magnitude higher, with consequently high visual luminosity.

===Progenitor===

The supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of progenitor star at the time of the collapse. The occurrence of each type of supernova depends on the star&#x27;s metallicity, since this affects the strength of the stellar wind and thereby the rate at which the star loses mass.

Type Ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary star systems and occur in all galaxy types. Core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation, since they result from short-lived massive stars. They are most commonly found in type Sc spirals, but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular galaxies, especially starburst galaxies.

Type Ib and Ic supernovae are hypothesised to have been produced by core collapse of massive stars that have lost their outer layer of hydrogen and helium, either via strong stellar winds or mass transfer to a companion. They normally occur in regions of new star formation, and are extremely rare in elliptical galaxies. The progenitors of type IIn supernovae also have high rates of mass loss in the period just prior to their explosions. Type Ic supernovae have been observed to occur in regions that are more metal-rich and have higher star-formation rates than average for their host galaxies. The table shows the progenitor for the main types of core collapse supernova, and the approximate proportions that have been observed in the local neighbourhood.

There are a number of difficulties reconciling modelled and observed stellar evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae. Red supergiants are the progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae, and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities, below about and , respectively. Most progenitors of type II supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter, and presumably less massive. This discrepancy has been referred to as the red supergiant problem. It was first described in 2009 by Stephen Smartt, who also coined the term. After performing a volume-limited search for supernovae, Smartt et al. found the lower and upper mass limits for type II-P supernovae to form to be and , respectively. The former is consistent with the expected upper mass limits for white dwarf progenitors to form, but the latter is not consistent with massive star populations in the Local Group. The upper limit for red supergiants that produce a visible supernova explosion has been calculated at .

It is thought that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae, but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures. Several progenitors of type IIb supernovae have been confirmed, and these were K and G supergiants, plus one A supergiant. Yellow hypergiants or LBVs are proposed progenitors for type IIb supernovae, and almost all type IIb supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors.

Blue supergiants form an unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors, partly due to their high luminosity and easy detection, while not a single Wolf–Rayet progenitor has yet been clearly identified. Models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova without progressing to a different evolutionary stage. One study has shown a possible route for low-luminosity post-red supergiant luminous blue variables to collapse, most likely as a type IIn supernova. Several examples of hot luminous progenitors of type IIn supernovae have been detected: SN 2005gy and SN 2010jl were both apparently massive luminous stars, but are very distant; and SN 2009ip had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been an LBV, but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disputed.

The progenitors of type Ib/c supernovae are not observed at all, and constraints on their possible luminosity are often lower than those of known WC stars. WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint, so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed. Very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified, despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged. Population modelling shows that the observed type Ib/c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped-envelope stars from interacting binary systems. The continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal type Ib and Ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst. Most of these supernovae are then produced from lower-mass low-luminosity helium stars in binary systems. A small number would be from rapidly rotating massive stars, likely corresponding to the highly energetic type Ic-BL events that are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts.

==External impact==
Supernovae events generate heavier elements that are scattered throughout the surrounding interstellar medium. The expanding shock wave from a supernova can trigger star formation. Galactic cosmic rays are generated by supernova explosions.

===Source of heavy elements===

Supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen through to rubidium, though the theoretical abundances of the elements produced or seen in the spectra varies significantly depending on the various supernova types. Type Ia supernovae produce mainly silicon and iron-peak elements, metals such as nickel and iron. Core collapse supernovae eject much smaller quantities of the iron-peak elements than type Ia supernovae, but larger masses of light alpha elements such as oxygen and neon, and elements heavier than zinc. The latter is especially true with electron capture supernovae. The bulk of the material ejected by type II supernovae is hydrogen and helium. The heavy elements are produced by: nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S; silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni; and rapid capture of neutrons (r-process) during the supernova&#x27;s collapse for elements heavier than iron. The r-process produces highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. In supernovae, r-process reactions are responsible for about half of all the isotopes of elements beyond iron, although neutron star mergers may be the main astrophysical source for many of these elements.

In the modern universe, old asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are the dominant source of dust from oxides, carbon and s-process elements. However, in the early universe, before AGB stars formed, supernovae may have been the main source of dust.

===Role in stellar evolution===

Remnants of many supernovae consist of a compact object and a rapidly expanding shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last for up to two centuries. The wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000 years.
The Big Bang produced hydrogen, helium and traces of lithium, while all heavier elements are synthesised in stars, supernovae, and collisions between neutron stars (thus being indirectly due to supernovae). Supernovae tend to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with elements other than hydrogen and helium, which usually astronomers refer to as &quot;metals&quot;. These ejected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation. Thus, each stellar generation has a slightly different composition, going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal-rich composition. Supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements, which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion. The different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star&#x27;s life, and may influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it: more giant planets form around stars of higher metallicity.

The kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation by compressing nearby, dense molecular clouds in space. The increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud is unable to lose the excess energy.

Evidence from daughter products of short-lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago, and may even have triggered the formation of this system.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are intense, transient pulses of radio waves that typically last no more than milliseconds. Many explanations for these events have been proposed; magnetars produced by core-collapse supernovae are leading candidates.

===Cosmic rays===
Supernova remnants are thought to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays, but direct evidence for cosmic ray production has only been found in a small number of remnants. Gamma rays from pion-decay have been detected from the supernova remnants IC 443 and W44. These are produced when accelerated protons from the remnant impact on interstellar material.

===Gravitational waves===
Supernovae are potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves, but none have so far been detected. The only gravitational wave events so far detected are from mergers of black holes and neutron stars, probable remnants of supernovae. Like the neutrino emissions, the gravitational waves produced by a core-collapse supernova are expected to arrive without the delay that affects light. Consequently, they may provide information about the core-collapse process that is unavailable by other means. Most gravitational-wave signals predicted by supernova models are short in duration, lasting less than a second, and thus difficult to detect. Using the arrival of a neutrino signal may provide a trigger that can identify the time window in which to seek the gravitational wave, helping to distinguish the latter from background noise.

===Effect on Earth===

A near-Earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the Earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere. Depending upon the type and energy of the supernova, it could be as far as 3,000 light-years away.
In 1996 it was theorised that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on Earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata. Iron-60 enrichment was later reported in deep-sea rock of the Pacific Ocean. In 2009, elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in Antarctic ice, which coincided with the 1006 and 1054 supernovae. Gamma rays from these supernovae could have boosted atmospheric levels of nitrogen oxides, which became trapped in the ice.

Historically, nearby supernovae may have influenced the biodiversity of life on the planet. Geological records suggest that nearby supernova events have led to an increase in cosmic rays, which in turn produced a cooler climate. A greater temperature difference between the poles and the equator created stronger winds, increased ocean mixing, and resulted in the transport of nutrients to shallow waters along the continental shelves. This led to greater biodiversity.

Type Ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the Earth. Because these supernovae arise from dim, common white dwarf stars in binary systems, it is likely that a supernova that can affect the Earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied. The closest-known candidate is IK Pegasi (HR 8210), about 150 light-years away, but observations suggest it could be as long as 1.9 billion years before the white dwarf can accrete the critical mass required to become a type Ia supernova. 

According to a 2003 estimate, a type II supernova would have to be closer than to destroy half of the Earth&#x27;s ozone layer, and there are no such candidates closer than about 500 light-years.

==Milky Way candidates==

The next supernova in the Milky Way will likely be detectable even if it occurs on the far side of the galaxy. It is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant, and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as 2MASS. There is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant, luminous blue variable, or Wolf–Rayet. The chances of the next supernova being a type Ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova. Again it should be observable wherever it occurs, but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed. It is not even known exactly what a type Ia progenitor system looks like, and it is difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs. The total supernova rate in the Milky Way is estimated to be between 2 and 12 per century, although one has not actually been observed for several centuries.

Statistically, the most common variety of core-collapse supernova is type II-P, and the progenitors of this type are red supergiants. It is difficult to identify which of those supergiants are in the final stages of heavy element fusion in their cores and which have millions of years left. The most-massive red supergiants shed their atmospheres and evolve to Wolf–Rayet stars before their cores collapse. All Wolf–Rayet stars end their lives from the Wolf–Rayet phase within a million years or so, but again it is difficult to identify those that are closest to core collapse. One class that is expected to have no more than a few thousand years before exploding are the WO Wolf–Rayet stars, which are known to have exhausted their core helium. Only eight of them are known, and only four of those are in the Milky Way.

A number of close or well-known stars have been identified as possible core collapse supernova candidates: the high-mass blue stars Spica and Rigel, the red supergiants Betelgeuse, Antares, and VV Cephei A; the yellow hypergiant Rho Cassiopeiae; the luminous blue variable Eta Carinae that has already produced a supernova impostor; and both components, a blue supergiant and a Wolf–Rayet star, of the Regor or Gamma Velorum system. Mimosa and Acrux, two bright star systems in the southern constellation of Crux, each contain blue stars with sufficient masses to explode as supernovae. Others have gained notoriety as possible, although not very likely, progenitors for a gamma-ray burst; for example WR 104.

Identification of candidates for a type Ia supernova is much more speculative. Any binary with an accreting white dwarf might produce a supernova although the exact mechanism and timescale is still debated. These systems are faint and difficult to identify, but the novae and recurrent novae are such systems that conveniently advertise themselves. One example is U Scorpii.

<text>Sergei Sergeyevich Prokofiev ( – 5 March 1953) was a Russian composer, pianist, and conductor who later worked in the Soviet Union. As the creator of acknowledged masterpieces across numerous music genres, he is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century. His works include such widely heard pieces as the March from &quot;The Love for Three Oranges,&quot; the suite &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot;, the ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;—from which &quot;Dance of the Knights&quot; is taken—and &quot;Peter and the Wolf.&quot; Of the established forms and genres in which he worked, he created—excluding juvenilia—seven completed operas, seven symphonies, eight ballets, five piano concertos, two violin concertos, a cello concerto, a symphony-concerto for cello and orchestra, and nine completed piano sonatas.

A graduate of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, Prokofiev initially made his name as an iconoclastic composer-pianist, achieving notoriety with a series of ferociously dissonant and virtuosic works for his instrument, including his first two piano concertos. In 1915, Prokofiev made a decisive break from the standard composer-pianist category with his orchestral &quot;Scythian Suite&quot;, compiled from music originally composed for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes. Diaghilev commissioned three further ballets from Prokofiev—&quot;Chout,&quot; &quot;Le pas d&#x27;acier&quot; and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;—which, at the time of their original production, all caused a sensation among both critics and colleagues. But Prokofiev&#x27;s greatest interest was opera, and he composed several works in that genre, including &quot;The Gambler&quot; and &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;. Prokofiev&#x27;s one operatic success during his lifetime was &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;, composed for the Chicago Opera and performed over the following decade in Europe and Russia.

After the Revolution of 1917, Prokofiev left Russia with the approval of Soviet People&#x27;s Commissar Anatoly Lunacharsky, and resided in the United States, then Germany, then Paris, making his living as a composer, pianist and conductor. In 1923 he married a Spanish singer, Carolina (Lina) Codina, with whom he had two sons; they divorced in 1947. In the early 1930s, the Great Depression diminished opportunities for Prokofiev&#x27;s ballets and operas to be staged in America and Western Europe. Prokofiev, who regarded himself as a composer foremost, resented the time taken by touring as a pianist, and increasingly turned to the Soviet Union for commissions of new music; in 1936, he finally returned to his homeland with his family. His greatest Soviet successes included &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot;, &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies, &quot;On Guard for Peace&quot;, and the Piano Sonatas Nos. 6–8.

The Nazi invasion of the USSR spurred Prokofiev to compose his most ambitious work, an operatic version of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;; he co-wrote the libretto with Mira Mendelson, his longtime companion and later second wife. In 1948, Prokofiev was attacked for producing &quot;anti-democratic formalism&quot;. Nevertheless, he enjoyed personal and artistic support from a new generation of Russian performers, notably Sviatoslav Richter and Mstislav Rostropovich: he wrote his Ninth Piano Sonata for the former and his Symphony-Concerto for the latter.
==Life and career==
=== Childhood and first compositions ===

Prokofiev was born in 1891 in a rural estate in Sontsovka, Bakhmut uezd, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (now known as Sontsivka, Pokrovsk Raion, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine). His father, Sergei Alekseyevich Prokofiev, was an agronomist from a mercantile family in Moscow. Prokofiev&#x27;s mother, Maria (née Zhitkova), came from a Saint Petersburg family of former serfs who had been owned by the Sheremetev family, under whose patronage serf-children were taught theatre and arts from an early age. She was described by Reinhold Glière, Prokofiev&#x27;s first composition teacher, as &quot;a tall woman with beautiful, clever eyes … who knew how to create an atmosphere of warmth and simplicity about her.&quot; After their wedding in the summer of 1877, the Prokofievs moved to a small estate in the Smolensk governorate. Eventually, Sergei Alekseyevich found employment as a soil engineer, employed by one of his former fellow-students, Dmitri Sontsov, to whose estate in the Ukrainian steppes the Prokofievs moved.

By the time of Prokofiev&#x27;s birth, Maria—having previously lost two daughters—had devoted her life to music; during her son&#x27;s early childhood, she spent two months a year in Moscow or St Petersburg taking piano lessons. Sergei Prokofiev was inspired by hearing his mother practicing the piano in the evenings, mostly works by Chopin and Beethoven, and wrote his first piano composition at the age of five, an &quot;Indian Gallop&quot;, which was written down by his mother: it was in the F Lydian mode (a major scale with a raised 4th scale degree), as the young Prokofiev felt &quot;reluctance to tackle the black notes&quot;. By seven, he had also learned to play chess. Chess remained a passion of his, and he became acquainted with world chess champions José Raúl Capablanca, whom he beat in a simultaneous exhibition match in 1914, and Mikhail Botvinnik, with whom he played several matches in the 1930s. At age nine, he was composing his first opera, &quot;The Giant&quot;, as well as an overture and various other pieces. Opera remained thereafter as the genre Prokofiev was most fond of working in.

=== Education and early works ===
In 1902, Prokofiev&#x27;s mother met Sergei Taneyev, director of the Moscow Conservatory, who initially suggested that Prokofiev should start lessons in piano and composition with Alexander Goldenweiser. Unable to arrange that, Taneyev instead arranged for composer and pianist Reinhold Glière to spend the summer of 1902 in Sontsovka teaching Prokofiev. The first series of lessons culminated, at the 11-year-old Prokofiev&#x27;s insistence, with the budding composer making his first attempt to write a symphony. The following summer, Glière revisited Sontsovka to give further tuition. When, decades later, Prokofiev wrote about his lessons with Glière, he gave due credit to his teacher&#x27;s sympathetic method but complained that Glière had introduced him to &quot;square&quot; phrase structure and conventional modulations, which he subsequently had to unlearn. Nonetheless, equipped with the necessary theoretical tools, Prokofiev started experimenting with dissonant harmonies and unusual time signatures in a series of short piano pieces he called &quot;ditties&quot; (after the so-called &quot;song form&quot;, more accurately ternary form, on which they were based), laying the basis for his own musical style.

Despite his growing talent, Prokofiev&#x27;s parents hesitated over starting their son on a musical career at such an early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, a professor at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, who asked to see Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, &quot;Desert Islands&quot; and &quot;The Feast during the Plague&quot;, and was working on his fourth, &quot;Undina&quot;. Glazunov was so impressed that he urged Prokofiev&#x27;s mother to have her son apply for admission to the Conservatory. He passed the introductory tests and enrolled that year.

Several years younger than most of his class, Prokofiev was viewed as eccentric and arrogant and annoyed a number of his classmates by keeping statistics on their errors. During that period, he studied under, among others, Alexander Winkler for piano, Anatoly Lyadov for harmony and counterpoint, Nikolai Tcherepnin for conducting, and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for orchestration (though when Rimsky-Korsakov died in 1908, Prokofiev noted that he had only studied with him &quot;after a fashion&quot;—he was just one of many students in a heavily attended class—and regretted that he otherwise &quot;never had the opportunity to study with him&quot;). He also shared classes with the composers Boris Asafyev and Nikolai Myaskovsky, the latter becoming a close and lifelong friend.

As a member of the Saint Petersburg music scene, Prokofiev developed a reputation as a musical rebel, while getting praise for his original compositions, which he performed himself on the piano. In 1909, he graduated from his class in composition with unimpressive marks. He continued at the Conservatory, studying piano under Anna Yesipova and continuing his conducting lessons under Tcherepnin.

In 1910, Prokofiev&#x27;s father died and Sergei&#x27;s financial support ceased. Fortunately, he had started making a name for himself as a composer and pianist outside the Conservatory, making appearances at the St Petersburg Evenings of Contemporary Music. There he performed several of his more adventurous piano works, such as his highly chromatic and dissonant Etudes, Op. 2 (1909). His performance of it impressed the organisers of the Evenings sufficiently for them to invite Prokofiev to give the Russian premiere of Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s Drei Klavierstücke, Op. 11. Prokofiev&#x27;s harmonic experimentation continued with &quot;Sarcasms&quot; for piano, Op. 17 (1912), which makes extensive use of polytonality. He composed his first two piano concertos around then, the latter of which caused a scandal at its premiere (23 August 1913, Pavlovsk). According to one account, the audience left the hall with exclamations of &quot;&#x27;To hell with this futuristic music! The cats on the roof make better music!&#x27;&quot;, but the modernists were in rapture.

In 1911, help arrived from renowned Russian musicologist and critic Alexander Ossovsky, who wrote a supportive letter to music publisher Boris P. Jurgenson (son of publishing-firm founder Peter Jurgenson [1836–1904]); thus a contract was offered to the composer. Prokofiev made his first foreign trip in 1913, travelling to Paris and London where he first encountered Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes.

=== First ballets ===

In 1914, Prokofiev finished his career at the Conservatory by entering the &#x27;battle of the pianos&#x27;, a competition open to the five best piano students for which the prize was a Schroeder grand piano; Prokofiev won by performing his own Piano Concerto No. 1.

Soon afterwards, he journeyed to London where he made contact with the impresario Sergei Diaghilev. Diaghilev commissioned Prokofiev&#x27;s first ballet, &quot;Ala and Lolli&quot;; but when Prokofiev brought the work in progress to him in Italy in 1915 he rejected it as &quot;non-Russian&quot;. Urging Prokofiev to write &quot;music that was national in character&quot;, Diaghilev then commissioned the ballet &quot;Chout&quot; (&quot;The Buffoon&quot;). (The original Russian-language full title was Сказка про шута, семерых шутов перешутившего, meaning &quot;The Tale of the Buffoon who Outwits Seven Other Buffoons&quot;.) Under Diaghilev&#x27;s guidance, Prokofiev chose his subject from a collection of folk tales by the ethnographer Alexander Afanasyev; the story, concerning a buffoon and a series of confidence tricks, had been previously suggested to Diaghilev by Igor Stravinsky as a possible subject for a ballet, and Diaghilev and his choreographer Léonide Massine helped Prokofiev to shape it into a ballet scenario. Prokofiev&#x27;s inexperience with ballet led him to revise the work extensively in the 1920s, following Diaghilev&#x27;s detailed critique, prior to its first production.

The ballet&#x27;s premiere in Paris on 17 May 1921 was a huge success and was greeted with great admiration by an audience that included Jean Cocteau, Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel. Stravinsky called the ballet &quot;the single piece of modern music he could listen to with pleasure&quot;, while Ravel called it &quot;a work of genius&quot;.

=== First World War and Revolution ===

During World War I, Prokofiev returned to the Conservatory and studied organ to avoid conscription. In 1916, he debuted his &quot;Toccata&quot;. Shortly after this he composed &quot;The Gambler&quot; based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky&#x27;s novel of the same name, but rehearsals were plagued by problems, and the scheduled 1917 première had to be cancelled because of the February Revolution. In the summer of that year, Prokofiev composed his first symphony, the &quot;Classical&quot;. The name was Prokofiev&#x27;s own; the music is in a style that, according to Prokofiev, Joseph Haydn would have used if he were alive at the time. The music is more or less Classical in style but incorporates more modern musical elements (see Neoclassicism).

The symphony was also an exact contemporary of Prokofiev&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 19, which was scheduled to premiere in November 1917. The first performances of both works had to wait until 21 April 1918 and 18 October 1923, respectively. Prokofiev stayed briefly with his mother in Kislovodsk in the Caucasus.

After completing the score of &quot;Seven, They Are Seven&quot;, a &quot;Chaldean invocation&quot; for chorus and orchestra, Prokofiev was &quot;left with nothing to do and time hung heavily on my hands&quot;. Believing that Russia &quot;had no use for music at the moment&quot;, Prokofiev decided to try his fortunes in America until the turmoil in his homeland had passed. He set out for Moscow and Petersburg in March 1918 to sort out financial matters and to arrange for his passport. In May, he headed for the US, having obtained official permission to do so from Anatoly Lunacharsky, the People&#x27;s Commissar for Education, who told him: &quot;You are a revolutionary in music, we are revolutionaries in life. We ought to work together. But if you want to go to America I shall not stand in your way.&quot;

=== Life abroad ===
Arriving in San Francisco after having been released from questioning by immigration officials on Angel Island on 11 August 1918, Prokofiev was soon compared to other famous Russian exiles, such as Sergei Rachmaninoff. His debut solo concert in New York led to several further engagements. He also received a contract from the music director of the Chicago Opera Association, Cleofonte Campanini, for the production of his new opera &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;, but due to Campanini&#x27;s illness and death, the premiere was postponed. The delay was another example of Prokofiev&#x27;s bad luck in operatic matters. The failure also cost him his American solo career since the opera took too much time and effort. He soon found himself in financial difficulties, and in April 1920, he left for Paris, not wanting to return to Russia as a failure.

In Paris, Prokofiev reaffirmed his contacts with Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes. He also completed some of his older, unfinished works, such as his Third Piano Concerto. &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; finally premièred in Chicago, under the composer&#x27;s baton, on 30 December 1921. Diaghilev became sufficiently interested in the opera to request Prokofiev play the vocal score to him in June 1922, while they were both in Paris for a revival of &quot;Chout&quot;, so he could consider it for a possible production. Stravinsky, who was present at the audition, refused to listen to more than the first act. When he then accused Prokofiev of &quot;wasting time composing operas&quot;, Prokofiev retorted that Stravinsky &quot;was in no position to lay down a general artistic direction, since he is himself not immune to error&quot;. According to Prokofiev, Stravinsky &quot;became incandescent with rage&quot; and &quot;we almost came to blows and were separated only with difficulty&quot;. As a result, &quot;our relations became strained and for several years Stravinsky&#x27;s attitude toward me was critical.&quot;

In March 1922, Prokofiev moved with his mother to the town of Ettal in the Bavarian Alps, where for over a year he concentrated on an opera project, &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;, based on the novel by Valery Bryusov. His later music had acquired a following in Russia, and he received invitations to return there, but decided to stay in Europe. In 1923, Prokofiev married the Spanish singer Carolina Codina (1897–1989, stage name Lina Llubera) before moving back to Paris.

In Paris, several of his works, including the Second Symphony, were performed, but their reception was lukewarm and Prokofiev sensed that he &quot;was evidently no longer a sensation&quot;. Still, the Symphony appeared to prompt Diaghilev to commission &quot;Le pas d&#x27;acier&quot; (&quot;The Steel Step&quot;), a &quot;modernist&quot; ballet score intended to portray the industrialisation of the Soviet Union. It was enthusiastically received by Parisian audiences and critics.

Around 1924, Prokofiev was introduced to Christian Science. He began to practice its teachings, which he believed to be beneficial to his health and to his fiery temperament and to which he remained faithful for the rest of his life, according to biographer Simon Morrison.

Prokofiev and Stravinsky restored their friendship, though Prokofiev particularly disliked Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;stylization of Bach&quot; in such recent works as the Octet and the Concerto for Piano and Wind Instruments. For his part, Stravinsky described Prokofiev as the greatest Russian composer of his day, after himself.

=== First visits to the Soviet Union ===
Prokofiev met Boris Krasin in the violinist Joseph Szigeti&#x27;s Paris apartment in 1924. In 1927, Prokofiev made his first concert tour in the Soviet Union. Over more than two months, he spent time in Moscow and Leningrad (as St Petersburg had been renamed), where he enjoyed a very successful staging of &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot; in the Mariinsky Theatre. In 1928, Prokofiev completed his Third Symphony, which was broadly based on his unperformed opera &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;. The conductor Serge Koussevitzky characterized the Third as &quot;the greatest symphony since Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Sixth&quot;.

In the meantime, under the influence of the teachings of Christian Science, Prokofiev had turned against the expressionist style and the subject matter of &quot;The Fiery Angel&quot;. He now preferred what he called a &quot;new simplicity&quot;, which he found more sincere than the &quot;contrivances and complexities&quot; of so much modern music of the 1920s. In 1928–29, Prokofiev composed his last ballet for Diaghilev, &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;. When first staged in Paris on 21 May 1929, choreographed by George Balanchine with Serge Lifar in the title role, the audience and critics were particularly struck by the final scene, in which the prodigal son drags himself across the stage on his knees to be welcomed by his father. Diaghilev had recognised that in the music to the scene, Prokofiev had &quot;never been more clear, more simple, more melodious, and more tender&quot;. Only months later, Diaghilev died.

That summer, Prokofiev completed the Divertimento, Op. 43 (which he had started in 1925) and revised his Sinfonietta, Op. 5/48, a work started in his days at the Conservatory. In October of that year, he had a car crash while driving his family back to Paris from their holiday: as the car turned over, Prokofiev pulled some muscles on his left hand. Prokofiev was therefore unable to perform in Moscow during his tour shortly after the accident, but he was able to enjoy watching performances of his music from the audience. Prokofiev also attended the Bolshoi Theatre&#x27;s &quot;audition&quot; of his ballet &quot;Le pas d&#x27;acier&quot;, and was interrogated by members of the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM) about the work: he was asked whether the factory portrayed &quot;a capitalist factory, where the worker is a slave, or a Soviet factory, where the worker is the master? If it is a Soviet factory, when and where did Prokofiev examine it, since from 1918 to the present he has been living abroad and came here for the first time in 1927 for two weeks [sic]?&quot; Prokofiev replied, &quot;That concerns politics, not music, and therefore I won&#x27;t answer.&quot; The RAPM condemned the ballet as a &quot;flat and vulgar anti-Soviet anecdote, a counter-revolutionary composition bordering on Fascism&quot;. The Bolshoi had no option but to reject the ballet.

With his left hand healed, Prokofiev toured the United States successfully at the start of 1930, propped up by his recent European success. That year, Prokofiev began his first non-Diaghilev ballet &quot;On the Dnieper&quot;, Op. 51, a work commissioned by Serge Lifar, who had been appointed &quot;maitre de ballet&quot; at the Paris Opéra. In 1931 and 1932, he completed his fourth and fifth piano concertos. The following year saw the completion of the Symphonic Song, Op. 57, which Prokofiev&#x27;s friend Myaskovsky—thinking of its potential audience in the Soviet Union—told him &quot;isn&#x27;t quite for us… it lacks that which we mean by monumentalism—a familiar simplicity and broad contours, of which you are extremely capable, but temporarily are carefully avoiding.&quot;

By the early 1930s, both Europe and America were suffering from the Great Depression, which inhibited both new opera and ballet productions, though audiences for Prokofiev&#x27;s appearances as a pianist were, in Europe at least, undiminished. But Prokofiev saw himself as a composer first and foremost, and increasingly resented the time lost to composition through his appearances as a pianist. Having been homesick for some time, Prokofiev began to build substantial bridges with the Soviet Union.

Following the dissolution of the RAPM in 1932, he acted increasingly as a musical ambassador between his homeland and western Europe, and his premieres and commissions were increasingly under the auspices of the Soviet Union. One such was &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot;, which was commissioned as the score to a Soviet film.

Another commission, from the Kirov Theatre (as the Mariinsky had now been renamed) in Leningrad, was the ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, composed to a scenario created by Adrian Piotrovsky and Sergei Radlov following the precepts of &quot;drambalet&quot; (dramatised ballet, officially promoted at the Kirov to replace works based primarily on choreographic display and innovation). Following Radlov&#x27;s acrimonious resignation from the Kirov in June 1934, a new agreement was signed with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the understanding that Piotrovsky would remain involved. But the ballet&#x27;s original happy ending (contrary to Shakespeare) provoked controversy among Soviet cultural officials, and the ballet&#x27;s production was postponed indefinitely when the staff of the Bolshoi was overhauled at the behest of the chairman of the Committee on Arts Affairs, Platon Kerzhentsev.

=== Return to Russia ===

In 1936, Prokofiev and his family settled permanently in Moscow, after shifting back and forth between Moscow and Paris for the previous four years.

That year, Prokofiev composed one of his most famous works, &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, for Natalya Sats&#x27; Central Children&#x27;s Theatre. Sats also persuaded him to write two songs for children, &quot;Sweet Song&quot;, and &quot;Chatterbox&quot;; they were eventually joined by &quot;The Little Pigs&quot; and published as &quot;Three Children&#x27;s Songs&quot;, Op. 68. Prokofiev also composed the gigantic &quot;Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution,&quot; originally intended for performance during the anniversary year but effectively blocked by Kerzhentsev, who demanded at the work&#x27;s audition before the Committee on Arts Affairs, &quot;Just what do you think you&#x27;re doing, Sergey Sergeyevich, taking texts that belong to the people and setting them to such incomprehensible music?&quot; The Cantata was not performed until 5 April 1966, just over 13 years after the composer&#x27;s death.

Forced to adapt to the new circumstances (whatever private misgivings he had about them), Prokofiev wrote a series of &quot;mass songs&quot; (Opp. 66, 79, 89), using the lyrics of officially approved Soviet poets. In 1938, he collaborated with Eisenstein on the historical epic &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;, composing some of his most inventive and dramatic music. Although the film had very poor sound recording, Prokofiev adapted much of his score into a large-scale cantata for mezzo-soprano, orchestra and chorus, which was extensively performed and recorded. In the wake of &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot;&#x27;s success, Prokofiev composed his first Soviet opera, &quot;Semyon Kotko&quot;, which was intended to be produced by the director Vsevolod Meyerhold. The opera&#x27;s première was postponed because Meyerhold was arrested on 20 June 1939 by the NKVD, and shot on 2 February 1940. At the end of the same year, Prokofiev was commissioned to compose &quot;Zdravitsa&quot; (literally &quot;Cheers!&quot;, but sometimes subtitled &quot;Hail to Stalin&quot; in English) (Op. 85) to celebrate Joseph Stalin&#x27;s 60th birthday.

Later in 1939, Prokofiev composed his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7, and 8, Opp. 82–84, widely known today as the &quot;War Sonatas&quot;. Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No. 6: 8 April 1940), Sviatoslav Richter (No. 7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and Emil Gilels (No. 8: Moscow, 30 December 1944), they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter. Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev, &quot;having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created&quot; (i.e. in &quot;Zdravitsa&quot;) then subsequently, in the three sonatas, &quot;expressed his true feelings&quot;. As evidence, Jaffé has pointed out that the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on the Robert Schumann lied &quot;Wehmut&quot; (&quot;Sadness&quot;, from the &quot;Liederkreis&quot;, Op. 39): its words translate, &quot;I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales … sing their song of longing from their dungeon&#x27;s depth … everyone delights, yet no one feels the pain, the deep sorrow in the song.&quot; Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize (Second Class) and No. 8 a Stalin Prize (First Class).

Meanwhile, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was staged by the Kirov Ballet, choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky, on 11 January 1940. To the surprise of all of its participants, the dancers having struggled to cope with the music&#x27;s syncopated rhythms and almost having boycotted the production, the ballet was an instant success and became recognised as the crowning achievement of Soviet dramatic ballet.

=== War years ===

Prokofiev had been considering making an opera out of Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s epic novel &quot;War and Peace&quot;, when news of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 made the subject seem all the more timely. Because of the war, he was evacuated together with a large number of other artists, initially to the Georgian SSR, where he lived in Tbilisi from 11 November 1941 until 29 June 1942. While there he began to compose the original version of &quot;War and Peace&quot;. While in the Georgian SSR he also composed his Second String Quartet and Piano Sonata No. 7. His relationship with the 25-year-old writer and librettist Mira Mendelson had finally led to his separation from his wife Lina. Despite their acrimonious separation, Prokofiev tried to persuade Lina and their sons to accompany him as evacuees out of Moscow, but Lina opted to stay.

During the war years, restrictions on style and the demand that composers write in a &#x27;socialist realist&#x27; style were slackened, and Prokofiev was generally able to compose in his own way. The Violin Sonata No. 1, Op. 80, &quot;The Year 1941&quot;, Op. 90, and the &quot;Ballade for the Boy Who Remained Unknown&quot;, Op. 93 all came from this period. In 1943, Prokofiev joined Eisenstein in Alma-Ata, the largest city in Kazakhstan, to compose more film music (&quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;), and the ballet &quot;Cinderella&quot; (Op. 87), one of his most melodious and celebrated compositions. Early that year, he also played excerpts from &quot;War and Peace&quot; to members of the Bolshoi Theatre collective, but the Soviet government had opinions about the opera that resulted in many revisions. In 1944, Prokofiev composed his Fifth Symphony (Op. 100) at a composer&#x27;s colony outside Moscow. He conducted its first performance on 13 January 1945, just a fortnight after the triumphant premieres on 30 December 1944 of his Eighth Piano Sonata and, on the same day, the first part of Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. With the premiere of his Fifth Symphony, which was programmed alongside &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; and the &quot;Classical&quot; Symphony (conducted by Nikolai Anosov), Prokofiev appeared to reach the peak of his celebrity as a leading Soviet composer.

On 20 January 1945, Prokofiev suffered a concussion after fainting in his apartment due to untreated chronic hypertension. The composer Dmitry Kabalevsky visited him in hospital and found him semi-conscious, and &quot;with a heavy heart, I left him, I thought it was the end.&quot; He never fully recovered from the injury, and, following medical advice, restricted his composing activity.

=== Postwar ===
Prokofiev had time to write his postwar Sixth Symphony and his Ninth Piano Sonata (for Sviatoslav Richter) before the so-called &quot;Zhdanov Doctrine&quot;. On the day before the decree was published, 10 February 1948, Prokofiev was at a ceremony in the Kremlin to mark his elevation to the status of People&#x27;s Artist of the RSFSR.

The decree followed a three-day conference of more than 70 composers, musicians and music lecturers convened on 10 January, presided over by Zhdanov. Prokofiev was berated by a minor composer, Viktor Bely, who accused him of &quot;innovation for innovation&#x27;s sake&quot; and &quot;artistic snobbishness&quot;, but unlike Dmitri Shostakovich, Aram Khachaturian and others, Prokofiev gave no speech. His silence set off rumors that he had been deliberately defiant and uncooperative. There is no official record, but according to a variety of witnesses, Prokofiev did not attend on the first day, and had to be fetched, arriving on day two wearing a brown suit and baggy-kneed trousers tucked into his felt boots. Ilya Ehrenburg, who was not in the hall, claimed in his memoirs that Prokofiev fell asleep, woke up suddenly and loudly asked who Zhdanov was. The cellist Mstislav Rostropovich heard that Prokofiev was chatting to the person next to him when a senior figure sitting nearby warned him to be quiet. Prokofiev asked: &quot;Who are you?&quot; The official said that his name did not matter, but that Prokofiev had better pay attention to him, to which Prokofiev retorted: &quot;I never pay attention to comments from people who haven&#x27;t been introduced to me.&quot; This possibly apocryphal story was corroborated by the head of the composers&#x27; union, Tikhon Khrennikov, who said that the person Prokofiev snubbed was the Stalinist official Matvei Shkiryatov.
The decree, published on 11 February, denounced six artists—Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Khachaturian, Shebalin, Popov, and Myaskovsky, in that order—for the crime of &quot;formalism&quot;, described as a &quot;renunciation of the basic principles of classical music&quot; in favor of &quot;muddled, nerve-racking&quot; sounds that &quot;turned music into cacophony&quot;. Eight of Prokofiev&#x27;s works were banned from performance: &quot;The Year 1941&quot;, &quot;Ode to the End of the War&quot;, &quot;Festive Poem&quot;, &quot;Cantata for the Thirtieth Anniversary of October&quot;, &quot;Ballad of an Unknown Boy&quot;, the 1934 piano cycle &quot;Thoughts&quot;, and Piano Sonatas Nos. 6 and 8. Such was the perceived threat behind the banning of the works that even works that had avoided censure were no longer programmed. By August 1948, Prokofiev was in severe financial straits, his personal debt amounting to 180,000 rubles.

On 22 November 1947, Prokofiev filed a petition in court to begin divorce proceedings against his estranged wife. Five days later the court ruled that the marriage had no legal basis since it had taken place in Germany, and had not been registered with Soviet officials, thus making it null and void. After a second judge upheld the verdict, he and his partner Mira wed on 13 January 1948. On 20 February 1948, Prokofiev&#x27;s first wife Lina was arrested and charged with espionage for trying to send money to her mother in Spain. After nine months of interrogation, she was sentenced by a three-member Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR to 20 years of hard labor. She was released eight years later on 30 June 1956 and in 1974 left the Soviet Union.

Prokofiev&#x27;s latest opera projects, among them his desperate attempt to appease the cultural authorities, &quot;The Story of a Real Man&quot;, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After he had a stroke on 7 July 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.

In spring 1949, Prokofiev wrote his Cello Sonata in C major, Op. 119, for the 22-year-old Mstislav Rostropovich, who gave the first performance in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter. For Rostropovich, Prokofiev also extensively recomposed his Cello Concerto, transforming it into a Symphony-Concerto, a landmark in the cello and orchestra repertory today. The last public performance he attended, on 11 October 1952, was the première of the Seventh Symphony, his last completed work. The symphony was written for the Children&#x27;s Radio Division.

=== Death ===

Prokofiev died at age 61 on 5 March 1953, the same day as Joseph Stalin. He had lived near Red Square, and for three days throngs gathered to mourn Stalin, making it impossible to hold Prokofiev&#x27;s funeral service at the headquarters of the Soviet Composers&#x27; Union. Because the hearse was not allowed near Prokofiev&#x27;s house, his coffin had to be moved by hand through back streets in the opposite direction of the masses of people going to visit Stalin&#x27;s body. About 30 people attended the funeral, Shostakovich among them. Although they had not seemed to get along when they met, in the later years their interactions had become far more amicable, with Shostakovich writing to Prokofiev, &quot;I wish you at least another hundred years to live and create. Listening to such works as your Seventh Symphony makes it much easier and more joyful to live.&quot; Prokofiev is buried in Moscow&#x27;s Novodevichy Cemetery.

The leading Soviet musical periodical reported Prokofiev&#x27;s death as a brief item on page 116 (the first 115 pages were devoted to Stalin&#x27;s death). Prokofiev&#x27;s death is usually attributed to cerebral hemorrhage. He had been chronically ill for eight years.

Prokofiev&#x27;s wife Mira Mendelson spent her final years living in the Moscow apartment they had shared. She occupied her time organizing her husband&#x27;s papers, promoting his music, and writing her memoirs, having been strongly encouraged by Prokofiev to embark on the latter. Work on the memoirs was difficult for her; she left them incomplete at her death. Mendelson died of a heart attack in Moscow in 1968, 15 years after Prokofiev. Inside her purse a message dated February 1950 and signed by Prokofiev and Mendelson instructed: &quot;We wish to be buried next to each other.&quot; Their remains are buried together at Novodevichy Cemetery.

Lina Prokofiev outlived her ex-husband by many years, dying in London in early 1989. Royalties from his music provided her with a modest income, and she acted as storyteller for a recording of her husband&#x27;s &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; (released on CD by Chandos Records) with Neeme Järvi conducting the Scottish National Orchestra. Their sons Sviatoslav (1924–2010), an architect, and Oleg (1928–1998), an artist, painter, sculptor and poet, dedicated much of their lives to promoting their father&#x27;s work.

==Legacy==
===Reputation===

Arthur Honegger said that Prokofiev would &quot;remain for us the greatest figure of contemporary music&quot;, and the American scholar Richard Taruskin wrote of Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;gift, virtually unparalleled among 20th-century composers, for writing distinctively original diatonic melodies&quot;. Yet for some time Prokofiev&#x27;s reputation in the West suffered as a result of Cold War antipathies, and his music has never won from Western academics and critics the same esteem as Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s and Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s, which had greater influence on younger musicians.

In Donetsk Oblast, the and Donetsk Sergei Prokofiev International Airport are named in Prokofiev&#x27;s honor. The latter facility was destroyed in 2014 during the First and Second Battle of Donetsk Airport.

The All-Ukrainian open pianists&#x27; competition named after Prokofiev is held annually in Kyiv and comprises three categories: piano, composition, and conducting.

===Recordings===

Prokofiev was a soloist with the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Piero Coppola, in the first recording of his Piano Concerto No. 3, recorded in London by His Master&#x27;s Voice in June 1932. Prokofiev also recorded some of his solo piano music for HMV in Paris in February 1935; these recordings were issued on CD by Pearl and Naxos. In 1938, he conducted the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in a recording of the second suite from his &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ballet; this performance was later released on LP and CD. 
A short sound film has been discovered of Prokofiev playing some of the music from his opera &quot;War and Peace&quot; and then explaining the music.

<text>A satellite or an artificial satellite is an object, typically a spacecraft, placed into orbit around a celestial body. They have a variety of uses, including communication relay, weather forecasting, navigation (GPS), broadcasting, scientific research, and Earth observation. Additional military uses are reconnaissance, early warning, signals intelligence and, potentially, weapon delivery. Other satellites include the final rocket stages that place satellites in orbit and formerly useful satellites that later become defunct.

Except for passive satellites, most satellites have an electricity generation system for equipment on board, such as solar panels or radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). Most satellites also have a method of communication to ground stations, called transponders. Many satellites use a standardized bus to save cost and work, the most popular of which are small CubeSats. Similar satellites can work together as groups, forming constellations. Because of the high launch cost to space, most satellites are designed to be as lightweight and robust as possible. Most communication satellites are radio relay stations in orbit and carry dozens of transponders, each with a bandwidth of tens of megahertz.

Satellites are launched from the Earth&#x27;s surface into space orbit by launch vehicles, high enough to avoid orbital decay by the atmosphere. Satellites can then change or maintain the orbit by propulsion, usually by chemical or ion thrusters. As of 2018, about 90% of the satellites orbiting the Earth are in low Earth orbit or geostationary orbit; geostationary means the satellites stay still in the sky (relative to a fixed point on the ground). Some imaging satellites chose a Sun-synchronous orbit because they can scan the entire globe with similar lighting. As the number of satellites and space debris around Earth increases, the threat of collision has become more severe. A small number of satellites orbit other bodies (such as the Moon, Mars, and the Sun) or many bodies at once (two for a halo orbit, three for a Lissajous orbit).

Earth observation satellites gather information for reconnaissance, mapping, monitoring the weather, ocean, forest, etc. Space telescopes take advantage of outer space&#x27;s near perfect vacuum to observe objects with the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Because satellites can see a large portion of the Earth at once, communications satellites can relay information to remote places. The signal delay from satellites and their orbit&#x27;s predictability are used in satellite navigation systems, such as GPS. Space probes are satellites designed for robotic space exploration outside of Earth, and space stations are in essence crewed satellites.

The first artificial satellite launched into the Earth&#x27;s orbit was the Soviet Union&#x27;s Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957. As of December 31, 2022, there are 6,718 operational satellites in the Earth&#x27;s orbit, of which 4,529 belong to the United States (3,996 commercial), 590 belong to China, 174 belong to Russia, and 1,425 belong to other nations.

== History ==
=== Early proposals ===
The first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite was Newton&#x27;s cannonball, a thought experiment by Isaac Newton to explain the motion of natural satellites, in his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (1687). The first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by Edward Everett Hale, &quot;The Brick Moon&quot; (1869). The idea surfaced again in Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;The Begum&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1879).

In 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857–1935) published &quot;Exploring Space Using Jet Propulsion Devices&quot;, which was the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft. He calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit, and inferred that a multi-stage rocket fueled by liquid propellants could achieve this.

Herman Potočnik explored the idea of using orbiting spacecraft for detailed peaceful and military observation of the ground in his 1928 book, &quot;The Problem of Space Travel&quot;. He described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments. The book described geostationary satellites (first put forward by Konstantin Tsiolkovsky) and discussed the communication between them and the ground using radio, but fell short with the idea of using satellites for mass broadcasting and as telecommunications relays.

In a 1945 &quot;Wireless World&quot; article, English science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications. He suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.

In May 1946, the United States Air Force&#x27;s Project RAND released the Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship, which stated &quot;A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century.&quot; The United States had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the Bureau of Aeronautics of the United States Navy. Project RAND eventually released the report, but considered the satellite to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda, rather than a potential military weapon.

In 1946, American theoretical astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer proposed an orbiting space telescope.

In February 1954, Project RAND released &quot;Scientific Uses for a Satellite Vehicle&quot;, by R. R. Carhart. This expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in June 1955 with &quot;The Scientific Use of an Artificial Satellite&quot;, by H. K. Kallmann and W. W. Kellogg.

=== First satellites ===

The first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 under the Sputnik program, with Sergei Korolev as chief designer. Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. The unanticipated announcement of Sputnik 1&#x27;s success precipitated the Sputnik crisis in the United States and ignited the so-called Space Race within the Cold War.

In the context of activities planned for the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), the White House announced on 29 July 1955 that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as Project Vanguard. On 31 July, the Soviet Union announced its intention to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.

Sputnik 2 was launched on 3 November 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a dog named Laika. The dog was sent without possibility of return.

In early 1955, after being pressured by the American Rocket Society, the National Science Foundation, and the International Geophysical Year, the Army and Navy worked on Project Orbiter with two competing programs. The army used the Jupiter C rocket, while the civilian–Navy program used the Vanguard rocket to launch a satellite. Explorer 1 became the United States&#x27; first artificial satellite, on 31 January 1958. The information sent back from its radiation detector led to the discovery of the Earth&#x27;s Van Allen radiation belts. The TIROS-1 spacecraft, launched on April 1, 1960, as part of NASA&#x27;s Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) program, sent back the first television footage of weather patterns to be taken from space.

In June 1961, three and a half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the United States Space Surveillance Network cataloged 115 Earth-orbiting satellites.

While Canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space, it was launched aboard an American rocket from an American spaceport. The same goes for Australia, whose launch of the first satellite involved a donated U.S. Redstone rocket and American support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the United Kingdom. The first Italian satellite San Marco 1 was launched on 15 December 1964 on a U.S. Scout rocket from Wallops Island (Virginia, United States) with an Italian launch team trained by NASA. In similar occasions, almost all further first national satellites were launched by foreign rockets.

France was the third country to launch a satellite on its own rocket. On 26 November 1965, the Astérix or A-1 (initially conceptualized as FR.2 or FR-2), was put into orbit by a Diamant A rocket launched from the CIEES site at Hammaguir, Algeria. With Astérix, France became the sixth country to have an artificial satellite.

=== Later Satellite Development ===
Early satellites were built to unique designs. With advancements in technology, multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses. The first standardized satellite bus design was the HS-333 geosynchronous (GEO) communication satellite launched in 1972. Beginning in 1997, FreeFlyer is a commercial off-the-shelf software application for satellite mission analysis, design, and operations.

After the late 2010s, and especially after the advent and operational fielding of large satellite internet constellations—where on-orbit active satellites more than doubled over a period of five years—the companies building the constellations began to propose regular planned deorbiting of the older satellites that reached the end of life, as a part of the regulatory process of obtaining a launch license. The largest artificial satellite ever is the International Space Station.

By the early 2000s, and particularly after the advent of CubeSats and increased launches of microsats—frequently launched to the lower altitudes of low Earth orbit (LEO)—satellites began to more frequently be designed to get destroyed, or breakup and burnup entirely in the atmosphere.
For example, SpaceX Starlink satellites, the first large satellite internet constellation to exceed 1000 active satellites on orbit in 2020, are designed to be 100% demisable and burn up completely on their atmospheric reentry at the end of their life, or in the event of an early satellite failure.

In different periods, many countries, such as Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, India, Iran, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States, had some satellites in orbit.

Japan&#x27;s space agency (JAXA) and NASA plan to send a wooden satellite prototype called LingoSat into orbit in the summer of 2024. They have been working on this project for few years and sent first wood samples to the space in 2021 to test the material&#x27;s resilience to space conditions.

==Components==
=== Orbit and altitude control ===


Most satellites use chemical or ion propulsion to adjust or maintain their orbit, coupled with reaction wheels to control their three axis of rotation or attitude. Satellites close to Earth are affected the most by variations in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic, gravitational field and the Sun&#x27;s radiation pressure; satellites that are further away are affected more by other bodies&#x27; gravitational field by the Moon and the Sun. Satellites utilize ultra-white reflective coatings to prevent damage from UV radiation. Without orbit and orientation control, satellites in orbit will not be able to communicate with ground stations on the Earth.

Chemical thrusters on satellites usually use monopropellant (one-part) or bipropellant (two-parts) that are hypergolic. Hypergolic means able to combust spontaneously when in contact with each other or to a catalyst. The most commonly used propellant mixtures on satellites are hydrazine-based monopropellants or monomethylhydrazine–dinitrogen tetroxide bipropellants. Ion thrusters on satellites usually are Hall-effect thrusters, which generate thrust by accelerating positive ions through a negatively-charged grid. Ion propulsion is more efficient propellant-wise than chemical propulsion but its thrust is very small (around ), and thus requires a longer burn time. The thrusters usually use xenon because it is inert, can be easily ionized, has a high atomic mass and storable as a high-pressure liquid.

===Power===
Most satellites use solar panels to generate power, and a few in deep space with limited sunlight use radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Slip rings attach solar panels to the satellite; the slip rings can rotate to be perpendicular with the sunlight and generate the most power. All satellites with a solar panel must also have batteries, because sunlight is blocked inside the launch vehicle and at night. The most common types of batteries for satellites are lithium-ion, and in the past nickel–hydrogen.

===Communications===

== Applications ==

=== Earth observation ===
Earth observation satellites are designed to monitor and survey the Earth, called remote sensing. Most Earth observation satellites are placed in low Earth orbit for a high data resolution, though some are placed in a geostationary orbit for an uninterrupted coverage. Some satellites are placed in a Sun-synchronous orbit to have consistent lighting and obtain a total view of the Earth. Depending on the satellites&#x27; functions, they might have a normal camera, radar, lidar, photometer, or atmospheric instruments. Earth observation satellite&#x27;s data is most used in archaeology, cartography, environmental monitoring, meteorology, and reconnaissance applications. As of 2021, there are over 950 Earth observation satellites, with the largest number of satellites operated with Planet Labs.

Weather satellites monitor clouds, city lights, fires, effects of pollution, auroras, sand and dust storms, snow cover, ice mapping, boundaries of ocean currents, energy flows, etc. Environmental monitoring satellites can detect changes in the Earth&#x27;s vegetation, atmospheric trace gas content, sea state, ocean color, and ice fields. By monitoring vegetation changes over time, droughts can be monitored by comparing the current vegetation state to its long term average. Anthropogenic emissions can be monitored by evaluating data of tropospheric NO2 and SO2.

=== Communication ===

===Spy satellites===

When an Earth observation satellite or a communications satellite is deployed for military or intelligence purposes, it is known as a spy satellite or reconnaissance satellite.

Their uses include early missile warning, nuclear explosion detection, electronic reconnaissance, and optical or radar imaging surveillance.

=== Navigation ===

Navigational satellites are satellites that use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.
=== Telescope ===
Astronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects.
=== Experimental ===
Tether satellites are satellites that are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether. Recovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance, biological, space-production and other payloads from orbit to Earth. Biosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation. Space-based solar power satellites are proposed satellites that would collect energy from sunlight and transmit it for use on Earth or other places.

=== Weapon ===

Since the mid-2000s, satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks. For testing purposes, satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from the Earth. Russia, United States, China and India have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites. In 2007, the Chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite, followed by the US Navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in February 2008. On 18 November 2015, after two failed attempts, Russia successfully carried out a flight test of an anti-satellite missile known as &quot;Nudol&quot;. On 27 March 2019, India shot down a live test satellite at 300 km altitude in 3 minutes, becoming the fourth country to have the capability to destroy live satellites.

== Environmental impact ==
The environmental impact of satellites is not currently well understood as they were previously assumed to be benign due to the rarity of satellite launches. However, the exponential increase and projected growth of satellite launches are bringing the issue into consideration. The main issues are resource use and the release of pollutants into the atmosphere which can happen at different stages of a satellite&#x27;s lifetime.

=== Resource use ===
Resource use is difficult to monitor and quantify for satellites and launch vehicles due to their commercially sensitive nature. However, aluminium is a preferred metal in satellite construction due to its lightweight and relative cheapness and typically constitutes around 40% of a satellite&#x27;s mass. Through mining and refining, aluminium has numerous negative environmental impacts and is one of the most carbon-intensive metals. Satellite manufacturing also requires rare elements such as lithium, gold, and gallium, some of which have significant environmental consequences linked to their mining and processing and/or are in limited supply. Launch vehicles require larger amounts of raw materials to manufacture and the booster stages are usually dropped into the ocean after fuel exhaustion. They are not normally recovered. Two empty boosters used for Ariane 5, which were composed mainly of steel, weighed around 38 tons each, to give an idea of the quantity of materials that are often left in the ocean.

=== Launches ===
Rocket launches release numerous pollutants into every layer of the atmosphere, especially affecting the atmosphere above the tropopause where the byproducts of combustion can reside for extended periods. These pollutants can include black carbon, CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), aluminium and water vapour, but the mix of pollutants is dependent on rocket design and fuel type. The amount of green house gases emitted by rockets is considered trivial as it contributes significantly less, around 0.01%, than the aviation industry yearly which itself accounts for 2-3% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.

Rocket emissions in the stratosphere and their effects are only beginning to be studied and it is likely that the impacts will be more critical than emissions in the troposphere. The stratosphere includes the ozone layer and pollutants emitted from rockets can contribute to ozone depletion in a number of ways. Radicals such as NOx, HOx, and ClOx deplete stratospheric O3 through intermolecular reactions and can have huge impacts in trace amounts. However, it is currently understood that launch rates would need to increase by ten times to match the impact of regulated ozone-depleting substances. Whilst emissions of water vapour are largely deemed as inert, H2O is the source gas for HOx and can also contribute to ozone loss through the formation of ice particles. Black carbon particles emitted by rockets can absorb solar radiation in the stratosphere and cause warming in the surrounding air which can then impact the circulatory dynamics of the stratosphere. Both warming and changes in circulation can then cause depletion of the ozone layer.

=== Operational ===
==== Low earth orbit satellites ====
Several pollutants are released in the upper atmospheric layers during the orbital lifetime of LEO satellites. Orbital decay is caused by atmospheric drag and to keep the satellite in the correct orbit the platform occasionally needs repositioning. To do this nozzle-based systems use a chemical propellant to create thrust. In most cases hydrazine is the chemical propellant used which then releases ammonia, hydrogen and nitrogen as gas into the upper atmosphere. Also, the environment of the outer atmosphere causes the degradation of exterior materials. The atomic oxygen in the upper atmosphere oxidises hydrocarbon-based polymers like Kapton, Teflon and Mylar that are used to insulate and protect the satellite which then emits gasses like CO2 and CO into the atmosphere.

==== Night sky ====
Given the current surge in satellites in the sky, soon hundreds of satellites may be clearly visible to the human eye at dark sites. It is estimated that the overall levels of diffuse brightness of the night skies has increased by up to 10% above natural levels. This has the potential to confuse organisms, like insects and night-migrating birds, that use celestial patterns for migration and orientation. The impact this might have is currently unclear. The visibility of man-made objects in the night sky may also impact people&#x27;s linkages with the world, nature, and culture.

==== Ground-based infrastructure ====
At all points of a satellite&#x27;s lifetime, its movement and processes are monitored on the ground through a network of facilities. The environmental cost of the infrastructure as well as day-to-day operations is likely to be quite high, but quantification requires further investigation.

=== Degeneration ===
Particular threats arise from uncontrolled de-orbit. 

Some notable satellite failures that polluted and dispersed radioactive materials are Kosmos 954, Kosmos 1402 and the Transit 5-BN-3.

When in a controlled manner satellites reach the end of life they are intentionally deorbited or moved to a graveyard orbit further away from Earth in order to reduce space debris. Physical collection or removal is not economical or even currently possible. Moving satellites out to a graveyard orbit is also unsustainable because they remain there for hundreds of years. It will lead to the further pollution of space and future issues with space debris. 
When satellites deorbit much of it is destroyed during re-entry into the atmosphere due to the heat. This introduces more material and pollutants into the atmosphere. There have been concerns expressed about the potential damage to the ozone layer and the possibility of increasing the earth&#x27;s albedo, reducing warming but also resulting in accidental geoengineering of the earth&#x27;s climate. After deorbiting 70% of satellites end up in the ocean and are rarely recovered.

===Mitigation===
Using wood as an alternative material has been posited in order to reduce pollution and debris from satellites that reenter the atmosphere.

==Interference==
===Collision threat===
Space debris pose dangers to the spacecraft (including satellites) in or crossing geocentric orbits and have the potential to drive a Kessler syndrome which could potentially curtail humanity from conducting space endeavors in the future.

With increase in the number of satellite constellations, like SpaceX Starlink, the astronomical community, such as the IAU, report that orbital pollution is getting increased significantly. A report from the SATCON1 workshop in 2020 concluded that the effects of large satellite constellations can severely affect some astronomical research efforts and lists six ways to mitigate harm to astronomy. The IAU is establishing a center (CPS) to coordinate or aggregate measures to mitigate such detrimental effects.

===Radio interference===
Due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions, they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters. Such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter&#x27;s range. GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming, but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.

Also, it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite&#x27;s transponder. It is common for Earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring tools and methods that enable them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively. 

==Regulation==
Issues like space debris, radio and light pollution are increasing in magnitude and at the same time lack progress in national or international regulation. 

===Liability===
Generally liability has been covered by the Liability Convention.

==Operation==
The operation capabilities and use have very much diversified and is broadening increasingly.

Satellite operation needs not only access to financial, manufacturing and launch capabilities, but also a ground segment infrastructure.

<text>Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retrofuturistic technology and aesthetics inspired by, but not limited to, 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American frontier, where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power.

Steampunk features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions as people in the 19th century might have envisioned them — distinguishing it from Neo-Victorianism — and is likewise rooted in the era&#x27;s perspective on fashion, culture, architectural style, and art. Such technologies may include fictional machines like those found in the works of H. G. Wells and Jules Verne. Other examples of steampunk contain alternative-history-style presentations of such technology as steam cannons, lighter-than-air airships, analog computers, or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage&#x27;s Analytical Engine.

Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror, historical fiction, alternate history, or other branches of speculative fiction, making it often a hybrid genre. As a form of speculative fiction, it explores alternative futures or pasts but can also address real-world social issues. The first known appearance of the term &quot;steampunk&quot; was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier. A popular subgenre is Japanese steampunk, consisting of steampunk-themed manga and anime.

Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th century. Various modern utilitarian objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical &quot;steampunk&quot; style, and a number of visual and musical artists have been described as steampunk.

==History==
===Precursors===
Steampunk is influenced by and often adopts the style of the 19th-century scientific romances of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Mary Shelley, and Edward S. Ellis&#x27;s &quot;The Steam Man of the Prairies&quot;. Several more modern works of art and fiction significant to the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name. &quot;Titus Alone&quot; (1959), by Mervyn Peake, is widely regarded by scholars as the first novel in the genre proper, while others point to Michael Moorcock&#x27;s 1971 novel &quot;The Warlord of the Air&quot;, which was heavily influenced by Peake&#x27;s work. The film &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985) was an early cinematic influence, although it can also be considered a precursor to the steampunk offshoot dieselpunk. &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot; was an early (1970s) comic version of the Moorcock-style mover between timestreams.

In fine art, Remedios Varo&#x27;s paintings combine elements of Victorian dress, fantasy, and technofantasy imagery. In television, one of the earliest manifestations of the steampunk ethos in the mainstream media was the CBS television series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; (1965–69), which inspired the later film.

===Origin of the term===
Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s, the term &quot;steampunk&quot; originated largely in the 1980s as a tongue-in-cheek variant of &quot;cyberpunk&quot;. It was coined by science fiction author K. W. Jeter, who was trying to find a general term for works by Tim Powers (&quot;The Anubis Gates&quot;, 1983), James Blaylock (&quot;Homunculus&quot;, 1986), and himself (&quot;Morlock Night&quot;, 1979, and &quot;Infernal Devices&quot;, 1987) — all of which took place in a 19th-century (usually Victorian) setting and imitated conventions of such actual Victorian speculative fiction as H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. In a letter to science fiction magazine &quot;Locus&quot;, printed in the April 1987 issue, Jeter wrote:


===Modern steampunk===

While Jeter&#x27;s &quot;Morlock Night&quot; and &quot;Infernal Devices&quot;, Powers&#x27; &quot;The Anubis Gates&quot;, and Blaylock&#x27;s &quot;Lord Kelvin&#x27;s Machine&quot; were the first novels to which Jeter&#x27;s neologism would be applied, the three authors gave the term little thought at the time. They were far from the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam-based technology or alternative histories. Keith Laumer&#x27;s &quot;Worlds of the Imperium&quot; (1962) and Ronald W. Clark&#x27;s &quot;Queen Victoria&#x27;s Bomb&quot; (1967) apply modern speculation to past-age technology and society. Michael Moorcock&#x27;s &quot;Warlord of the Air&quot; (1971) is another early example. Harry Harrison&#x27;s novel &quot;A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah!&quot; (1973) portrays Britain in an alternative 1973, full of atomic locomotives, coal-powered flying boats, ornate submarines, and Victorian dialogue. &quot;The Adventures of Luther Arkwright&quot; (mid-1970s) was one of the first steampunk comics. In February 1980, Richard A. Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first &quot;chapter&quot; of their 10-part comic strip &quot;The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer&quot;. In 2004, one anonymous author described steampunk as &quot;Colonizing the Past so we can dream the future.&quot;

The first use of the word &quot;steampunk&quot; in a title was in Paul Di Filippo&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Steampunk Trilogy&quot;, consisting of three short novels: &quot;Victoria&quot;, &quot;Hottentots&quot;, and &quot;Walt and Emily&quot;, which, respectively, imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a human/newt clone; an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters, drawing its title from the historic racial taxonomy &quot;hottentot&quot;; and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson.

===Japanese steampunk===

Japanese steampunk consists of steampunk manga comics and anime productions from Japan. Steampunk elements have consistently appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s, dating back to Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s epic science-fiction trilogy consisting of &quot;Lost World&quot; (1948), &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1949) and &quot;Nextworld&quot; (1951). The steampunk elements found in manga eventually made their way into mainstream anime productions starting in the 1970s. Influenced by 19th-century European authors such as Jules Verne, steampunk anime and manga arose from a Japanese fascination with an imaginary fantastical version of old Industrial Europe, linked to a phenomenon called &quot;akogare no Pari&quot; (&quot;the Paris of our dreams&quot;), comparable to the West&#x27;s fascination with an &quot;exotic&quot; East.

The most influential steampunk animator was Hayao Miyazaki, who was creating steampunk anime since the 1970s, starting with the television show &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978). His manga &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; (1982) and its 1984 anime film adaptation also contained steampunk elements. Miyazaki&#x27;s most influential steampunk production was the Studio Ghibli anime film &quot;Laputa: Castle in the Sky&quot; (1986), which became a major milestone in the genre and has been described by &quot;The Steampunk Bible&quot; as &quot;one of the first modern steampunk classics.&quot; Archetypal steampunk elements in &quot;Laputa&quot; include airships, air pirates, steam-powered robots, and a view of steam power as a limitless but potentially dangerous source of power.

The success of &quot;Laputa&quot; inspired Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax to create their first hit production, &quot;&quot; (1990), a steampunk anime show which loosely adapts elements from Verne&#x27;s &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, with Captain Nemo making an appearance. Based on a concept by Miyazaki, &quot;Nadia&quot; was influential on later steampunk anime such as Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s anime film &quot;Steamboy&quot; (2004). Disney&#x27;s animated steampunk film &quot;&quot; (2001) was influenced by anime, particularly Miyazaki&#x27;s works and possibly &quot;Nadia&quot;. Other popular Japanese steampunk works include Miyazaki&#x27;s Studio Ghibli anime film &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004), Sega&#x27;s video game and anime franchise &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; (1996) which is set in a steampunk version of Meiji/Taishō era Japan, and Square Enix&#x27;s manga and anime franchise &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; (2001).

===Relationships to retrofuturism, DIY craft and making===
Steampunk used to be confused with retrofuturism. Indeed, both sensibilities recall &quot;the older but still modern eras in which technological change seemed to anticipate a better world, one remembered as relatively innocent of industrial decline.&quot; For some scholars, retrofuturism is considered a strand of steampunk, one that looks at alternatives to historical imagination and usually created with the same kinds of social protagonists and written for the same type of audiences.

One of steampunk&#x27;s most significant contributions is the way in which it mixes digital media with traditional handmade art forms. As scholars Rachel Bowser and Brian Croxall put it, &quot;the tinkering and tinker-able technologies within steampunk invite us to roll up our sleeves and get to work re-shaping our contemporary world.&quot; In this respect, steampunk bears much in common with DIY craft and bricolage artmaking.

==Art, entertainment, and media==

===Art and design===
Many of the visualisations of steampunk have their origins with, among others, Walt Disney&#x27;s film &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), including the design of the story&#x27;s submarine the &quot;Nautilus&quot;, its interiors, and the crew&#x27;s underwater gear; and George Pal&#x27;s film &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960), especially the design of the time machine itself. This theme is also carried over to Six Flags Magic Mountain and Disney parks, in the themed area the &quot;Screampunk District&quot; at Six Flags Magic Mountain and in the designs of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park and Disneyland Paris&#x27; Discoveryland area.

Aspects of steampunk design emphasise a balance between form and function. In this, it is like the Arts and Crafts Movement. But John Ruskin, William Morris, and the other reformers in the late nineteenth century rejected machines and industrial production. In contrast, steampunk enthusiasts present a &quot;non-luddite critique of technology&quot;. In Dutch amusement park De Efteling, there is a dive coaster themed to a steampunk Victorian haunted goldmine called Baron 1898.

Various modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical &quot;steampunk&quot; style. Examples include computer keyboards and electric guitars. The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as polished brass, iron, wood, and leather) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era, rejecting the aesthetic of industrial design.
In 1994, the Paris Metro station at Arts et Métiers was redesigned by Belgian artist Francois Schuiten in steampunk style, to honor the works of Jules Verne. The station is reminiscent of a submarine, sheathed in brass with giant cogs in the ceiling and portholes that look out onto fanciful scenes.

The artist group &quot;Kinetic Steam Works&quot; brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007. The group&#x27;s founding member, Sean Orlando, created a Steampunk Tree House (in association with a group of people who would later form the &quot;Five Ton Crane Arts Group&quot;) that has been displayed at a number of festivals. The Steampunk Tree House is now permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton, Delaware.

The Neverwas Haul is a three-story, self-propelled mobile art vehicle built to resemble a Victorian house on wheels. Designed by Shannon O&#x27;Hare, it was built by volunteers in 2006 and presented at the Burning Man festival from 2006 through 2015. When fully built, the Haul propelled itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and required a crew of ten people to operate safely. Currently, the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an &quot;art car factory&quot; in Vallejo, CA owned by O&#x27;Hare and home to several other self-styled &quot;contraptionists&quot;.

In May–June 2008, multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London and Brooklyn, New York, in a Victorian era-styled telectroscope. Utilizing this device, New York promoter Evelyn Kriete organised a transatlantic wave between steampunk enthusiasts from both cities, prior to White Mischief&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; steampunk-themed event.

In 2009, for Questacon, artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece that represented the concept of the clockwork universe. This steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the moon&#x27;s terminator in action. The 3D moon movie was created by Antony Williams.

Steampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects sold on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011, though many of the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established descriptions of steampunk. Thus the craft network may not strike observers as &quot;sufficiently steampunk&quot; to warrant its use of the term. Comedian April Winchell, author of the book &quot;Regretsy: Where DIY Meets WTF&quot;, cataloged some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website &quot;Regretsy&quot;. The blog was popular among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk &quot;notables&quot;.

From October 2009 through February 2010, the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, hosted the first major exhibition of steampunk art objects, curated and developed by New York artist and designer Art Donovan, who also exhibited his own &quot;electro-futuristic&quot; lighting sculptures, and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett, museum director. From redesigned practical items to fantastical contraptions, this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen steampunk artists from around the globe. The exhibit proved to be the most successful and highly attended in the museum&#x27;s history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors. The event was detailed in the official artist&#x27;s journal &quot;The Art of Steampunk&quot;, by curator Donovan.

In November 2010, The Libratory Steampunk Art Gallery was opened by Damien McNamara in Oamaru, New Zealand. Created from papier-mâché to resemble a large cave and filled with industrial equipment from yesteryear, rayguns, and general steampunk quirks, its purpose is to provide a place for steampunkers in the region to display artwork for sale all year long. A year later, a more permanent gallery, Steampunk HQ, was opened in the former Meeks Grain Elevator Building across the road from The Woolstore, and has since become a notable tourist attraction for Oamaru.

In 2012, the &quot;Mobilis in Mobili: An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance&quot; made its debut. Originally located at New York City&#x27;s Wooster Street Social Club (itself the subject of the television series &quot;NY Ink&quot;), the exhibit featured working steampunk tattoo systems designed by Bruce Rosenbaum, of ModVic and owner of the Steampunk House, Joey &quot;Dr. Grymm&quot; Marsocci, and Christopher Conte. with different approaches. &quot;[B]icycles, cell phones, guitars, timepieces and entertainment systems&quot; rounded out the display. The opening night exhibition featured a live performance by steampunk band Frenchy and the Punk.
The stills at The Oxford Artisan Distillery are nicknamed &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Nemo&quot;, named after the submarine and its captain in the Jules Verne 1870 science fiction novel &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;. They were built in copper by South Devon Railway Engineering using a steampunk style.

===Fashion===


Steampunk fashion has no set guidelines but tends to synthesize modern styles with influences from the Victorian era. Such influences may include bustles, corsets, gowns, and petticoats; suits with waistcoats, coats, top hats and bowler hats (themselves originating in 1850 England), tailcoats and spats; or military-inspired garments. Steampunk-influenced outfits are usually accented with several technological and &quot;period&quot; accessories: timepieces, parasols, flying/driving goggles, and ray guns. Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits, after being modified to give them the appearance of Victorian-era objects. Post-apocalyptic elements, such as gas masks, ragged clothing, and tribal motifs, can also be included. Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion, the Lolita and aristocrat styles, neo-Victorianism, and the Romantic Goth subculture.

In 2005, Kate Lambert, known as &quot;Kato&quot;, founded the first steampunk clothing company, &quot;Steampunk Couture&quot;, mixing Victorian and post-apocalyptic influences. In 2013, IBM predicted, based on an analysis of more than a half million public posts on message boards, blogs, social media sites, and news sources, &quot;that &#x27;steampunk,&#x27; a subgenre inspired by the clothing, technology and social mores of Victorian society, will be a major trend to bubble up and take hold of the retail industry&quot;. Indeed, high fashion lines such as Prada, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Versace, Chanel, and Christian Dior had already been introducing steampunk styles on the fashion runways.

In episode 7 of Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Under the Gunn&quot; reality series, contestants were challenged to create avant-garde &quot;steampunk chic&quot; looks. &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; tackled steampunk fashion in a 2012 episode where models competed in a steampunk-themed photo shoot, posing in front of a steam train while holding a live owl.

===Literature===
In 1988, the first version of the science fiction tabletop role-playing game &quot;&quot; was published. The game is set in an alternative history in which certain now discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable and led to new technologies. Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick, Loren Wiseman, and Marcus Rowland.

William Gibson and Bruce Sterling&#x27;s novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; (1990) is often credited with bringing about widespread awareness of steampunk. The novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling&#x27;s cyberpunk writings to an alternative Victorian era where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage&#x27;s proposed steam-powered mechanical computer, which Babbage called a difference engine (a later, more general-purpose version was known as an Analytical Engine), was actually built, and led to the dawn of the Information Age more than a century &quot;ahead of schedule&quot;. This setting was different from most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and dark view of this future, rather than the more prevalent utopian versions.

Nick Gevers&#x27;s original anthology &quot;Extraordinary Engines&quot; (2008) features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre&#x27;s writers, as well as other science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo-Victorian conventions. A retrospective reprint anthology of steampunk fiction was released, also in 2008, by Tachyon Publications. Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled &quot;Steampunk&quot;, it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock, whose &quot;Narbondo&quot; trilogy is typically considered steampunk; Jay Lake, author of the novel &quot;Mainspring&quot;, sometimes labeled &quot;clockpunk&quot;; the aforementioned Michael Moorcock; as well as Jess Nevins, known for his annotations to &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; (first published in 1999).

Younger readers have also been targeted by steampunk themes, by authors such as Philip Reeve and Scott Westerfeld. Reeve&#x27;s quartet &quot;Mortal Engines&quot; is set far in Earth&#x27;s future where giant moving cities consume each other in a battle for resources, a concept Reeve coined as &quot;Municipal Darwinism&quot;. Westerfeld&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; trilogy is set during an alternate First World War fought between the &quot;clankers&quot; (Central Powers), who use steam technology, and &quot;darwinists&quot; (Allied Powers), who use genetically engineered creatures instead of machines.

&quot;Mash-ups&quot; are also becoming increasingly popular in books aimed at younger readers, mixing steampunk with other genres. Stefan Bachmann&#x27;s &quot;The Peculiar&quot; duology was labeled a &quot;steampunk fairytale,&quot; and imagines steampunk technology as a means to stave off an incursion of faeries in Victorian England. Suzanne Lazear&#x27;s &quot;Aether Chronicles&quot; series also mixes steampunk with faeries, and &quot;The Unnaturalists&quot;, by Tiffany Trent, combines steampunk with mythological creatures and alternate history.

Self-described author of &quot;far-fetched fiction&quot; Robert Rankin has incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds that are both Victorian and re-imagined contemporary. In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society.

The comic book series &quot;Hellboy&quot;, created by Mike Mignola, and the two &quot;Hellboy&quot; films featuring Ron Perlman and directed by Guillermo del Toro, all have steampunk elements. In the comic book and the first (2004) film, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is a Nazi SS scientist who has an addiction to having himself surgically altered, and who has many mechanical prostheses, including a clockwork heart. The character Johann Krauss is featured in the comic and in the second film, &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot; (2008), as an ectoplasmic medium (a gaseous form in a partly mechanical suit). This second film also features the Golden Army itself, which is a collection of 4,900 mechanical steampunk warriors.

===Steampunk settings===

====Alternative world====
Since the 1990s, the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognisable historical periods, to works set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam- or spring-powered technology. One of the earliest short stories relying on steam-powered flying machines is &quot;The Aerial Burglar&quot; of 1844. An example from juvenile fiction is &quot;The Edge Chronicles&quot; by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell.

Fantasy steampunk settings abound in tabletop and computer role-playing games. Notable examples include &quot;Skies of Arcadia&quot;, &quot;Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

One of the first steampunk novels set in a Middle-earth-like world was the &quot;Forest of Boland Light Railway&quot; by BB, about gnomes who build a steam locomotive. Fifty years later, Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld novel &quot;Raising Steam,&quot; about the ongoing industrial revolution and railway mania in Ankh-Morpork.

The gnomes and goblins in &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; also have technological societies that could be described as steampunk, as they are vastly ahead of the technologies of men, but still run on steam and mechanical power.

The Dwarves of the &quot;Elder Scrolls&quot; series, described therein as a race of Elves called the Dwemer, also use steam-powered machinery, with gigantic brass-like gears, throughout their underground cities. However, magical means are used to keep ancient devices in motion despite the Dwemer&#x27;s ancient disappearance.

The 1998 game &quot;&quot;, as well as the other sequels including its 2014 reboot, feature heavy steampunk-inspired architecture, setting, and technology.

Amidst the historical and fantasy subgenres of steampunk is a type that takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy equivalent of our future involving the domination of steampunk-style technology and aesthetics. Examples include Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro&#x27;s &quot;The City of Lost Children&quot; (1995), &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; (1999–2000), &quot;Trigun&quot;, and Disney&#x27;s film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002). In 2011, musician Thomas Dolby heralded his return to music after a 20-year hiatus with an online steampunk alternate fantasy world called the Floating City, to promote his album &quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot;.

====American West====
Another setting is &quot;Western&quot; steampunk, which overlaps with both the weird West and science fiction Western subgenres. One of the earliest steampunk books set in America was &quot;The Steam Man of the Prairies&quot; by Edward S. Ellis. Recent examples include the TV show &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; and the movie adaption &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, the Italian comics about Magico Vento, and Devon Monk&#x27;s &quot;Dead Iron.&quot;

====Fantasy and horror====
Kaja Foglio introduced the term &quot;Gaslight Romance&quot;, gaslamp fantasy, which John Clute and John Grant define as &quot;steampunk stories ... most commonly set in a romanticised, smoky, 19th-century London, as are Gaslight Romances. But the latter category focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century—on Dracula, Jekyll and Hyde, Jack the Ripper, Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan—and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and recursive fantasy, though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history.&quot; Author/artist James Richardson-Brown coined the term &quot;steamgoth&quot; to refer to steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a &quot;darker&quot; bent.

====Post-apocalyptic====
Mary Shelley&#x27;s &quot;The Last Man&quot;, set near the end of the 21st century after a plague had brought down civilization, was probably the ancestor of post-apocalyptic steampunk literature. Post-apocalyptic steampunk is set in a world where some cataclysm has precipitated the fall of civilization and steam power is once again ascendant, such as in Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s post-apocalyptic anime &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978, loosely based on Alexander Key&#x27;s &quot;The Incredible Tide&quot; (1970)), where a war fought with superweapons has devastated the planet. Robert Brown&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Wrath of Fate&quot; (as well as much of Abney Park&#x27;s music) is set in a Victorianesque world where an apocalypse was set into motion by a time-traveling mishap. Cherie Priest&#x27;s Boneshaker series is set in a world where a zombie apocalypse happened during the Civil War era. &quot;The Peshawar Lancers&quot; by S.M. Stirling is set in a post-apocalyptic future in which a meteor shower in 1878 caused the collapse of industrialized civilization. The movie 9 (which might be better classified as &quot;stitchpunk&quot; but was largely influenced by steampunk) is also set in a post-apocalyptic world after a self-aware war machine ran amok. &quot;Steampunk Magazine&quot; even published a book called &quot;A Steampunk&#x27;s Guide to the Apocalypse&quot;, about how steampunks could survive should such a thing actually happen.

====Victorian====

In general, this category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period (sometimes an alternate history version of an actual historical period) in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun, but electricity is not yet widespread, &quot;usually Britain of the early to mid-nineteenth century or the fantasized Wild West-era United States&quot;, with an emphasis on steam- or spring-propelled gadgets. The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and Edwardian eras, though some in this &quot;Victorian steampunk&quot; category are set as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and as late as the end of World War I.

Some examples of this type include the novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot;, the comic book series &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, the Disney animated film &quot;&quot;, Scott Westerfeld&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; trilogy, and the roleplaying game &quot;.&quot; The anime film &quot;Steamboy&quot; (2004) is another example of Victorian steampunk, taking place in an alternate 1866 where steam technology is far more advanced than reality. Some, such as the comic series &quot;Girl Genius&quot;, have their own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic settings. Other comic series are set in a more familiar London, as in the &quot;Victorian Undead&quot;, which has Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Watson, and others taking on zombies, Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, and Count Dracula, with advanced weapons and devices. Another example of this genre is the &quot;Tunnels&quot; novels by Roderick Gordon and Brian Williams. These are set in the modern day, but with an underground Victorian world that is working to overthrow the world above. Detective graphic novel series Lady Mechanika is set in an alternative Victorian-like world.

Karel Zeman&#x27;s film &quot;The Fabulous World of Jules Verne&quot; (1958) is a very early example of cinematic steampunk. Based on Jules Verne novels, Zeman&#x27;s film imagines a past that never was, based on those novels. Other early examples of historical steampunk in cinema include Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s anime films such as &quot;&quot; (1986) and &quot;Howl&#x27;s Moving Castle&quot; (2004), which contain many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the steampunk genre.

&quot;Historical&quot; steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy, but a number of historical steampunk stories have incorporated magical elements as well. For example, &quot;Morlock Night&quot;, written by K. W. Jeter, revolves around an attempt by the wizard Merlin to raise King Arthur to save the Britain of 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future.

Paul Guinan&#x27;s &quot;Boilerplate&quot;, a &quot;biography&quot; of a robot in the late 19th century, began as a website that garnered international press coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real. The site was adapted into the illustrated hardbound book &quot;Boilerplate: History&#x27;s Mechanical Marvel&quot;, which was published by Abrams in October 2009. Because the story was not set in an alternative history, and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian era, some booksellers referred to the tome as &quot;historical steampunk&quot;.

====East Asia====
Fictional settings inspired by East Asian rather than European history, especially those inspired by Chinese history, have been called &quot;silkpunk&quot;. The term originated with the author Ken Liu, who defined it as &quot;a blend of science fiction and fantasy [that] draws inspiration from classical East Asian antiquity&quot;, with a &quot;technology vocabulary (...) based on organic materials historically important to East Asia (bamboo, paper, silk) and seafaring cultures of the Pacific (coconut, feathers, coral)&quot;, rather than the brass and leather associated with steampunk. Liu used the term to describe his &quot;Dandelion Dynasty&quot; series, which began in 2015. Other works described as silkpunk include Neon Yang&#x27;s &quot;Tensorate&quot; series of novellas, which began in 2017. Lyndsie Manusos of Book Riot has argued that the genre does &quot;not fit in a direct analogy with steampunk. Silkpunk is technology and poetics. It is engineering and language.&quot;

===Music===
Steampunk music is very broadly defined. Abney Park&#x27;s lead singer Robert Brown defined it as &quot;mixing Victorian elements and modern elements&quot;. There is a broad range of musical influences that make up the steampunk sound, from industrial dance and world music to folk rock, dark cabaret to straightforward punk, Carnatic to industrial, hip-hop to opera (and even industrial hip-hop opera), darkwave to progressive rock, barbershop to big band.

Joshua Pfeiffer (of Vernian Process) is quoted as saying, &quot;As for Paul Roland, if anyone deserves credit for spearheading Steampunk music, it is him. He was one of the inspirations I had in starting my project. He was writing songs about the first attempt at manned flight, and an Edwardian airship raid in the mid-80s long before almost anyone else...&quot; Thomas Dolby is also considered one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist (i.e., Steampunk and Dieselpunk) music. Amanda Palmer was once quoted as saying, &quot;Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk!&quot;

Steampunk has also appeared in the work of musicians who do not specifically identify as steampunk. For example, the music video of &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, by David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj, takes place in a steampunk universe where Guetta creates human androids. Another music video is &quot;The Ballad of Mona Lisa&quot;, by Panic! at the Disco, which has a distinct Victorian steampunk theme. A continuation of this theme has been used throughout the 2011 album &quot;Vices &amp; Virtues&quot;, in the music videos, album art, and tour set and costumes. In addition, the album &quot;Clockwork Angels&quot; (2012) and its supporting tour by progressive rock band Rush contain lyrics, themes, and imagery based around steampunk. Similarly, Abney Park headlined the first &quot;Steamstock&quot; outdoor steampunk music festival in Richmond, California, which also featured Thomas Dolby, Frenchy and the Punk, Lee Presson and the Nails, Vernian Process, and others.

The music video for the Lindsey Stirling song &quot;Roundtable Rival&quot;, has a Western steampunk setting.

===Television and films===


&quot;The Fabulous World of Jules Verne&quot; (1958) and &quot;The Fabulous Baron Munchausen&quot; (1962), both directed by Karel Zeman, have steampunk elements. The 1965 television series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, as well as the 1999 film of the same name, features many elements of advanced steam-powered technology set in the Wild West time period of the United States. &quot;Two Years&#x27; Vacation&quot; (or &quot;The Stolen Airship&quot;) (1967) directed by Karel Zeman contains steampunk elements.

The BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; also incorporates steampunk elements. Several storylines can be classed as steampunk, most notably &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1966), wherein Victorian scientists invent a time travel device using mirrors and static electricity. During season 14 of the show (in 1976), the formerly futuristic looking interior set was replaced with a Victorian-styled wood-panel and brass affair. In the 1996 American co-production, the TARDIS interior was re-designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the central control console made up of an eclectic array of anachronistic objects. Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series, the TARDIS console continued to incorporate steampunk elements, including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone, for many years.

&quot;Dinner for Adele&quot; (1977) directed by Oldřich Lipský involves steampunk contraptions. The 1979 film &quot;Time After Time&quot; has Herbert George &quot;H.G.&quot; Wells following a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson into the future, as John is suspected of being Jack the Ripper. Both separately use Wells&#x27;s time machine to travel.

&quot;The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians&quot;, (1981) directed by Oldřich Lipský, contains steampunk elements. The 1982 American TV series &quot;Q.E.D.&quot; is set in Edwardian England, stars Sam Waterston as Professor Quentin Everett Deverill (from whose initials, by which he is primarily known, the series title is derived, initials which also stand for the Latin phrase &quot;quod erat demonstrandum&quot;, which translates as &quot;which was to be demonstrated&quot;). The Professor is an inventor and scientific detective, in the mold of Sherlock Holmes. The plot of the Soviet film &quot;Kin-dza-dza!&quot; (1986) centers on a desert planet, depleted of its resources, where an impoverished dog-eat-dog society uses steampunk machines, the movements and functions of which defy Earthly logic.

In making his 1986 Japanese film &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;, Hayao Miyazaki was heavily influenced by steampunk culture, the film featuring various airships and steampowered contraptions as well as a mysterious island that floats through the sky, accomplished not through magic as in most stories, but instead by harnessing the physical properties of a rare crystal—analogous to the lodestone used in the Laputa of Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;—augmented by massive propellers, as befitting the Victorian motif. The first &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit&quot; animation &quot;A Grand Day Out&quot; (1989) features a space rocket in the steampunk style.

The second half of &quot;Back to the Future III&quot; (1990) gradually evolves into steampunk.

&quot;The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.&quot;, a 1993 Fox Network TV science fiction-Western set in the 1890s, features elements of steampunk as represented by the character Professor Wickwire, whose inventions were described as &quot;the coming thing&quot;. The short-lived 1995 TV show &quot;Legend&quot;, on UPN, set in 1876 Arizona, features such classic inventions as a steam-driven &quot;quadrovelocipede&quot;, trigoggle and night-vision goggles (à la teslapunk), and stars John de Lancie as a thinly disguised Nikola Tesla.

Alan Moore&#x27;s and Kevin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 1999 &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; graphic novel series (and the subsequent 2003 film adaption) greatly popularised the steampunk genre.

&quot;Steamboy&quot; (2004) is a Japanese animated action film directed and co-written by Katsuhiro Otomo (&quot;Akira&quot;). It is a retro science-fiction epic set in a steampunk Victorian England. It features steamboats, trains, airships and inventors. The 2004 film &quot;Lemony Snicket&#x27;s A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; contains steampunk-esque elements such as costumes and vehicle interiors. The 2007 Syfy miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot; incorporates a considerable number of steampunk-inspired themes into a reimagining of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Despite leaning more towards Gothic influences, the &quot;parallel reality&quot; of Meanwhile, City, within the 2009 film &quot;Franklyn&quot; contains many steampunk themes, such as costumery, architecture, minimal use of electricity (with a preference for gaslight), and absence of modern technology (such as there being no motorised vehicles or advanced weaponry, and the manual management of information without computers).

The 2009–2014 Syfy television series &quot;Warehouse 13&quot; features many steampunk-inspired objects and artifacts, including computer designs created by steampunk artisan Richard Nagy, a.k.a. &quot;Datamancer&quot;. The 2010 episode of the TV series &quot;Castle&quot; entitled &quot;Punked&quot; (first aired October 11, 2010) prominently features the steampunk subculture and uses Los Angeles-area steampunks (such as the League of STEAM) as extras. The 2011 film &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; has many steampunk elements, including gadgets and airships.

&quot;The Legend of Korra&quot;, a 2012–2014 Nickelodeon animated series, incorporates steampunk elements in an industrialized world with East Asian themes.
The &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014) television series is a Gothic Victorian fantasy series with steampunk props and costumes.

The 2013–2014 ABC3 game show &quot;Steam Punks!&quot;, sees Paul Verhoeven playing The Inquisitor, who helps teams complete multiple challenges who have become trapped in a bizarre world controlled by an evil genius named The Machine.

The 2015 GSN reality television game show &quot;Steampunk&#x27;d&quot; features a competition to create steampunk-inspired art and designs which are judged by notable steampunks Thomas Willeford, Kato, and Matthew Yang King (as Matt King). Based on the work of cartoonist Jacques Tardi, &quot;April and the Extraordinary World&quot; (2015) is an animated movie set in a steampunk Paris.

The American fantasy animated sitcom, &quot;Disenchantment&quot;, created by Matt Groening for Netflix, features a steampunk country named Steamland, led by an odd industrialist named Alva Gunderson voiced by Richard Ayoade, first appears in the season 1 episode, &quot;The Electric Princess.&quot; The country is portrayed as driven by logic and is egalitarian, governed by science, rather than magic, as is the case for Dreamland, where the protagonist, Princess Bean, is from. The country has cars, automatic lights, submarines, and other modern technologies, all of which are steam-powered, and references to Groening&#x27;s other series, &quot;Futurama&quot;. Steamland appears in three episodes of the show&#x27;s second season, showing an explorers club as part of the country&#x27;s high society, flying zeppelins, and robots with light bulbs for heads that chase the protagonists through the streets. Some even argued that Steamland is &quot;dieselpunk-inspired.&quot;

The 2023 film &quot;Poor Things&quot; has been noted for its &quot;steampunk-infused&quot; production design.

===Video games===
A variety of styles of video games have used steampunk settings.

&quot;Steel Empire&quot; (1992), a shoot &#x27;em up game originally released as &quot;Koutetsu Teikoku&quot; on the Sega Mega Drive console in Japan, is considered to be the first steampunk video game. Designed by Yoshinori Satake and inspired by Hayao Miyazaki&#x27;s anime film &quot;&quot; (1986), &quot;Steel Empire&quot; is set in an alternate timeline dominated by steam-powered technology. The commercial success of &quot;Steel Empire&quot;, both in Japan and the West, helped propel steampunk into the video game market, and had a significant influence on later steampunk games. The most notable steampunk game it influenced is &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; (1994), a Japanese role-playing game developed by Squaresoft and designed by Hiroyuki Ito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; was both critically and commercially successful, and had a considerable influence on later steampunk video games.

&quot;The Chaos Engine&quot; (1993) is a run and gun video game inspired by the Gibson/Sterling novel &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; (1990), set in a Victorian steampunk age. Developed by the Bitmap Brothers, it was first released on the Amiga in 1993; a sequel was released in 1996. The graphic adventure puzzle video games &quot;Myst&quot; (1993), &quot;Riven&quot; (1997), &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot; (2001), and &quot;Myst IV: Revelation&quot; (all produced by or under the supervision of Cyan Worlds) take place in an alternate steampunk universe, where elaborate infrastructures have been built to run on steam power. &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; (since 1994, last release in 2014) is an action role-playing game where one can find an ancient extinct race called dwemers or dwarves, whose steampunk technology is based on steam-powered levers and gears made of copper-bronze material, which are maintained by magical techniques that have kept them in working order over the centuries.

&quot;Sakura Wars&quot; (1996), a visual novel and tactical role-playing game developed by Sega for the Saturn console, is set in a steampunk version of Japan during the Meiji and Taishō periods, and features steam-powered mecha robots. &quot;&quot; (1998), its sequels, &quot;Thief II&quot; (2000), &quot;&quot; (2004) and its reboot &quot;Thief&quot; (2014) are set in a steampunk metropolis. The 2001 computer role-playing game &quot;&quot; mixed fantasy tropes with steampunk.

The &quot;Professor Layton&quot; series of games (2007 debut) has several entries showcasing steampunk machinery and vehicles. Notably &quot;Professor Layton and the Unwound Future&quot; features a quasi-steampunk future setting. &quot;Solatorobo&quot; (2010) is a role-playing video game developed by CyberConnect2 set in a floating island archipelago populated by anthropomorphic cats and dogs, who pilot steampunk airships and engage in combat with robots. &quot;Resonance of Fate&quot; (2010) is a role-playing video game developed by tri-Ace and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is set in a steampunk environment with combat involving guns.

Developed by Relic Entertainment, it sees an adventurer building an army of genetically spliced animals to battle against a mad scientist who has abducted his father. The player&#x27;s headquarters is a steam-powered &quot;Hovertrain&quot; locomotive, which functions as both a science lab and mobile command center. Coal is a key resource in the game, and must be burned to provide power to the players many base buildings.

The &quot;SteamWorld&quot; series of games (2010 debut) has the player controlling steam-powered robots. &quot;Minecraft&quot; (2011) has a steampunk-themed texture pack. &quot;Terraria&quot; (2011) is a video game developed by Re-Logic. It is a 2D open world platform game in which the player controls a single character in a generated world. It has a Steampunker non-player character in the game who sells items referencing Steampunk. 
&quot;LittleBigPlanet 2&quot; (2011) has the world Victoria&#x27;s Laboratory, run by Victoria von Bathysphere, which mixes steampunk themes with confections. &quot;Guns of Icarus Online&quot; (2012) is multiplayer game with steampunk themes.

&quot;Dishonored&quot; is a series (2012 debut) of stealth games with role-playing elements developed by Arkane Studios and widely considered to be a spiritual successor of the original &quot;Thief&quot; trilogy. Set in the Empire of the Isles, a steampunk Victorian metropolis where technology and supernatural magic coexist. Steam-powered robots and mechanical combat suits are present as enemies, as well as the presence of magic. The major locations in the Isles include Dunwall, the Empire&#x27;s capital city which uses the burning of whale oil as the city&#x27;s main fuel source, and Karnaca, which is powered by wind turbines fed by currents generated by a cleft mountain along the city&#x27;s borders.

&quot;BioShock Infinite&quot; (2013) is a first-person shooter game set in 1912, in a fictional city called Columbia, which uses technology to float in the sky and has many historical and religious scenes.

Players build a colony and attempt to ward off waves of zombies. &quot;Frostpunk&quot; (2018) is a city-building game set in 1888, but where the Earth is in the midst of a great Ice Age. Players must construct a city around a large steampunk heat generator with many steampunk aesthetics and mechanics, such as a &quot;Steam Core.&quot;

==Culture and community==
Because of the popularity of steampunk, there is a growing movement of adults that want to establish steampunk as a culture and lifestyle. Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion, home decor, music, and film. While Steampunk is considered the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies, it can be more broadly categorised as neo-Victorianism, described by scholar Marie-Luise Kohlke as &quot;the afterlife of the nineteenth century in the cultural imaginary&quot;. The subculture has its own magazine, blogs, and online shops.

In September 2012, a panel, chaired by steampunk entertainer Veronique Chevalier and with panelists including magician Pop Hadyn and members of the steampunk performance group the League of STEAM, was held at Stan Lee&#x27;s Comikaze Expo. The panel suggested that because steampunk was inclusive of and incorporated ideas from various other subcultures such as goth, neo-Victorian, and cyberpunk, as well as a growing number of fandoms, it was fast becoming a &quot;super-culture&quot; rather than a mere subculture. Other steampunk notables such as Professor Elemental have expressed similar views about steampunk&#x27;s inclusive diversity.

Some have proposed a steampunk philosophy that incorporates punk-inspired anti-establishment sentiments typically bolstered by optimism about human potential. A 2004 &quot;Steampunk Manifesto,&quot; later republished in &quot;SteamPunk Magazine&quot;, lamented that most &quot;so-called&quot; steampunk was nothing more than dressed-up recreationary nostalgia and proposed that &quot;authentic&quot; steampunk would &quot;take the levers of technology from the [technocrats] and powerful.&quot; American activist and performer Miriam Rosenberg Rocek impersonated anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman to inspire discussions around gender, society and politics. &quot;SteamPunk Magazine&quot; was edited and published by anarchists. Its founder, Margaret Killjoy, argued &quot;there have always been radical politics at the core of steampunk.&quot; Diana M. Pho, a science-fiction editor and author of the multicultural steampunk blog &quot;Beyond Victoriana&quot;, similarly argued steampunk&#x27;s &quot;progressive roots&quot; can be traced to its literary inspirations, including Verne&#x27;s Captain Nemo. Steampunk authors Phenderson Djèlí Clark, Jaymee Goh, Dru Pagliassotti, and Charlie Stross consider their work political.

These views are not universally shared. Killjoy lamented that even some diehard enthusiasts believe steampunk &quot;has nothing to offer but designer clothes.&quot; Pho argued many steampunk fans &quot;don&#x27;t like to acknowledge that their attitudes could be considered ideological.&quot; The largest online steampunk community, &quot;Brass Goggles&quot;, which is dedicated to what it calls the &quot;lighter side&quot; of steampunk, banned discussion about politics. Cory Gross, who was one of the first to write about the history and theory of steampunk, argued that the &quot;sepia-toned yesteryear more appropriate for Disney and grandparents than a vibrant and viable philosophy or culture&quot; denounced in the &quot;Steampunk Manifesto&quot; was in fact representative of the genre. Author Catherynne M. Valente called the punk in steampunk &quot;nearly meaningless.&quot; Kate Franklin and James Schafer, who at the time managed one of the largest steampunk groups on Facebook, admitted in 2011 that steampunk hadn&#x27;t created the &quot;revolutionary, or even a particularly progressive&quot; community they wanted. Blogger and podcaster Eric Renderking Fisk announced in 2017 that steampunk was no longer punk, since it had &quot;lost the anti-authoritarian, anti-establishment aspects.&quot;

Others argued explicitly against turning steampunk into a political movement, preferring to see steampunk as &quot;escapism&quot; or a &quot;fandom&quot;. In 2018, Nick Ottens, editor of the online alternate-history magazine &quot;Never Was&quot;, declared that the &quot;lighter side&quot; of steampunk had won out. To the extent that steampunk is politicized, it appears to be an American and British phenomenon. Continental Europeans and Latin Americans are more likely to consider steampunk a hobby than a cause.

===Social events===
June 19, 2005 marked the grand opening of the world&#x27;s first steampunk club night, Malediction Society, in Los Angeles. The event ran for nearly 12 years at The Monte Cristo nightclub, interrupted by a single year residency at Argyle Hollywood, until both the club night and The Monte Cristo closed in April 2017. Though the steampunk aesthetic eventually gave way to a more generic goth and industrial aesthetic, Malediction Society celebrated its roots every year with &quot;The Steampunk Ball&quot;.

The year 2006 saw the first &quot;SalonCon&quot;, a neo-Victorian/steampunk convention. It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists, musicians (Voltaire and Abney Park), and authors (Catherynne M. Valente, Ekaterina Sedia, and G. D. Falksen). It also featured salons led by people prominent in their respective fields, workshops and panels on steampunk, and a seance, ballroom dance instruction, and the Chrononauts&#x27; Parade. The event was covered by MTV and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Since then, a number of popular steampunk conventions have sprung up the world over, with names like Steamcon (Seattle), the Steampunk World&#x27;s Fair (Piscataway, New Jersey), Up in the Aether: The Steampunk Convention (Dearborn, Michigan), Steampunk NZ (Oamaru, New Zealand), Steampunk Unlimited (Strasburg Railroad, Lancaster, PA). Each year, on Mother&#x27;s Day weekend, the city of Waltham, MA, turns over its city center and surrounding areas to host the Watch City Steampunk Festival, a US outdoor steampunk festival. In Kennebunk, ME the Brick Store Museum hosts the Southern Maine Steampunk Fair annually. During the first weekend of May, the Australian town of Nimmitabel celebrates Steampunk @ Altitude with some 2,000 people in attendance.
In recent years, steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic-Con, with the Saturday of the four-day event being generally known among steampunks as &quot;Steampunk Day&quot;, and culminating with a photo-shoot for the local press. In 2010, this was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s largest steampunk photo shoot. In 2013, Comic-Con announced four official 2013 T-shirts, one of them featuring the official Rick Geary Comic-Con toucan mascot in steampunk attire. The Saturday steampunk &quot;after-party&quot; has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar: in 2010, the headliners included The Slow Poisoner, Unextraordinary Gentlemen, and Aurelio Voltaire, with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies and special appearance by the League of STEAM; in 2011, UXG returned with Abney Park.

Steampunk has also sprung up recently at Renaissance Festivals and Renaissance Faires, in the US. Some festivals have organised events or a &quot;Steampunk Day&quot;, while others simply support an open environment for donning steampunk attire. The Bristol Renaissance Faire in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on the Wisconsin/Illinois border, featured a Steampunk costume contest during the 2012 season, the previous two seasons having seen increasing participation in the phenomenon.

Steampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe. The largest European event is &quot;Weekend at the Asylum&quot;, held at The Lawn, Lincoln, every September since 2009. Organised as a not-for-profit event by the Ministry of Steampunk (formerly Victorian Steampunk Society), the Asylum is a dedicated steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln, England, along with Lincoln Castle. In 2011, there were over 1,000 steampunks in attendance. The event features the Empire Ball, Majors Review, Bazaar Eclectica, and the international Tea Duelling final.
 The Surrey Steampunk Convivial was originally held in New Malden, but since 2019 has been held in Stoneleigh in southwestern London, within walking distance of H. G. Wells&#x27;s home. The Surrey Steampunk Convivial started as an annual event in 2012, and now takes place thrice a year, and has spanned three boroughs and five venues. Attendees have been interviewed by BBC Radio 4 for Phill Jupitus and filmed by the BBC World Service. The West Yorkshire village of Haworth has held an annual Steampunk weekend since 2013, on each occasion as a charity event raising funds for Sue Ryder&#x27;s &quot;Manorlands&quot; hospice in Oxenhope. In September 2021, Finland&#x27;s first steampunk festival was held at the Väinö Linna Square and the Werstas Workers&#x27; House in Tampere, Pirkanmaa, Finland.

===Other===

A 2018 physics Ph.D. dissertation used the phrase &quot;Quantum Steampunk&quot; to describe the author&#x27;s synthesis of some 19th century and current ideas. The term has not been widely adopted.

A 2012 conference paper on human factors in computing systems examined the use of steampunk as a design fiction for human-computer interaction (HCI). It concludes that &quot;the practices of DIY and appropriation that are evident in Steampunk design provide a useful set of design strategies and implications for HCI&quot;.

<text>A spreadsheet is a computer application for computation, organization, analysis and storage of data in tabular form. Spreadsheets were developed as computerized analogs of paper accounting worksheets. The program operates on data entered in cells of a table. Each cell may contain either numeric or text data, or the results of formulas that automatically calculate and display a value based on the contents of other cells. The term &quot;spreadsheet&quot; may also refer to one such electronic document.

Spreadsheet users can adjust any stored value and observe the effects on calculated values. This makes the spreadsheet useful for &quot;what-if&quot; analysis since many cases can be rapidly investigated without manual recalculation. Modern spreadsheet software can have multiple interacting sheets and can display data either as text and numerals or in graphical form.

Besides performing basic arithmetic and mathematical functions, modern spreadsheets provide built-in functions for common financial accountancy and statistical operations. Such calculations as net present value or standard deviation can be applied to tabular data with a pre-programmed function in a formula. Spreadsheet programs also provide conditional expressions, functions to convert between text and numbers, and functions that operate on strings of text.

Spreadsheets have replaced paper-based systems throughout the business world. Although they were first developed for accounting or bookkeeping tasks, they now are used extensively in any context where tabular lists are built, sorted, and shared.

== Basics ==

LANPAR, available in 1969, was the first electronic spreadsheet on mainframe and time sharing computers. LANPAR was an acronym: LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random. VisiCalc (1979) was the first electronic spreadsheet on a microcomputer, and it helped turn the Apple II into a popular and widely used personal computer. Lotus 1-2-3 was the leading spreadsheet when DOS was the dominant operating system. Microsoft Excel now has the largest market share on the Windows and Macintosh platforms. A spreadsheet program is a standard feature of an office productivity suite. In 2006 Google launched a beta release spreadsheet web application, this is currently known as Google Sheets and one of the applications provided in Google Drive.

A spreadsheet consists of a table of &quot;cells&quot; arranged into rows and columns and referred to by the X and Y locations. X locations, the columns, are normally represented by letters, &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; &quot;C,&quot; etc., while rows are normally represented by numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc. A single cell can be referred to by addressing its row and column, &quot;C10&quot;. This electronic concept of cell references was first introduced in LANPAR (Language for Programming Arrays at Random) (co-invented by Rene Pardo and Remy Landau) and a variant used in VisiCalc and known as &quot;A1 notation&quot;. 
Additionally, spreadsheets have the concept of a &quot;range&quot;, a group of cells, normally contiguous. For instance, one can refer to the first ten cells in the first column with the range &quot;A1:A10&quot;. LANPAR innovated forward referencing/natural order calculation which didn&#x27;t re-appear until Lotus 123 and Microsoft&#x27;s MultiPlan Version 2.

In modern spreadsheet applications, several spreadsheets, often known as &quot;worksheets&quot; or simply &quot;sheets&quot;, are gathered together to form a &quot;workbook&quot;. A workbook is physically represented by a file containing all the data for the book, the sheets, and the cells with the sheets. Worksheets are normally represented by tabs that flip between pages, each one containing one of the sheets, although Numbers changes this model significantly. Cells in a multi-sheet book add the sheet name to their reference, for instance, &quot;Sheet 1!C10&quot;. Some systems extend this syntax to allow cell references to different workbooks.

Users interact with sheets primarily through the cells. A given cell can hold data by simply entering it in, or a formula, which is normally created by preceding the text with an equals sign. Data might include the string of text codice_1, the number codice_2 or the date codice_3. A formula would begin with the equals sign, codice_4, but this would normally be invisible because the display shows the &quot;result&quot; of the calculation, codice_5 in this case, not the formula itself. This may lead to confusion in some cases.

The key feature of spreadsheets is the ability for a formula to refer to the contents of other cells, which may, in turn, be the result of a formula. To make such a formula, one replaces a number with a cell reference. For instance, the formula codice_6 would produce the result of multiplying the value in cell C10 by the number 5. If C10 holds the value codice_7 the result will be codice_5. But C10 might also hold its formula referring to other cells, and so on.
The ability to chain formulas together is what gives a spreadsheet its power. Many problems can be broken down into a series of individual mathematical steps, and these can be assigned to individual formulas in cells. Some of these formulas can apply to ranges as well, like the codice_9 function that adds up all the numbers within a range.

Spreadsheets share many principles and traits of databases, but spreadsheets and databases are not the same things. A spreadsheet is essentially just one table, whereas a database is a collection of many tables with machine-readable semantic relationships. While it is true that a workbook that contains three sheets is indeed a file containing multiple tables that can interact with each other, it lacks the relational structure of a database. Spreadsheets and databases are interoperable—sheets can be imported into databases to become tables within them, and database queries can be exported into spreadsheets for further analysis.

A spreadsheet program is one of the main components of an office productivity suite, which usually also contains a word processor, a presentation program, and a database management system. Programs within a suite use similar commands for similar functions. Usually, sharing data between the components is easier than with a non-integrated collection of functionally equivalent programs. This was particularly an advantage at a time when many personal computer systems used text-mode displays and commands instead of a graphical user interface.

== History ==

=== Paper spreadsheets ===

Humans have organized data into tables, that is, grids of columns and rows, since ancient times. The Babylonians used clay tablets to store data as far back as 1800 BCE. Other examples can be found in book-keeping ledgers and astronomical records.

Since at least 1906 the term &quot;spread sheet&quot; has been used in accounting to mean a grid of columns and rows in a ledger. And prior to the rise of computerized spreadsheets, &quot;spread&quot; referred to a newspaper or magazine item (text or graphics) that covers two facing pages, extending across the centerfold and treating the two pages as one large page. The compound word &#x27;spread-sheet&#x27; came to mean the format used to present book-keeping ledgers—with columns for categories of expenditures across the top, invoices listed down the left margin, and the amount of each payment in the cell where its row and column intersect—which were, traditionally, a &quot;spread&quot; across facing pages of a bound ledger (book for keeping accounting records) or on oversized sheets of paper (termed &#x27;analysis paper&#x27;) ruled into rows and columns in that format and approximately twice as wide as ordinary paper.

=== Electronic spreadsheets ===

==== Batch spreadsheet report generator BSRG ====
A batch &quot;spreadsheet&quot; is indistinguishable from a batch compiler with added input data, producing an output report, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a 4GL or conventional, non-interactive, batch computer program. However, this concept of an electronic spreadsheet was outlined in the 1961 paper &quot;Budgeting Models and System Simulation&quot; by Richard Mattessich. The subsequent work by Mattessich (1964a, Chpt. 9, &quot;Accounting and Analytical Methods&quot;) and its companion volume, Mattessich (1964b, &quot;Simulation of the Firm through a Budget Computer Program&quot;) applied computerized spreadsheets to accounting and budgeting systems (on mainframe computers programmed in FORTRAN IV). These batch Spreadsheets dealt primarily with the addition or subtraction of entire columns or rows (of input variables), rather than individual &quot;cells&quot;.

In 1962, this concept of the spreadsheet, called BCL for Business Computer Language, was implemented on an IBM 1130 and in 1963 was ported to an IBM 7040 by R. Brian Walsh at Marquette University, Wisconsin. This program was written in Fortran. Primitive timesharing was available on those machines. In 1968 BCL was ported by Walsh to the IBM 360/67 timesharing machine at Washington State University. It was used to assist in the teaching of finance to business students. Students were able to take information prepared by the professor and manipulate it to represent it and show ratios etc. In 1964, a book entitled &quot;Business Computer Language&quot; was written by Kimball, Stoffells and Walsh. Both the book and program were copyrighted in 1966 and years later that copyright was renewed.

Applied Data Resources had a FORTRAN preprocessor called Empires.

In the late 1960s, Xerox used BCL to develop a more sophisticated version for their timesharing system.

==== LANPAR spreadsheet compiler ====
A key invention in the development of electronic spreadsheets was made by Rene K. Pardo and Remy Landau, who filed in 1970 on a spreadsheet automatic natural order calculation algorithm. While the patent was initially rejected by the patent office as being a purely mathematical invention, following 12 years of appeals, Pardo and Landau won a landmark court case at the Predecessor Court of the Federal Circuit (CCPA), overturning the Patent Office in 1983 — establishing that &quot;something does not cease to become patentable merely because the point of novelty is in an algorithm.&quot; However, in 1995 a federal district court ruled the patent unenforceable due to inequitable conduct by the inventors during the application process. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld that decision in 1996.

The actual software was called LANPAR — LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random. This was conceived and entirely developed in the summer of 1969, following Pardo and Landau&#x27;s recent graduation from Harvard University. Co-inventor Rene Pardo recalls that he felt that one manager at Bell Canada should not have to depend on programmers to program and modify budgeting forms, and he thought of letting users type out forms in any order and having an electronic computer calculate results in the right order (&quot;Forward Referencing/Natural Order Calculation&quot;). Pardo and Landau developed and implemented the software in 1969.

LANPAR was used by Bell Canada, AT&amp;T, and the 18 operating telephone companies nationwide for their local and national budgeting operations. LANPAR was also used by General Motors. Its uniqueness was Pardo&#x27;s co-invention incorporating forward referencing/natural order calculation (one of the first &quot;non-procedural&quot; computer languages) as opposed to left-to-right, top to bottom sequence for calculating the results in each cell that was used by VisiCalc, SuperCalc, and the first version of MultiPlan. Without forward referencing/natural order calculation, the user had to refresh the spreadsheet until the values in all cells remained unchanged. Once the cell values stayed constant, the user was assured that there were no remaining forward references within the spreadsheet.

==== Autoplan/Autotab spreadsheet programming language ====
In 1968, three former employees from the General Electric computer company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona set out to start their own software development house. A. Leroy Ellison, Harry N. Cantrell, and Russell E. Edwards found themselves doing a large number of calculations when making tables for the business plans that they were presenting to venture capitalists. They decided to save themselves a lot of effort and wrote a computer program that produced their tables for them. This program, originally conceived as a simple utility for their personal use, would turn out to be the first software product offered by the company that would become known as Capex Corporation. &quot;AutoPlan&quot; ran on GE&#x27;s Time-sharing service; afterward, a version that ran on IBM mainframes was introduced under the name &quot;AutoTab&quot;. (National CSS offered a similar product, CSSTAB, which had a moderate timesharing user base by the early 1970s. A major application was opinion research tabulation.)

AutoPlan/AutoTab was not a WYSIWYG interactive spreadsheet program, it was a simple scripting language for spreadsheets. The user defined the names and labels for the rows and columns, then the formulas that defined each row or column. In 1975, Autotab-II was advertised as extending the original to a maximum of &quot;1,500 rows and columns, combined in any proportion the user requires...&quot;

GE Information Services, which operated the time-sharing service, also launched its own spreadsheet system, Financial Analysis Language (FAL), circa 1974. It was later supplemented by an additional spreadsheet language, TABOL, which was developed by an independent author, Oliver Vellacott in the UK. Both FAL and TABOL were integrated with GEIS&#x27;s database system, DMS.

==== IBM Financial Planning and Control System ====
The IBM Financial Planning and Control System was developed in 1976, by Brian Ingham at IBM Canada. It was implemented by IBM in at least 30 countries. It ran on an IBM mainframe and was the first application for financial planning developed with APL that completely hid the programming language from the end-user. Through IBM&#x27;s VM operating system, it was among the first programs to auto-update each copy of the application as new versions were released. Users could specify simple mathematical relationships between rows and between columns. Compared to any contemporary alternatives, it could support very large spreadsheets. It loaded actual financial planning data drawn from the legacy batch system into each user&#x27;s spreadsheet monthly. It was designed to optimize the power of APL through object kernels, increasing program efficiency by as much as 50 fold over traditional programming approaches.

==== APLDOT modeling language ====
An example of an early &quot;industrial weight&quot; spreadsheet was APLDOT, developed in 1976 at the United States Railway Association on an IBM 360/91, running at The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, MD. The application was used successfully for many years in developing such applications as financial and costing models for the US Congress and for Conrail. APLDOT was dubbed a &quot;spreadsheet&quot; because financial analysts and strategic planners used it to solve the same problems they addressed with paper spreadsheet pads.

=== VisiCalc for the Apple II===
The concept of spreadsheets became widely known due to VisiCalc, developed for the Apple II in 1979 by VisiCorp staff Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston.
Significantly, it also turned the personal computer from a hobby for computer enthusiasts into a business tool.

VisiCalc was the first spreadsheet that combined many of the essential features of modern spreadsheet applications, such as a WYSIWYG interactive user interface, automatic recalculation, status and formula lines, range copying with relative and absolute references, and formula building by selecting referenced cells. Unaware of LANPAR at the time, &quot;PC World&quot; magazine called VisiCalc the first electronic spreadsheet.

Bricklin has spoken of watching his university professor create a table of calculation results on a blackboard. When the professor found an error, he had to tediously erase and rewrite several sequential entries in the table, triggering Bricklin to think that he could replicate the process on a computer, using the blackboard as the model to view results of underlying formulas. His idea became VisiCalc.

VisiCalc for the Apple II went on to become the first killer application, a program so compelling, people would buy a particular computer just to use it. It was ported to other computers, including CP/M machines, Atari 8-bit computers, and the Commodore PET, but VisiCalc remains best known as an Apple II program.

=== SuperCalc for CP/M ===

SuperCalc was a spreadsheet application published by Sorcim in 1980, and originally bundled (along with WordStar) as part of the CP/M software package included with the Osborne 1 portable computer. It quickly became the de facto standard spreadsheet for CP/M.

=== Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet for IBM PC DOS ===
The introduction of Lotus 1-2-3 in November 1982 accelerated the acceptance of the IBM Personal Computer. It was written especially for IBM PC DOS and had improvements in speed and graphics compared to VisiCalc on the Apple II, this helped it grow in popularity. Lotus 1-2-3 was the leading spreadsheet for several years.

=== Microsoft Excel for Apple Macintosh and Windows===

Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Apple Macintosh on September 30, 1985, and then ported it to Windows, with the first version being numbered 2.05 (to synchronize with the Macintosh version 2.2) and released in November 1987. Microsoft&#x27;s Windows 3.x platforms of the early 1990s made it possible for their Excel spreadsheet application to take market share from Lotus. By the time Lotus responded with usable Windows products, Microsoft had begun to assemble their Office suite. By 1995, Excel was the market leader, edging out Lotus 1-2-3, and in 2013, IBM discontinued Lotus 1-2-3 altogether.

=== Google Sheets, Online, Web-based spreadsheets ===

In 2006 Google launched their beta release Google Sheets, a web based spreadsheet application that can be accessed by multiple users from any device type using a compatible web browser, it can be used online and offline (with or without internet connectivity). Google Sheets originated from a web-based spreadsheet application XL2Web developed by 2Web Technologies, combined with DocVerse which enabled multiple-user online collaboration of Office documents.

In 2016 Collabora Online Calc was launched, notable in that the web based spreadsheet could be hosted and integrated into any environment without dependency on a 3rd party for authentication or maintenance. Collabora Online runs LibreOffice kit at its core, which grew from StarOffice that was launched in 1985.

=== Mainframe spreadsheets ===
*The Works Records System at ICI developed in 1974 on IBM 370/145
*ExecuCalc, from Parallax Systems, Inc.: Released in late 1982, ExecuCalc was the first mainframe &quot;visi-clone&quot; which duplicated the features of VisiCalc on IBM mainframes with 3270 display terminals. Over 150 copies were licensed (35 to Fortune 500 companies). DP managers were attracted to compatibility and avoiding then-expensive PC purchases (see 1983 &quot;Computerworld&quot; magazine front page article and advertisement.)

=== Other products ===
Several companies have attempted to break into the spreadsheet market with programs based on very different paradigms. Lotus introduced what is likely the most successful example, Lotus Improv, which saw some commercial success, notably in the financial world where its powerful data mining capabilities remain well respected to this day.

Spreadsheet 2000 attempted to dramatically simplify formula construction, but was generally not successful.

== Concepts ==
The main concepts are those of a grid of cells, called a sheet, with either raw data, called values, or formulas in the cells. Formulas say how to mechanically compute new values from existing values. Values are general numbers, but can also be pure text, dates, months, etc. Extensions of these concepts include logical spreadsheets. Various tools for programming sheets, visualizing data, remotely connecting sheets, displaying cells&#x27; dependencies, etc. are commonly provided.

=== Cells ===
A &quot;cell&quot; can be thought of as a box for holding data. A single cell is usually referenced by its column and row (C2 would represent the cell containing the value 30 in the example table below). Usually rows, representing the dependent variables, are referenced in decimal notation starting from 1, while columns representing the independent variables use 26-adic bijective numeration using the letters A-Z as numerals. Its physical size can usually be tailored to its content by dragging its height or width at box intersections (or for entire columns or rows by dragging the column- or row-headers).

An array of cells is called a &quot;sheet&quot; or &quot;worksheet&quot;. It is analogous to an array of variables in a conventional computer program (although certain unchanging values, once entered, could be considered, by the same analogy, constants). In most implementations, many worksheets may be located within a single spreadsheet. A worksheet is simply a subset of the spreadsheet divided for the sake of clarity. Functionally, the spreadsheet operates as a whole and all cells operate as global variables within the spreadsheet (each variable having &#x27;read&#x27; access only except its containing cell).

A cell may contain a value or a formula, or it may simply be left empty.
By convention, formulas usually begin with = sign.

==== Values ====
A value can be entered from the computer keyboard by directly typing into the cell itself. Alternatively, a value can be based on a formula (see below), which might perform a calculation, display the current date or time, or retrieve external data such as a stock quote or a database value.

The Spreadsheet &quot;Value Rule&quot;

Computer scientist Alan Kay used the term &quot;value rule&quot; to summarize a spreadsheet&#x27;s operation: a cell&#x27;s value relies solely on the formula the user has typed into the cell. The formula may rely on the value of other cells, but those cells are likewise restricted to user-entered data or formulas. There are no &#x27;side effects&#x27; to calculating a formula: the only output is to display the calculated result inside its occupying cell. There is no natural mechanism for permanently modifying the contents of a cell unless the user manually modifies the cell&#x27;s contents. In the context of programming languages, this yields a limited form of first-order functional programming.
==== Automatic recalculation ====
A standard of spreadsheets since the 1980s, this optional feature eliminates the need to manually request the spreadsheet program to recalculate values (nowadays typically the default option unless specifically &#x27;switched off&#x27; for large spreadsheets, usually to improve performance). Some earlier spreadsheets required a manual request to recalculate since the recalculation of large or complex spreadsheets often reduced data entry speed. Many modern spreadsheets still retain this option.

Recalculation generally requires that there are no circular dependencies in a spreadsheet. A dependency graph is a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. Dependency graphs without circular dependencies form directed acyclic graphs, representations of partial orderings (in this case, across a spreadsheet) that can be relied upon to give a definite result.

==== Real-time update ====
This feature refers to updating a cell&#x27;s contents periodically with a value from an external source—such as a cell in a &quot;remote&quot; spreadsheet. For shared, Web-based spreadsheets, it applies to &quot;immediately&quot; updating cells another user has updated. All dependent cells must be updated also.

==== Locked cell ====
Once entered, selected cells (or the entire spreadsheet) can optionally be &quot;locked&quot; to prevent accidental overwriting. Typically this would apply to cells containing formulas but might apply to cells containing &quot;constants&quot; such as a kilogram/pounds conversion factor (2.20462262 to eight decimal places). Even though individual cells are marked as locked, the spreadsheet data are not protected until the feature is activated in the file preferences.

==== Data format ====
A cell or range can optionally be defined to specify how the value is displayed. The default display format is usually set by its initial content if not specifically previously set, so that for example &quot;31/12/2007&quot; or &quot;31 Dec 2007&quot; would default to the cell format of &quot;date&quot;.
Similarly adding a % sign after a numeric value would tag the cell as a percentage cell format. The cell contents are not changed by this format, only the displayed value.

Some cell formats such as &quot;numeric&quot; or &quot;currency&quot; can also specify the number of decimal places.

This can allow invalid operations (such as doing multiplication on a cell containing a date), resulting in illogical results without an appropriate warning.

==== Cell formatting ====
Depending on the capability of the spreadsheet application, each cell (like its counterpart the &quot;style&quot; in a word processor) can be separately formatted using the attributes of either the content (point size, color, bold or italic) or the cell (border thickness, background shading, color). To aid the readability of a spreadsheet, cell formatting may be conditionally applied to data; for example, a negative number may be displayed in red.

A cell&#x27;s formatting does not typically affect its content and depending on how cells are referenced or copied to other worksheets or applications, the formatting may not be carried with the content.

==== Named cells ====
In most implementations, a cell, or group of cells in a column or row, can be &quot;named&quot; enabling the user to refer to those cells by a name rather than by a grid reference. Names must be unique within the spreadsheet, but when using multiple sheets in a spreadsheet file, an identically named cell range on each sheet can be used if it is distinguished by adding the sheet name. One reason for this usage is for creating or running macros that repeat a command across many sheets. Another reason is that formulas with named variables are readily checked against the algebra they are intended to implement (they resemble Fortran expressions). The use of named variables and named functions also makes the spreadsheet structure more transparent.

===== Cell reference =====
In place of a named cell, an alternative approach is to use a cell (or grid) reference. Most cell references indicate another cell in the same spreadsheet, but a cell reference can also refer to a cell in a different sheet within the same spreadsheet, or (depending on the implementation) to a cell in another spreadsheet entirely, or a value from a remote application.

A typical cell reference in &quot;A1&quot; style consists of one or two case-insensitive letters to identify the column (if there are up to 256 columns: A–Z and AA–IV) followed by a row number (e.g., in the range 1–65536). Either part can be relative (it changes when the formula it is in is moved or copied), or absolute (indicated with $ in front of the part concerned of the cell reference). The alternative &quot;R1C1&quot; reference style consists of the letter R, the row number, the letter C, and the column number; relative row or column numbers are indicated by enclosing the number in square brackets. Most current spreadsheets use the A1 style, some providing the R1C1 style as a compatibility option.

When the computer calculates a formula in one cell to update the displayed value of that cell, cell reference(s) in that cell, naming some other cell(s), causes the computer to fetch the value of the named cell(s).

A cell on the same &quot;sheet&quot; is usually addressed as:

codice_10

A cell on a different sheet of the same spreadsheet is usually addressed as:

 =SHEET2!A1 (that is; the first cell in sheet 2 of the same spreadsheet).

Some spreadsheet implementations in Excel allow cell references to another spreadsheet (not the currently open and active file) on the same computer or a local network. It may also refer to a cell in another open and active spreadsheet on the same computer or network that is defined as shareable. These references contain the complete filename, such as:

 =&#x27;C:\Documents and Settings\Username\My spreadsheets\[main sheet]Sheet1!A1

In a spreadsheet, references to cells automatically update when new rows or columns are inserted or deleted. Care must be taken, however, when adding a row immediately before a set of column totals to ensure that the totals reflect the values of the additional rows—which they often do not.

A circular reference occurs when the formula in one cell refers—directly, or indirectly through a chain of cell references—to another cell that refers back to the first cell. Many common errors cause circular references. However, some valid techniques use circular references. These techniques, after many spreadsheet recalculations, (usually) converge on the correct values for those cells.

===== Cell ranges =====
Likewise, instead of using a named range of cells, a range reference can be used. Reference to a range of cells is typical of the form (A1:A6), which specifies all the cells in the range A1 through to A6. A formula such as &quot;=SUM(A1:A6)&quot; would add all the cells specified and put the result in the cell containing the formula itself.

=== Sheets ===
In the earliest spreadsheets, cells were a simple two-dimensional grid. Over time, the model has expanded to include a third dimension, and in some cases a series of named grids, called sheets. The most advanced examples allow inversion and rotation operations which can slice and project the data set in various ways.

=== Formulas ===
A formula identifies the calculation needed to place the result in the cell it is contained within. A cell containing a formula, therefore, has two display components; the formula itself and the resulting value. The formula is normally only shown when the cell is selected by &quot;clicking&quot; the mouse over a particular cell; otherwise, it contains the result of the calculation.

A formula assigns values to a cell or range of cells, and typically has the format:

where the expression consists of:
*values, such as codice_11, codice_12 or codice_13;
*references to other cells, such as, e.g., codice_14 for a single cell or codice_15 for a range;
*arithmetic operators, such as codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19, and others;
*relational operators, such as codice_20, codice_21, and others; and,
*functions, such as codice_22, codice_23, and many others.

When a cell contains a formula, it often contains references to other cells. Such a cell reference is a type of variable. Its value is the value of the referenced cell or some derivation of it. If that cell in turn references other cells, the value depends on the values of those. References can be relative (e.g., codice_14, or codice_15), absolute (e.g., codice_26, or codice_27) or mixed row– or column-wise absolute/relative (e.g., codice_28 is column-wise absolute and codice_29 is row-wise absolute).

The available options for valid formulas depend on the particular spreadsheet implementation but, in general, most arithmetic operations and quite complex nested conditional operations can be performed by most of today&#x27;s commercial spreadsheets. Modern implementations also offer functions to access custom-build functions, remote data, and applications.

A formula may contain a condition (or nested conditions)—with or without an actual calculation—and is sometimes used purely to identify and highlight errors. In the example below, it is assumed the sum of a column of percentages (A1 through A6) is tested for validity and an explicit message put into the adjacent right-hand cell.

:=IF(SUM(A1:A6) &gt; 100, &quot;More than 100%&quot;, SUM(A1:A6))

Further examples:
:=IF(AND(A1&lt;&gt;&quot;,B1&lt;&gt;&quot;),A1/B1,&quot;) means that if both cells A1 and B1 are not &lt;&gt; empty &quot;, then divide A1 by B1 and display, other do not display anything.
:=IF(AND(A1&lt;&gt;&quot;,B1&lt;&gt;&quot;),IF(B1&lt;&gt;0,A1/B1,&quot;Division by zero&quot;),&quot;&quot;) means that if cells A1 and B1 are not empty, and B1 is not zero, then divide A1 by B1, if B1 is zero, then display &quot;Division by zero&quot;, and do not display anything if either A1 and B1 are empty.
:=IF(OR(A1&lt;&gt;&quot;,B1&lt;&gt;&quot;),&quot;Either A1 or B1 show text&quot;,&quot;&quot;) means to display the text if either cells A1 or B1 are not empty.

The best way to build up conditional statements is step by step composing followed by trial and error testing and refining code.

A spreadsheet does not have to contain any formulas at all, in which case it could be considered merely a collection of data arranged in rows and columns (a database) like a calendar, timetable, or simple list. Because of its ease of use, formatting, and hyperlinking capabilities, many spreadsheets are used solely for this purpose.

=== Functions ===

Spreadsheets usually contain several supplied functions, such as arithmetic operations (for example, summations, averages, and so forth), trigonometric functions, statistical functions, and so forth. In addition there is often a provision for &quot;user-defined functions&quot;. In Microsoft Excel, these functions are defined using Visual Basic for Applications in the supplied Visual Basic editor, and such functions are automatically accessible on the worksheet. Also, programs can be written that pull information from the worksheet, perform some calculations, and report the results back to the worksheet. In the figure, the name &quot;sq&quot; is user-assigned, and the function &quot;sq&quot; is introduced using the &quot;Visual Basic&quot; editor supplied with Excel. &quot;Name Manager&quot; displays the spreadsheet definitions of named variables &quot;x&quot; &amp; &quot;y&quot;.

=== Subroutines ===

Functions themselves cannot write into the worksheet but simply return their evaluation. However, in Microsoft Excel, subroutines can write values or text found within the subroutine directly to the spreadsheet. The figure shows the Visual Basic code for a subroutine that reads each member of the named column variable &quot;x&quot;, calculates its square, and writes this value into the corresponding element of named column variable &quot;y&quot;. The &quot;y&quot; column contains no formula because its values are calculated in the subroutine, not on the spreadsheet, and simply are written in.

=== Remote spreadsheet ===
Whenever a reference is made to a cell or group of cells that are not located within the current physical spreadsheet file, it is considered as accessing a &quot;remote&quot; spreadsheet. The contents of the referenced cell may be accessed either on the first reference with a manual update or more recently in the case of web-based spreadsheets, as a near real-time value with a specified automatic refresh interval.

=== Charts ===

Many spreadsheet applications permit charts and graphs (e.g., histograms, pie charts) to be generated from specified groups of cells that are dynamically re-built as cell contents change. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet or added as a separate object. To create an Excel histogram, a formula based on the REPT function can be used.

=== Multi-dimensional spreadsheets ===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, first Javelin Software and Lotus Improv appeared. Unlike models in a conventional spreadsheet, they utilized models built on objects called variables, not on data in cells of a report. These multi-dimensional spreadsheets enabled viewing data and algorithms in various self-documenting ways, including simultaneous multiple synchronized views. For example, users of Javelin could move through the connections between variables on a diagram while seeing the logical roots and branches of each variable. This is an example of what is perhaps its primary contribution of the earlier Javelin—the concept of traceability of a user&#x27;s logic or model structure through its twelve views. A complex model can be dissected and understood by others who had no role in its creation.

In these programs, a time series, or any variable, was an object in itself, not a collection of cells that happen to appear in a row or column. Variables could have many attributes, including complete awareness of their connections to all other variables, data references, and text and image notes. Calculations were performed on these objects, as opposed to a range of cells, so adding two-time series automatically aligns them in calendar time, or in a user-defined time frame. Data were independent of worksheets—variables, and therefore data, could not be destroyed by deleting a row, column, or entire worksheet. For instance, January&#x27;s costs are subtracted from January&#x27;s revenues, regardless of where or whether either appears in a worksheet. This permits actions later used in pivot tables, except that flexible manipulation of report tables, was but one of many capabilities supported by variables. Moreover, if costs were entered by week and revenues by month, the program could allocate or interpolate as appropriate. This object design enabled variables and whole models to reference each other with user-defined variable names and to perform multidimensional analysis and massive, but easily editable consolidations.

Trapeze, a spreadsheet on the Mac, went further and explicitly supported
not just table columns, but also matrix operators.

=== Logical spreadsheets ===
Spreadsheets that have a formula language based upon logical expressions, rather than arithmetic expressions are known as logical spreadsheets. Such spreadsheets can be used to reason deductively about their cell values.

== Programming issues ==
Just as the early programming languages were designed to generate spreadsheet printouts, programming techniques themselves have evolved to process tables (also known as spreadsheets or matrices) of data more efficiently in the computer itself.

=== End-user development ===
Spreadsheets are a popular end-user development tool. EUD denotes activities or techniques in which people who are not professional developers create automated behavior and complex data objects without significant knowledge of a programming language. Many people find it easier to perform calculations in spreadsheets than by writing the equivalent sequential program. This is due to several traits of spreadsheets.
*They use spatial relationships to define program relationships. Humans have highly developed intuitions about spaces, and of dependencies between items. Sequential programming usually requires typing line after line of text, which must be read slowly and carefully to be understood and changed.
*They are forgiving, allowing partial results and functions to work. One or more parts of a program can work correctly, even if other parts are unfinished or broken. This makes writing and debugging programs easier, and faster. Sequential programming usually needs every program line and character to be correct for a program to run. One error usually stops the whole program and prevents any result. Though this user-friendliness is benefit of spreadsheet development, it often comes with increased risk of errors. 
*Modern spreadsheets allow for secondary notation. The program can be annotated with colors, typefaces, lines, etc. to provide visual cues about the meaning of elements in the program.
*Extensions that allow users to create new functions can provide the capabilities of a functional language.
*Extensions that allow users to build and apply models from the domain of machine learning.
*Spreadsheets are versatile. With their Boolean logic and graphics capabilities, even electronic circuit design is possible.
* Spreadsheets can store relational data and spreadsheet formulas can express all queries of SQL. There exists a query translator, which automatically generates the spreadsheet implementation from the SQL code.

=== Spreadsheet programs ===
A &quot;spreadsheet program&quot; is designed to perform general computation tasks using spatial relationships rather than time as the primary organizing principle.

It is often convenient to think of a spreadsheet as a mathematical graph, where the nodes are spreadsheet cells, and the edges are references to other cells specified in formulas. This is often called the dependency graph of the spreadsheet. References between cells can take advantage of spatial concepts such as relative position and absolute position, as well as named locations, to make the spreadsheet formulas easier to understand and manage.

Spreadsheets usually attempt to automatically update cells when the cells depend on change. The earliest spreadsheets used simple tactics like evaluating cells in a particular order, but modern spreadsheets calculate following a minimal recomputation order from the dependency graph. Later spreadsheets also include a limited ability to propagate values in reverse, altering source values so that a particular answer is reached in a certain cell. Since spreadsheet cell formulas are not generally invertible, though, this technique is of somewhat limited value.

Many of the concepts common to sequential programming models have analogs in the spreadsheet world. For example, the sequential model of the indexed loop is usually represented as a table of cells, with similar formulas (normally differing only in which cells they reference).

Spreadsheets have evolved to use scripting programming languages like VBA as a tool for extensibility beyond what the spreadsheet language makes easy.

== Shortcomings ==
While spreadsheets represented a major step forward in quantitative modeling, they have deficiencies. Their shortcomings include the perceived unfriendliness of alpha-numeric cell addresses.

* Research by ClusterSeven has shown huge discrepancies in the way financial institutions and corporate entities understand, manage and police their often vast estates of spreadsheets and unstructured financial data (including comma-separated values (CSV) files and Microsoft Access databases). One study in early 2011 of nearly 1,500 people in the UK found that 57% of spreadsheet users have never received formal training on the spreadsheet package they use. 72% said that no internal department checks their spreadsheets for accuracy. Only 13% said that Internal Audit reviews their spreadsheets, while a mere 1% receive checks from their risk department.

* Spreadsheets can have reliability problems. Research studies estimate that around 1% of all formulas in operational spreadsheets are in error.

::Despite the high error risks often associated with spreadsheet authorship and use, specific steps can be taken to significantly enhance control and reliability by structurally reducing the likelihood of error occurrence at their source.

* The practical expressiveness of spreadsheets can be limited unless their modern features are used. Several factors contribute to this limitation. Implementing a complex model on a cell-at-a-time basis requires tedious attention to detail. Authors have difficulty remembering the meanings of hundreds or thousands of cell addresses that appear in formulas.

::These drawbacks are mitigated by the use of named variables for cell designations, and employing variables in formulas rather than cell locations and cell-by-cell manipulations. Graphs can be used to show instantly how results are changed by changes in parameter values. The spreadsheet can be made invisible except for a transparent user interface that requests pertinent input from the user, displays results requested by the user, creates reports, and has built-in error traps to prompt correct input.

* Similarly, formulas expressed in terms of cell addresses are hard to keep straight and hard to audit. Research shows that spreadsheet auditors who check numerical results and cell formulas find no more errors than auditors who only check numerical results. That is another reason to use named variables and formulas employing named variables.

::Specifically, spreadsheets typically contain many copies of the same formula. When the formula is modified, the user has to change every cell containing that formula. In contrast, most computer languages allow a formula to appear only once in the code and achieve repetition using loops: making them much easier to implement and audit.

* The alteration of a dimension demands major surgery. When rows (or columns) are added to or deleted from a table, one has to adjust the size of many downstream tables that depend on the table being changed. In the process, it is often necessary to move other cells around to make room for the new columns or rows and to adjust graph data sources. In large spreadsheets, this can be extremely time-consuming.
* Adding or removing a dimension is so difficult, one generally has to start over. The spreadsheet as a paradigm forces one to decide on dimensionality right of the beginning of one&#x27;s spreadsheet creation, even though it is often most natural to make these choices after one&#x27;s spreadsheet model has matured. The desire to add and remove dimensions also arises in parametric and sensitivity analyses.
* Collaboration in authoring spreadsheet formulas can be difficult when such collaboration occurs at the level of cells and cell addresses.

Other problems associated with spreadsheets include:

* Some sources advocate the use of specialized software instead of spreadsheets for some applications (budgeting, statistics)
* The Microsoft xls file format which is the default file format used in versions prior to 2007 had a capacity limit of 65,536 rows by 256 columns (216 and 28 respectively). This presents a problem for people using larger datasets, and can result in data loss. In spite of the time passed, a recent example is the loss of COVID-19 positives in the British statistics for September and October 2020 when the Microsoft xls file format had been used in a legacy computer system.
* Lack of auditing and revision control. This makes it difficult to determine who changed what and when. This can cause problems with regulatory compliance. Lack of revision control greatly increases the risk of errors due to the inability to track, isolate and test changes made to a document. Modern spreadsheets include revision control.
* Lack of security. Spreadsheets lack controls on who can see and modify particular data. This, combined with the lack of auditing above, can make it easy for someone to commit fraud.
* Because they are loosely structured, it is easy for someone to introduce an error, either accidentally or intentionally, by entering information in the wrong place or expressing dependencies among cells (such as in a formula) incorrectly.
* The results of a formula (example &quot;=A1*B1&quot;) applies only to a single cell (that is, the cell the formula is located in—in this case perhaps C1), even though it can &quot;extract&quot; data from many other cells, and even real-time dates and actual times. This means that to cause a similar calculation on an array of cells, an almost identical formula (but residing in its own &quot;output&quot; cell) must be repeated for each row of the &quot;input&quot; array. This differs from a &quot;formula&quot; in a conventional computer program, which typically makes one calculation that it applies to all the input in turn. With current spreadsheets, this forced repetition of near-identical formulas can have detrimental consequences from a quality assurance standpoint and is often the cause of many spreadsheet errors. Some spreadsheets have array formulas to address this issue.
*Trying to manage the sheer volume of spreadsheets that may exist in an organization without proper security, audit trails, the unintentional introduction of errors, and other items listed above can become overwhelming.

While there are built-in and third-party tools for desktop spreadsheet applications that address some of these shortcomings, awareness, and use of these is generally low. A good example of this is that 55% of Capital market professionals &quot;don&#x27;t know&quot; how their spreadsheets are audited; only 6% invest in a third-party solution

== Spreadsheet risk ==

Spreadsheet risk is the risk associated with deriving a materially incorrect value from a spreadsheet application that will be utilized in making a related (usually numerically based) decision. Examples include the valuation of an asset, the determination of financial accounts, the calculation of medicinal doses, or the size of a load-bearing beam for structural engineering. The risk may arise from inputting erroneous or fraudulent data values, from mistakes (or incorrect changes) within the logic of the spreadsheet or the omission of relevant updates (e.g., out of date exchange rates). Some single-instance errors have exceeded US$1 billion. Because spreadsheet risk is principally linked to the actions (or inaction) of individuals it is defined as a sub-category of operational risk.

Despite this, research carried out by ClusterSeven revealed that around half (48%) of c-level executives and senior managers at firms reporting annual revenues over £50m said there were either no usage controls at all or poorly applied manual processes over the use of spreadsheets at the firms.

In 2013 Thomas Herndon, a graduate student of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst found major coding flaws in the spreadsheet used by the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff in &quot;Growth in a Time of Debt&quot;, a very influential 2010 journal article. The Reinhart and Rogoff article was widely used as justification to drive 2010–2013 European austerity programs.

<text>St. Louis ( ) is an independent city in the U.S. state of Missouri. It is located near the confluence of the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers. In 2020, the city proper had a population of 301,578, while its metropolitan area, which extends into Illinois, had an estimated population of over 2.8 million. It is the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the second-largest in Illinois. The city&#x27;s combined statistical area is the 20th-largest in the United States.

The land that became St. Louis had been occupied by Native American cultures for thousands of years before European settlement. The city was founded on February 14, 1764, by French fur traders Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent, Pierre Laclède, and Auguste Chouteau. They named it for King Louis IX of France, and it quickly became the regional center of the French Illinois Country. In 1804, the United States acquired St. Louis as part of the Louisiana Purchase. In the 19th century, St. Louis developed as a major port on the Mississippi River; from 1870 until the 1920 census, it was the fourth-largest city in the country. It separated from St. Louis County in 1877, becoming an independent city and limiting its political boundaries. In 1904, it hosted the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, also known as the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair, and the Summer Olympics.

St. Louis is designated as one of 173 global cities by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. The GDP of Greater St. Louis was $209.9 billion in 2022. St. Louis has a diverse economy with strengths in the service, manufacturing, trade, transportation, and aviation industries. It is home to sixteen &quot;Fortune&quot; 1000 companies, six of which are also &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 companies. Federal agencies headquartered in the city or with significant operations there include the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

Major research universities in Greater St. Louis include Washington University in St. Louis, Saint Louis University, and the University of Missouri–St. Louis. The Washington University Medical Center in the Central West End neighborhood hosts an agglomeration of medical and pharmaceutical institutions, including Barnes-Jewish Hospital.

St. Louis has four professional sports teams: the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball, the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League, St. Louis City SC of Major League Soccer, and the St. Louis BattleHawks of the United Football League. The city&#x27;s attractions include the Gateway Arch in Downtown St. Louis, the St. Louis Zoo, the Missouri Botanical Garden, the Saint Louis Art Museum, and Bellefontaine Cemetery.

==History==
===Mississippian culture and European exploration===

The area that became St. Louis was a center of the Native American Mississippian culture, which built numerous temple and residential earthwork mounds on both sides of the Mississippi River. Their major regional center was at Cahokia Mounds, active from 900 to 1500. Due to numerous major earthworks within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the &quot;Mound City&quot;. These mounds were mostly demolished during the city&#x27;s development. Historic Native American tribes in the area encountered by early Europeans included the Siouan-speaking Osage people, whose territory extended west, and the Illiniwek.

European exploration of the area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers Louis Jolliet and Jacques Marquette traveled through the Mississippi River valley. Five years later, La Salle claimed the region for France as part of La Louisiane, also known as Louisiana. The earliest European settlements in the Illinois Country (also known as Upper Louisiana) were built by the French during the 1690s and early 1700s at Cahokia, Kaskaskia, and Fort de Chartres. Migrants from the French villages on the east side of the Mississippi River, such as Kaskaskia, also founded Ste. Genevieve in the 1730s.

In 1764, after France lost the Seven Years&#x27; War, Pierre Laclède and his stepson Auguste Chouteau founded what was to become the city of St. Louis. (French lands east of the Mississippi had been ceded to Great Britain and the lands west of the Mississippi to Spain; Catholic France and Spain were 18th-century allies. Louis XV of France and Charles III of Spain were cousins, both from the House of Bourbon.) The French families built the city&#x27;s economy on the fur trade with the Osage, and with more distant tribes along the Missouri River. The Chouteau brothers gained a monopoly from Spain on the fur trade with Santa Fe. French colonists used African slaves as domestic servants and workers in the city.

During the negotiations for the 1763 Treaty of Paris, French negotiators agreed to transfer France&#x27;s colonial territories west of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers to New Spain to compensate for Spanish territorial losses during the war. These areas remained under Spanish control until 1803, when they were transferred to the French First Republic. During the American Revolutionary War, St. Louis was unsuccessfully attacked by British-allied Native Americans in the 1780 Battle of St. Louis.

===Founding===

The founding of St. Louis was preceded by a trading business between Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent and Pierre Laclède (Liguest) in late 1763. St. Maxent invested in a Mississippi River expedition led by Laclède, who searched for a location to base the company&#x27;s fur trading operations. Though Ste. Genevieve was already established as a trading center, he sought a place less prone to flooding. He found an elevated area overlooking the flood plain of the Mississippi River, not far south from its confluence with the Missouri and Illinois rivers. In addition to having an advantageous natural drainage system, there were nearby forested areas to supply timber and grasslands which could easily be converted for agricultural purposes. Laclède declared that this place &quot;might become, hereafter, one of the finest cities in America&quot;. He dispatched his 14-year-old stepson, Auguste Chouteau, to the site, with the support of 30 settlers in February 1764.

Laclède arrived at the future town site two months later and produced a plan for St. Louis based on the New Orleans street plan. The default block size was 240 by 300 feet, with just three long avenues running parallel to the west bank of the Mississippi. He established a public corridor of 300 feet fronting the river, but later this area was released for private development.
For the city&#x27;s first few years, it was not recognized by any governments. Although the settlement was thought to be under the control of the Spanish government, no one asserted any authority over it, and thus St. Louis had no local government. This vacuum led Laclède to assume civil control, and all problems were disposed in public settings, such as communal meetings. In addition, Laclède granted new settlers lots in town and the surrounding countryside. In hindsight, many of these original settlers thought of these first few years as &quot;the golden age of St. Louis&quot;. In 1763, the Native Americans in the region around St. Louis began expressing dissatisfaction with the victorious British, objecting to their refusal to continue to the French tradition of supplying gifts to Natives. Odawa chieftain Pontiac began forming a pan-tribal alliance to counter British control over the region but received little support from the indigenous residents of St. Louis. By 1765, the city began receiving visits from representatives of the British, French, and Spanish governments.

St. Louis was transferred to the French First Republic in 1800 (although all of the colonial lands continued to be administered by Spanish officials), then sold by the French to the U.S. in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase. St. Louis became the capital of, and gateway to, the new territory. Shortly after the official transfer of authority was made, the Lewis and Clark Expedition was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The expedition departed from St. Louis in May 1804 along the Missouri River to explore the vast territory. There were hopes of finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean, but the party had to go overland in the Upper West. They reached the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River in summer 1805. They returned, reaching St. Louis on September 23, 1806. Both Lewis and Clark lived in St. Louis after the expedition. Many other explorers, settlers, and trappers (such as Ashley&#x27;s Hundred) would later take a similar route to the West.

===19th century===

The city elected its first municipal legislators (called trustees) in 1808. Steamboats first arrived in St. Louis in 1817, improving connections with New Orleans and eastern markets. Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1822, and continued to develop largely due to its busy port and trade connections.

Immigrants from Ireland and Germany arrived in St. Louis in significant numbers starting in the 1840s, and the population of St. Louis grew from less than 20,000 inhabitants in 1840, to 77,860 in 1850, to more than 160,000 by 1860. By the mid-1800s, St. Louis had a greater population than New Orleans.

Settled by many Southerners in a slave state, the city was split in political sympathies and became polarized during the American Civil War. In 1861, 28 civilians were killed in a clash with Union troops. The war hurt St. Louis economically, due to the Union blockade of river traffic to the south on the Mississippi River. The St. Louis Arsenal constructed ironclads for the Union Navy.

Slaves worked in many jobs on the waterfront and on the riverboats. Given the city&#x27;s location close to the free state of Illinois and others, some slaves escaped to freedom. Others, especially women with children, sued in court in freedom suits, and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits. About half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds of suits before the American Civil War.
The printing press of abolitionist Elijah Parish Lovejoy was destroyed for the third time by townsfolk. He was murdered the next year in nearby Alton, Illinois.

After the war, St. Louis profited via trade with the West, aided by the 1874 completion of the Eads Bridge, named for its design engineer. Industrial developments on both banks of the river were linked by the bridge, the second in the Midwest over the Mississippi River after the Hennepin Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis. The bridge connects St. Louis, Missouri to East St. Louis, Illinois. The Eads Bridge became a symbolic image of the city of St. Louis, from the time of its erection until 1965 when the Gateway Arch Bridge was constructed. The bridge crosses the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede&#x27;s Landing, to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch, to the south. Today the road deck has been restored, allowing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to cross the river. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail system has used the rail deck since 1993. An estimated 8,500 vehicles pass through it daily.

On August 22, 1876, the city of St. Louis voted to secede from St. Louis County and become an independent city, and, following a recount of the votes in November, officially did so in March 1877. The 1877 St. Louis general strike caused significant upheaval, in a fight for the eight-hour day and the banning of child labor.

Industrial production continued to increase during the late 19th century. Major corporations such as the Anheuser-Busch brewery, Ralston Purina company and Desloge Consolidated Lead Company were established at St. Louis which was also home to several brass era automobile companies, including the Success Automobile Manufacturing Company; St. Louis is the site of the Wainwright Building, a skyscraper designed in 1892 by architect Louis Sullivan.

===20th century===
In 1900, the entire streetcar system was shut down by a several months-long strike, with significant unrest occurring in the city &amp; violence against the striking workers.

In 1904, the city hosted the World&#x27;s Fair and the Olympics, becoming the first non-European city to host the games. The formal name for the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair was the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Permanent facilities and structures remaining from the fair are located in Forest Park, and other notable structures within the park&#x27;s boundaries include the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Zoo and the Missouri History Museum, and Tower Grove Park and the Botanical Gardens.

After the Civil War, social and racial discrimination in housing and employment were common in St. Louis. In 1916, during the Jim Crow Era, St. Louis passed a residential segregation ordinance saying that if 75% of the residents of a neighborhood were of a certain race, no one from a different race was allowed to move in. That ordinance was struck down in a court challenge, by the NAACP, after which racial covenants were used to prevent the sale of houses in certain neighborhoods to &quot;persons not of Caucasian race&quot;. Again, St. Louisans offered a lawsuit in challenge, and such covenants were ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1948 in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;.

In 1926, Douglass University, a historically black university was founded by B. F. Bowles in St. Louis, and at the time no other college in St. Louis County admitted black students.

In the first half of the 20th century, St. Louis was a destination in the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South seeking better opportunities. During World War II, the NAACP campaigned to integrate war factories. In 1964, civil rights activists protested at the construction of the Gateway Arch to publicize their effort to gain entry for African Americans into the skilled trade unions, where they were underrepresented. The Department of Justice filed the first suit against the unions under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

Between 1900 and 1929, St. Louis, had about 220 automakers, close to 10 percent of all American carmakers, about half of which built cars exclusively in St. Louis. Notable names include Dorris, Gardner and Moon.

In the first part of the century, St. Louis had some of the worst air pollution in the United States. In April 1940, the city banned the use of soft coal mined in nearby states. The city hired inspectors to ensure that only anthracite was burned. By 1946, the city had reduced air pollution by about 75%.
&quot;De jure&quot; educational segregation continued into the 1950s, and &quot;de facto&quot; segregation continued into the 1970s, leading to a court challenge and interdistrict desegregation agreement. Students have been bused mostly from the city to county school districts to have opportunities for integrated classes, although the city has created magnet schools to attract students.

St. Louis, like many Midwestern cities, expanded in the early 20th century due to industrialization, which provided jobs to new generations of immigrants and migrants from the South. It reached its peak population of 856,796 at the 1950 census. Suburbanization from the 1950s through the 1990s dramatically reduced the city&#x27;s population, as did restructuring of industry and loss of jobs. The effects of suburbanization were exacerbated by the small geographical size of St. Louis due to its earlier decision to become an independent city, and it lost much of its tax base. During the 19th and 20th century, most major cities aggressively annexed surrounding areas as residential development occurred away from the central city; however, St. Louis was unable to do so.

Several urban renewal projects were built in the 1950s, as the city worked to replace old and substandard housing. Some of these were poorly designed and resulted in problems. One prominent example, Pruitt–Igoe, became a symbol of failure in public housing, and was torn down less than two decades after it was built. The degradation and razing of Mill Creek Valley in this time was featured as an example of disenfranchisement in the 2024 Reparations Commission Report.

Since the 1980s, several revitalization efforts have focused on Downtown St. Louis.

===21st century===

The urban revitalization projects that started in the 1980s continued into the new century. The city&#x27;s old garment district, centered on Washington Avenue in the Downtown and Downtown West neighborhoods, experienced major development starting in the late 1990s as many of the old factory and warehouse buildings were converted into lofts. The American Planning Association designated Washington Avenue as one of 10 Great Streets for 2011. The Cortex Innovation Community, located within the city&#x27;s Central West End neighborhood, was founded in 2002 and has become a multi-billion dollar economic engine for the region, with companies such as Microsoft and Boeing currently leasing office space. The Forest Park Southeast neighborhood in the central corridor has seen major investment starting in the early 2010s. Between 2013 and 2018, over $50 million worth of residential construction has been built in the neighborhood. The population of the neighborhood has increased by 19% from the 2010 to 2020 Census.

The St. Louis Rams of the National Football League controversially returned to Los Angeles in 2016. The city of St. Louis sued the NFL in 2017, alleging the league breached its own relocation guidelines to profit at the expense of the city. In 2021, the NFL and Rams owner Stan Kroenke agreed to settle out of court with the city for $790 million.

===Architecture===


The architecture of St. Louis exhibits a variety of commercial, residential, and monumental architecture. St. Louis is known for the Gateway Arch, the tallest monument constructed in the United States at . The Arch pays homage to Thomas Jefferson and St. Louis&#x27;s position as the gateway to the West. Architectural influences reflected in the area include French Colonial, German, early American, and modern architectural styles.

Several examples of religious structures are extant from the pre-Civil War period, and most reflect the common residential styles of the time. Among the earliest is the Basilica of St. Louis, King of France (referred to as the &quot;Old Cathedral&quot;). The Basilica was built between 1831 and 1834 in the Federal style. Other religious buildings from the period include SS. Cyril and Methodius Church (1857) in the Romanesque Revival style and Christ Church Cathedral (completed in 1867, designed in 1859) in the Gothic Revival style.

A few civic buildings were constructed during the early 19th century. The original St. Louis courthouse was built in 1826 and featured a Federal style stone facade with a rounded portico. However, this courthouse was replaced during renovation and expansion of the building in the 1850s. The Old St. Louis County Courthouse (known as the &quot;Old Courthouse&quot;) was completed in 1864 and was notable for having a cast iron dome and for being the tallest structure in Missouri until 1894. Finally, a customs house was constructed in the Greek Revival style in 1852, but was demolished and replaced in 1873 by the U.S. Customhouse and Post Office.

Because much of the city&#x27;s commercial and industrial development was centered along the riverfront, many pre-Civil War buildings were demolished during construction of the Gateway Arch. The city&#x27;s remaining architectural heritage of the era includes a multi-block district of cobblestone streets and brick and cast-iron warehouses called Laclede&#x27;s Landing. Now popular for its restaurants and nightclubs, the district is located north of Gateway Arch along the riverfront. Other industrial buildings from the era include some portions of the Anheuser-Busch Brewery, which date to the 1860s.

St. Louis saw a vast expansion in variety and number of religious buildings during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The largest and most ornate of these is the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis, designed by Thomas P. Barnett and constructed between 1907 and 1914 in the Neo-Byzantine style. The St. Louis Cathedral, as it is known, has one of the largest mosaic collections in the world. Another landmark in religious architecture of St. Louis is the St. Stanislaus Kostka, which is an example of the Polish Cathedral style. Among the other major designs of the period were St. Alphonsus Liguori (known as &quot;The Rock Church&quot;) (1867) in the Gothic Revival and Second Presbyterian Church of St. Louis (1900) in Richardsonian Romanesque.

By the 1900 census, St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the country. In 1904, the city hosted a world&#x27;s fair at Forest Park called the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. Its architectural legacy is somewhat scattered. Among the fair-related cultural institutions in the park are the St. Louis Art Museum designed by Cass Gilbert, part of the remaining lagoon at the foot of Art Hill, and the Flight Cage at the St. Louis Zoo. The Missouri History Museum was built afterward, with the profit from the fair. But 1904 left other assets to the city, like Theodore Link&#x27;s 1894 St. Louis Union Station, and an improved Forest Park.

One US Bank Plaza, the local headquarters for US Bancorp, was constructed in 1976 in the structural expressionist style. Several notable postmodern commercial skyscrapers were built downtown in the 1970s and 1980s, including the former AT&amp;T building at 909 Chestnut Street (1986), and One Metropolitan Square (1989), which is the tallest building in St. Louis.

During the 1990s, St. Louis saw the construction of the largest United States courthouse by area, the Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse (2000). The Eagleton Courthouse is home to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The most recent high-rise buildings in St. Louis include two residential towers: One Hundred in the Central West End neighborhood and One Cardinal Way in the Downtown neighborhood.

===Neighborhoods===

The city is divided into 79 officially-recognized neighborhoods.

===Topography===

According to the United States Census Bureau, St. Louis has a total area of , of which is land and (6.2%) is water. The city is built on bluffs and terraces that rise 100–200 feet above the western banks of the Mississippi River, in the Midwestern United States just south of the Missouri-Mississippi confluence. Much of the area is a fertile and gently rolling prairie that features low hills and broad, shallow valleys. Both the Mississippi River and the Missouri River have cut large valleys with wide flood plains.

Limestone and dolomite of the Mississippian epoch underlie the area, and parts of the city are karst in nature. This is particularly true of the area south of downtown, which has numerous sinkholes and caves. Most of the caves in the city have been sealed, but many springs are visible along the riverfront. Coal, brick clay, and millerite ore were once mined in the city. The predominant surface rock, known as &quot;St. Louis limestone&quot;, is used as dimension stone and rubble for construction.

Near the southern boundary of the city of St. Louis (separating it from St. Louis County) is the River des Peres, practically the only river or stream within the city limits that is not entirely underground. Most of River des Peres was confined to a channel or put underground in the 1920s and early 1930s. The lower section of the river was the site of some of the worst flooding of the Great Flood of 1993.

The city&#x27;s eastern boundary is the Mississippi River, which separates Missouri from Illinois. The Missouri River forms the northern line of St. Louis County, except for a few areas where the river has changed its course. The Meramec River forms most of its southern line.

===Climate===
The urban area of St. Louis has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;); however, its metropolitan region even to the south may present a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;), which shows the effect of the urban heat island in the city. The city experiences hot, humid summers and chilly to cold winters. It is subject to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico. The average annual temperature recorded at nearby Lambert–St. Louis International Airport, is . temperatures can be seen on an average 3 and 1 days per year, respectively. Precipitation averages , but has ranged from in 1953 to in 2015. The highest recorded temperature in St. Louis was on July 14, 1954, and the lowest was on January 5, 1884.

St. Louis experiences thunderstorms 48 days a year on average. Especially in the spring, these storms can often be severe, with high winds, large hail and tornadoes. Lying within the hotbed of Tornado Alley, St. Louis is one of the most frequently tornado-struck metropolitan areas in the U.S. and has an extensive history of damaging tornadoes. Severe flooding, such as the Great Flood of 1993, may occur in spring and summer; the (often rapid) melting of thick snow cover upstream on the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers can contribute to springtime flooding.

===Flora and fauna===

Before the founding of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning underbrush. Trees are mainly oak, maple, and hickory, similar to the forests of the nearby Ozarks; common understory trees include eastern redbud, serviceberry, and flowering dogwood. Riparian areas are forested with mainly American sycamore.

Most of the residential areas of the city are planted with large native shade trees. The largest native forest area is found in Forest Park. In autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the eastern woodland, although numerous decorative non-native species are found. The most notable invasive species is Japanese honeysuckle, which officials are trying to manage because of its damage to native trees. It is removed from some parks.

Wildlife includes urbanized coyotes, white-tailed deer, eastern gray squirrel, cottontail rabbit, and the nocturnal Virginia opossum. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include Canada goose, mallard duck, and shorebirds, including the great egret and great blue heron. Gulls are common along the Mississippi River; these species follow barge traffic.

Winter populations of bald eagles are along the Mississippi River around the Chain of Rocks Bridge. The city is on the Mississippi Flyway, used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern U.S. The Eurasian tree sparrow, an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. The city has special sites for birdwatching of migratory species, including Tower Grove Park.

Common frog species include the American toad and species of chorus frogs called spring peepers, which are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of cicadas or ladybugs. Mosquitoes, no-see-ums, and houseflies are common insect nuisances, especially in July and August; because of this, windows are almost always fitted with screens. Invasive populations of honeybees have declined in recent years. Numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche, and armadillos are throughout the St. Louis area.

==Demographics==

St. Louis grew slowly until the American Civil War, when industrialization and immigration sparked a boom. Mid-19th century immigrants included many Irish and Germans; later there were immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. In the early 20th century, African American and white migrants came from the South; the former as part of the Great Migration out of rural areas of the Deep South. Many came from Mississippi and Arkansas. Italians, Serbians, Lebanese, Syrians, and Greeks settled in St. Louis by the late 19th-Century.

After years of immigration, migration, and expansion, the city reached its peak population in 1950. That year, the Census Bureau reported St. Louis&#x27;s population as 82% White and 17.9% African American. After World War II, St. Louis began losing population to the suburbs, first because of increased demand for new housing, unhappiness with city services, ease of commuting by highways, and later, white flight. St. Louis&#x27;s population decline has resulted in a significant increase of abandoned residential housing units and vacant lots throughout the city proper; this blight has attracted much wildlife (such as deer and coyotes) to the many abandoned overgrown lots. As of the 2020 Census, St. Louis has lost 64.8% of its population since the 1950 United States census. During this period, the population of Greater St. Louis, which includes more than one county, has grown every year and continues to do so.
According to the 2010 United States census, St. Louis had 319,294 people living in 142,057 households, of which 67,488 households were families. The population density was . About 24% of the population was 19 or younger, 9% were 20 to 24, 31% were 25 to 44, 25% were 45 to 64, and 11% were 65 or older. The median age was about 34 years,

The African-American population is concentrated in the north side of the city (the area north of Delmar Boulevard is 94.0% black, compared with 35.0% in the central corridor and 26.0% in the south side of St. Louis). Among the Asian-American population in the city, the largest ethnic group is Vietnamese (0.9%), followed by Chinese (0.6%) and Indians (0.5%). The Vietnamese community has concentrated in the Dutchtown neighborhood of south St. Louis; Chinese are concentrated in the Central West End. People of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group, and make up 2.2% of St. Louis&#x27;s population. They have the highest concentration in the Dutchtown, Benton Park West (Cherokee Street), and Gravois Park neighborhoods. People of Italian descent are concentrated in The Hill.

In 2010, St. Louis&#x27;s per-capita rates of online charitable donations and volunteerism were among the highest among major U.S. cities.

, 91.05% (270,934) of St. Louis city residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 2.86% (8,516) spoke Spanish, 0.91% (2,713) Serbo-Croatian, 0.74% (2,200) Vietnamese, 0.50% (1,495) African languages, 0.50% (1,481) Chinese, and French was spoken as a main language by 0.45% (1,341) of the population over the age of five. In total, 8.95% (26,628) of St. Louis&#x27;s population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.

===Bosnian population===

About fifteen families from Bosnia settled in St. Louis between 1960 and 1970. After the Bosnian War started in 1992, more Bosnian refugees began arriving and by 2000, tens of thousands of Bosnian refugees settled in St. Louis with the help of Catholic aid societies. Many of them were professionals and skilled workers who had to take any job opportunity to be able to support their families. Most Bosnian refugees are Muslim, ethnically Bosniaks (87%); they have settled primarily in south St. Louis and South County. Bosnian-Americans are well integrated into the city, developing many businesses and ethnic/cultural organizations.

An estimated 70,000 Bosnians live in the metro area, which is tied with Chicago for largest population of Bosnians in the United States and the largest Bosnian population outside their homeland. The highest concentration of Bosnians is in the neighborhood of Bevo Mill and in Affton, Mehlville, and Oakville of south St. Louis County.

Bosnian Muslim Romani people have also settled in St. Louis.

===Crime===

Since 2014 the city of St. Louis has had, , one of the highest murder rates, per capita, in the United States, with 188 homicides in 2015 (59.3 homicides per 100,000) and ranks No. 13 of the most dangerous cities in the world by homicide rate. Detroit, Flint, Memphis, Birmingham, and Baltimore have higher overall violent crime rates than St. Louis, when comparing other crimes such as rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. These crime rates are high relative to other American cities, but St. Louis index crime rates have declined almost every year since the peak in 1993 (16,648), to the 2014 level of 7,931 (which is the sum of violent crimes and property crimes) per 100,000. In 2015, the index crime rate reversed the 2005–2014 decline to a level of 8,204. Between 2005 and 2014, violent crime has declined by 20%, although rates of violent crime remains 6 times higher than the United States national average and property crime in the city remains 2 times the national average. St. Louis has a higher homicide rate than the rest of the U.S. for both whites and blacks and a higher proportion committed by males. , 7 of the homicide suspects were white, 95 black, 0 Hispanic, 0 Asian and 1 female out of the 102 suspects. In 2016, St. Louis was the most dangerous city in the United States with populations of 100,000 or more, ranking 1st in violent crime and 2nd in property crime. It was also ranked 6th of the most dangerous of all establishments in the United States, and East St. Louis, a suburb of the city itself, was ranked 1st. The St. Louis Police Department at the end of 2016 reported a total of 188 murders for the year, the same number of homicides that had occurred in the city in 2015. According to the STLP At the end of 2017, St. Louis had 205 murders but the city recorded only 159 inside St. Louis city limits. The new Chief of Police, John Hayden said two-thirds (67%) of all the murders and one-half of all the assaults are concentrated in a triangular area in the North part of the city.

Yet another factor when comparing the murder rates of St. Louis and other cities is the manner of drawing municipal boundaries. While many other municipalities have annexed many suburbs, St. Louis has not annexed as much suburban area as most American cities. According to a 2018 estimate, the St. Louis metro area included about 3 million residents and the city included about 300,000 residents. Therefore, the city contains about ten percent of the metro population, a low ratio indicating that the municipal boundaries include only a small part of the metro population.

==Economy==

The gross domestic product of Greater St. Louis was $209.9 billion in 2022, up from $192.9 billion the previous year. Greater St. Louis had a GDP per capita of $68,574 in 2021, up 10% from the previous year.
