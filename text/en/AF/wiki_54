<text>Reverse Polish notation (RPN), also known as reverse Łukasiewicz notation, Polish postfix notation or simply postfix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators &quot;follow&quot; their operands, in contrast to prefix or Polish notation (PN), in which operators &quot;precede&quot; their operands. The notation does not need any parentheses for as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands.

The term &quot;postfix notation&quot; describes the general scheme in mathematics and computer sciences, whereas the term &quot;reverse Polish notation&quot; typically refers specifically to the method used to enter calculations into hardware or software calculators, which often have additional side effects and implications depending on the actual implementation involving a stack. The description &quot;Polish&quot; refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.

The first computer to use postfix notation, though it long remained essentially unknown outside of Germany, was Konrad Zuse&#x27;s Z3 in 1941 as well as his Z4 in 1945. The reverse Polish scheme was again proposed in 1954 by Arthur Burks, Don Warren, and Jesse Wright and was independently reinvented by Friedrich L. Bauer and Edsger W. Dijkstra in the early 1960s to reduce computer memory access and use the stack to evaluate expressions. The algorithms and notation for this scheme were extended by the philosopher and computer scientist Charles L. Hamblin in the mid-1950s.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Hewlett-Packard used RPN in all of their desktop and hand-held calculators, and has continued to use it in some models into the 2020s. In computer science, reverse Polish notation is used in stack-oriented programming languages such as Forth, dc, Factor, STOIC, PostScript, RPL, and Joy.

== Explanation ==
In reverse Polish notation, the operators follow their operands. For example, to add 3 and 4 together, the expression is rather than . The conventional notation expression becomes in reverse Polish notation: 4 is first subtracted from 3, then 5 is added to it.

The concept of a &quot;stack&quot;, a last-in/first-out construct, is integral to the left-to-right evaluation of RPN. In the example , first the 3 is put onto the stack, then the 4; the 4 is now on top and the 3 below it. The subtraction operator removes the top two items from the stack, performs , and puts the result of −1 onto the stack.

The common terminology is that added items are &quot;pushed&quot; on the stack and removed items are &quot;popped&quot;.

The advantage of reverse Polish notation is that it removes the need for order of operations and parentheses that are required by infix notation and can be evaluated linearly, left-to-right. For example, the infix expression becomes in reverse Polish notation.

== Practical implications ==
Reverse Polish notation has been compared to how one had to work through problems with a slide rule.

In comparison testing of reverse Polish notation with algebraic notation, reverse Polish has been found to lead to faster calculations, for two reasons. The first reason is that reverse Polish calculators do not need expressions to be parenthesized, so fewer operations need to be entered to perform typical calculations. Additionally, users of reverse Polish calculators made fewer mistakes than for other types of calculators. Later research clarified that the increased speed from reverse Polish notation may be attributed to the smaller number of keystrokes needed to enter this notation, rather than to a smaller cognitive load on its users. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that reverse Polish notation is more difficult for users who previously learned algebraic notation.

== Converting from infix notation ==

Edsger W. Dijkstra invented the shunting-yard algorithm to convert infix expressions to postfix expressions (reverse Polish notation), so named because its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard.

There are other ways of producing postfix expressions from infix expressions. Most operator-precedence parsers can be modified to produce postfix expressions; in particular, once an abstract syntax tree has been constructed, the corresponding postfix expression is given by a simple post-order traversal of that tree.

== Implementations ==
=== Hardware calculators ===
==== Early history ====
The first computer implementing a form of reverse Polish notation (but without the name and also without a stack), was Konrad Zuse&#x27;s Z3, which he started to construct in 1938 and demonstrated publicly on 12 May 1941. In dialog mode, it allowed operators to enter two operands followed by the desired operation. It was destroyed on 21 December 1943 in a bombing raid. With Zuse&#x27;s help a first replica was built in 1961. The 1945 Z4 also added a 2-level stack.

Other early computers to implement architectures enabling reverse Polish notation were the English Electric Company&#x27;s KDF9 machine, which was announced in 1960 and commercially available in 1963, and the Burroughs B5000, announced in 1961 and also delivered in 1963:

Presumably, the KDF9 designers drew ideas from Hamblin&#x27;s GEORGE (General Order Generator), an autocode programming system written for a DEUCE computer installed at the University of Sydney, Australia, in 1957.

One of the designers of the B5000, Robert S. Barton, later wrote that he developed reverse Polish notation independently of Hamblin sometime in 1958 after reading a 1954 textbook on symbolic logic by Irving Copi, where he found a reference to Polish notation, which made him read the works of Jan Łukasiewicz as well, and before he was aware of Hamblin&#x27;s work.

Friden introduced reverse Polish notation to the desktop calculator market with the EC-130, designed by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Appleby Ragen, supporting a four-level stack in June 1963. The successor EC-132 added a square root function in April 1965. Around 1966, the Monroe Epic calculator supported an unnamed input scheme resembling RPN as well.

==== Hewlett-Packard ====
Hewlett-Packard engineers designed the 9100A Desktop Calculator in 1968 with reverse Polish notation with only three stack levels with working registers &quot;X&quot; (&quot;keyboard&quot;), &quot;Y&quot; (&quot;accumulate&quot;) and visible storage register &quot;Z&quot; (&quot;temporary&quot;), a reverse Polish notation variant later referred to as &quot;three-level RPN&quot;. This calculator popularized reverse Polish notation among the scientific and engineering communities.
The HP-35, the world&#x27;s first handheld scientific calculator, introduced the classical &quot;four-level RPN&quot; with its specific ruleset of the so-called &quot;operational (memory) stack&quot; (later also called &quot;automatic memory stack&quot;) in 1972. In this scheme, the key duplicates values into Y under certain conditions (&quot;automatic stack lift&quot; with &quot;temporary stack lift disable&quot;), and the top register &quot;T&quot; (&quot;top&quot;) gets duplicated on drops (&quot;top copy on pop&quot; aka &quot;top stack level repetition&quot;) in order to ease some calculations and to save keystrokes. HP used reverse Polish notation on every handheld calculator it sold, whether scientific, financial, or programmable, until it introduced the HP-10 adding machine calculator in 1977. By this time, HP was the leading manufacturer of calculators for professionals, including engineers and accountants.

Later calculators with LCDs in the early 1980s, such as the HP-10C, HP-11C, HP-15C, HP-16C, and the financial HP-12C calculator also used reverse Polish notation. In 1988, Hewlett-Packard introduced a business calculator, the HP-19B, without reverse Polish notation, but its 1990 successor, the HP-19BII, gave users the option of using algebraic or reverse Polish notation again.

In 1986, HP introduced RPL, an object-oriented successor to reverse Polish notation. It deviates from classical reverse Polish notation by using a dynamic stack only limited by the amount of available memory (instead of three or four fixed levels) and which could hold all kinds of data objects (including symbols, strings, lists, matrices, graphics, programs, etc.) instead of just numbers. The system would display an error message when running out of memory instead of just dropping values off the stack on overflow as with fixed-sized stacks. It also changed the behaviour of the stack to no longer duplicate the top register on drops (since in an unlimited stack there is no longer a top register) and the behaviour of the key so that it no longer duplicated values into Y, which had shown to sometimes cause confusion among users not familiar with the specific properties of the &quot;automatic memory stack&quot;. From 1990 to 2003, HP manufactured the HP-48 series of graphing RPL calculators, followed by the HP-49 series between 1999 and 2008. The last RPL calculator was named HP 50g, introduced in 2006 and discontinued in 2015. However, there are several community efforts like newRPL or DB48X to recreate RPL on modern calculators.

As of 2011, Hewlett-Packard was offering the calculator models 12C, 12C Platinum, 17bII+, 20b, 30b, 33s, 35s, 48gII (RPL) and 50g (RPL) which support reverse Polish notation.

While calculators emulating classical models continued to support classical reverse Polish notation, new reverse Polish notation models feature a variant of reverse Polish notation, where the key behaves as in RPL. This latter variant is sometimes known as &quot;entry RPN&quot;.

In 2013, the HP Prime introduced a &quot;128-level&quot; form of entry RPN called &quot;advanced RPN&quot;. In contrast to RPL with its dynamic stack, it just drops values off the stack on overflow like other fixed-sized stacks do. However, like RPL, it does not emulate the behaviour of a classical operational RPN stack to duplicate the top register on drops.

In late 2017, the list of active models supporting reverse Polish notation included only the 12C, 12C Platinum, 17bii+, 35s, and Prime. By July 2023, only the 12C, 12C Platinum, the freshly released HP 15C Collector&#x27;s Edition, and the Prime remain active models supporting RPN.
==== Sinclair Radionics ====
In Britain, Clive Sinclair&#x27;s Sinclair Scientific (1974) and Scientific Programmable (1975) models used reverse Polish notation.

====Commodore====
In 1974, Commodore produced the Minuteman *6 (MM6) without an key and the Minuteman *6X (MM6X) with an key, both implementing a form of &quot;two-level RPN&quot;. The SR4921 RPN came with a variant of &quot;four-level RPN&quot; with stack levels named X, Y, Z, and W (rather than T) and an key (for &quot;entry&quot;). In contrast to Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s reverse Polish notation implementation, W filled with 0 instead of its contents being duplicated on stack drops.

==== Prinztronic ====
Prinz and Prinztronic were own-brand trade names of the British Dixons photographic and electronic goods stores retail chain, later rebranded as Currys Digital stores, and became part of DSG International. A variety of calculator models was sold in the 1970s under the Prinztronic brand, all made for them by other companies.

Among these was the PROGRAM Programmable Scientific Calculator which featured reverse Polish notation.

==== Heathkit ====
The Aircraft Navigation Computer Heathkit OC-1401/OCW-1401 used &quot;five-level RPN&quot; in 1978.

==== Soviet Union / Semico ====
Soviet programmable calculators (MK-52, MK-61, B3-34 and earlier B3-21 models) used reverse Polish notation for both automatic mode and programming. Modern Russian calculators MK-161 and MK-152, designed and manufactured in Novosibirsk since 2007 and offered by Semico, are backwards compatible with them. Their extended architecture is also based on reverse Polish notation.

==== Community-developed hardware-based calculators ====

An eight-level stack was suggested by John A. Ball in 1978.

The community-developed calculators WP 34S (2011), WP 31S (2014) and WP 34C (2015), which are based on the HP 20b/HP 30b hardware platform, support classical Hewlett-Packard-style reverse Polish notation supporting automatic stack lift behaviour of the key and top register copies on pops, but switchable between a four- and an eight-level operational stack.

In addition to the optional support for an eight-level stack, the newer SwissMicros DM42-based WP 43S as well as the WP 43C (2019) / C43 (2022) / C47 (2023) derivatives support data types for stack objects (real numbers, infinite integers, finite integers, complex numbers, strings, matrices, dates and times). The latter three variants can also be switched between &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;entry RPN&quot; behaviour of the key, a feature often requested by the community. They also support a rarely seen significant figures mode, which had already been available as a compile-time option for the WP 34S and WP 31S.

Since 2021, the HP-42S simulator Free42 version 3 can be enabled to support a dynamic RPN stack only limited by the amount of available memory instead of the classical 4-level stack. This feature was incorporated as a selectable function into the DM42 since firmware DMCP-3.21 / DM42-3.18.

<text>Roald Hoffmann (born Roald Safran; July 18, 1937) is a Polish-American theoretical chemist who won the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He has also published plays and poetry. He is the Frank H. T. Rhodes Professor of Humane Letters Emeritus at Cornell University.

==Early life==

===Escape from the Holocaust===
Hoffmann was born in Złoczów, Poland (now Zolochiv, Ukraine), to a Polish-Jewish family, and was named in honor of the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. His parents were Clara (Rosen), a teacher, and Hillel Safran, a civil engineer. After Germany invaded Poland and occupied the town, his family was placed in a labor camp where his father, who was familiar with much of the local infrastructure, was a valued prisoner. As the situation grew more dangerous, with prisoners being transferred to extermination camps, the family bribed guards to allow an escape. They arranged with a Ukrainian neighbor named Mykola Dyuk for Hoffmann, his mother, two uncles and an aunt to hide in the attic and a storeroom of the local schoolhouse, where they remained for eighteen months, from January 1943 to June 1944, while Hoffmann was aged 5 to 7.

His father remained at the labor camp, but was able to occasionally visit, until he was tortured and killed by the Germans for his involvement in a plot to arm the camp prisoners. When she received the news, his mother attempted to contain her sorrow by writing down her feelings in a notebook her husband had been using to take notes on a relativity textbook he had been reading. While in hiding his mother kept Hoffmann entertained by teaching him to read and having him memorize geography from textbooks stored in the attic, then quizzing him on it. He referred to the experience as having been enveloped in a cocoon of love. In 1944 they moved to Kraków where his mother remarried. They adopted her new husband&#x27;s surname Hoffmann.

Most of the rest of the family was killed in the Holocaust, though one grandmother and a few others survived. They migrated to the United States on the troop carrier &quot;Ernie Pyle&quot; in 1949.

Hoffmann visited Zolochiv with his adult son (by then a parent of a five-year-old) in 2006 and found that the attic where he had hidden was still intact, but the storeroom had been incorporated, ironically enough, into a chemistry classroom. In 2009, a monument to Holocaust victims was built in Zolochiv on Hoffmann&#x27;s initiative.

==Personal life==
Hoffmann married Eva Börjesson in 1960. They have two children, Hillel Jan and Ingrid Helena.

He describes himself as &quot;an atheist who is moved by religion.&quot;

===Education and academic credentials===
Hoffmann graduated in 1955 from New York City&#x27;s Stuyvesant High School, where he won a Westinghouse science scholarship. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree at Columbia University (Columbia College) in 1958. He earned his Master of Arts degree in 1960 from Harvard University. He earned his doctor of philosophy degree from Harvard University while working under joint supervision of Martin Gouterman and subsequent 1976 Nobel Prize in Chemistry winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. Hoffman worked on the molecular orbital theory of polyhedral molecules. Under Lipscomb&#x27;s direction the Extended Hückel method was developed by Lawrence Lohr and by Roald Hoffmann. This method was later extended by Hoffmann. In 1965, he went to Cornell University and has remained there, where he is a professor emeritus.

==Scientific research==
Hoffmann&#x27;s research and interests have been in the electronic structure of stable and unstable molecules, and in the study of transition states in reactions. He has investigated the structure and reactivity of both organic and inorganic molecules, and examined problems in organo-metallic and solid-state chemistry. Hoffman has developed semiempirical and nonempirical computational tools and methods such as the extended Hückel method which he proposed in 1963 for determining molecular orbitals.

With Robert Burns Woodward he developed the Woodward–Hoffmann rules for elucidating reaction mechanisms and their stereochemistry. They realized that chemical transformations could be approximately predicted from subtle symmetries and asymmetries in the electron orbitals of complex molecules. Their rules predict differing outcomes, such as the types of products that will be formed when two compounds are activated by heat compared with those produced under activation by light. For this work Hoffmann received the 1981 Nobel Prize in chemistry, sharing it with Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui, who had independently resolved similar issues. (Woodward was not included in the prize, which is given only to living persons, although he had won the 1965 prize for other work.) In his Nobel Lecture, Hoffmann introduced the isolobal analogy for predicting the bonding properties of organometallic compounds.

Some of Hoffman&#x27;s most recent work, with Neil Ashcroft and Vanessa Labet, examines bonding in matter under extreme high pressure.

==Artistic interests==

===&quot;The World Of Chemistry&quot; with Roald Hoffmann===
In 1988 Hoffmann became the series host in a 26-program PBS education series by Annenberg/CPB, &quot;The World of Chemistry&quot;, opposite with series demonstrator Don Showalter. While Hoffmann introduced a series of concepts and ideas, Showalter provided a series of demonstrations and other visual representations to help students and viewers to better understand the information.

=== &quot;Entertaining Science&quot; ===
Since the spring of 2001, Hoffmann has been the host of the monthly series &quot;Entertaining Science&quot; at New York City&#x27;s Cornelia Street Cafe, which explores the juncture between the arts and science.

===Non-fiction===
He has published books on the connections between art and science: &quot;Roald Hoffmann on the Philosophy, Art, and Science of Chemistry&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Finite: The Sublime in Art and Science&quot;.

===Poetry===
Hoffmann is also a writer of poetry. His collections include &quot;The Metamict State&quot; (1987, ), &quot;Gaps and Verges&quot; (1990, ), and &quot;Chemistry Imagined&quot; (1993, , co-produced with artist Vivian Torrence.

===Plays===
He co-authored with Carl Djerassi the play &quot;Oxygen&quot;, about the discovery of oxygen and the experience of being a scientist. Hoffman&#x27;s play, &quot;Should&#x27;ve&quot; (2006) about ethics in science and art, has been produced in workshops, as has a play based on his experiences in the holocaust, &quot;We Have Something That Belongs to You&quot; (2009), later retitled &quot;Something That Belongs to You.

==Honors and awards==
===Nobel Prize in Chemistry===
In 1981, Hoffmann received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which he shared with Kenichi Fukui &quot;for their theories, developed independently, concerning the course of chemical reactions&quot;.

===Other awards===
Hoffmann has won many other awards, and is the recipient of more than 25 honorary degrees.

<text>In phonetics, rhotic consonants, or &quot;R-like&quot; sounds, are liquid consonants that are traditionally represented orthographically by symbols derived from the Greek letter rho (Ρ and ρ), including , in the Latin script and , in the Cyrillic script. They are transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet by upper- or lower-case variants of Roman , : , , , , , , , and . Transcriptions for vocalic or semivocalic realisations of underlying rhotics include the and .

This class of sounds is difficult to characterise phonetically; from a phonetic standpoint, there is no single articulatory correlate (manner or place) common to rhotic consonants. Rhotics have instead been found to carry out similar phonological functions or to have certain similar phonological features across different languages.

Being &quot;R-like&quot; is an elusive and ambiguous concept phonetically and the same sounds that function as rhotics in some systems may pattern with fricatives, semivowels or even stops in others. For example, the alveolar flap is a rhotic consonant in many languages, but in North American English, the alveolar tap is an allophone of the stop phoneme , as in &quot;water&quot;. It is likely that rhotics are not a phonetically natural class but a phonological class.

Some languages have rhotic and non-rhotic varieties, which differ in the incidence of rhotic consonants. In non-rhotic accents of English, /ɹ/ is not pronounced unless it is followed directly by a vowel.

==Types==
The most typical rhotic sounds found in the world&#x27;s languages are the following:

* Trill (popularly known as rolled r): The airstream is interrupted several times as one of the organs of speech (usually the tip of the tongue or the uvula) vibrates, closing and opening the air passage. If a trill is made with the tip of the tongue against the upper gum, it is called an apical (tongue-tip) alveolar trill; the IPA symbol for this sound is . Most non-alveolar trills, such as the bilabial one, however, are not considered rhotic.
**Many languages, such as Bulgarian, Swedish, Norwegian, Frisian, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, Dutch and most Occitan variants, use trilled rhotics. In the English-speaking world, the stereotyped Scottish rolled is well known. The &quot;stage pronunciation&quot; of German specifies the alveolar trill for clarity. Rare kinds of trills include Czech (fricative trill) and Welsh (voiceless trill).
**The uvular trill is another kind of rhotic trill; see below for more. 
*Tap &quot;or&quot; flap (these terms describe very similar articulations): Similar to a trill, but involving just one brief interruption of airflow. In many languages flaps are used as reduced variants of trills, especially in fast speech. However, in Spanish, for example, flaps and trills contrast, as in &quot;pero&quot; (&quot;but&quot;) versus &quot;perro&quot; (&quot;dog&quot;). Also flaps are used as basic rhotics in Japanese and Korean languages. In Australian English and most American dialects of English, taps do not function as rhotics but are realizations of intervocalic apical stops ( and , as in &quot;butter&quot; and &quot;cider&quot;). The IPA symbol for these sounds is (or substandard for the tap, contrasted with the flap ).
* Alveolar or retroflex approximant (as in most accents of English—with minute differences): The front part of the tongue approaches the upper gum, or the tongue-tip is curled back towards the roof of the mouth (&quot;retroflexion&quot;). No or little friction can be heard, and there is no momentary closure of the vocal tract. The IPA symbol for the alveolar approximant is and the symbol for the retroflex approximant is . There is a distinction between an &quot;unrounded retroflex approximant&quot; and a &quot;rounded&quot; variety that probably could have been found in Anglo-Saxon and even to this day in some dialects of English, where the orthographic key is &quot;r&quot; for the unrounded version and usually &quot;wr&quot; for the rounded version (these dialects will make a differentiation between &quot;right&quot; and &quot;write&quot;). Also used as a rhotic in some dialects of Armenian, Dutch, German, Brazilian Portuguese (depending on phonotactics).
* Uvular (popularly called guttural r): The back of the tongue approaches the soft palate or the uvula. The standard Rs in European Portuguese, French, German, Danish, and Modern Hebrew are variants of this rhotic. If fricative, the sound is often impressionistically described as harsh or grating. This includes the voiced uvular fricative, voiceless uvular fricative, and uvular trill. In northern England, there were accents that once employed a uvular R, which was called the &quot;Northumbrian burr&quot;.
* developmental non-rhotic Rs: Many non-rhotic British speakers have a labialization to of their Rs, which is between idiosyncratic and dialectal (southern and southwestern England), and since it includes some RP speakers, somewhat prestigious. Apart from English, in all Brazilian Portuguese dialects the phoneme, or , may be actually realized as other, traditionally non-rhotic, fricatives (and most often is so), unless it occurs single between vowels, being so realized as a dental, alveolar, postalveolar or retroflex flap. In the syllable coda, it varies individually as a fricative, a flap or an approximant, though fricatives are ubiquitous in the Northern and Northeastern regions and all states of Southeastern Brazil but São Paulo and surrounding areas. The total inventory of allophones is rather long, or up to , the latter eight being particularly common, while none of them except archaic , that contrasts with the flap in all positions, may occur alone in a given dialect. Few dialects, such as &quot;sulista&quot; and &quot;fluminense&quot;, give preference to voiced allophones; elsewhere, they are common only as coda, before voiced consonants. Additionally, some other languages and variants, such as Haitian Creole and Timorese Portuguese, use velar and glottal fricatives instead of traditional rhotics, too. In Vietnamese, depending on dialect, the rhotic can occur as , or . In modern Mandarin Chinese, the phoneme , which is represented as in Hanyu Pinyin, resembles the rhotics in other languages in realization, thus it can be considered a rhotic consonant.

Furthermore, there is also a non-syllabic open vowel (conventional transcription, the exact quality varies) that patterns as in some Germanic languages such as German, Danish and Luxembourgish. It occurs only in the syllable coda.

==Characteristics==
In broad transcription rhotics are usually symbolised as unless there are two or more types of rhotic in the same language; for example, most Australian Aboriginal languages, which contrast approximant and trill , use the symbols &quot;r&quot; and &quot;rr&quot; respectively. The IPA has a full set of different symbols which can be used whenever more phonetic precision is required: an &quot;r&quot; rotated 180° for the alveolar approximant, a small capital &quot;R&quot; for the uvular trill, and a flipped small capital &quot;R&quot; for the voiced uvular fricative or approximant.

The fact that the sounds conventionally classified as &quot;rhotics&quot; vary greatly in both place and manner in terms of articulation, and also in their acoustic characteristics, has led several linguists to investigate what, if anything, they have in common that justifies grouping them together. One suggestion that has been made is that each member of the class of rhotics shares certain properties with other members of the class, but not necessarily the same properties with all; in this case, rhotics have a &quot;family resemblance&quot; with each other rather than a strict set of shared properties. Another suggestion is that rhotics are defined by their behaviour on the sonority hierarchy, namely, that a rhotic is any sound that patterns as being more sonorous than a lateral consonant but less sonorous than a vowel. The potential for variation within the class of rhotics makes them a popular area for research in sociolinguistics.

==Rhotics and rhoticity in the world&#x27;s languages==
===English===

English has rhotic and non-rhotic accents. Rhotic speakers pronounce a historical in all instances, while non-rhotic speakers only pronounce at the beginning of a syllable.

===Dutch===
Colloquial Northern Dutch speech of the Randstad region is variably rhotic. In the syllable coda, the sequences may be realized as , which may be close to or the same as the vowels or sequences , resulting in a variable merger. For instance, &quot;kerk&quot; &#x27;church&#x27; and &quot;cake&quot; &#x27;pound cake&#x27; may become homophonous as , whereas &quot;maar&quot; &#x27;but&#x27; can be homophonous with &quot;maai&quot; &#x27;(I) mow&#x27; as . and are usually somewhat distinct from and as the former feature vowels that are more central (and features a diphthong in certain dialects, such as Rotterdam Dutch).

After , may be dropped altogether, as in &quot;kilometer&quot; &#x27;kilometer&#x27;. This is commonly heard in The Hague. It is not necessarily restricted to the word-final position, as it can also happen in word-final clusters in words such as &quot;honderd&quot; &#x27;hundred&#x27;.

After , , , and , may be realized as a centering glide, as in &quot;mier&quot; &#x27;ant&#x27;, &quot;muur&quot; &#x27;wall&#x27;, &quot;moer&quot; &#x27;queen bee&#x27;, &quot;meer&quot; &#x27;lake&#x27; and &quot;deur&quot; &#x27;door&#x27;. As with and , these vowels are more central (and also longer) than in other contexts. Furthermore, both and are raised in this context, so that &quot;meer&quot; becomes a near-homophone of &quot;mier&quot;, whereas &quot;deur&quot; becomes a quasi-rhyme of &quot;muur&quot;.

In citation forms, in the syllable coda is pronounced as a pharyngealized pre-velar bunched approximant (known in Dutch as the &quot;&quot;) that is acoustically similar to : etc. Other realizations (alveolar taps and voiced uvular fricatives) are also possible, depending on the region and individual speaker, so that &quot;mier&quot; may be also pronounced or . The pre-velar bunched approximant as well as the palatal approximant realization of described above are virtually unknown in southern varieties of Dutch. In the varieties where they do occur, they are restricted to the syllable coda. In other environments, is realized as or .

===Other Germanic languages===
The rhotic consonant is dropped or vocalized under similar conditions in other Germanic languages, notably German, Danish, western Norwegian and southern Swedish (both because of Danish influence), rendering the English accents that native speakers of these languages speak with as non-rhotic as well.

In most varieties of German (with the notable exception of Swiss Standard German), in the syllable coda is frequently realized as a vowel or a semivowel, or . In the traditional standard pronunciation, this happens only in the unstressed ending &quot;-er&quot; and after long vowels: for example &quot;besser&quot; , &quot;sehr&quot; . In common speech the vocalization is usual after short vowels as well, and additional contractions may occur: for example &quot;Dorn&quot; ~ , &quot;hart&quot; ~ . Commonplace mergers include that of with (leading to homophony of e.g. &quot;warten, waten&quot;) and loss of length distinctions before coda (e.g. homophony of &quot;Herr, Heer&quot;). Compare German phonology.

Similarly, Danish after a vowel is, unless followed by a stressed vowel, either pronounced (&quot;mor&quot; &quot;mother&quot; , &quot;næring&quot; &quot;nourishment&quot; ) or merged with the preceding vowel while usually influencing its vowel quality ( and or are realised as long vowels and , and , and are all pronounced ) (&quot;løber&quot; &quot;runner&quot; , &quot;Søren Kierkegaard&quot; (personal name) ).

===Astur-Leonese===
In Asturian, word-final is always lost in infinitives before an enclitic pronoun, which is reflected in writing. For example, the infinitive form &quot;dar&quot; plus the third-person plural dative pronoun &quot;-yos&quot; &quot;da-yos&quot; (&quot;give to them&quot;) or the accusative form &quot;los&quot; &quot;dalos&quot; (&quot;give them&quot;). That happens also in Leonese in which the infinitive form is &quot;dare&quot; , and both the and the vowel are dropped (&quot;da-yos&quot;, not *&quot;dáre-yos&quot;). However, most speakers also drop rhotics in the infinitive before a lateral consonant of a different word, but that is not shown in writing: &quot;dar los dos&quot; (give the two [things]). That does not occur in the middle of words: the name &quot;Carlos&quot; .

===Catalan===
In some Catalan dialects, word-final is lost in coda position not only in suffixes of nouns and adjectives denoting the masculine singular and plural, (written as &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-rs&quot;; as well as in words like &quot;llavors&quot; &quot;then; so&quot;), but also in the &quot;-&quot;ar&quot;, -&quot;er&quot; and -&quot;ir&quot;&quot; suffixes of infinitives: &quot;forner&quot; &quot;(male) baker&quot;, &quot;forners&quot; , &quot;fer&quot; &quot;to do&quot;, &quot;lluir&quot; &quot;to shine, to look good&quot;. However, rhotics are &quot;recovered&quot; when followed by the feminine suffix &quot;-a&quot; , and when infinitives have single or multiple enclitic pronouns (notice the two rhotics are neutralized in the coda, with a flap occurring between vowels, and a trill elsewhere); e.g. &quot;fornera&quot; &quot;(female) baker&quot;, &quot;fer-lo&quot; &quot;to do it (masc.)&quot;, &quot;fer-ho&quot; &quot;to do it/that/so&quot;, &quot;lluir-se&quot; &quot;to excel, to show off&quot;.

===French===
Final ⟨r⟩ is generally not pronounced in words ending in ⟨-er⟩. The R in &quot;parce que&quot; (&quot;because&quot;) is not pronounced in informal speech.

===Malay (including Indonesian)===
The pronunciation of final in Malay and Indonesian varies considerably. In Indonesian, (lit. &#x27;standard&#x27; in Malay) Malay, and Kedah Malay, the final is pronounced, but in the Johor-Riau accent, the standard accent of Malay in Brunei and Malaysia, and several other dialects, it is not.

The quality of the realization of the phoneme varies too. In the syllable onset, in Indonesian, Malay, and standard Johor-Riau Malay, it varies between a trill , a flap , and sometimes, even an approximant . In many dialects of Malay, such as those of Kedah, Kelantan-Pattani and Terengganu, onset is usually realized as a velar fricative . In Perak Malay, a uvular pronunciation, is more common.

In Kedah Malay, final is uniquely realized as a pharyngeal fricative . In the dialect of Malacca, when it appears after , final is vocalized into or .

===Portuguese===
In some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese, is unpronounced or aspirated. That occurs most frequently with verbs in the infinitive, which is always indicated by a word-final . In some states, however, it happens mostly with any when preceding a consonant. The &quot;Carioca&quot; accent (from the city of Rio de Janeiro) is notable for this. The Caipira dialect (from São Paulo countryside) usually realizes as , , or . 

===Spanish===
Among the Spanish dialects, Andalusian Spanish, Caribbean Spanish (descended from and still very similar to Andalusian and Canarian Spanish), Castúo (the Spanish dialect of Extremadura), Northern Colombian Spanish (in cities like Cartagena, Montería, San Andrés and Santa Marta, but not Barranquilla, which is mostly rhotic) and the Argentine dialect spoken in the Tucumán province may have an unpronounced word-final , especially in infinitives, which mirrors the situation in some dialects of Brazilian Portuguese. However, in Antillean Caribbean forms, word-final in infinitives and non-infinitives is often in free variation with word-final , which may be delateralized to , forming a rising diphthong with the preceding vowel (as in &quot;dar&quot; &#x27;to give&#x27;).

===Thai===
The native Thai rhotic is the alveolar trill. The English approximants /ɹ/ and /l/ are used interchangeably in Thai. That is, Thai-speakers generally replace an English-derived &quot;r&quot; (ร) with an &quot;l&quot; (ล), and when they hear an &quot;l&quot; (ล), they may write an &quot;r&quot; (ร).

===Turkish===
In Istanbul Turkish, is always pronounced except in colloquial speech for the present continuous tense suffix as in (&#x27;going&#x27;) or (&#x27;I was writing&#x27;) and (&#x27;one&#x27;) when used as an adjective/quantifier (but not other numbers containing this word, such as (&#x27;eleven&#x27;)). In these cases, the preceding vowel is not lengthened. The unfavorability of dropping can be explained with minimal pairs, such as (&#x27;stole&#x27;) versus (imperative &#x27;ring&#x27;).

In some parts of Turkey, like Kastamonu, the syllable-final is almost never pronounced: &quot;gidiya&quot; instead of &quot;gidiyor&quot; (&quot;she/he is going&quot;) and &quot;gide&quot; instead of &quot;gider&quot; (&quot;she/he goes&quot;). In &quot;gide&quot;, the preceding &quot;e&quot; is lengthened and pronounced somewhat between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;a&quot;.

===Chinese===
Northern Chinese accents, centered around Beijing, are well known as having &quot;erhua&quot; which can be translated as &quot;R-change&quot;. This normally happens at ends of words, particularly ones that end in an -n/-ng sound. So a southern Chinese might say &quot;yī diǎn&quot; (一点) (&quot;a little bit&quot;) but a Beijinger would say it more like [(j)i tʲɚ] which in Pinyin is sometimes rendered &quot;yī diǎnr&quot; to show if the word can be rhotacized. The final &quot;R&quot; sound is strongly pronounced, not unlike Irish or American accents.

===Uyghur===
Among the Turkic languages, Uyghur displays more or less the same feature, as syllable-final is dropped, and the preceding vowel is lengthened: &quot;Uyghurlar&quot; &#x27;Uyghurs&#x27;. The may, however, sometimes be pronounced in unusually &quot;careful&quot; or &quot;pedantic&quot; speech; in such cases, it is often mistakenly inserted after long vowels even when there is no phonemic .

===Yaqui===
Similarly in Yaqui, an indigenous language of northern Mexico, intervocalic or syllable-final is often dropped with lengthening of the previous vowel: &quot;pariseo&quot; becomes , &quot;sewaro&quot; becomes .

===Lacid===
Lacid, whose exonyms in various literature include Lashi, Lachik, Lechi, and Leqi, is a Tibeto-Burman language spoken by the Lacid people. There are various reports of their population from 30,000 to 60,000 people. Most are in Myanmar, but there are also small groups in China and Thailand. Noftz (2017) reports finding an example of a rhotic alveolar fricative in Lacid while he was doing phonological research at Payap University, in Thailand, in 2015. He was not able to continue his research and expressed the need for further examination of the segment to verify his results. It is postulated that the segment is a remnant of the rhotic fricative in Proto-Tibeto-Burman.

===Berber languages===
Syllable-final is lost in many varieties of Rif Berber and is lengthened before to , and and become diphthongs like in English or German. However, a distinct phoneme from earlier exists and does not undergo the same development.

<text>Richard Lester Meyers (born October 2, 1949), better known by his stage name Richard Hell, is an American singer, songwriter, bass guitarist and writer.

Hell was in several important early punk rock bands, including Neon Boys, Television and the Heartbreakers, after which he formed Richard Hell &amp; the Voidoids. Their 1977 album &quot;Blank Generation&quot; influenced many other punk bands. Its title track was named &quot;One of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock&quot; by music writers in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame listing and is ranked as one of the all-time Top 10 punk songs by a 2006 poll of original British punk figures, as reported in the &quot;Rough Guide to Punk&quot;.

Since the late 1980s, Hell has devoted himself primarily to writing, publishing two novels and several other books. He was the film critic for &quot;BlackBook&quot; magazine from 2004 to 2006.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Richard Lester Meyers was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1949. His father, a secular Jew, was an experimental psychologist, researching animal behavior. He died when Hell was seven years old. Hell was then raised by his mother, Carolyn H. Rhodes, who came from Methodists of Welsh and English ancestry. After her husband&#x27;s death, she returned to school and became a professor.

Hell attended the Sanford School in Delaware for one year, where he became friends with Tom Miller, who later changed his name to Tom Verlaine. They ran away from school together and a short time later were arrested in Alabama for arson and vandalism.

Hell never finished high school, instead moving to New York City to make his way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded &quot;Genesis:Grasp&quot;. They used an AM VariTyper with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books.

Before he was 21, his own poems were published in numerous periodicals, ranging from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to the New Directions &quot;Annual&quot;s. In 1971, along with Verlaine, Hell also published under the pseudonym Theresa Stern, a fictional poet whose photo was actually a combination of both his and Verlaine&#x27;s faces in drag, superimposed over one another to create a new identity. A book of poems credited to &quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;Wanna Go Out?&quot;, was released by Dot in 1973.

===The Neon Boys, Television, and the Heartbreakers===
In 1972, Verlaine joined Hell in New York and formed the Neon Boys. In 1974, the band added a second guitarist, Richard Lloyd, and changed their name to Television.

Television&#x27;s performances at CBGB helped kick-start the first wave of punk bands, inspiring a number of different artists including Patti Smith, who wrote the first press review of Television for the &quot;SoHo Weekly News&quot; in June 1974. She formed a highly successful band of her own, the Patti Smith Group. Television was one of the early bands to play at CBGB because their manager, Terry Ork, persuaded owner Hilly Kristal to book them alongside the Ramones. They also built the club&#x27;s first stage. Hell started playing his punk rock anthem &quot;Blank Generation&quot; during his time in Television. In early 1975, Hell parted ways with Television after a dispute over creative control. Hell claimed that he and Verlaine had originally divided the songwriting evenly, but that later Verlaine sometimes refused to play Hell&#x27;s songs. Verlaine remained silent on the subject.

Hell left Television the same week that Jerry Nolan and Johnny Thunders quit the New York Dolls. In May 1975, the three of them formed the Heartbreakers (not to be confused with Tom Petty&#x27;s band, which adopted the same name the following year). After one show, Walter Lure joined the Heartbreakers as a second guitarist. Four Heartbreakers demo tracks, recorded while Hell was still in the band, were later released on that band&#x27;s &quot;L.A.M.F. Definitive Edition&quot; reissue. A live album recorded with Hell in 1975 was released as &quot;What Goes Around...&quot; in 1991.

===Richard Hell and the Voidoids===
In early 1976, Hell quit the Heartbreakers and started Richard Hell and the Voidoids with Robert Quine, Ivan Julian and Marc Bell. The band released two albums, though the second, &quot;Destiny Street&quot;, retained only Quine from the original group, with Naux (Juan Maciel) on guitar and Fred Maher on drums. Hell&#x27;s best known songs with the Voidoids included &quot;Blank Generation&quot;, &quot;Love Comes in Spurts&quot;, &quot;The Kid With the Replaceable Head&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. In 2009, the guitar tracks on &quot;Destiny Street&quot; were re-recorded and released as &quot;Destiny Street Repaired&quot;, with guitarists Julian, Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell playing to the original rhythm tracks. Also in 2009, Hell gave his blessing to the public access program Pancake Mountain to create an animated music video for &quot;The Kid with the Replaceable Head&quot;. It was the Voidoids&#x27; first and only official music video. The cut used for the animation appears on Hell&#x27;s 2005 retrospective album, &quot;Spurts, The Richard Hell Story&quot;.

===Dim Stars and other collaborations===
Hell&#x27;s only other album release was as part of the band Dim Stars, for which he came out of retirement for a month in the early 1990s. Dim Stars featured guitarist Thurston Moore and drummer Steve Shelley from Sonic Youth, Gumball&#x27;s guitarist Don Fleming, and Quine. They formed only to record a 1991 EP and a 1992 album, both titled &quot;Dim Stars&quot;, and played one show in public, a WFMU benefit at The Ritz in Manhattan. Hell played bass, sang lead vocals and wrote the lyrics for the album.

Hell also guested on the 1993 &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; album by Shotgun Rationale, and co-wrote and sang lead vocals on the song &quot;Never Mind&quot; by the Heads, a 1996 collaborative effort between three former members of Talking Heads.

===Books===
&quot;The Voidoid&quot;, a novella written in 1973, was finally published by CodeX in 1993. It was reissued in 2009 by 38th Street Publishers with illustrations by Kier Cooke Sandvik. His early poetry collections include &quot;I Was a Spiral on the Floor&quot; (1988) and &quot;Across the Years&quot; (1992), both published by Soyo Publications. &quot;Artifact: Notebooks from Hell 1974–1980&quot;, a collection of his punk-era journals, was released in 1990 by Hanuman Books. In 1996, Scribner published Hell&#x27;s first full-length novel, &quot;Go Now&quot;, set in 1980 and drawn largely from his own experiences. Hell released a collection of short pieces (poems, essays and drawings) called &quot;Hot and Cold&quot; in 2001. His second novel, &quot;Godlike&quot;, was published in 2005 by Akashic Books as part of Dennis Cooper&#x27;s Little House on the Bowery Series. Also published in 2005 was &quot;Rabbit Duck&quot;, a book of 13 poems written in collaboration with David Shapiro. More recent works include &quot;Psychopts&quot; (2008), a collaboration with artist Christopher Wool, as well as &quot;Disgusting&quot; (2010) and &quot;I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp&quot; (2013).

Hell&#x27;s nonfiction has been widely anthologized, including a number of appearances in &quot;best music writing&quot; collections. &quot;The Toilet Paper Columns&quot; (2007) compiled his columns for the Colorado alternative magazine &quot;Toilet Paper&quot;, while &quot;Massive Pissed Love: Nonfiction 2001-2014&quot; was issued by Soft Skull Press in 2015. Hell&#x27;s archive of his manuscripts, tapes, correspondence (written and email), journals and other documents of his life was purchased for $50,000 by New York University&#x27;s Fales Library in 2003.

A mural in Hell&#x27;s hometown of Lexington, Kentucky, created by students from Lexington Montessori High School, was completed in June 2019. The mural, located in the city&#x27;s North Limestone neighborhood, has three parts: two profiles of Hell, and a quote from his autobiography, &quot;I Dreamed I Was a Very Clean Tramp&quot;. &quot;This was in Lexington, Ky. when everybody was a kid. I looked for caves and birds and ran away from home. My favorite thing to do was to run away. The words ‘let’s run away’ still sounds magical to me.&quot;

===Films===
Hell has appeared in several low-budget films, most notably Susan Seidelman&#x27;s &quot;Smithereens&quot;. Other acting appearances include Ulli Lommel&#x27;s &quot;Blank Generation&quot;, Nick Zedd&#x27;s &quot;Geek Maggot Bingo&quot;, Rachel Amadeo&#x27;s &quot;What About Me?&quot; and Rachid Kerdouche&#x27;s &quot;Final Reward&quot;. Hell had a non-speaking cameo role as Madonna&#x27;s murdered boyfriend in Seidelman&#x27;s 1985 &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot;.

===Personal life===
In 1976, Hell dated Nancy Spungen for a few months before she moved to England. Hell was married to Scandal&#x27;s Patty Smyth for two years during 1985–86, and they had a daughter, Ruby. In January 2020, it was mentioned on Hell&#x27;s website that he had begun a relationship with novelist Katherine Faw.

<text>The Rob Roy is a cocktail consisting primarily of whisky and vermouth, created in 1894 by a bartender at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan, New York City. The drink was named in honor of the premiere of &quot;Rob Roy&quot;, an operetta by composer Reginald De Koven and lyricist Harry B. Smith loosely based upon Scottish folk hero Rob Roy MacGregor. 

A Rob Roy is similar to a Manhattan, but is made exclusively with Scotch whisky; the Manhattan is traditionally made with rye, and today also commonly made with bourbon or Canadian whisky. While this version of a Manhattan may have been first dubbed a Rob Roy in 1894, the Manhattan made with Scotch whisky first appears in print ten years earlier in a London bar guide by Charlie Paul.

Like the Manhattan, the Rob Roy can be made &quot;sweet&quot;, &quot;dry&quot;, or &quot;perfect&quot;. The standard Rob Roy is the sweet version, made with sweet vermouth, so there is no need to specify a &quot;sweet&quot; Rob Roy when ordering. A &quot;dry&quot; Rob Roy is made by replacing the sweet vermouth with dry vermouth. A &quot;perfect&quot; Rob Roy is made with equal parts sweet and dry vermouth.

The Rob Roy includes a dash of Angostura bitters (mostly for color), and is usually served in a cocktail glass garnished with two maraschino cherries on a skewer (for the standard version), or a lemon twist (for the perfect and dry versions).

<text>In analytic philosophy and computer science, referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of linguistic constructions, and by extension of languages. A linguistic construction is called &quot;referentially transparent&quot; when for any expression built from it, replacing a subexpression with another one that denotes the same value does not change the value of the expression. Otherwise, it is called &quot;referentially opaque&quot;. Each expression built from a referentially opaque linguistic construction states something about a subexpression, whereas each expression built from a referentially transparent linguistic construction states something not about a subexpression, meaning that the subexpressions are ‘transparent’ to the expression, acting merely as ‘references’ to something else. For example, the linguistic construction ‘_ was wise’ is referentially transparent (e.g., &quot;Socrates was wise&quot; is equivalent to &quot;The founder of Western philosophy was wise&quot;) but ‘_ said _’ is referentially opaque (e.g., &quot;Xenophon said ‘Socrates was wise’&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;Xenophon said ‘The founder of Western philosophy was wise’&quot;).

Referential transparency, in programming languages, depends on semantic equivalences among denotations of expressions, or on contextual equivalence of expressions themselves. That is, referential transparency depends on the semantics of the language. So, both declarative languages and imperative languages can have referentially transparent positions, referentially opaque positions, or (usually) both, according to the semantics they are given.

The importance of referentially transparent positions is that they allow the programmer and the compiler to reason about program behavior as a rewrite system at those positions. This can help in proving correctness, simplifying an algorithm, assisting in modifying code without breaking it, or optimizing code by means of memoization, common subexpression elimination, lazy evaluation, or parallelization.

== History ==
The concept originated in Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; (1910–1913):

A proposition as the vehicle of truth or falsehood is a particular occurrence, while a proposition considered factually is a class of similar occurrences. It is the proposition considered factually that occurs in such statements as “&quot;A&quot; believes &quot;p&quot;“ and “&quot;p&quot; is about &quot;A&quot;.”

Of course it is possible to make statements about the particular fact “Socrates is Greek.” We may say how many centimetres long it is; we may say it is black; and so on. But these are not the statements that a philosopher or logician is tempted to make.

When an assertion occurs, it is made by means of a particular fact, which is an instance of the proposition asserted. But this particular fact is, so to speak, “transparent”; nothing is said about it, but by means of it something is said about something else. It is this “transparent” quality that belongs to propositions as they occur in truth-functions. This belongs to &quot;p&quot; when &quot;p&quot; is asserted, but not when we say “&quot;p&quot; is true.”
It was adopted in analytic philosophy in Willard Van Orman Quine&#x27;s &quot;Word and Object&quot; (1960):

When a singular term is used in a sentence purely to specify its object, and the sentence is true of the object, then certainly the sentence will stay true when any other singular term is substituted that designates the same object. Here we have a criterion for what may be called &quot;purely referential position&quot;: the position must be subject to the &quot;substitutivity of identity&quot;.

Referential transparency has to do with constructions (§ 11); modes of containment, more specifically, of singular terms or sentences in singular terms or sentences. I call a mode of containment referentially transparent if, whenever an occurrence of a singular term is purely referential in a term or sentence , it is purely referential also in the containing term or sentence .
The term appeared in its contemporary computer science usage in the discussion of variables in programming languages in Christopher Strachey&#x27;s seminal set of lecture notes &quot;Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages&quot; (1967):

One of the most useful properties of expressions is that called by Quine [4] &quot;referential transparency&quot;. In essence this means that if we wish to find the value of an expression which contains a sub-expression, the only thing we need to know about the sub-expression is its value. Any other features of the sub-expression, such as its internal structure, the number and nature of its components, the order in which they are evaluated or the colour of the ink in which they are written, are irrelevant to the value of the main expression.
== Formal definitions ==
There are three fundamental properties concerning substitutivity in formal languages: referential transparency, definiteness, and unfoldability.

Let’s denote syntactic equivalence with ≡ and semantic equivalence with =.

=== Referential transparency ===
A &quot;position&quot; is defined by a sequence of natural numbers. The empty sequence is denoted by ε and the sequence constructor by ‘.’.

&quot;Example.&quot; — Position 2.1 in the expression is the place occupied by the first occurrence of .

Expression &quot;with&quot; expression &quot;inserted at&quot; position is denoted by and defined by
: if else undefined, for all operators and expressions .

&quot;Example.&quot; — If then .

Position is &quot;purely referential&quot; in expression is defined by
: implies , for all expressions .
In other words, a position is purely referential in an expression if and only if it is subject to the substitutivity of equals. is purely referential in all expressions.

Operator is &quot;referentially transparent&quot; in place is defined by
: is purely referential in implies is purely referential in , for all positions and expressions .
Otherwise is &quot;referentially opaque&quot; in place .

An operator is &quot;referentially transparent&quot; is defined by it is referentially transparent in all places. Otherwise it is &quot;referentially opaque&quot;.

A formal language is &quot;referentially transparent&quot; is defined by all its operators are referentially transparent. Otherwise it is &quot;referentially opaque&quot;.

&quot;Example.&quot; — The ‘_ lives in _’ operator is referentially transparent:
: &quot;She lives in London.&quot;
Indeed, the second position is purely referential in the assertion because substituting &quot;The capital of the United Kingdom&quot; for &quot;London&quot; does not change the value of the assertion. The first position is also purely referential for the same substitutivity reason.

&quot;Example.&quot; — The ‘_ contains _’ and quote operators are referentially opaque:
: &quot;‘London’ contains six letters.&quot;
Indeed, the first position is not purely referential in the statement because substituting &quot;The capital of the United Kingdom&quot; for &quot;London&quot; changes the value of the statement and the quotation. So in the first position, the ‘_ contains _’ and quote operators destroy the relation between an expression and the value that it denotes.

&quot;Example.&quot; — The ‘_ refers to _’ operator is referentially transparent, despite the referential opacity of the quote operator:
: &quot;‘London’ refers to the largest city of the United Kingdom.&quot;
Indeed, the first position is purely referential in the statement, though it is not in the quotation, because substituting &quot;The capital of the United Kingdom&quot; for &quot;London&quot; does not change the value of the statement. So in the first position, the ‘_ refers to _’ operator restores the relation between an expression and the value that it denotes. The second position is also purely referential for the same substitutivity reason.

=== Definiteness ===
A formal language is &quot;definite&quot; is defined by all the occurrences of a variable within its scope denote the same value.

&quot;Example.&quot; — Mathematics is definite:
Indeed, the two occurrences of denote the same value.

=== Unfoldability ===
A formal language is &quot;unfoldable&quot; is defined by all expressions are β-reducible.

&quot;Example.&quot; — The lambda calculus is unfoldable:
Indeed, .

=== Relations between the properties ===
Referential transparency, definiteness, and unfoldability are independent.
Definiteness implies unfoldability only for deterministic languages.
Non-deterministic languages cannot have definiteness and unfoldability at the same time.

<text>Reaganomics (; a portmanteau of &quot;Reagan&quot; and &quot;economics&quot; attributed to Paul Harvey), or Reaganism, were the neoliberal economic policies promoted by U.S. President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s. These policies focused mainly on supply-side economics; however, opponents (including some Republicans) characterized them as &quot;trickle-down economics&quot; or &quot;Voodoo Economics&quot;, while Reagan and his advocates preferred to call it free-market economics.

The pillars of Reagan&#x27;s economic policy included increasing defense spending, balancing the federal budget and slowing the growth of government spending, reducing the federal income tax and capital gains tax, reducing government regulation, and tightening the money supply in order to reduce inflation.

The results of Reaganomics are still debated. Supporters point to the end of stagflation, stronger GDP growth, and an entrepreneurial revolution in the decades that followed. Critics point to the widening income gap, what they described as an atmosphere of greed, reduced economic mobility, declining real median wages, and the national debt tripling in eight years which ultimately reversed the post-World War II trend of a shrinking national debt as percentage of GDP.

==Historical context==

Prior to the Reagan administration, the United States economy experienced a decade of high unemployment and persistently high inflation (known as stagflation). Attacks on Keynesian economic orthodoxy as well as empirical economic models such as the Phillips Curve grew. Political pressure favored stimulus resulting in an expansion of the money supply. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s wage and price controls were phased out. The federal oil reserves were created to ease any future short term shocks. President Jimmy Carter had begun phasing out price controls on petroleum while he created the Department of Energy. Much of the credit for the resolution of the stagflation is given to two causes: renewed focus on increasing productivity and a three-year contraction of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board under Paul Volcker.

In stating that his intention was to lower taxes, Reagan&#x27;s approach was a departure from his immediate predecessors. Reagan enacted lower marginal tax rates as well as simplified income tax codes and continued deregulation. During Reagan&#x27;s eight year presidency, the annual deficits averaged 4.0% of GDP, compared to a 2.2% average during the preceding eight years. The real (inflation adjusted) average rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. GDP per employed person increased at an average 1.5% rate during the Reagan administration, compared to an average 0.6% during the preceding eight years. Private sector productivity growth, measured as real output per hour of all persons, increased at an average rate of 1.9% during Reagan&#x27;s eight years, compared to an average 1.3% during the preceding eight years. Federal net outlays as a percent of GDP averaged 20.27% under Reagan (01/20/1981 - 01/20/1989), compared to 21.14% during the preceding eight (01/20/1973 - 1/20/1981) years.

During the Nixon and Ford Administrations, before Reagan&#x27;s election, a combined supply and demand side policy was considered unconventional by the moderate wing of the Republican Party. While running against Reagan for the Presidential nomination in 1980, George H. W. Bush had derided Reaganomics as &quot;voodoo economics&quot;. Similarly, in 1976, Gerald Ford had severely criticized Reagan&#x27;s proposal to turn back a large part of the Federal budget to the states.

==Justifications==

In his 1980 campaign speeches, Reagan presented his economic proposals as a return to the free enterprise principles, free market economy that had been in favor before the Great Depression and FDR&#x27;s New Deal policies. At the same time he attracted a following from the supply-side economics movement, which formed in opposition to Keynesian demand-stimulus economics. This movement produced some of the strongest supporters for Reagan&#x27;s policies during his term in office.

The contention of the proponents, that the tax rate cuts would more than cover any increases in federal debt, was influenced by a theoretical taxation model based on the elasticity of tax rates, known as the Laffer curve. Arthur Laffer&#x27;s model predicts that excessive tax rates actually reduce potential tax revenues, by lowering the incentive to produce; the model also predicts that insufficient tax rates (rates below the optimum level for a given economy) lead directly to a reduction in tax revenues.

Ronald Reagan also cited the 14th-century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun as an influence on his supply-side economic policies, in 1981. Reagan paraphrased Ibn Khaldun, who said that &quot;In the beginning of the dynasty, great tax revenues were gained from small assessments,&quot; and that &quot;at the end of the dynasty, small tax revenues were gained from large assessments.&quot; Reagan said his goal is &quot;trying to get down to the small assessments and the great revenues.&quot;

==Policies==
Reagan lifted remaining domestic petroleum price and allocation controls on January 28, 1981, and lowered the oil windfall profits tax in August 1981. He ended the oil windfall profits tax in 1988. During the first year of Reagan&#x27;s presidency, federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70% to 50% and the lowest bracket from 14% to 11%. This act slashed estate taxes and trimmed taxes paid by business corporations by $150 billion over a five-year period. In 1982 Reagan agreed to a rollback of corporate tax cuts and a smaller rollback of individual income tax cuts. The 1982 tax increase undid a third of the initial tax cut. In 1983 Reagan instituted a payroll tax increase on Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance. In 1984 another bill was introduced that closed tax loopholes. According to tax historian Joseph Thorndike, the bills of 1982 and 1984 &quot;constituted the biggest tax increase ever enacted during peacetime&quot;.

With the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Reagan and Congress sought to simplify the tax system by eliminating many deductions, reducing the highest marginal rates, and reducing the number of tax brackets. In 1983, Democrats Bill Bradley and Dick Gephardt had offered a proposal; in 1984 Reagan had the Treasury Department produce its own plan. The 1986 act aimed to be revenue-neutral: while it reduced the top marginal rate, it also cleaned up the tax base by removing certain tax write-offs, preferences, and exceptions, thus raising the effective tax on activities previously specially favored by the code. 
Federal revenue share of GDP fell from 19.6% in fiscal 1981 to 17.3% in 1984, before rising back to 18.4% by fiscal year 1989. Personal income tax revenues fell during this period relative to GDP, while payroll tax revenues rose relative to GDP. Reagan&#x27;s 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income reduced the maximum capital gains rate to only its lowest level since the Hoover administration (1933). The 1986 act set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages, with both topping out at 28%.

Reagan significantly increased public expenditures, primarily the Department of Defense, which rose (in constant 2000 dollars) from $267.1 billion in 1980 (4.9% of GDP and 22.7% of public expenditure) to $393.1 billion in 1988 (5.8% of GDP and 27.3% of public expenditure); most of those years military spending was about 6% of GDP, exceeding this number in 4 different years. All these numbers had not been seen since the end of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War in 1973. In 1981, Reagan significantly reduced the maximum tax rate, which affected the highest income earners, and lowered the top marginal tax rate from 70% to 50%; in 1986 he further reduced the rate to 28%. The federal deficit under Reagan peaked at 6% of GDP in 1983, falling to 3.2% of GDP in 1987 and to 3.1% of GDP in his final budget. The inflation-adjusted rate of growth in federal spending fell from 4% under Jimmy Carter to 2.5% under Ronald Reagan. This was the slowest rate of growth in inflation adjusted spending since Eisenhower. However, federal deficit as percent of GDP was up throughout the Reagan presidency from 2.7% at the end of (and throughout) the Carter administration. As a short-run strategy to reduce inflation and lower nominal interest rates, the U.S. borrowed both domestically and abroad to cover the Federal budget deficits, raising the national debt from $997 billion to $2.85 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the world&#x27;s largest international creditor to the world&#x27;s largest debtor nation. Reagan described the new debt as the &quot;greatest disappointment&quot; of his presidency.

According to William A. Niskanen, one of the architects of Reaganomics, &quot;Reagan delivered on each of his four major policy objectives, although not to the extent that he and his supporters had hoped&quot;, and notes that the most substantial change was in the tax code, where the top marginal individual income tax rate fell from 70.1% to 28.4%, and there was a &quot;major reversal in the tax treatment of business income&quot;, with effect of &quot;reducing the tax bias among types of investment but increasing the average effective tax rate on new investment&quot;. Roger Porter, another architect of the program, acknowledges that the program was weakened by the many hands that changed the President&#x27;s calculus, such as Congress.

==Results==
===Overview===
Spending during the years Reagan budgeted (FY 1982–89) averaged 21.6% GDP, roughly tied with president Obama, but lagging behind President Trump&#x27;s 38.2%, though much of that was due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Both Obama and Reagan faced a severe recession early in their administration. In addition, the public debt rose from 26% GDP in 1980 to 41% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2.052 trillion in 1988, a roughly three-fold increase. The unemployment rate fell from 7% in 1980, to 5% in 1988. The inflation rate declined from 10% in 1980 to 4% in 1988.

Some economists have stated that Reagan&#x27;s policies were an important part of bringing about the third longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history. During the Reagan administration, real GDP growth averaged 3.5%, compared to 2.9% during the preceding eight years. The annual average unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percentage points, from 7.2% in 1980 to 5.5% in 1988, after it had increased by 1.6 percentage points over the preceding eight years. Nonfarm employment increased by 16.1 million during Reagan&#x27;s presidency, compared to 15.4 million during the preceding eight years, while manufacturing employment declined by 582,000 after rising 363,000 during the preceding eight years. Reagan&#x27;s administration is the only one not to have raised the minimum wage. The inflation rate, 13.5% in 1980, fell to 4.1% in 1988, in part because the Federal Reserve increased interest rates (prime rate peaking at 20.5% in August 1981). The latter contributed to a recession from July 1981 to November 1982 during which unemployment rose to 9.7% and GDP fell by 1.9%. Additionally, income growth slowed for middle- and lower-class (2.4% to 1.8%) and rose for the upper-class (2.2% to 4.83%).

The misery index, defined as the inflation rate added to the unemployment rate, shrank from 19.33 when he began his administration to 9.72 when he left, the greatest improvement record for a President since Harry S. Truman left office. In terms of American households, the percentage of total households making less than $10,000 a year (in real 2007 dollars) shrank from 8.8% in 1980 to 8.3% in 1988 while the percentage of households making over $75,000 went from 20.2% to 25.7% during that period, both signs of progress.

===Employment===
The job growth (measured for non-farm payrolls) under the Reagan administration averaged 168,000 per month, versus 216,000 for Carter, 55,000 for H.W. Bush, and 239,000 for Clinton. The annual job growth percentages (comparing the beginning and ending number of jobs during their time in office to determine an annual growth rate) show that jobs grew by 2.0% annually under Reagan, versus 3.1% under Carter, 0.6% under H.W. Bush, and 2.4% under Clinton.

The unemployment rate averaged 7.5% under Reagan, compared to an average 6.6% during the preceding eight years. Declining steadily after December 1982, the rate was 5.4% the month Reagan left office.

The labor force participation rate increased by 2.6 percentage points during Reagan&#x27;s eight years, compared to 3.9 percentage points during the preceding eight years.

===Growth rates===
Following the 1981 recession, the unemployment rate had averaged slightly higher (6.75% vs. 6.35%), productivity growth lower (1.38% vs. 1.92%), and private investment as a percentage of GDP slightly less (16.08% vs. 16.86%). In the 1980s, industrial productivity growth in the United States matched that of its trading partners after trailing them in the 1970s. By 1990, manufacturing&#x27;s share of GNP exceeded the post-World War II low hit in 1982 and matched &quot;the level of output achieved in the 1960s when American factories hummed at a feverish clip&quot;.

===GDP growth===
Real GDP grew over one-third during Reagan&#x27;s presidency, an over $2 trillion increase. The compound annual growth rate of GDP was 3.6% during Reagan&#x27;s eight years, compared to 2.7% during the preceding eight years. Real GDP per capita grew 2.6% under Reagan, compared to 1.9% average growth during the preceding eight years.

=== Real wages ===
The average real hourly wage for production and nonsupervisory workers continued the decline that had begun in 1973, albeit at a slower rate, and remained below the pre-Reagan level in every Reagan year. While inflation remained elevated during his presidency and likely contributed to the decline in wages over this period, Reagan&#x27;s critics often argue that his neoliberal policies were responsible for this and also led to a stagnation of wages in the next few decades.
===Income and wealth===
In nominal terms, median household income grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5% during the Reagan presidency, compared to 8.5% during the preceding five years (pre-1975 data are unavailable). Real median family income grew by $4,492 during the Reagan period, compared to a $1,270 increase during the preceding eight years. After declining from 1973 through 1980, real mean personal income rose $4,708 by 1988. Nominal household net worth increased by a CAGR of 8.4%, compared to 9.3% during the preceding eight years.

===Poverty level===
The percentage of the total population below the poverty level increased from 13.0% in 1980 to 15.2% in 1983, then declined back to 13.0% in 1988. During Reagan&#x27;s first term, critics noted homelessness as a visible problem in U.S. urban centers. According to Don Mitchell, the increased cuts to spending on housing and social services under Reagan was a contributing factor to the homeless population nearly doubling in just three years, from 1984 to 1987. In the closing weeks of his presidency, Reagan told David Brinkley that the homeless &quot;make it their own choice for staying out there,&quot; noting his belief that there &quot;are shelters in virtually every city, and shelters here, and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to going into one of those shelters&quot;. He also stated that &quot;a large proportion&quot; of them are &quot;mentally impaired&quot;, which he believed to be a result of lawsuits by the ACLU (and similar organizations) against mental institutions.

===Federal income tax and payroll tax levels===

During the Reagan administration, fiscal year federal receipts grew from $599 billion to $991 billion (an increase of 65%) while fiscal year federal outlays grew from $678 billion to $1144 billion (an increase of 69%). According to a 1996 report of the Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress, during Reagan&#x27;s two terms, and through 1993, the top 10% of taxpayers paid an increased share of income taxes (not including payroll taxes) to the Federal government, while the lowest 50% of taxpayers paid a reduced share of income tax revenue. Personal income tax revenues declined from 9.4% GDP in 1981 to 8.3% GDP in 1989, while payroll tax revenues increased from 6.0% GDP to 6.7% GDP during the same period.

===Tax receipts===

Both CBO and the Reagan Administration forecast that individual and business income tax revenues would be lower if the Reagan tax cut proposals were implemented, relative to a policy baseline without those cuts, by about $50 billion in 1982 and $210 billion by 1986. According to a 2003 Treasury study, the tax cuts in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 resulted in a significant decline in revenue relative to a baseline without the cuts, approximately $111 billion (in 1992 dollars) on average during the first four years after implementation or nearly 3% GDP annually. Other tax bills had neutral or, in the case of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, a (~+1% of GDP) increase in revenue as a share of GDP. The study did not examine the longer-term impact of Reagan tax policy, including sunset clauses and &quot;the long-run, phased-in effect of the tax bills&quot;. The fact that tax receipts &quot;as a percentage of GDP&quot; fell following the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 shows a decrease in tax burden as share of GDP and a commensurate increase in the deficit, as spending did not fall relative to GDP. Total federal tax receipts increased in every Reagan year except 1982, at an annual average rate of 6.2% compared to 10.8% during the preceding eight years.

The effect of Reagan&#x27;s 1981 tax cuts (reduced revenue relative to a baseline without the cuts) were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax increases that had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977, and further increases by Reagan in 1983 and following years, also to counter the uses of tax shelters. An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation.

===Debt and government expenditures===

Reagan was inaugurated in January 1981, making the first fiscal year (FY) he budgeted 1982 and the final budget 1989. 
* During Reagan&#x27;s presidency, the federal debt held by the public nearly tripled in nominal terms, from $738 billion to $2.1 trillion. This led to the U.S. moving from the world&#x27;s largest international creditor to the world&#x27;s largest debtor nation. Reagan described the new debt as the &quot;greatest disappointment&quot; of his presidency.
* The federal deficit as percentage of GDP rose from 2.5% of GDP in fiscal year 1981 to a peak of 5.7% of GDP in 1983, then fell to 2.7% GDP in 1989.
* Total federal outlays averaged of 21.8% of GDP from 1981–88, versus the 1974–1980 average of 20.1% of GDP. This was the highest of any President from Carter through Obama.
* Total federal revenues averaged 17.7% of GDP from 1981–88, versus the 1974–80 average of 17.6% of GDP.
* Federal individual income tax revenues fell from 8.7% of GDP in 1980 to a trough of 7.5% of GDP in 1984, then rose to 7.8% of GDP in 1988.

===Business and market performance===
Nominal after-tax corporate profits grew at a compound annual growth rate of 3.0% during Reagan&#x27;s eight years, compared to 13.0% during the preceding eight years. The S&amp;P 500 Index increased 113.3% during the 2024 trading days under Reagan, compared to 10.4% during the preceding 2024 trading days. The business sector share of GDP, measured as gross private domestic investment, declined by 0.7 percentage points under Reagan, after increasing 0.7 percentage points during the preceding eight years.

===Size of federal government===
The federal government&#x27;s share of GDP increased 0.2 percentage points under Reagan, while it decreased 1.5 percentage points during the preceding eight years. The number of federal civilian employees increased 4.2% during Reagan&#x27;s eight years, compared to 6.5% during the preceding eight years.

As a candidate, Reagan asserted he would shrink government by abolishing the Cabinet-level departments of energy and education. He abolished neither, but elevated veterans affairs from independent agency status to Cabinet-level department status.

===Income distribution===
Continuing a trend that began in the 1970s, income inequality grew and accelerated in the 1980s. &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote in 2006: &quot;After the 1973 oil shocks, productivity growth suddenly slowed. A few years later, at the start of the 1980s, the gap between rich and poor began to widen.&quot; According to the CBO: 
*The top 1% of income earners&#x27; share of income &quot;before&quot; transfers and taxes rose from 9.0% in 1979 to a peak of 13.8% in 1986, before falling to 12.3% in 1989.
*The top 1% share of income earners&#x27; of income &quot;after&quot; transfers and taxes rose from 7.4% in 1979 to a peak of 12.8% in 1986, before falling to 11.0% in 1989.
*The bottom 90% had a lower share of the income in 1989 vs. 1979.
==Analysis==

According to a 1996 study by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key economic variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. The study asserted that real median family income grew by $4,000 during the eight Reagan years and experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years. The Cato study was dismissive of any positive effects of tightening, and subsequent loosening, of Federal Reserve monetary policy under &quot;inflation hawk&quot; Paul Volcker, whom President Carter had appointed in 1979 to halt the persistent inflation of the 1970s.

Economic analyst Stephen Moore stated in the Cato analysis, &quot;No act in the last quarter century had a more profound impact on the U.S. economy of the eighties and nineties than the Reagan tax cut of 1981.&quot; He argued that Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts, combined with an emphasis on federal monetary policy, deregulation, and expansion of free trade created a sustained economic expansion, the greatest American sustained wave of prosperity ever. He also claims that the American economy grew by more than a third in size, producing a $15 trillion increase in American wealth. Consumer and investor confidence soared. Cutting federal income taxes, cutting the U.S. government spending budget, cutting programs, scaling down the government work force, maintaining low interest rates, and keeping a watchful inflation hedge on the monetary supply was Ronald Reagan&#x27;s formula for a successful economic turnaround.

Milton Friedman stated, &quot;Reaganomics had four simple principles: Lower marginal tax rates, less regulation, restrained government spending, noninflationary monetary policy. Though Reagan did not achieve all of his goals, he made good progress.&quot;

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 and its impact on the alternative minimum tax (AMT) reduced nominal rates on the wealthy and eliminated tax deductions, while raising tax rates on lower-income individuals. The across the board tax system reduced marginal rates and further reduced bracket creep from inflation. The highest income earners (with incomes exceeding $1,000,000) received a tax break, restoring a flatter tax system. In 2006, the IRS&#x27;s National Taxpayer Advocate&#x27;s report characterized the effective rise in the AMT for individuals as a problem with the tax code. Through 2007, the revised AMT had brought in more tax revenue than the former tax code, which has made it difficult for Congress to reform.

Economist Paul Krugman argued the economic expansion during the Reagan administration was primarily the result of the business cycle and the monetary policy by Paul Volcker. Krugman argues that there was nothing unusual about the economy under Reagan because unemployment was reducing from a high peak and that it is consistent with Keynesian economics for the economy to grow as employment increases if inflation remains low. Krugman has also criticized Reaganomics from the standpoint of wealth and income inequality. He argues that the Reagan era tax cuts ended the post-World War II &quot;Great Compression&quot; of wealth held by the rich.

The CBO Historical Tables indicate that federal spending during Reagan&#x27;s two terms (FY 1981–88) averaged 22.4% GDP, well above the 20.6% GDP average from 1971 to 2009. In addition, the public debt rose from 26.1% GDP in 1980 to 41.0% GDP by 1988. In dollar terms, the public debt rose from $712 billion in 1980 to $2,052 billion in 1988, a three-fold increase. Krugman argued in June 2012 that Reagan&#x27;s policies were consistent with Keynesian stimulus theories, pointing to the significant increase in per-capita spending under Reagan.

William Niskanen noted that during the Reagan years, privately held federal debt increased from 22% to 38% of GDP, despite a long peacetime expansion. Second, the savings and loan problem led to an additional debt of about $125 billion. Third, greater enforcement of U.S. trade laws increased the share of U.S. imports subjected to trade restrictions from 12% in 1980 to 23% in 1988.

Economists Raghuram Rajan and Luigi Zingales pointed out that many deregulation efforts had either taken place or had begun before Reagan (note the deregulation of airlines and trucking under Carter, and the beginning of deregulatory reform in railroads, telephones, natural gas, and banking). They stated, &quot;The move toward markets preceded the leader [Reagan] who is seen as one of their saviors.&quot; Economists Paul Joskow and Roger Noll made a similar contention.

Economist William A. Niskanen, a member of Reagan&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers wrote that deregulation had the &quot;lowest priority&quot; of the items on the Reagan agenda given that Reagan &quot;failed to sustain the momentum for deregulation initiated in the 1970s&quot; and that he &quot;added more trade barriers than any administration since Hoover.&quot; By contrast, economist Milton Friedman has pointed to the number of pages added to the Federal Register each year as evidence of Reagan&#x27;s anti-regulation presidency (the Register records the rules and regulations that federal agencies issue per year). The number of pages added to the Register each year declined sharply at the start of the Ronald Reagan presidency breaking a steady and sharp increase since 1960. The increase in the number of pages added per year resumed an upward, though less steep, trend after Reagan left office. In contrast, the number of pages being added each year increased under Ford, Carter, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama. The number of pages in Federal Register is however criticized as an extremely crude measure of regulatory activity, because it can be easily manipulated (e.g. font sizes have been changed to keep page count low). The apparent contradiction between Niskanen&#x27;s statements and Friedman&#x27;s data may be resolved by seeing Niskanen as referring to &quot;statutory&quot; deregulation (laws passed by Congress) and Friedman to &quot;administrative&quot; deregulation (rules and regulations implemented by federal agencies). A 2016 study by the Congressional Research Service found that Reagan&#x27;s average annual number of final federal regulatory rules published in the Federal Register was higher than during the Clinton, George W. Bush or Obama&#x27;s administrations, even though the Reagan economy was considerably smaller than during those later presidents. Another study by the QuantGov project of the libertarian Mercatus Center found that the Reagan administration added restrictive regulations — containing such terms as &quot;shall,&quot; &quot;prohibited&quot; or &quot;may not&quot; — at a faster average annual rate than did Clinton, Bush or Obama.

Greg Mankiw, a conservative Republican economist who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, wrote in 2007:
I used the phrase &quot;charlatans and cranks&quot; in the first edition of my principles textbook to describe some of the economic advisers to Ronald Reagan, who told him that broad-based income tax cuts would have such large supply-side effects that the tax cuts would raise tax revenue. I did not find such a claim credible, based on the available evidence. I never have, and I still don&#x27;t ... My other work has remained consistent with this view. In a paper on dynamic scoring, written while I was working at the White House, Matthew Weinzierl and I estimated that a broad-based income tax cut (applying to both capital and labor income) would recoup only about a quarter of the lost revenue through supply-side growth effects. For a cut in capital income taxes, the feedback is larger — about 50 percent — but still well under 100 percent. A chapter on dynamic scoring in the 2004 Economic Report of the President says about the same thing.

Glenn Hubbard, who preceded Mankiw as Bush&#x27;s CEA chair, also disputed the assertion that tax cuts increase tax revenues, writing in his 2003 Economic Report of the President: &quot;Although the economy grows in response to tax reductions (because of higher consumption in the short run and improved incentives in the long run), it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity.&quot;

In 1986, Martin Feldstein — a self-described &quot;traditional supply sider&quot; who served as Reagan&#x27;s chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1982 to 1984 — characterized the &quot;new supply siders&quot; who emerged circa 1980:

What distinguished the new supply siders from the traditional supply siders as the 1980s began was not the policies they advocated but the claims that they made for those policies ... The &quot;new&quot; supply siders were much more extravagant in their claims. They projected rapid growth, dramatic increases in tax revenue, a sharp rise in saving, and a relatively painless reduction in inflation. The height of supply side hyperbole was the &quot;Laffer curve&quot; proposition that the tax cut would actually increase tax revenue because it would unleash an enormously depressed supply of effort. Another remarkable proposition was the claim that even if the tax cuts did lead to an increased budget deficit, that would not reduce the funds available for investment in plant and equipment because tax changes would raise the saving rate by enough to finance the increased deficit ... Nevertheless, I have no doubt that the loose talk of the supply side extremists gave fundamentally good policies a bad name and led to quantitative mistakes that not only contributed to subsequent budget deficits but that also made it more difficult to modify policy when those deficits became apparent.

<doc id="26531" wikidata="Q848490" url="?curid=26531" title="Roland Corporation">
<text>is a Japanese multinational manufacturer of electronic musical instruments, electronic equipment, and software. It was founded by Ikutaro Kakehashi in Osaka on 18 April 1972. In 2005, its headquarters relocated to Hamamatsu in Shizuoka Prefecture. It has factories in Malaysia, Taiwan, Japan, and the United States. As of December 2022, it employed 2,783 people. In 2014, it was subject to a management buyout by its CEO, Junichi Miki, supported by Taiyo Pacific Partners.

Roland has manufactured numerous instruments that have had lasting impacts on music, such as the Juno-106 synthesizer, TB-303 bass synthesizer, and TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines. It was also instrumental in the development of MIDI, a standardized means of synchronizing electronic instruments manufactured by different companies. In 2016, &quot;Fact&quot; wrote that Roland had arguably had more influence on electronic music than any other company.

== History ==
===Background===

Roland founder Ikutaro Kakehashi had founded Ace Electronic Industries in 1960, with Ace having designed and manufactured electronic organs, drum machines, instrument amplifiers, and effects pedals. In March 1972, after one of Ace&#x27;s major investors, , was acquired by Sumitomo Chemical (an industrial company with no interest in the music industry), Kakehashi resigned.

===1970s===

On 18 April 1972, just a month after resigning from Ace, Kakehashi founded Roland in Osaka, Kakehashi, who had no musical training, wanted to appeal to amateurs and hobbyists, and focused on miniaturization, affordability, and simplicity.

The &quot;Roland&quot; name was selected for export purposes, as Kakehashi was interested in a name that was easy to pronounce for his worldwide target markets. The name was found in a telephone directory, and Kakehashi was satisfied with the simple two-syllable word and its soft consonants. The letter &quot;R&quot; was chosen because it was not used by many other music equipment companies, so would stand out in trade-show directories and industry listings. Kakehashi did not learn of the French epic poem &quot;The Song of Roland&quot; until later.

With seven employees from his former company, a rented shed, and $100,000, Kakehashi built on his experience at Ace, introducing a drum machine, the TR-77 or Rhythm 77, as Roland&#x27;s first product, followed by the TR-33 and TR-55 released that same year. In 1973, Roland introduced the first compact synthesizer produced in Japan and the first synthesizer produced by Roland, the SH-1000, as well as their first nonpreset synthesizer, the SH-3.

The company was also manufacturing effects pedals, introducing the RE-201 Space Echo in 1974, and expanding into guitar amplifiers the following year with the JC-60 and JC-120 Jazz Chorus, whose chorus circuit would become the first Boss Corporation product, the CE-1 Chorus Ensemble, the following year. In 1976, Roland introduced the semimodular System 100 and the modular System 700 synthesizers.

In 1977, the company introduced one of the earliest microprocessor-driven music sequencers, the MC-8 MicroComposer, and the first guitar synthesizer, the GR-500. Just one year later, they introduced the CompuRhythm CR-78, the first drum machine that enabled users to program and store their own drum patterns.

=== 1980s ===

During the 1980s and 1990s, Roland released several instruments that have had a lasting influence on popular music. After Kakehashi realized microprocessors could be used to program drum machines, Roland launched the TR-808 drum machine, its first programmable drum machine, in 1980. Although it was not an immediate commercial success, the 808 was eventually used on more hit records than any other drum machine and became a cornerstone of the emerging electronic and hip hop genres. It has been described as hip hop&#x27;s equivalent to the Fender Stratocaster guitar, which dramatically influenced the development of rock music. The 808 was followed in 1983 by the TR-909, which, alongside the TB-303 synthesizer, influenced the development of dance music such as techno, house, and acid. Roland released the Roland Jupiter-8 in 1981.

Roland played a key role in the development of MIDI, a standardized means of synchronizing electronic musical instruments manufactured by different companies. Kakehashi proposed developing a standard with representatives from Oberheim Electronics, Sequential Circuits, Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai. He and Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits unveiled MIDI in 1983. It remains the industry standard.

=== 1990s ===

In, 1991 Roland released the JD-800, a digital synthesizer with many sliders. In 1993, they released the JD-990, which is the rackmount version of the JD-800. In 1994, Kakehashi founded the Roland Foundation and became chairman. In 1995, he was appointed the chairman of Roland Corporation.
Roland instruments were also featured in the &quot;There Goes A . . . &quot; series of videos by Dave Hood.

=== 2000s ===
In 2001, Kakehashi resigned as chair of Roland Corporation and was appointed as a special executive adviser. In 2002, he published an autobiography, &quot;I Believe in Music.&quot; His second book, &quot;An Age Without Samples: Originality and Creativity in the Digital World&quot;, was published in 2017.

=== 2010s ===
In 2018, Roland launched a subscription service called Roland Cloud. Users of the service can download and emulate a number of Roland synthesizers (modelled through a proprietary paradigm called &quot;ACB&quot;) and drum machines in audio plugin formats. This collection also includes orchestral modules (namely the Roland SRX racks) and new additions such as original sampled instruments. 

=== 2020s ===
Throughout 2022, Roland celebrated their 50th anniversary by releasing two new editions of their Space Echo tape delay through their Boss brand, along with selling commemorative merchandise and clothing through their online streetswear shop &quot;Roland Lifestyle&quot;. Later on, a collaboration with Dais Records was announced on 8 June ahead of the release of the JUNO-X synthesizer the following month. A new Jupiter-4 emulation for Roland Cloud and an NFT collection also materialised in the summer and autumn respectively.

==Brands==
Roland markets products under a number of brand names, each of which is used on products geared toward a different niche.

* The Roland brand is used on a wide range of products including synthesizers, digital pianos, electronically enhanced accordions, electronic drum systems, dance and DJ gear, guitar synthesizers, amplifiers, and recording products. Many of these products are now also available through Roland Cloud, a VST subscription service.
* Boss is a brand used for products geared toward guitar players, and is used for guitar pedals, effects units, rhythm and accompaniment machines, guitar amplifiers, and portable recording equipment.
* Edirol was a line of professional video-editing and video-presentation systems, as well as portable digital audio recorders. Edirol also had Desktop Media (DTM) products, more production-oriented, and included computer audio interfaces, mixers, and speakers. Following Roland&#x27;s purchase of a controlling interest in Cakewalk Software, most of the division&#x27;s products were rebranded as Cakewalk products or blended with the professional audio/RSS products to form Roland Systems Group. 
* Roland Systems Group is a line of professional commercial audio and video products.
* Amdek was incorporated in 1981 &quot;as a manufacturer of computerized music peripherals and as a distributor of assembled electronic music instrument parts.&quot; The Amdek brand is best remembered for a series of user-assembled effects pedals and accessories, marketed until 1983; at least 16 kits are known to have existed. Amdek&#x27;s primary focus was on the potential uses of personal computers to assist musicians, and in 1982 they introduced the DXY-100, the company&#x27;s first pen plotter, with the intent of allowing users to print out their own sheet music. Soon realizing the printer had a much larger market potential, in 1983 Amdek became the Roland DG Corporation.
* Roland DG is a company in digital printing and engraving technology, produces computerized vinyl cutters, thermal-transfer printer/cutters, wide-format inkjet printers and printer/cutters, 3D scanners, and dental milling devices, and engravers. In 2014, Roland DG officially entered the 3D printing market with the launch of its monoFab series, featuring the ARM-10 3D printer.

* In 1987, Roland acquired the then-defunct Rhodes name, and released a number of digital keyboards bearing the Rhodes brand. Harold Rhodes had regained the rights to the name in 2000 prior to his death that same year. Rhodes was dissatisfied with Roland&#x27;s treatment of the marque, and had plans to reintroduce his iconic electric piano, but died before he was able to bring it to market.
* V-MODA designs and develops &quot;world‑class high‑fidelity headphones and audio devices&quot; and became a part of the Roland family on 8 August 2016 also known as 808 Day.

<doc id="26532" wikidata="Q741855" url="?curid=26532" title="Rhys ap Gruffydd">
<text>Rhys ap Gruffydd or ap Gruffudd (often anglicised to &quot;Griffith&quot;; c. 1132 – 28 April 1197) was the ruler of the kingdom of Deheubarth in south Wales from 1155 to 1197. Today, he is commonly known as The Lord Rhys, in Welsh &quot;Yr Arglwydd Rhys&quot;, although this title may have not been used in his lifetime. He usually used the title &quot;Proprietary Prince of Deheubarth&quot; or &quot;Prince of South Wales&quot;, but two documents have been discovered in which he uses the title &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; or &quot;Prince of the Welsh&quot;. Rhys was one of the most successful and powerful Welsh princes, and, after the death of Owain Gwynedd of Gwynedd in 1170, the dominant power in Wales.

Rhys&#x27;s grandfather, Rhys ap Tewdwr, was king of Deheubarth, and was killed at Brecon in 1093 by Bernard de Neufmarché. Following his death, most of Deheubarth was taken over by the Normans. Rhys&#x27;s father, Gruffydd ap Rhys, eventually was able to become ruler of a small portion, and more territory was won back by Rhys&#x27;s older brothers after Gruffydd&#x27;s death. Rhys became ruler of Deheubarth in 1155. He was forced to submit to King Henry II of England in 1158. Henry invaded Deheubarth in 1163, stripped Rhys of all his lands and took him prisoner. A few weeks later he was released and given back a small part of his holdings. Rhys made an alliance with Owain Gwynedd and, after the failure of another invasion of Wales by Henry in 1165, was able to win back most of his lands.

In 1171 Rhys made peace with King Henry and was confirmed in possession of his recent conquests as well as being named Justiciar of South Wales. He maintained good relations with King Henry until the latter&#x27;s death in 1189. Following Henry&#x27;s death Rhys revolted against Richard I and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory, capturing a number of castles. In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffydd, who maintained a feud with each other. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196 and captured a number of castles. The following year he died unexpectedly and was buried in St Davids Cathedral.

==Genealogy and early life==

Rhys was the fourth son of Gruffydd ap Rhys, ruler of part of Deheubarth, by his wife Gwenllian ferch Gruffydd, daughter of Gruffudd ap Cynan, king of Gwynedd. His next older brother was Maredudd ap Gruffydd, and there were older brothers, Morgan and Maelgwn, who were killed in battle with their mother in 1136. He also had two older half-brothers, Anarawd and Cadell, from his father&#x27;s first marriage. Rhys married Gwenllian ferch Madog, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, the last Prince of all Powys.
His grandfather, Rhys ap Tewdwr, had been king of all Deheubarth until his death in 1093. Rhys ap Tewdwr was killed in Brycheiniog, and most of his kingdom was taken over by Norman lords. Gruffydd ap Rhys was forced to flee to Ireland. He later returned to Deheubarth and ruled a portion of the kingdom, but was forced to flee to Ireland again in 1127. When Rhys was born in 1132, his father held only the commote of Caeo in Cantref Mawr.

The death of King Henry I of England, and the ensuing Anarchy arising from the rival claims of Stephen and Matilda to the English throne, gave the Welsh the opportunity to rise against the Normans. A revolt spread through south Wales in 1136, and Gruffydd ap Rhys, aided by his two eldest sons, Anarawd and Cadell, defeated the Normans in a battle near Loughor, killing over five hundred. After driving Walter de Clifford out of Cantref Bychan, Gruffydd set off to Gwynedd to enlist the help of his father-in-law, Gruffudd ap Cynan. In the absence of her husband, Gwenllian led an army against the Norman lordship of Cydweli (Kidwelly), taking along her two oldest sons, Morgan and Maelgwn. She was defeated and killed by an army commanded by Maurice de Londres of Oystermouth Castle. Morgan was also killed and Maelgwn captured.

Gruffydd formed an alliance with Gwynedd, and later in 1136 the sons of Gruffudd ap Cynan, Owain Gwynedd and Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, led an army to Ceredigion. Their combined forces won a decisive victory over the Normans at the Battle of Crug Mawr. Ceredigion was reclaimed from the Normans, but was annexed by Gwynedd as the senior partner in the alliance. Gruffydd ap Rhys continued his campaign against the Normans in 1137, but died later that year. The leadership of the family now passed to Rhys&#x27; half-brother Anarawd ap Gruffydd. In 1143, when Rhys was eleven, Anarawd was murdered, a death arranged for by Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, brother of Owain Gwynedd, king of Gwynedd. Owain punished Cadwaladr by depriving him of his lands in Ceredigion.

==First battles (1146–1155)==
Anarawd&#x27;s brother, Cadell ap Gruffydd, took over as head of the family. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Pembroke, rebuilt Carmarthen Castle in 1145, then began a campaign to reclaim Ceredigion. He built a castle in the commote of Mabudryd, but Cadell, aided by Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd who held Ceredigion for Gwynedd, destroyed it in 1146. Rhys appears in the annals for the first time in 1146, fighting alongside his brothers Cadell and Maredudd in the capture by assault of Llansteffan Castle. This was followed by the capture of Wiston in 1147, Carmarthen in 1150 and Loughor in 1151. In 1151 Cadell was attacked while out hunting by a group of Norman and Flemish knights from Tenby, and left for dead. He survived, but suffered injuries which left him unable to play an active role, and in 1153 he left on a pilgrimage to Rome.

Maredudd became ruler of Deheubarth and continued a campaign, begun in 1150, aimed at recovering Ceredigion, which had been held by Gwynedd since 1136. Maredudd and Rhys drove Hywel ab Owain Gwynedd from Ceredigion by 1153. The same year Rhys is recorded as an independent commander for the first time, leading an army to capture the Norman castle of St Clears. Maredudd and Rhys also destroyed the castles at Tenby and Aberafan that year. Maredudd died in 1155 at the age of twenty-five and left Rhys as ruler of Deheubarth. Around this time he married Gwenllian ferch Madog, daughter of Madog ap Maredudd, prince of Powys.

==Early reign==

===Loss of territory (1155–1163)===

Shortly after becoming ruler of Deheubarth, Rhys heard rumours that Owain Gwynedd was planning to invade Ceredigion in order to reclaim it for Gwynedd. Rhys responded by building a castle at Aberdyfi in 1156. The threatened invasion did not take place, and Turvey claims that Owain&#x27;s intention may have been to test the resolve of the new ruler.

King Stephen had died in October 1154, bringing to an end the long dispute with the Empress Matilda which had helped Anarawd, Cadell and Maredudd to extend their rule in Deheubarth. With disunity within the realm no longer a problem, the new king of England, Henry II, soon turned his attention to Wales. He began with an invasion of Gwynedd in 1157. This invasion was not entirely successful, but Owain Gwynedd was induced to seek terms and to give up some territory in the north-east of Wales.
The following year, Henry prepared an invasion of Deheubarth. Rhys made plans to resist, but was persuaded by his council to meet the king to discuss peace terms. The terms were much harsher than those offered to Owain: Rhys was stripped of all his possessions apart from Cantref Mawr, though he was promised one other cantref. The other territories were returned to their Norman lords.

Among the Normans who returned to their holdings was Walter de Clifford, who reclaimed Cantref Bychan, then invaded Rhys&#x27;s lands in Cantref Mawr. An appeal to the king produced no response, and Rhys resorted to arms, first capturing Clifford&#x27;s castle at Llandovery then seizing Ceredigion. King Henry responded by preparing another invasion, and Rhys submitted without resistance. He was obliged to give hostages, probably including his son Hywel.

The king was absent in France in 1159, and Rhys took the opportunity to attack Dyfed and then to lay siege to Carmarthen, which was saved by a relief force led by Earl Reginald of Cornwall. Rhys retreated to Cantref Mawr, where an army led by five earls, the Earls of Cornwall, Gloucester, Hertford, Pembroke and Salisbury, marched against him. The earls were assisted by Cadwaladr, brother of Owain Gwynedd, and Owain&#x27;s sons, Hywel and Cynan. However they were forced to withdraw and a truce was arranged. In 1162, Rhys again attempted to recover some of his lost lands, and captured Llandovery castle. The following year Henry II returned to England after an absence of four years and prepared for another invasion of Deheubarth. Rhys met the king to discuss terms and was obliged to give more hostages, including another son, Maredudd. He was then seized and taken to England as a prisoner. Henry appears to have been uncertain what to do with Rhys, but after a few weeks decided to free him and allow him to rule Cantref Mawr. Rhys was summoned to appear before Henry at Woodstock to do homage together with Owain Gwynedd and Malcolm IV of Scotland.

===Welsh uprising (1164–1170)===

In 1164 all the Welsh princes united in an uprising. Warren suggests that when Rhys and Owain were obliged to do homage to Henry in 1163 they were forced to accept a status of dependent vassalage instead of their previous client status, and that this led to the revolt. Rhys had other reasons for rebellion, for he had returned to Deheubarth from England to find that the neighbouring Norman lords were threatening Cantref Mawr. His nephew, Einion ab Anarawd, who was the captain of his bodyguard, had been murdered at the instigation of Roger de Clare, Earl of Hertford. The murderer had been given the protection of the Clares in Ceredigion. Rhys first appealed to the king to intercede; when this failed, he invaded Ceredigion and recaptured all of it apart from the town and castle of Cardigan. The Welsh revolt led to another invasion of Wales by King Henry in 1165. Henry attacked Gwynedd first, but instead of following the usual invasion route along the north coast he attacked from the south, following a route over the Berwyn hills. He was met by the united forces of the Welsh princes, led by Owain Gwynedd and including Rhys. According to &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot;:

Torrential rain forced Henry&#x27;s army to retreat in disorder without fighting a major battle, and Henry vented his spleen on the hostages, having Rhys&#x27;s son Maredudd blinded. Rhys&#x27;s other son, Hywel, was not among the victims. Rhys returned to Deheubarth where he captured and burned Cardigan Castle. He allowed the garrison to depart, but held the castellan, Robert Fitz-Stephen, as a prisoner. Shortly afterwards Rhys captured Cilgerran castle.

In 1167 he joined Owain Gwynedd in an attack on Owain Cyfeiliog of southern Powys, and spent three weeks helping Owain besiege the Norman castle of Rhuddlan. In 1168 he attacked the Normans at Builth, destroying its castle. Rhys benefited from the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169 and 1170, which was largely led by the Cambro-Norman lords of south Wales. In 1167 the King of Leinster, Diarmait Mac Murchada, who had been driven out of his kingdom, had asked Rhys to release Robert Fitz-Stephen from captivity to take part in an expedition to Ireland. Rhys did not oblige at the time, but released him the following year and in 1169 Fitz-Stephen led the vanguard of a Norman army which landed in Wexford. The leader of the Norman forces, Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, known as &quot;Strongbow&quot;, followed in 1170. According to Warren, &quot;they were prompted to go by a growing suspicion that King Henry did not intend to renew his offensive against the Welsh, but was instead seeking an accommodation with the Welsh leaders&quot;. The departure of the Norman lords enabled Rhys to strengthen his position, and the death of Owain Gwynedd in late 1170 left him as the acknowledged leader of the Welsh princes.

==Later reign==

===Peace with King Henry (1171–1188)===
In 1171 King Henry II arrived in England from France, on his way to Ireland. Henry wished to ensure that Richard de Clare, who had married Diarmait&#x27;s daughter and become heir to Leinster, did not establish an independent Norman kingdom in Ireland. His decision to try a different approach in his dealings with the Welsh was influenced by the events in Ireland, although Warren suggests that &quot;it seems likely that Henry began rethinking his attitude to the Welsh soon after the débâcle of 1165&quot;. Henry now wished to make peace with Rhys, who came to Newnham to meet him. Rhys was to pay a tribute of 300 horses and 4,000 head of cattle, but was confirmed in possession of all the lands he had taken from Norman lords, including the Clares. They met again in October that year at Pembroke as Henry waited to cross to Ireland. Rhys had collected 86 of the 300 horses, but Henry agreed to take only 36 of them and remitted the remainder of the tribute until after his return from Ireland. Rhys&#x27;s son, Hywel, who had been held as a hostage for many years, was returned to him. Henry and Rhys met once more at Laugharne as Henry returned from Ireland in 1172, and shortly afterwards Henry appointed Rhys &quot;justice on his behalf in all Deheubarth&quot;. According to A. D. Carr:

The agreement between Henry and Rhys was to last until Henry&#x27;s death in 1189. When Henry&#x27;s sons rebelled against him in 1173 Rhys sent his son Hywel Sais to Normandy to aid the king, then in 1174 personally led an army to Tutbury in Staffordshire to assist at the siege of the stronghold of the rebel Earl William de Ferrers. When Rhys returned to Wales after the fall of Tutbury, he left a thousand men with the king for service in Normandy. King Henry held a council at Gloucester in 1175 which was attended by a large gathering of Welsh princes, led by Rhys. It appears to have concluded with the swearing of a mutual assistance pact for the preservation of peace and order in Wales. In 1177 Rhys, Dafydd ab Owain, who had emerged as the main power in Gwynedd, and Cadwallon ap Madog from Rhwng Gwy a Hafren swore fealty and liege homage to Henry at a council held at Oxford. At this council the king gave Meirionnydd, part of the kingdom of Gwynedd, to Rhys.
Rhys built a number of stone castles, starting with Cardigan castle, which was the earliest recorded native-built stone castle in Wales. He also built Carreg Cennen castle near Llandeilo, a castle set in a spectacular position on a mountain top. He held a festival of poetry and song at his court at Cardigan over Christmas 1176. This is generally regarded as the first recorded Eisteddfod. The festival was announced a year in advance throughout Wales and in England, Scotland, Ireland and possibly France. Two chairs were awarded as prizes, one for the best poem and the other for the best musical performance. J. E. Caerwyn Williams suggests that this event may be an adaptation of the similar French &quot;puys&quot;. R.R. Davies suggests that the texts of Welsh law, traditionally codified by Hywel Dda at Whitland, were first assembled in book form under the aegis of Rhys.

Rhys founded two religious houses during this period. Talley Abbey was the first Premonstratensian abbey in Wales, while Llanllyr was a Cistercian nunnery, only the second nunnery to be founded in Wales and the first to prosper. He became the patron of the abbeys of Whitland and Strata Florida and made large grants to both houses. Giraldus Cambrensis, who was related to Rhys, gives an account of his meetings with Rhys in 1188 when Giraldus accompanied Archbishop Baldwin around Wales to raise men for the Third Crusade. Some Welsh clerics were not happy about this visit, but Rhys was enthusiastic and gave the Archbishop a great deal of assistance. Giraldus says that Rhys decided to go on crusade himself and spent several weeks making preparations, but was eventually persuaded to change his mind by his wife Gwenllian, &quot;by female artifices&quot;.

===Final campaigns (1189–1196)===

Henry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by Richard I. Rhys considered that he was no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest and Gower, and captured the castles of St. Clear&#x27;s, Laugharne and Llansteffan. Richard&#x27;s brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.

In his later years Rhys had trouble keeping control of his sons, particularly Maelgwn and Gruffydd. In 1189 Gruffydd persuaded Rhys to imprison Maelgwn, and he was given into Gruffydd&#x27;s keeping at Dinefwr. Gruffydd handed him over to his father-in-law, William de Braose. Gruffydd is also said to have persuaded his father to annex the lordship of Cemais and its chief castle of Nevern, held by William FitzMartin, in 1191. This action was criticised by Giraldus Cambrensis, who describes Gruffydd as &quot;a cunning and artful man&quot;. William FitzMartin was married to Rhys&#x27;s daughter Angharad, and, according to Giraldus, Rhys &quot;had solemnly sworn, by the most precious relics, that his indemnity and security should be faithfully maintained&quot;. Rhys had also annexed the Norman lordships of Cydweli and Carnwyllion in 1190. In 1192 Rhys secured Maelgwn&#x27;s release, but by now Maelgwn and Gruffydd were bitter enemies. In 1194 Rhys was defeated in battle by Maelgwn and Hywel, who imprisoned him in Nevern castle, though Hywel later released his father without Maelgwn&#x27;s consent. Giraldus suggests that Rhys&#x27;s incarceration in Nevern castle was divine vengeance for the dispossession of William FitzMartin. In 1195 two other sons, Rhys Gryg and Maredudd, seized Llanymddyfri and Dinefwr, and Rhys responded by imprisoning them. Rhys launched his last campaign against the Normans in 1196. He captured a number of castles, including Carmarthen, Colwyn, Radnor and Painscastle, and defeated an army led by Roger de Mortimer and Hugh de Say near Radnor, with forty knights among the dead. This was Rhys&#x27; last battle. William de Braose offered terms, and Painscastle was returned to him.

===Death and aftermath (1197)===

Rhys died on 28 April 1197, unexpectedly, and was buried in St Davids Cathedral. The chronicler of &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; records for 1197:

Rhys died excommunicate, having quarreled with the Bishop of St Davids, Peter de Leia, over the theft of some of the bishop&#x27;s horses some years previously. Before he could be buried in the cathedral, the bishop had his corpse scourged in posthumous penance.

Rhys had nominated his eldest legitimate son, Gruffydd ap Rhys, as his successor, and soon after his father&#x27;s death Gruffydd met the Justiciar, Archbishop Hubert Walter, on the border and was confirmed as heir. Maelgwn, the eldest son but illegitimate, refused to accept this and was given military assistance by Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys. Maelgwn took the town and castle of Aberystwyth and captured Gruffydd, whom he handed over to the custody of Gwenwynwyn. Gwenwynwyn later handed him over to the king, who imprisoned him at Corfe Castle.

==Character and historical assessment==
Giraldus Cambrensis frequently mentions Rhys in his writings and describes him as &quot;a man of excellent wit and quick in repartee&quot;. Gerald tells the story of a banquet at Hereford in 1186 where Rhys sat between two members of the Clare family. What could have been a tense affair, since Rhys had seized lands in Ceredigion previously held by the Clare family, passed off with an exchange of courteous compliments, followed by some good-natured banter between Rhys and Gerald about their family connections. Rhys gave Gerald and Archbishop Baldwin a great deal of assistance when they visited Wales to raise troops for the crusade in 1188, and Gerald several times refers to his &quot;kindness&quot; and says that Rhys accompanied them all the way from Cardigan to the northern border of Ceredigion &quot;with a liberality peculiarly praiseworthy in so illustrious a prince&quot;.

Another contemporary writer also wrote of Rhys if Roger Turvey is correct in stating that Walter Map&#x27;s piece &quot;Of the King Appollonides&quot; deals with Rhys under a pseudonym. Map was less favourably disposed toward Rhys, describing him as &quot;This king I have seen and know, and hate&quot;, but goes on to say &quot;I would not have my hatred blacken his worth; it is not my wish ever to suppress any man&#x27;s excellence through envy&quot;. He tells the following story about Apollonides/Rhys:

Davies provides the following assessment of Rhys:

Davies also notes two flaws in Rhys&#x27;s achievement. One was the personal nature of his accord with Henry II, which meant that it did not survive Henry&#x27;s death. The other was his inability to control his sons or to force them to accept Gruffydd as his successor.

==Children==
Rhys had at least nine sons and eight daughters. Three of the sons were named Maredudd and two of the daughters were named Gwenllian.

* Gruffydd ap Rhys II (died 1201) was the eldest legitimate son and was nominated by Rhys as his successor. He married Maud de Braose, the daughter of William de Braose and Maud de Braose.
* Maelgwn ap Rhys (died 1231), who was the eldest son but illegitimate.
* Rhys Gryg (died 1233) married a daughter of the Earl of Clare.
* Hywel ap Rhys (died 1231) 
* Maredudd ap Rhys (died 1239)
* Another Maredudd (died 1227) became Archdeacon of Cardigan.
* Rhys&#x27;s daughter Nest or Annest ferch Rhys married Rhodri ab Owain, prince of the western part of Gwynedd.
* Gwenllian (circa 1178 – 1236) who married Ednyfed Fychan, seneschal of Gwynedd under Llywelyn the Great, and through her, Rhys became an ancestor of the Tudor dynasty. Through the Tudors inter-marrying with the House of Stuart Rhys is an ancestor to the current ruling house of the United Kingdom and also an ancestor of several ruling houses in Europe. When Henry Tudor landed in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1485 to make a bid for the throne, his descent from Rhys was one of the factors which enabled him to attract Welsh support (Henry flew a (Welsh) dragon banner at the battle of Bosworth Field).
* Angharad ferch Rhys married William FitzMartin, lord of Cemais.
* Other daughters married the Welsh rulers of Gwrtheyrnion and Elfael.

<doc id="26534" wikidata="Q258015" url="?curid=26534" title="Rachel Summers">
<text>Rachel Anne Summers is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-plotter John Byrne.

In her first appearance, the character&#x27;s surname was not revealed; in later appearances, she was established as the daughter of the alternate future counterparts to Cyclops and Jean Grey-Summers from the dystopian Days of Future Past timeline. Although there are other characters bearing her name throughout the multiverse, she herself is considered a multiversal anomaly with no true alternate-universe counterparts.

The character is a mutant with similar abilities to her mother, including telepathy, telekinesis, and a connection to the Phoenix Force. Throughout her publication history, she has also been referred to by the monikers Marvel Girl, Phoenix, Prestige, and Mother Askani (later simply Askani).

==Publication history==

Rachel first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #141 (Jan. 1981) and has since been affiliated with several comic book superhero teams including the X-Men and Excalibur.

In 2022, she joined the Knights of X team as part of the Destiny of X era under the leadership of Captain Britain, who takes a group of mutants under her wing leading them into the Otherworld. The title was the follow-up to the 2019&#x27;s Excalibur relaunch and was written by Tini Howard. In its fourth issue, Rachel Summers and her long-time friend Betsy Braddock confessed their romantic feelings for each other and their kiss was shown in a splash page.

==Fictional character biography==
===Future adolescence===
Rachel Anne Summers comes from an alternate future Earth known as Earth-811, as seen in the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot; storyline from &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #141–142. In this reality, the assassination of Senator Robert Kelly provoked the ratification of the Mutant Registration Act, leading to a dystopian future where the mutant-hunting Sentinel robots rule North America. Rachel was abducted by operatives working for Ahab, who used drugs and hypnotherapy to turn Rachel into the mutant-hunting &quot;Hound&quot;. She fulfilled her duties, but her psychic powers linked her to her victims; fueling her grief and despair until she attacked Ahab and scarred him. In return, he sent her to the mutant concentration camps. There, she befriended the surviving mutant rebels, including Wolverine, Magneto, Colossus, Storm, Kate Pryde, and her lover, the adult Franklin Richards.

Rachel managed to send Kate&#x27;s consciousness into the past to her younger self to prevent the assassination, but it did not change their time. Rachel sent her astral form into the past to find out why and discovered she had sent Kate into an alternate past. On the way back, she encountered the disembodied Phoenix Force and it followed her to her present. Rachel passed out from the strain of astral projection and the Phoenix Force revealed itself to Kate, who asked it to give Rachel a fresh start.

When Rachel and Kate broke into &quot;Project: Nimrod&quot; on a suicide mission to destroy a new model of Sentinel, they became trapped. When Kate spoke the words &quot;Dark Phoenix,&quot; the Phoenix Force ripped Rachel from her timeline and sent her body back to the alternate past to which she had sent Kate&#x27;s consciousness. This was a past where she learned Jean Grey was dead and that her father was married to someone else. Rachel experienced additional heartache and displacement trauma when she discovered that her father&#x27;s new wife, Madelyne Pryor, was pregnant with a son (Nathan Summers), because in her timeline she was the first-born child of Scott Summers.

===X-Men===
Rachel had a brief membership in the X-Men before finding a Shi&#x27;ar holoempathic crystal at her grandparents&#x27; home. The crystal was imprinted with a portion of Rachel&#x27;s mother&#x27;s essence inside it as a tribute to the family shortly after Jean Grey&#x27;s death. After Rachel took a vow to remember her mother with the uniform and name of Phoenix, the Phoenix Force fully bonded with her. She was granted access to its power on a cosmic magnitude, albeit in a much more limited fashion than the Dark Phoenix. Soon after, the grudge which she had begun with Selene boiled over when Rachel secretly invaded the Hellfire Club. She did this with the intention of taking vengeance on Selene for the murders she had committed, particularly that of nightclub owner Nicholas Damiano, who had previously taken Rachel into his home after Selene had attacked her. Selene proved to be no match for Rachel&#x27;s newly increased powers, but just as she was about to finish Selene, Wolverine arrived and was forced to stab Rachel in the chest. Critically injured, Rachel was lured into Spiral&#x27;s &quot;Body Shoppe.&quot;

===Excalibur===

Months later, while recuperating from injuries on Muir Island, Shadowcat and Nightcrawler both had the same dream, where they were actors and helped Rachel, who was trapped there, escape. Shortly thereafter, Rachel escaped from the alternate reality of Mojoworld. Rachel has once been cited having a flashback to her time there where she is held in chains and tortured. The three former X-Men were joined by Captain Britain and Meggan and founded the British superhero team Excalibur. While part of the team, she discovered that this universe&#x27;s version of her mother, Jean Grey, was alive. She attempted to bond with Jean, but Jean, upon discovering Rachel was the present host for the Phoenix, rejected any contact with her. Jean still resented the Phoenix Force for stealing a portion of her life. She also rejected Rachel because she felt that Rachel&#x27;s existence was a constant reminder of the dystopian future she feared could still come to pass. Eventually, however, Jean moved past those feelings and formally welcomed Rachel into her life.

===Askani===
Rachel remained with Excalibur until an incident caused Captain Britain to be lost in the timestream. She exchanged places with the time-lost Captain Britain and emerged two thousand years in the future, in a world conquered by Apocalypse and crushed under his iron fist. She gathered together a group of rebels and founded the Askani. She trained one of her followers to travel back in time and bring her &quot;brother&quot; Nathan forward in time when he was infected with a techno-organic virus. The Askani cloned Nathan in case he was not able to survive the virus. Apocalypse&#x27;s followers attacked the Askani and took the clone (who would later become the supervillain Stryfe), leaving Rachel critically injured. Hooked up to life support, she drew the minds of Scott and Jean into the future, as &quot;Slym&quot; and &quot;Redd&quot;, to raise Nathan and tutor him in the use of his powers. Rachel finally died ten years later and sent Scott and Jean back to their original bodies seconds after they had left.

After Nathan, now known as Cable, had finally defeated Apocalypse, he went into the timeline to retrieve Rachel. There, he discovered a Rachel &quot;sans&quot; Phoenix Force. With the premature death of Apocalypse, the Askani timeline had been diverged from the mainstream Marvel Universe, Earth-616. As a result, she had been flung into the far future, yet subjectively a short time after she had been lost in the timestream, as the slave of a creature called &quot;Gaunt&quot;, who had used her to lead Cable there for a &quot;battle of the ages&quot;. Cable defeated Gaunt in the battle and Rachel, now free, was able to use her residual Phoenix Force to return them both to the present. She then decided to take a break from superheroics and enrolled in college after she made Cable promise he would not tell anyone she was back. Despite her efforts to live a normal life, however, she was kidnapped by the telepath Elias Bogan and subsequently rescued by the X-Men.

===Rachel Grey===
She decided to rejoin the X-Men, taking the name &quot;Marvel Girl&quot; to honor her mother (who had recently died yet again) and wearing a costume her mother had designed but never worn: a variation on Jean&#x27;s first green costume. She also changed her last name to &quot;Grey&quot;, possibly to express disapproval at her father&#x27;s betrayal of Jean, as well as his continuing relationship with Emma Frost; though she and Emma made a truce of sorts during one of the team&#x27;s missions in Hong Kong. Rachel and Nightcrawler began to have an attraction towards each other, kissing at one point, but nothing came of it as Nightcrawler also had an attraction to Storm at the time, who was in somewhat of a romantic &quot;friendship&quot; with Wolverine. Her stint with this team also included a visit to the Savage Land. In the storyline &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;, which was heavily criticized by readers, Rachel was subjected to the mind-control of a tribe of advanced dinosaur people, the Hauk&#x27;ka, causing her to believe she belonged to their species. Afterward, she subconsciously used her telekinesis to change her own genome in their image. This was eventually reverted. After &quot;House of M&quot; and &quot;Decimation&quot;, where most of the world&#x27;s mutants lost their powers, the government had Sentinels instituted at the X-Mansion to protect the mutants in case any enemies used this low point to attack. Though their intentions were good this time, it reminded Rachel too much of the previous timeline when Sentinels herded mutants into concentration camps.

Rachel had a short stint with newly re-formed Excalibur, reminiscent of the former team, shortly after the &quot;House of M&quot; events. She assisted the team in battling Shadow-X and the Shadow King (in the guise of Professor X).

===End of Greys===

Rachel spent some time with her grandparents, bonding with her grandfather. At a family reunion with all her relatives, a commando unit under the order of the Shi&#x27;ar attacked the party, killing everyone in an effort to wipe out the Grey genome. The commando unit was unable to kill Rachel; instead, one member was able to graft a &quot;deathmark&quot; on her back that would allow them to find her wherever she went. It is assumed that the only remaining member of the Grey family now left on Earth besides Rachel is Cable. Afterward, at the graves of the Grey family, Rachel vowed a terrible vengeance on the Shi&#x27;ar and was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not my mom. I&#x27;m not the Phoenix. I&#x27;m my own woman. And by the time I&#x27;m done... they&#x27;ll wish I &quot;was&quot; the Phoenix.&quot;

The Death Commandos later tracked Rachel to the psychiatry office of Dr. Maureen Lyszinski. Rachel, with the help of Psylocke, Nightcrawler, Bishop, and Cannonball, saved the doctor and took down the Death Commandos. She decided to imprison them, instead of killing them, by telling them, &quot;I mean to find destiny in a way that brings us both [Jean Grey] honor.&quot; She is also sometimes referenced as &quot;Starchilde&quot; in this series.

===Rise and Fall of the Shi&#x27;ar Empire===
After Rachel was kidnapped, along with Cyclops, by her paternal uncle Vulcan, he freed Darwin from inside him. Later, Professor X recruited Rachel, along with Havok, Nightcrawler, Warpath, Darwin, and Polaris, for a space mission to stop Vulcan from laying waste to the Shi&#x27;ar empire. Xavier, who recently was stripped of his powers, recruited Rachel to serve as his telepathic &quot;eyes and ears&quot; during their mission. Aware of Rachel&#x27;s vendetta against the Shi&#x27;ar, Xavier agreed to use their trip into space to find out who in the Shi&#x27;ar Empire gave the order to wipe out all members of the Grey family, and he warned Rachel that they will deal with the people responsible for her recent losses Xavier&#x27;s way.

While in space, the team was attacked by Korvus, a Shi&#x27;ar warrior sent to kill Rachel. Korvus&#x27; ancestor, Rook&#x27;shir, was a previous host of the Phoenix Force, and a small portion of the Phoenix&#x27;s power was left behind in his sword, the Blade of the Phoenix. With this power, Korvus made short work of the other X-Men, but when Rachel blocked the sword, their minds were involuntarily linked. Through this link, Rachel learned that Korvus&#x27; family was also murdered by the Shi&#x27;ar government because of their connection to the Phoenix. The remaining echo of the Phoenix power from the sword was then transferred to Rachel. Rachel claimed that rather than having taken the power, the power chose to go to her, saying, &quot;The Phoenix knows me, remember? It likes me.&quot; When this happened, Rachel&#x27;s normally gold energy aura turned blue, the same color as the Blade of the Phoenix. She then telekinetically disabled an explosive implant that the Shi&#x27;ar chancellor was using to force Korvus&#x27; obedience.

Due to Rachel&#x27;s connection to Korvus through the sword, she discovers the Phoenix Force formerly in the blade is just an echo, a &quot;blue shadow&quot;, of the Force. The shadow of the Phoenix begins influencing Rachel&#x27;s behavior, causing her to design a new darker uniform and begin a romance with Korvus. She soon breaks off the relationship after she realizes their bond is only because of the residual Phoenix Force.

Leading up to the fight with Vulcan, Rachel is shown using her powers to kill the guards who stand in her way. Havok warns her not to, but Rachel tells him that they deserve to die after what they did to her family. When it comes to the big fight, Rachel shows just how powerful she is by protecting Korvus from one of Vulcan&#x27;s blasts. Rachel is one of the X-Men stranded in Shi&#x27;ar space when their ship is sent back to Earth.

After the death of her other grandfather, Corsair, at the hands of Vulcan, she, along with Havok, Polaris, Korvus, Ch&#x27;od, and Raza, become the new Starjammers. They elect to remain in Shi&#x27;ar space and restore Lilandra to the throne or die trying. As her uncle states, &quot;If they fail, he has no doubt that Vulcan will head for Earth.&quot;

===Starjammers===
During the conflict, the Starjammers find another threat in the form of the Scy&#x27;ar Tal (translates as &quot;Death to the Shi&#x27;ar&quot;). Rachel makes contact with the eldest Scy&#x27;ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy&#x27;ar Tal were originally called the M&#x27;Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi`ar attacked them, killing a great number of their people and making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi&#x27;ar settled on their planet, took the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra and K&#x27;ythri. The M&#x27;Kraan then changed their name to Scy&#x27;ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi`ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather&#x27;s Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan made contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire.

During the ceasefire, Rachel comes into contact with the Death Commandos again and attempts to kill them to avenge the deaths of her relatives; however, she is deterred by Polaris. In the end, all the Starjammers are captured by the Shi&#x27;ar except Rachel, Korvus, and Lilandra.

===X-Men: Kingbreaker and War of Kings===
Rachel and the Starjammers play a large role in the sequel to the &quot;Emperor Vulcan&quot; miniseries called &quot;X-Men: Kingbreaker&quot;. She is also seen prominently in the &quot;War of Kings&quot; storyline, which features Vulcan, the Inhumans, Nova, and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

While with the Starjammers, in battle with Vulcan&#x27;s new guard, the fragment of the &quot;blue&quot; Phoenix within her and Korvus&#x27; blade mysteriously leaves them. After the Phoenix echo leaves Rachel, she says &quot;please... not now... Mom.&quot; From this frame onward, the &quot;hound&quot; markings reappear on Rachel&#x27;s face.

In agreement with the Inhumans, the Starjammers and the Guardians of the Galaxy assault a Shi&#x27;ar vessel to free Lilandra, hoping to end the conflict while restoring her to the throne. Even without her Phoenix powers, Rachel is powerful enough to entrap Gladiator in an illusion to keep him distracted from battle. Their gambit pays off and the group is able to free Lilandra.

Rachel is next seen as Lilandra&#x27;s bodyguard along with the rest of the Starjammers. On the home planet of the Shi&#x27;ar, Lilandra assumes her throne, but while making a ceremonial gesture is killed by the murderer known as Razor, who possesses the Darkhawk armor. The only person who perceives this is Rachel, since Razor is shielded from the perceptions of others.

After Lilandra is assassinated, Rachel fights alongside the Starjammers against the Shi&#x27;ar Guard and Araki, who has summoned the same Shi&#x27;ar commandos that killed Rachel&#x27;s family and branded her with the Shi&#x27;ar death mark. Rachel uses her powers to implode Black Cloak&#x27;s head, saying, &quot;He was the one... He killed my family,&quot; though killing him does not make her feel happier. Gladiator finishes the job by killing Araki himself. Rachel, along with the rest of the Starjammers, regroup later on and mourn the Shi&#x27;ar, as they doubt that they will recover from this war.

===Realm of Kings===
It is known through Ch&#x27;od, and apparently due to the incident where she and Korvus both lost the connection to the Phoenix Force, that Rachel and Korvus, along with Havok and Polaris, have departed for Earth.

===Age of X===
While on the way back to Earth, Rachel attempted to contact Professor Xavier or Emma Frost with a message. However at that moment, Moira (a powerful alternate personality of the mutant Legion) warped reality taking Rachel&#x27;s mind with it creating the amnesic Revenant. Once reality was restored, Rachel&#x27;s mind is separated from her body which according to her is &quot;half a universe away&quot;. Because of Moira&#x27;s actions, Rachel no longer remembers the message and her mind retains the form of her Age of X counterpart. Scott promised her that they would return her home.

===Schism and Regenesis===
Rachel reappears in &quot;Schism&quot;. She asks Rogue to connect with her to see what will happen. When the two of them touch, Rogue sees a vision of where Rachel, Havok and Polaris are as Rachel then returns to her body. When she awakens she is met by an unseen villain holding a gun and telling her he has killed her friends.

Borrowing one of Legion&#x27;s manifold powers, Rogue teleports alongside Gambit, Magneto and Frenzy to rescue their teammates on the other side of the galaxy. Once there, Rachel is retrieved from a band of pirates as Rogue becomes their new leader. The remaining X-Men discover they&#x27;ve arrived at a space station called Gul Damar which is in a state of upheaval due to the rebellion of insectoid creatures called Grad Nan Holt against their Shi&#x27;ar enslavers. They are also being pulled into an exploding sun and the entire civil war is revealed to be orchestrated by a powerful Grad Nan Holt telepath known as &quot;Friendless.&quot; A number of battles with the creature proves unsuccessful for Rachel, but with the combined efforts of Rogue and the X-Men they are able to defeat him and return home via the wormhole that was created from the collapsing star.

Rachel as part of a team of Wolverine&#x27;s X-Men attempted to psychically battle Exodus in an attempt to prevent the assassination of Cyclops. The team is eventually beaten and the X-Men are saved by Generation Hope.

Rachel is then invited to hold a position as senior staff member of the &quot;Jean Grey School for Higher Learning,&quot; which was rebuilt from the Xavier Institute and has Wolverine as acting Headmaster and Kitty Pryde as Headmistress.

====Avengers vs. X-Men====
During the events of &quot;AVX&quot;, when the X-Men on Utopia escape from the invading Avengers, Rachel contacts Cyclops to provide Hope&#x27;s location. Afterwards, Rachel states that she knows the Phoenix Force better than anyone else on Earth and that she is living proof that it can be controlled. She also says that if the Phoenix has chosen her and that is the destiny that Hope wants, she will do everything in her power to help her. She and Iceman tell Wolverine at the school that they are going to help Cyclops in the battle. However, when Cyclops and Emma Frost begin to be corrupted by the Phoenix&#x27;s power, she, like the other X-Men, decide to oppose their rule. Rachel then battled against Cyclops and helped both the Avengers and X-Men in the final battle.

====Marvel NOW! and Inhuman war====
In 2013, Marvel revealed an all new all female series simply named &quot;X-Men&quot;. Written by Brian Wood with art by Olivier Coipel, &quot;X-Men&quot; will feature an all female cast including Storm, Jubilee, Rogue, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey and Psylocke.

The X-Men are in pursuit of Arkea, who has attempted to revive the X-Men&#x27;s long lost enemies. The X-Men are attacked by the newly formed Sisterhood and Rachel is telepathically locked down by Madelyne Pryor. Storm strikes a deal for Rachels freedom allowing Madelyne and Selene to walk free.

In the &quot;AXIS&quot; story arc, Storm sends the entire student body against the Red Onslaught in an attempt to save Earth. Rachel is shown to be reverted to her hound form by Dr. Doom and Wanda Maximoffs spell.

Rachel is part of Storm&#x27;s team of Amazing X-Men who attempts to stop the Living Monolith from becoming the new Juggernaut.

Rachel Grey is distrusting of Spider-Man&#x27;s newly appointed position as Jean Grey School guidance counsellor. Using her telepathy she seeks to expose his secret identity only to lose that memory by being mind-wiped by Martha Johansson.

Rachel is shown as a teacher at the Jean Grey Institute in the battle against Kenji.

===ResurrXion===
When Kitty Pryde returns from space to lead the X-Men, Rachel joins her team in &quot;X-Men Gold&quot; and adopts the unique, new code name Prestige.

===Dawn of X===
In the new status quo for mutants post &quot;House of X and Powers of X&quot;, Professor X and Magneto invite all mutants to live on Krakoa and welcome even former enemies into their fold. Rachel spends some time with her family on the Summer House, the new residence of the Summers Family, located on the Moon. Soon after X (Xavier) is killed by bioengineered human terrorists, Cyclops gathers Rachel and Kid Cable for a mission on the Atlantic Ocean regarding a piece of their new homeland of Krakoa.

Later, she joins Polaris, Daken, Northstar and former X-students Eye-Boy and Prodigy in a new initiative in Krakoa: they are to investigate any mutant death and prepare a report for The Five as part of the Resurrection Protocols of Krakoa. Their first case involves the supposed death of Northstar&#x27;s twin sister, Aurora.

==Powers and abilities==
Rachel possesses various psionic abilities, generally exhibited through telepathy, psychometry, telekinesis, and limited time manipulation.

===Telepathy===
Rachel&#x27;s &quot;virtually unlimited&quot; telepathy allows her to receive, broadcast, and manipulate cognitive processes (such as thoughts) in an intricate manner. Examples of Rachel&#x27;s aptitudes for this include creating durable mind-links across distances, projecting blasts of psionic energy that disrupt aspects of brain functioning, shielding her mind from other telepaths, creating illusions, and rendering someone imperceptible to the five senses. In addition, Rachel has demonstrated the ability to telepathically suppress superpowers; control, repair, and exchange minds; as well as safely editing memories. Rachel has also harnessed her telepathy to sense, locate, and track other sentient beings based on their thought patterns, but has a moral apprehension about using this skill due to her experiences as a Hound.

It has been suggested that Rachel&#x27;s telepathy, although immeasurable in raw power, is mitigated by her limited training and finesse. Emma Frost was able to outflank an incredulous Rachel in a contest on the astral plane. In the same issue, Emma offered her educative services; and later still, Rachel received training from Professor Charles Xavier (while he was depowered), giving her access to his vast knowledge and expertise in telepathy.

===Telekinesis===
By using telekinesis, Marvel Girl can remotely manipulate matter even on a sub-atomic level. She can channel this ability to create protective force fields and blasts of concussive force. By using her telekinesis to levitate herself, Marvel Girl can fly at incredible speeds. Rachel has been able to create a micro black hole, levitate an entire city for a time, sustain shields that withstood Jovian atmospheric pressures, and direct blows from Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjolnir. Moreover, Rachel&#x27;s telekinetic fine-motor control has allowed her to alter molecular valences, mentally alter clothing with ease, create a telekinetic/psionic sword (much like Psylocke&#x27;s telekinetic katana), a telekinetic hammer powerful enough to knock Thor off his feet, and even rewrite human genomes.

While all depictions portray Rachel as an extremely powerful telekinetic, the limitations of her hard-psi capabilities have been somewhat inconsistent. Some instances have depicted Rachel&#x27;s telekinetic potential to be nigh-unlimited, whereas others have shown her struggling against, and even outmatched by, lesser developed telekinetics such as Psylocke.

===Chronoskimming===
Marvel Girl utilizes her psionic talents in conjunction with her ability to manipulate time in a variety of ways. &quot;Chronoskimming&quot; describes her ability to temporarily transplant a person&#x27;s mind and send it through time into a younger/older version, a close ancestor/descendant, or as a disembodied astral form.
Rachel unconsciously emanates a fourth dimensional pulse, effectively creating a chrono-shield that protects her from changes in the timeline. She can also sense and manipulate residual psychic energy in the form of psychometry.

===Phoenix Force===
When Rachel was bonded to the cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force, she demonstrated heightened psi-powers, the ability to manipulate energy and life-forces, and limited cosmic awareness. Rachel&#x27;s connection to the Phoenix power was lost in the distant future and did not return with her when she traveled back to the early 21st century (present) of Earth-616 (Marvel&#x27;s mainstream universe).

Most recently, Marvel Girl absorbed a residual echo of the Phoenix Force left in the sword of a previous host, a Shi&#x27;ar named Rook&#x27;shir. It was revealed that this energy source was a less powerful (but easier to wield) form of the Phoenix Force. The echo was powerful enough to allow Rachel to survive in and fly through the vacuum of space without the need for additional protection, as well as being able to hold her own in combat against the tremendous physical power of Gladiator. These demonstrations were short lived, however, due to its disappearance, which Rachel attributes to Jean Grey. She now exhibits her standard power levels, however she has later shown the ability to manipulate Phoenix Fire from the Multiverse.

===Power signature===
As a host for the Phoenix Force, Rachel manifested the cosmic firebird in displays of great power. During her 2000s &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; appearances, Marvel Girl also exhibited a Phoenix emblem over her left eye whenever she demonstrated psionic feats. It was at first accompanied by a &quot;shadow form&quot; (similar to the one Jean Grey manifested when she absorbed the telepathic powers of Psylocke). However, the illustration of this shadow form ceased without explanation. After regaining a small portion of the Phoenix Force (echo), the emblem over her eye changed from a gold Phoenix shape to a static version made of electric blue flame. Her display of power was once more altered in &quot;X-Men: Emperor Vulcan&quot; #3, where she produced the familiar fiery raptor with which the Phoenix Force is commonly associated (see profile image).

===Skills and abilities===
At times, Rachel has been shown to learn new skills extremely quickly. For example, she mastered a set of &quot;demon ninja&quot; sword skills simply by watching her teammate Shadowcat perform them. Along with sword fighting, Rachel has experience in lock-picking, vehicular repair (such as engines), and use of advanced technology and weaponry. However, these abilities have not been evident in her more recent appearances.

===Potential and limitations===
Rachel&#x27;s power level and scope of abilities have been inconsistently described by writers over the years. However, she is usually depicted with &quot;virtually unlimited&quot; potential in her dual psionic talents. In most cases, she displayed greater feats as the Phoenix and even matched Gladiator&#x27;s strength with the aid of a &quot;Phoenix echo&quot;. Rachel is considered by many to be an Omega-level mutant (like her mother), but the only literary reference to this attribute is when the future Sentinel, Nimrod, classified Rachel as an &quot;Omega class subject&quot; several years before the term was established in Marvel canon.

Even with the omnipotent strength of the Phoenix, magic and magical objects are able to resist Rachel&#x27;s powers. When the Soulsword appeared near the Excalibur lighthouse headquarters seeking Kitty Pryde to become its new wielder, Rachel attempted to remove it from bedrock to alleviate her friend&#x27;s apprehension. Despite using the full extent of power permitted by the Phoenix Force, Rachel was unable to remove the sword, surmising that only Kitty could remove it.

==Other versions==
In the very first issue of the &quot;Uncanny X-Men&quot; story arc &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;, Rachel and Psylocke were transported to the White Hot Room as an indirect result of the reality-shift performed by a mentally unstable Scarlet Witch. While there, it was established that the Rachel appearing in Earth-616 (originally from Earth-811) has no true alternate counterparts within the Marvel multiverse. Rather, all other incarnations of &quot;Rachel Summers&quot; that exist in parallel timelines (see below) are linked only by having the same name, or attributes.

===House of M===
The &quot;House of M&quot; reality had Rachel and Psylocke return to their dimension and thus be engrossed in the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s reconstruction of the world. In this reality, Rachel was the bodyguard and traveling companion to Psylocke, who was crowned British royalty after her brother, Brian, became ruler of all England. Rachel then became involved with Captain Britain&#x27;s mission to seal the breach in reality (rift) that was created by the Scarlet Witch&#x27;s manipulations.

===Variations of Days of Future Past===
In at least three alternate future timelines derived from &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, a Rachel Summers married Franklin Richards and procreated mutant children. One such child was the time-traveling supervillain Hyperstorm (Jonathan Richards). Hyperstorm was responsible for causing the Fantastic Four to think that Mister Fantastic (Jonathan&#x27;s grandfather) and Doctor Doom were dead; he was only defeated when he was trapped in another dimension by Galactus. The second child was Dream Summers, who possessed empathic superpowers. She was a superhero who appeared in the &quot;Spider-Man/X-Men: Time&#x27;s Arrow&quot; trilogy of novels. In a third reality, they produced a child named David Richards, who was rescued from a concentration camp by the interdimensional traveling Exiles and raised by the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; version of Sabretooth. David&#x27;s traumatic experiences at the camp motivated him to become a fanatical murderer.

In another variation of the &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, shown in &quot;Weapon X: Days of Future Now&quot;, a Rachel Summers was captured by Weapon X and detained in the &quot;Neverland&quot; concentration camp.

===Exiles===
In the so-called &quot;Legacy Earth&quot; reality of &quot;Exiles&quot;, in which the Legacy Virus mutated into a techno-organic plague, a Rachel Summers was a member of the Avengers, the last superhero group. At Morph&#x27;s behest, she contacted Thor and the Asgardians to help them against the Vi-Locks, a race of beings infected with the techno-organic virus.

===&quot;X-Men: The End&quot;===
The miniseries &quot;X-Men: The End&quot; (written by Chris Claremont) details the last adventures of the X-Men in a possible future. In this reality, Rachel played a central role, and was the political campaign manager of Kitty Pryde (Chicago mayoral candidate). However, she abandoned this position after Cassandra Nova led a series of attacks on the X-Men and their allies. She traveled alongside Cable into Shi&#x27;ar space. After a Professor X was taken hostage by Nova, and she entered his psyche to free him. However, Nova traps her and Lilandra within. She seemingly kills them both, but Rachel used the power of the Phoenix to save herself and incapacitates Nova. They leave Xavier&#x27;s mind and continue the battle in Rachel&#x27;s mind, where Rachel is overpowered. Cassandra, using Rachel&#x27;s body, kills Jean Grey and Cyclops, leaving Rachel forced to watch the ordeal. Nova then leaves Rachel&#x27;s body, stealing the Phoenix Force. This immediately kills her, as the Phoenix is the only thing keeping her alive after Cassandra destroyed her mental form.

<doc id="26535" wikidata="Q1344799" url="?curid=26535" title="Richard of Saint Victor">
<text>Richard of Saint Victor (died 10 March 1173) was a Medieval Scottish philosopher and theologian and one of the most influential religious thinkers of his time. A canon regular, he was a prominent mystical theologian, and was prior of the famous Augustinian Abbey of Saint Victor in Paris from 1162 until his death in 1173.

==Life==

Very little is known about the origins and upbringing of Richard of Saint Victor. John of Toulouse wrote a short &quot;Vita&quot; of Richard in the seventeenth century. He said that Richard came from Scotland. John added that Richard was received into the Abbey of St Victor by Abbot Gilduin (1114–1155) and was a student under Hugh of St Victor, the most influential of all Victorine teachers (implying that Richard entered the community before Hugh&#x27;s death in 1141). This account of Richard&#x27;s early life is not accepted by all modern scholars, however, and some have suggested that Richard entered the abbey after Hugh&#x27;s death in 1141.

All scholarship agrees, however, that Richard was a magister during the 1150s, and was then promoted to subprior in 1159 (as stated by a document found at the abbey). He served under Achard of St. Victor&#x27;s elected successor Ernisius, who was unworthy of the position. Richard&#x27;s life was then burdened by the frustrations of working under a man who was ill-suited for his responsibilities. Ernisius wasted the abbey&#x27;s resources on overly ambitious building projects and persecuted those who attempted to resist him. Richard was allowed to keep his office but his influence was restricted. Things became so unbearable that an appeal was made to the Pope, who then visited Saint Victor in 1162. Through a multitude of transactions, Ernisius was eventually removed from his position and the Pope commended Richard for his continued involvement in the matter. Letters from England written to Richard show that he was in constant touch with English affairs and give evidence of the international character of intellectual life at this time.

He was then promoted to prior in 1162, a position he held until his death on 10 March 1173.

==Writings==

Richard wrote extensively (Migne&#x27;s &quot;Patrologia Latina&quot; contains 34 works attributed to him, and this is not Richard&#x27;s full corpus). There are some problems with establishing the chronology of Richard&#x27;s works. The earliest ones come before 1153, and the latest were written one or two years before his death. His earlier works are similar to the general teaching and writing of the period. His writing develops from basic exegesis, theology and philosophy to more of a study of purely spiritual questions. In his early writings he relies on the moral interpretations of previous theologians such as Augustine of Hippo, Bede, Pope Gregory I and Hugh. He later became more independent and strayed from Hugh&#x27;s influence. There is some debate between historians about which of Richard&#x27;s texts are the most influential and important. Because Richard&#x27;s work covers many spheres of thought it is somewhat difficult to categorise his work.

===&quot;The Book of the Twelve Patriarchs&quot;, or &quot;Benjamin Minor&quot;===
&quot;The Book of the Twelve Patriarchs&quot;, sometimes titled &quot;Benjamin Minor&quot;, is one of Richard of Saint Victor&#x27;s great works on contemplation. It is not exactly known when it was written, but it would seem to date before 1162. Richard specifies that this work is not a treatise on contemplation but rather prepares the mind for contemplation. 
===&quot;The Mystical Ark&quot;, or &quot;Benjamin Major&quot;===
&quot;The Mystical Ark&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Benjamin Major&quot; or &quot;The Grace of Contemplation&quot; completes this with the study of the mind in relation to prayer. However, in the last chapters of &quot;Benjamin Major&quot;, written later than the Minor, Richard almost abandons his topic and the discussion of the teaching of mystical theology takes up a good portion of every remaining chapter. He is still attempting to instruct his followers on a text but he has also engaged himself in creating a system of mystical theology.

===&quot;De Trinitate&quot;===
One of Richard&#x27;s greatest works was the &quot;De Trinitate&quot; which was probably written while Richard was prior, between 1162 and 1173. This is known because it incorporates pieces of theological text which editors are now finding in earlier works. &quot;De Trinitate&quot; is Richard&#x27;s most independent and original study on dogmatic theology. It stems from the desire to show that dogmatic truths of Christian revelation are ultimately not against reason. Richard&#x27;s theological approach stems from a profoundly mystical life of prayer, which in the Spirit seeks to involve the mind, in continuation with the Augustinian and Anselmian tradition.

Since this work was not available in any English translation until recently, its diffusion has been limited and its influence has seldom gone beyond &#x27;Book III&#x27;. In 2011, the first full English translation of Richard&#x27;s &quot;De Trinitate&quot; was published by Ruben Angelici.

===Other treatises and works===
Richard wrote a massive handbook of biblical education entitled &quot;Liber Exceptionum&quot; (&quot;Book of Selections/Book of Notes&quot;), important scriptural commentaries, and many treatises.

&quot;The Four Degrees of Violent Charity&quot;, composed about 1170, with its description of how vehement love leads to union with God and more perfect service of neighbour, has been of interest to writers interested in Christian mysticism.

Richard&#x27;s other treatises are a number of short works which mainly deal with textual difficulties and theological issues. Many of them can be grouped together with larger works. Some of them are correspondence between Richard and his students while others seem to have been written at the request of friends. Although short, they are often interesting because they allow the modern reader to see the mentality of the students and the discussions and issues of the time.

Richard of Saint Victor&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on Ezekiel&quot; is of special interest in the field of art history because the explanations laid out by the author are accompanied by illustrations. A number of copies have come down to us, none of which are dated, but they are written in a style attributable to the second half of the twelfth century.

==Historiographical contributions==
What makes Richard of Saint-Victor stand out from other theologians of his time is that he approaches theological problems as more of a psychologist, contributing to &#x27;a careful analysis of contemplative experiences.&#x27;

<text>A rose is either a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa (), in the family Rosaceae (), or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and tens of thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Their flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through pinks, reds, oranges and yellows. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and Northwest Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses.

The name &quot;rose&quot; comes from Latin &quot;rosa&quot;, which was perhaps borrowed from Oscan, from Greek ῥόδον &quot;rhódon&quot; (Aeolic βρόδον &quot;wródon&quot;), itself borrowed from Old Persian &quot;wrd-&quot; (&quot;wurdi&quot;), related to Avestan &quot;varəδa&quot;, Sogdian &quot;ward&quot;, Parthian &quot;wâr&quot;.

== Botany ==

The leaves are borne alternately on the stem. In most species, they are long, pinnate, with (3–) 5–9 (−13) leaflets and basal stipules; the leaflets usually have a serrated margin, and often a few small prickles on the underside of the stem. Most roses are deciduous but a few (particularly from Southeast Asia) are evergreen or nearly so.

=== Thorns ===
The sharp growths along a rose stem, though commonly called &quot;thorns&quot;, are technically prickles, outgrowths of the epidermis (the outer layer of tissue of the stem), unlike true thorns, which are modified stems. Rose prickles are typically sickle-shaped hooks, which aid the rose in hanging onto other vegetation when growing over it. Some species such as &quot;Rosa rugosa&quot; and &quot;[R. pimpinellifolia&quot; have densely packed straight prickles, probably an adaptation to reduce browsing by animals, but also possibly an adaptation to trap wind-blown sand and so reduce erosion and protect their roots (both of these species grow naturally on coastal sand dunes). Despite the presence of prickles, roses are frequently browsed by deer. A few species of roses have only vestigial prickles that have no points.

Plant geneticist Zachary Lippman of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory found that prickles are controlled by the LOG gene. Blocking the LOG gene in roses reduced the thorns (large prickles) into tiny buds.

=== Flower ===
The flowers of most species have five petals, with the exception of &quot;Rosa omeiensis&quot; and &quot;Rosa sericea&quot;, which usually have only four. Each petal is divided into two distinct lobes and is usually white or pink, though in a few species yellow or red. Beneath the petals are five sepals (or in the case of some &quot;Rosa omeiensis&quot; and &quot;Rosa sericea&quot;, four). These may be long enough to be visible when viewed from above and appear as green points alternating with the rounded petals. The coloured petals are fused on the axis and arranged in five bundles forming a circle, the petal bundles expand further from each other; the petals form a cup or disc surrounding the gynoecium. There are multiple superior ovaries that develop into achenes.

=== Reproduction === 

Roses are insect-pollinated in nature. A fertilized ovary forms a berry-like aggregate fruit called a &quot;hip&quot;. The hips of most species are red, but a few (e.g. &quot;Rosa pimpinellifolia&quot;) have dark purple to black hips. Each hip comprises an outer fleshy layer, the hypanthium, which contains 5–160 &quot;seeds&quot; (technically dry single-seeded fruits called achenes) embedded in a matrix of fine, but stiff, hairs. Rose hips of some species, especially the dog rose (&quot;Rosa canina&quot;) and rugosa rose (&quot;R. rugosa&quot;), are very rich in vitamin C, among the richest sources of any plant. The hips are eaten by fruit-eating birds such as thrushes and waxwings, which then disperse the seeds in their droppings.

Many of the domestic cultivars do not produce hips, as the flowers are too tightly petalled to provide access for pollination and the plants can only propagate through human-made cuttings.

=== Evolution ===
The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado. Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.

Today&#x27;s garden roses come from 18th-century China. Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.

===Genome===

A study of the patterns of natural selection in the genome of roses indicated that genes related to DNA damage repair and stress adaptation have been positively selected, likely during their domestication. This rapid evolution may reflect an adaptation to genome confliction resulting from frequent intra- and inter-species hybridization and switching environmental conditions of growth.

=== Species ===

The genus &quot;Rosa&quot; is composed of 140–180 species and divided into four subgenera:

* &quot;Hulthemia&quot; (formerly &quot;Simplicifoliae&quot;, meaning &quot;with single leaves&quot;) containing two species from Southwest Asia, &quot;Rosa persica&quot; and &quot;Rosa berberifolia&quot;, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
* &quot;Hesperrhodos&quot; (from the Greek for &quot;western rose&quot;) contains &quot;Rosa minutifolia&quot; and &quot;Rosa stellata&quot;, from North America.
* &quot;Platyrhodon&quot; (from the Greek for &quot;flaky rose&quot;, referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, &quot;Rosa roxburghii&quot; (also known as the chestnut rose).
* &quot;Rosa&quot; (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called &quot;Eurosa&quot;) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
** &quot;Banksianae&quot; – white and yellow flowered roses from China.
** &quot;Bracteatae&quot; – three species, two from China and one from India.
** &quot;Caninae&quot; – pink and white flowered species from Asia, Europe and North Africa.
** &quot;Carolinae&quot; – white, pink, and bright pink flowered species all from North America.
** &quot;Chinensis&quot; – white, pink, yellow, red and mixed-colour roses from China and Burma.
** &quot;Gallicanae&quot; – pink to crimson and striped flowered roses from western Asia and Europe.
** &quot;Gymnocarpae&quot; – one species in western North America (&quot;Rosa gymnocarpa&quot;), others in east Asia.
** &quot;Laevigatae&quot; – a single white flowered species from China.
** &quot;Pimpinellifoliae&quot; – white, pink, bright yellow, mauve and striped roses from Asia and Europe.
** &quot;Rosa&quot; (syn. sect. &quot;Cinnamomeae&quot;) – white, pink, lilac, mulberry and red roses from everywhere but North Africa.
** &quot;Synstylae&quot; – white, pink, and crimson flowered roses from all areas.

== Ecology ==
Some birds, particularly finches, eat the seeds.

===Pests and diseases===
Wild roses are host plants for a number of pests and diseases. Many of these affect other plants, including other genera of the Rosaceae.

Cultivated roses are often subject to severe damage from insect, arachnid and fungal pests and diseases. In many cases they cannot be usefully grown without regular treatment to control these problems.

== Uses ==
Roses are best known as ornamental plants grown for their flowers in the garden and sometimes indoors. They have also been used for commercial perfumery and commercial cut flower crops. Some are used as landscape plants, for hedging and for other utilitarian purposes such as game cover and slope stabilization.

=== Ornamental plants ===
The majority of ornamental roses are hybrids that were bred for their flowers. A few, mostly species roses are grown for attractive or scented foliage (such as &quot;Rosa glauca&quot; and &quot;R. rubiginosa&quot;), ornamental thorns (such as &quot;R. sericea&quot;) or for their showy fruit (such as &quot;R. moyesii&quot;).

Ornamental roses have been cultivated for millennia, with the earliest known cultivation known to date from at least 500 BC in Mediterranean countries, Persia, and China. It is estimated that 30 to 35 thousand rose hybrids and cultivars have been bred and selected for garden use as flowering plants. Most are double-flowered with many or all of the stamens having morphed into additional petals.

In the early 19th century the Empress Josephine of France patronized the development of rose breeding at her gardens at Malmaison. As long ago as 1840 a collection numbering over one thousand different cultivars, varieties and species was possible when a rosarium was planted by Loddiges nursery for Abney Park Cemetery, an early Victorian garden cemetery and arboretum in England.

=== Cut flowers ===

Roses are a popular crop for both domestic and commercial cut flowers. Generally they are harvested and cut when in bud, and held in refrigerated conditions until ready for display at their point of sale. The price of the roses depends partly on the characteristics of the rose itself, such as how long the stem is and how big the bloom is, and partly on factors about how it was grown, such as which country is was grown in.

In temperate climates, cut roses are often grown in greenhouses, and in warmer countries they may also be grown under cover in order to ensure that the flowers are not damaged by weather and that pest and disease control can be carried out effectively. Significant quantities are grown in some tropical countries, and these are shipped by air to markets across the world.

Some kind of roses are artificially coloured using dyed water, like rainbow roses.

=== Perfume ===

Rose perfumes are made from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which is a mixture of volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An associated product is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (&quot;Rosa&quot; × &quot;damascena&quot; &#x27;Trigintipetala&#x27;) are used. In other parts of the world &quot;Rosa&quot; × &quot;centifolia&quot; is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. &#x27;Rose Absolute&#x27; is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.

The main constituents of attar of roses are the fragrant alcohols geraniol and L-citronellol and rose camphor, an odorless solid composed of alkanes, which separates from rose oil. β-Damascenone is also a significant contributor to the scent.

=== Food and drink ===

Rose hips, usually from &quot;R. canina&quot;, are high in vitamin C, and are edible raw after the removal of the irritant hairs. Hips can be made into jam, jelly, marmalade, and soup, or brewed for tea. They are also pressed and filtered to make rose hip syrup. Rose hips are also used to produce rose hip seed oil, which is used in skin products and some makeup products.Diarrhodon (Gr διάρροδον, &quot;compound of roses&quot;, from ῥόδων, &quot;of roses&quot;) is the historic name for various compounds in which red roses are an ingredient.

Rose water has a very distinctive flavour and is used in Middle Eastern, Persian, and South Asian cuisine—especially in sweets such as Turkish delight, barfi, baklava, halva, gulab jamun, knafeh, and nougat. Rose petals or flower buds are sometimes used to flavour ordinary tea, or combined with other herbs to make herbal teas. A sweet preserve of rose petals called gulkand is common in the Indian subcontinent. The leaves and washed roots are also sometimes used to make tea.

In France, there is much use of rose syrup, most commonly made from an extract of rose petals. In the Indian subcontinent, Rooh Afza, a concentrated squash made with roses, is popular, as are rose-flavoured frozen desserts such as ice cream and kulfi.

The flower stems and young shoots are edible, as are the petals (sans the white or green bases). The latter are usually used as flavouring or to add their scent to food. Other minor uses include candied rose petals.

Rose creams (rose-flavoured fondant covered in chocolate, often topped with a crystallised rose petal) are a traditional English confectionery widely available from numerous producers in the UK.

Under the American Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, there are only certain &quot;Rosa&quot; species, varieties, and parts are listed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
* Rose absolute: &quot;Rosa alba&quot; L., &quot;Rosa centifolia&quot; L., &quot;Rosa damascena&quot; Mill., &quot;Rosa gallica&quot; L., and vars. of these spp.
* Rose (otto of roses, attar of roses): Ditto
* Rose buds
* Rose flowers
* Rose fruit (hips)
* Rose leaves: &quot;Rosa&quot; &quot;spp.&quot;

=== Art and symbolism ===

The long cultural history of the rose has led to it being used often as a symbol. In ancient Greece, the rose was closely associated with the goddess Aphrodite. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Aphrodite protects the body of Hector using the &quot;immortal oil of the rose&quot; and the archaic Greek lyric poet Ibycus praises a beautiful youth saying that Aphrodite nursed him &quot;among rose blossoms&quot;. The second-century AD Greek travel writer Pausanias associates the rose with the story of Adonis and states that the rose is red because Aphrodite wounded herself on one of its thorns and stained the flower red with her blood. Book Eleven of the ancient Roman novel &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius contains a scene in which the goddess Isis, who is identified with Venus, instructs the main character, Lucius, who has been transformed into a donkey, to eat rose petals from a crown of roses worn by a priest as part of a religious procession in order to regain his humanity. French writer René Rapin invented a myth in which a beautiful Corinthian queen named Rhodanthe (&quot;she with rose flowers&quot;) was besieged inside a temple of Artemis by three ardent suitors who wished to worship her as a goddess; the god Apollo then transformed her into a rosebush.

Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, the rose became identified with the Virgin Mary. The colour of the rose and the number of roses received has symbolic representation. The rose symbol eventually led to the creation of the rosary and other devotional prayers in Christianity. The Rose Cross incorporates the flower directly into the Christian cross, and is the namesake of the esoteric religious order of Rosicrucianism.

Ever since the 1400s, the Franciscans have had a Crown Rosary of the Seven Joys of the Blessed Virgin Mary. In the 1400s and 1500s, the Carthusians promoted the idea of sacred mysteries associated with the rose symbol and rose gardens. Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s painting &quot;The Feast of the Rosary&quot; (1506) depicts the Virgin Mary distributing garlands of roses to her devotees.

Roses symbolised the Houses of York and Lancaster in a conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. Subsequently roses of the corresponding colours have been used a emblems for the English counties of Yorkshire and Lancashire.

The Tudor rose combines the colours of the roses of York and Lancaster, and is an emblem of then Tudor dynasty and of England.

Roses are a favored subject in art and appear in portraits, illustrations, on stamps, as ornaments or as architectural elements. The Luxembourg-born Belgian artist and botanist Pierre-Joseph Redouté is known for his detailed watercolours of flowers, particularly roses.

Henri Fantin-Latour was also a prolific painter of still life, particularly flowers including roses. The rose &#x27;Fantin-Latour&#x27; was named after the artist.

Other impressionists including Claude Monet, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir have paintings of roses among their works. In the 19th century, for example, artists associated the city of Trieste with a certain rare white rose, and this rose developed as the city&#x27;s symbol. It was not until 2021 that the rose, which was believed to be extinct, was rediscovered there.

In 1986 President Ronald Reagan signed legislation to make the rose the floral emblem of the United States.

The rose is often exchanged on St. Valentines Day and is used often as a symbol of such.

<doc id="26538" wikidata="Q108169" url="?curid=26538" title="Roman Curia">
<text>The Roman Curia () comprises the administrative institutions of the Holy See and the central body through which the affairs of the Catholic Church are conducted. The Roman Curia is the institution which the Roman Pontiff ordinarily makes use of in the exercise of his supreme pastoral office and universal mission in the world: thus curialism refers traditionally to an emphasis on the supreme authority of the Holy See within the Catholic Church. It is at the service of the Pope and bishops, fulfilling their function with an evangelical spirit, working for the good and at the service of communion, unity and edification of the Universal Church and attending to the demands of the world in which the Church is called to fulfill its duty and mission (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, article 1).

The structure and organization of responsibilities within the Curia are at present regulated by the apostolic constitution, issued by Pope Francis on 19 March 2022, which entered into force on 5 June 2022. It was previously regulated by issued by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988. With the coming into force of , was fully abrogated and replaced.

Other bodies that play an administrative or consulting role in ecclesial affairs are sometimes mistakenly identified with the Curia, such as the Synod of Bishops and regional conferences of bishops. Cardinal Gerhard Müller, prefect emeritus of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, wrote in 2015 that &quot;the Synod of Bishops is not a part of the Roman Curia in the strict sense: it is the expression of the collegiality of bishops in communion with the Pope and under his direction. The Roman Curia instead aids the Pope in the exercise of his primacy over all the churches.&quot;

==Historical background==

The Curia was created by Pope Urban II (r. 1088–1099).

&quot;Curia&quot; in medieval and later Latin usage means &quot;court&quot; in the sense of &quot;royal court&quot; rather than &quot;court of law&quot;. The Roman Curia is sometimes anglicized as the Court of Rome, as in the 1534 Act of Parliament that forbade appeals to it from England. It is the papal court and assists the Pope in carrying out his functions. The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to cabinets in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but the only sections that can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government are the Second Section of the Secretariat of State, known also as the Section for Relations with States, the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State (established in 1939 by Pius XII), and the Congregation for Catholic Education.

It is normal for every Latin Catholic diocese to have its own &quot;curia&quot; for its administration. For the Diocese of Rome, these functions are &quot;not&quot; handled by the Roman Curia, but by the Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome, as provided by the apostolic constitution &quot;Ecclesia in Urbe&quot;. The pope has, going back to St. Peter, been the bishop of Rome. There is also the Vicar General of Rome, traditionally a cardinal, and his deputy the vicegerent, who holds the personal title of archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. A distinct office, the Vicar General for Vatican City, administers the portion of the Diocese of Rome in Vatican City.

Until recently, there still existed hereditary officers of the Roman Curia, holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the Papal States were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by Pope Pius X, was incorporated into the 1917 Code of Canon Law. Further steps toward reorganization were begun by Pope Paul VI in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the 1983 Code of Canon Law. The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the Holy See. , the Curia comprises the offices listed in the sections below. All members of the Curia except the Cardinal Camerlengo and the Major Penitentiary resign their office immediately after a papal death or resignation. See &quot;sede vacante&quot;.

==Structure==
The Roman Curia is composed of the Secretariat of State, the dicasteries and the Bodies, all of which are juridically equal. By the term &quot;Curial Institutions&quot; is meant the units of the Roman Curia. The Offices of the Roman Curia are the Prefecture of the Papal Household, the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff and the Camerlengo of Holy Roman Church (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 12).

In general, each Curial Institution is composed of a prefect or equivalent, a suitable number of Members, one or more Secretaries who assist the prefect, together with, but in a subordinate line, one or more Under-secretaries, who are flanked by various Officials and Consultors (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 13 § 1).

The Members of the Curial Institutions are appointed from among the Cardinals residing both in and outside Rome, to whom are added, in as much as they are particularly expert in the matters in question, some bishops, especially diocesan/eparchial ones, as well as, according to the nature of the dicastery, some priests and deacons, some members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and some lay faithful (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 15).

The prefect, or his equivalent, the members, the secretary, the undersecretary and the other major officials assigned to heads of office, equivalents and experts, as well as the consultors, are appointed by the Roman Pontiff for a five-year term. As a rule, after five years, clerical officials and members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life who have served in curial institutions and offices return to pastoral care in their diocese/parish or in the institutes or societies to which they belong. Should the superiors of the Roman Curia deem it opportune, the service may be extended for another period of five years (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 17).

Despite this general structure, some Curial Institutions have a different structure either due to a special law made for the Curial Institution or because of the nature of the Curial Institution (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 13 § 2). Some examples of Curial Institutions with a special structure are the Apostolic Penitentiary (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 190) and the Tribunal of the Roman Rota (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 201).

In the event of the Apostolic See becoming vacant, all the heads of Curial Institutions and Members cease to hold office. Exceptions to this rule are the Major Penitentiary, who continues to carry out the ordinary business within his competence, proposing to the College of Cardinals those matters which he would report to the Roman Pontiff, and the Almoner of His Holiness, who continues in the exercise of works of charity according to the same criteria used during the pontificate, remaining in the employ of the College of Cardinals until the election of the new Roman Pontiff. During the vacancy of the See, the Secretaries are responsible for the ordinary government of curial institutions, taking care only of matters of ordinary administration. Within three months of the election of the Roman Pontiff they are to be confirmed in their office by him. The Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations assumes the duties provided for in the norms concerning the vacancy of the Apostolic See and the election of the Roman Pontiff (&quot;Praedicate evangelium&quot;, Article 18).

==Secretariat==
===Secretariat of State===
The Secretariat of State is the oldest dicastery in the Roman Curia, the government of the Catholic Church. As the Papal Secretariat, it closely assists the Roman Pontiff in the exercise of his supreme mission.

The current secretary of the state is Pietro Cardinal Parolin.

==== Section for General Affairs ====
The Section for General Affairs is responsible for dealing with the following matters concerning the daily service of the Roman Pontiff: to examine those matters which is necessary to deal with matters outside the ordinary competence of the Curial Institutions and other bodies of the Apostolic See, and to foster coordination among these dicasteries and other bodies and offices without prejudice to their autonomy. It is responsible to carry out everything that concerns the Representatives of States at the Holy See. The current Substitute for General Affairs is Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra.

The current secretary for pontifical representations is Archbishop Jan Romeo Pawłowski.

===== Central Statistics Office of the Church =====
The Central Statistics Office, which operates under the Vatican Secretariat of State, conducts a variety of studies for the Roman Curia throughout the year. But one of the office&#x27;s biggest projects is compiling the annual, 500-page Statistical Yearbook of the Church. The yearbook tracks the Catholic population, both by a head count of the baptized in each country and as a percentage of the world&#x27;s population. The current Person-in-charge is Monsignor Tomislav Ɖukez.

==Dicasteries==
Under the new constitution, all the Vatican&#x27;s main departments are now known as &quot;dicasteries&quot;. Along with removing the title &quot;congregation&quot; from Vatican departments, the new constitution renames pontifical councils as &quot;dicasteries&quot;. The constitution says: &quot;The Roman Curia is composed of the Secretariat of State, the dicasteries and other bodies, all juridically equal to each other&quot;. The Curial Institutions is now made up of 16 dicasteries. Each dicastery is headed by a prefect, and supported by secretary and under-secretary.

===Dicastery for Evangelization===
The Dicastery for Evangelization is competent for the fundamental questions of evangelization in the world and for the establishment, accompaniment and support of the new particular Churches, without prejudice to the competence of the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches.

This new dicastery is a merger of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization. It is made up of two Sections: one for fundamental questions of evangelization in the world and one for first evangelization and the new particular Churches in the territories within its competence. It is presided over directly by the Roman Pontiff, currently Pope Francis. Each of the two sections is governed in his name and by his authority by a pro-prefect.

==== Section for Fundamental Issues in World Evangelization ====
It is the task of the Section to study, in collaboration with the particular Churches, Episcopal Conferences and Eastern Hierarchical Structures, Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the fundamental questions of evangelization and the development of an effective announcing the Gospel by identifying appropriate forms, instruments and language.

It encourages reflection on the history of evangelization and mission, especially in their relationship to the political, social, and cultural events that have marked and conditioned the preaching of the Gospel. The current pro-prefect is Archbishop Salvatore (Rino) Fisichella.

==== Section for First Evangelization and the New Particular Churches ====
The Section supports the proclamation of the Gospel and the deepening of the life of faith in the territories of first evangelization and deals with everything that concerns the erection of ecclesiastical circumscriptions or their modifications, as well as their provisioning, and it carries out the other tasks in the same way as the Dicastery for Bishops does within the scope of its competence. The Section, according to the principle of just autonomy, supports the new Particular Churches in the work of first evangelization and growth, collaborating with the Particular Churches, Episcopal Conferences, Institutes of Consecrated Life, Societies of Apostolic Life, associations, ecclesial movements, new communities, and ecclesial assistance agencies. To this section are entrusted the Pontifical Missionary Societies: the Pontifical Society for the Propagation of the Faith, the Pontifical Society of St. Peter the Apostle, the Pontifical Society of the Missionary Childhood, and the Pontifical Missionary Union, as instruments for the promotion of the missionary responsibility of every baptized person and for the support of the New Particular Churches. The current pro-prefect is Luis Antonio Cardinal Gokim Tagle.

==== Associated organization ====

The current president is Archbishop Salvatore (Rino) Fisichella.

* complaints of nullity and requests for &quot;restitutio in integrum&quot; against judgments of the Roman Rota;
* appeals, in cases concerning the status of persons, against the refusal of a new examination of the case decided by the Roman Rota;

It fosters the unity of jurisprudence and, through its own sentences, is a help to lower tribunals.

The greater part of its decisions concern the nullity of marriage. In such cases its competence includes marriages between two Catholics, between a Catholic and non-Catholic, and between two non-Catholic parties whether one or both of the baptized parties belongs to the Latin or an Eastern Rite.

The court is named &quot;Rota&quot; (Latin for: wheel) because the judges, called &quot;auditors&quot;, originally met in a round room to hear cases.

<text>Romano Bruno Mussolini (26 September 1927 – 3 February 2006) was an Italian jazz pianist, painter, and film producer. He was the fourth child and youngest son of Benito Mussolini. Romano Mussolini, an Italian jazz pianist, painter, and film producer died on February 3rd, 2006 in Rome, Italy of complications from heart problems related to kidney failure and gallbladder disease. Romano Mussolini was 78 years old.

==Early life and education==
Romano Mussolini grew up in , his family&#x27;s residence in Forlì in Romagna. He studied music as a child, playing classical pieces on the piano and accompanying his father, Benito Mussolini, who played the violin. After World War II, he started playing jazz under the assumed name &quot;Romano Full&quot;.

== Musical career ==
His playing style has been described as &quot;like a slightly melancholic Oscar Peterson. Occasionally inspired, he was always efficient; he made the refrains run on time.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1962, Mussolini married Maria Scicolone, the younger sister of actress Sophia Loren. They had two daughters, Alessandra and her younger sister Elisabetta. Alessandra led a small Italian far-right party often described as neofascist, &quot;Alternativa Sociale&quot;. Romano Mussolini composed the party&#x27;s official anthem, &quot;The Pride of Being Italian&quot;.

With his second wife, the actress , he had a daughter, Rachele Mussolini, named after his mother Rachele Guidi. The younger Rachele has served as a member of the city council of Rome.

Mussolini was very reserved about his family history until the entry of the post-fascist National Alliance party into government following the 2001 general election. In 2004 he published a broadly sympathetic account of his personal recollections of his father, &quot;Il Duce, mio padre&quot; (translated as &quot;My father, il Duce: a memoir by Mussolini&#x27;s son&quot;, alluding to the Fascist dictator&#x27;s official title), including anecdotes of private confidences and discussions.

==Death==
Romano Mussolini died from heart problems in a hospital in Rome in 2006, aged 78.

<doc id="26541" wikidata="Q1280565" url="?curid=26541" title="Repo Man (film)">
<text>Repo Man is a 1984 American science fiction black comedy film written and directed by Alex Cox in his directorial debut. It stars Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez, with Tracey Walter, Olivia Barash, Sy Richardson, Vonetta McGee, Fox Harris, and Dick Rude among the supporting cast. Set in Los Angeles, the plot concerns a young punk rocker (Estevez) who is recruited by a car repossession agency and gets caught up in the pursuit of a mysterious Chevrolet Malibu that might be connected to extraterrestrials.

A satire of America under the Reagan administration, consumerism and the Atomic Age, &quot;Repo Man&quot; was developed by Cox in partnership with his fellow film school graduates from UCLA, independent producers Jonathan Wacks and Peter McCarthy. His inspiration for the film came from his own experiences working with repossession agent Mark Lewis. Originally conceiving of it as a road movie, Cox reconfigured the story to take place mostly in Los Angeles to maintain its budget. Michael Nesmith of The Monkees came on board the project as an executive producer, and secured a negative pickup deal with Universal Pictures. Principal photography ran through summer 1983, during which Cox encouraged improvisation from the cast; the film&#x27;s ending notably differed from what had originally been written. The soundtrack, headlined by a main theme composed and performed by Iggy Pop, is noted as a snapshot of 1980s hardcore punk; Cox wanted the music to underscore the life of repo men.

Despite a troubled initial release due to Universal&#x27;s skepticism towards the film&#x27;s commercial viability, &quot;Repo Man&quot; received widespread acclaim, and was deemed by critics to be one of the best films of 1984. It has since gained a cult following, particularly surrounding Cox&#x27;s re-edited version of the film for television due to its deliberate inclusion of surreal overdubs to replace profanity. A stand-alone sequel based on an unproduced screenplay by Cox, &quot;Waldo&#x27;s Hawaiian Holiday&quot;, was published as a graphic novel in 2008, while a spiritual successor, &quot;Repo Chick&quot;, was released in 2009.

== Plot ==
In the Mojave Desert, a policeman pulls over a 1964 Chevrolet Malibu driven by J. Frank Parnell. The policeman opens the trunk, sees a blinding flash of white light, and instantly vaporizes, leaving only his boots behind.

Otto Maddox, a young punk rocker in L.A., is fired from his job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when Bud drives up and offers him $25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood, supposedly for his wife. Otto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a &quot;repo man&quot; and goes to see his parents. After learning that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money they promised to reward him for graduating from college to a televangelist, he takes the repo job.

After repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, she shows him pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She says they are dangerous due to the radiation they emit. Meanwhile, Helping Hand is offered a $20,000 bounty notice for the Malibu. Most assume that the repossession is drug-related because the bounty is far above the actual value of the car.

Parnell arrives in L.A. driving the Malibu but cannot meet his waiting UFO compatriots because of a team of government agents led by a woman with a metal hand. When Parnell pulls into a gas station, Helping Hand&#x27;s competitors, the Rodriguez brothers, take the Malibu. They stop for sodas because the car&#x27;s trunk is hot. While they are out of the car, a trio of Otto&#x27;s punk friends, who are on a crime spree, steal it.

After visiting a nightclub, Parnell appears and tricks the punks into opening the trunk, killing one of them and scaring the other two away. Later, he picks up Otto and drives aimlessly before collapsing and dying from radiation. After surviving a convenience store shootout with the punks that leaves Bud wounded and punk Duke dead, Otto takes the Malibu back to Helping Hand and leaves it in the lot. The car is stolen again, and a chase ensues. By this time, the car is glowing bright green.

Eventually, the Malibu reappears at the Helping Hand lot with Bud behind the wheel, but he ends up being shot. The various groups trying to acquire the car soon show up: government agents, the UFO scientists, and the televangelist. Anyone who approaches it bursts into flames, even those in flame-retardant suits. Only Miller, an eccentric mechanic at Helping Hand who had explained earlier to Otto that aliens exist and can travel through time in their spaceships, can enter the car. He slides behind the wheel and beckons Otto into the Malibu. After Otto settles into the passenger seat, it lifts straight into the air. It flies away through the city&#x27;s skyline (Miller telling Otto what Bud had said earlier, &quot;The life of a repo man is ALWAYS intense.&quot;) and later into space.

== Cast ==
==Production==
===Filming===
Numerous scenes were filmed around the Downtown Los Angeles, such as south of downtown in the Garment/Fashion District and southeast of downtown in the Arts District. Early in the film when Otto was walking along the tracks, the 4th Street bridge over the Los Angeles River was in the background. When Parnell and Leila are in nearby phone booths talking to each other, the scene is located at the corner of Wilson and Violet in Los Angeles.

== Reception ==
&quot;Repo Man&quot; garnered widespread praise upon its release, and is widely considered to be one of the best films of 1984. In 2008, the film was voted by a group of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writers and editors as the eighth-best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked the film seventh on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of a possible 4, and wrote:
Neil Gaiman reviewed &quot;Repo Man&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;one of last year&#x27;s cult movie successes was &quot;Repo Man&quot; [...] and it&#x27;s not hard to see why. A lobotomised nuclear scientist is driving around Los Angeles in a car with something in the boot. Dead extraterrestrials, a neutron bomb or something even more bizarre?&quot;

The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 98% approval rating based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Repo Man&quot; is many things: an alien-invasion film, a punk-rock musical, a send-up of consumerism. One thing it isn&#x27;t is boring.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 82 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, and was given the &quot;Must-See&quot; badge.

== Accolades ==

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack features songs by various punk rock musicians such as The Plugz, Black Flag, the Circle Jerks, Suicidal Tendencies, Iggy Pop (with Steve Jones, Nigel Harrison, and Clem Burke as his backing band) and others. The film score was created by Tito Larriva, Steven Hufsteter, Charlie Quintana and Tony Marsico of The Plugz. Iggy Pop volunteered to write the title song after his manager viewed a screening of the film.

== Sequels ==
=== &quot;Waldo&#x27;s Hawaiian Holiday&quot; ===

Chris Bones saw the script on Cox&#x27;s website and asked, and received, permission to adapt the script into a graphic novel. The book, &quot;Waldo&#x27;s Hawaiian Holiday&quot;, was released in March 2008 by Gestalt Publishing.

=== &quot;Repo Chick&quot; ===

On December 3, 2008, a sequel was reported to be going into development with the working title &quot;Repo Chick&quot;. The story would be set in 2008 and the resulting boom in repossession that extends far beyond cars and homes. On February 13, 2009, Cox announced on his blog that shooting had finished and the film was in post-production. The bulk of the film was shot in front of a green screen, with backgrounds filmed and composited-in during post-production.

<text>Ruth Fulton Benedict (June 5, 1887 – September 17, 1948) was an American anthropologist and folklorist.

She was born in New York City, attended Vassar College, and graduated in 1909. After studying anthropology at the New School of Social Research under Elsie Clews Parsons, she entered graduate studies at Columbia University in 1921, where she studied under Franz Boas. She received her Ph.D. and joined the faculty in 1923. Margaret Mead, with whom she shared a romantic relationship, Marvin Opler and Vera D. Rubin were among her students and colleagues.

Benedict was president of the American Anthropological Association and also a prominent member of the American Folklore Society. She became the first woman to be recognized as a prominent leader of a learned profession. She can be viewed as a transitional figure in her field for redirecting both anthropology and folklore away from the limited confines of culture-trait diffusion studies and towards theories of performance as integral to the interpretation of culture. She studied the relationships between personality, art, language, and culture and insisted that no trait existed in isolation or self-sufficiency, a theory that she championed in her 1934 book &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot;.

==Early biography==
===Childhood===
Benedict was born Ruth Fulton in New York City on June 5, 1887, to Beatrice (Shattuck) and Frederick Fulton. Her mother worked in the city as a school teacher, and her father was a homeopathic doctor and surgeon. Fulton loved his work and research, but they eventually led to his premature death, as he acquired an unknown disease during one of his surgeries in 1888. His illness caused the family to move back to Norwich, New York, to the farm of Ruth&#x27;s maternal grandparents, the Shattucks. A year later, he died ten days after he had returned from a trip to Trinidad to search for a cure.

Beatrice Fulton was deeply affected by her husband&#x27;s passing. Any mention of him overwhelmed her with grief; every March, she cried at church and in bed. Ruth hated her mother&#x27;s sorrow and viewed it as a weakness. For Ruth, the greatest taboos were crying in front of people and showing expressions of pain. She reminisced, &quot;I did not love my mother; I resented her cult of grief.&quot; The psychological effects on her childhood were thus profound, since &quot;in one stroke she [Ruth] experienced the loss of the two most nourishing and protective people around her—the loss of her father at death and her mother to grief&quot;.

As a toddler, she contracted measles, which left her partially deaf; that was not discovered until she began school. Ruth had a fascination with death as a young child. When she was four years old, her grandmother took her to see an infant that had recently died. Upon seeing the dead child&#x27;s face, Ruth claimed that it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.

At seven, Ruth began to write short verses and to read any book that she could get her hands on. Her favorite author was Jean Ingelow, and her favorite readings were &quot;A Legend of Bregenz&quot; and &quot;The Judas Tree&quot;. Through writing, she gained approval from her family. Writing was her outlet, and she wrote with an insightful perception about human reality. For example, in her senior year of high school, she wrote a piece, &quot;Lulu&#x27;s Wedding (A True Story)&quot;, in which she recalled the wedding of a family serving-girl. Instead of romanticizing the event, she revealed the true unromantic arranged marriage that Lulu went through because the man would take her even though he was much older.

Although her fascination with death started at an early age, she continued to study how death affected people throughout her career. In her book &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot;, Benedict shows how the Pueblo culture dealt with grieving and death. She describes in the book that individuals may deal with reactions to death, such as frustration and grief, differently from one another. Societies all have social norms that they follow; some allow more expression in dealing with death, such as mourning, but other societies do not permit its acknowledgement.

===College and marriage===
After high school, Ruth and her sister entered St Margaret&#x27;s School for Girls, a college preparatory school, with the help from a full-time scholarship. The girls were successful in school and entered Vassar College in September 1905, where Ruth thrived in an all-female atmosphere. Stories were then circulating that going to college led girls to become childless and remain unmarried. Nevertheless, Ruth explored her interests in college and found writing as her way of expressing herself as an &quot;intellectual radical&quot; - as her classmates sometimes labelled her. The author Walter Pater (1839-1894) influenced her greatly during this time as she strove to be like him and to live a well-lived life. She graduated with her sister in 1909 with a major in English Literature. Unsure of what to do after college, she received an invitation from a wealthy trustee of the college to go on an all-expense-paid tour around Europe. Accompanied by two girls from California whom she had never met, Katherine Norton and Elizabeth Atsatt, she traveled through France, Switzerland, Italy,Germany, and England for one year with the opportunity of various home-stays throughout the trip.

Over the next few years, Ruth took up many different jobs. She first tried paid social-work for the Charity Organization Society; later she accepted a job as a teacher at the Westlake School for Girls in Los Angeles, California. While working there, she gained an interest in Asia that would later affect her choice of fieldwork as a working anthropologist. However, she was unhappy with that job as well and, after one year, left to teach English in Pasadena at the Orton School for Girls. Those years were difficult, and she experienced depression and severe loneliness. However, through reading authors like Walt Whitman and Richard Jefferies, who stressed a worth, importance, and enthusiasm for life, she held onto hope for a better future.

The summer after her first year teaching at the Orton School, she returned home to the Shattucks&#x27; farm to spend some time in thought and peace. There, Stanley Rossiter Benedict, an engineer at Cornell Medical College, began to visit her at the farm. She had met him by chance in Buffalo, New York around 1910. That summer, Ruth fell deeply in love with Stanley as he began to visit her more, and she accepted his proposal for marriage. Invigorated by love, she undertook several writing projects to keep busy besides the everyday housework chores in her new life with Stanley. She began to publish poems under different pseudonyms: Ruth Stanhope, Edgar Stanhope, and Anne Singleton. She also began work on writing a biography of Mary Wollstonecraft and other lesser-known women who (she felt) deserved more acknowledgement for their work and contributions.

By 1918, the couple had begun to drift apart. Stanley suffered an injury that made him want to spend more time away from the city, and Ruth was not happy when the couple moved to Bedford Hills, far away from the city.

==Career in anthropology==
===Education and early career===
In her search for a career, she decided to attend some lectures at the New School for Social Research while looking into the possibility of becoming an educational philosopher. While at the school, she took a class called &quot;Sex in Ethnology&quot; taught by Elsie Clews Parsons. She enjoyed the class and took another anthropology course with Alexander Goldenweiser, a student of noted anthropologist Franz Boas. With Goldenweiser as her teacher, Ruth&#x27;s love for anthropology steadily grew. As close friend, and lover Margaret Mead explained, &quot;Anthropology made the first &#x27;sense&#x27; that any ordered approach to life had ever made to Ruth Benedict.&quot; After working with Goldenweiser for a year, he sent her to work as a graduate student with Franz Boas at Columbia University in 1921. She developed a close friendship with Boas, who took on a role as a kind of father figure in her life. Benedict lovingly referred to him as &quot;Papa Franz.&quot;

Boas gave her graduate credit for the courses that she had completed at the New School for Social Research. Benedict wrote her dissertation, &quot;The Concept of the Guardian Spirit in North America,&quot; and received the PhD in anthropology in 1923. Benedict also started a friendship with Edward Sapir, who encouraged her to continue the study of the relations between individual creativity and cultural patterns. Sapir and Benedict shared an interest in poetry and read and critiqued each other&#x27;s work; both submitted to the same publishers and both were rejected. Both also were interested in psychology and the relation between individual personalities and cultural patterns, and in their correspondences, they frequently psychoanalyzed each other. However, Sapir showed little understanding for Benedict&#x27;s private thoughts and feelings. In particular, his conservative gender ideology jarred with Benedict&#x27;s struggle for emancipation. While they were very close friends for a while, the differences in worldview and personality ultimately led their friendship to strain.

Benedict taught her first anthropology course at Barnard College in 1922 and among the students was Margaret Mead. Benedict was a significant influence on Mead.

Boas regarded Benedict as an asset to the anthropology department, and in 1931, he appointed her as assistant professor in anthropology, something that was impossible until her divorce from Stanley Benedict that same year.

One student who felt especially fond of Ruth Benedict was Ruth Landes. Letters that Landes sent to Benedict state that she was enthralled by the way in which Benedict taught her classes and with the way that she forced the students to think in an unconventional way.

When Boas retired in 1937, most of his students considered Ruth Benedict to be the obvious choice for the head of the anthropology department. However, the administration of Columbia was not as progressive in its attitude towards female professionals as Boas had been, and the university president, Nicholas Murray Butler, was eager to curb the influence of the Boasians whom he considered to be political radicals. Instead, Ralph Linton, one of Boas&#x27;s former students, a World War I veteran and a fierce critic of Benedict&#x27;s &quot;Culture and Personality&quot; approach, was named head of the department. Benedict was understandably insulted by Linton&#x27;s appointment, and the Columbia department was divided between the two rival figures of Linton and Benedict, both accomplished anthropologists with influential publications, neither of whom ever mentioned the work of the other.

===Relationship with Margaret Mead===
Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict were two of the most influential and famous anthropologists of their time. Both got along well with their shared passion for each other&#x27;s work and the sense of pride that they felt in being successful working women while that was still uncommon. They were frequently known to critique each other&#x27;s work; they entered into a companionship that began through their work, but during its early period, it also had an erotic character. Both Benedict and Mead wanted to dislodge stereotypes about women that were widely believed during their time and to show people that working women could also be successful even though working society was seen as a man&#x27;s world. In her memoir about her parents, &quot;With a Daughter&#x27;s Eye&quot;, Mead&#x27;s daughter strongly implies that the relationship between Benedict and Mead was partly sexual.

In 1946, Benedict received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women. After Benedict died of a heart attack in 1948, Mead kept the legacy of Benedict&#x27;s work going by supervising projects that Benedict would have looked after and by editing and publishing notes from studies that Benedict had collected throughout her life.

===Postwar===
Before World War II began, Benedict had been giving lectures at the Bryn Mawr College for the Anna Howard Shaw Memorial Lectureship. The lectures were focused around the idea of synergy. However, World War II made her focus on other areas of concentration of anthropology, and the lectures were never presented in their entirety. After the war, she focused on finishing her book &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;. Her original notes for the synergy lecture were never found after her death. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1947. She continued her teaching after the war and advanced to the rank of full professor only two months before her death in New York on September 17, 1948.

==Work==
===&quot;Patterns of Culture&quot;===
Benedict&#x27;s &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot; (1934) was translated into fourteen languages and was for years published in many editions and used as standard reading material for anthropology courses in American universities.

The essential idea in &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot; is, according to the foreword by Margaret Mead, &quot;her view that human cultures are &#x27;personality writ large. As Benedict wrote in that book, &quot;A culture, like an individual, is a more or less consistent pattern of thought and action.&quot; Each culture, she held, chooses from &quot;the great arc of human potentialities&quot; only a few characteristics, which become the leading personality traits of the persons living in that culture. Those traits comprise an interdependent constellation of aesthetics and values in each culture which together add up to a unique .

For example, she described the emphasis on restraint in Pueblo cultures of the American Southwest and the emphasis on abandon in the Native American cultures of the Great Plains. She used the Nietzschean opposites of &quot;Apollonian&quot; and &quot;Dionysian&quot; as the stimulus for her thought about these Native American cultures.

She describes how in ancient Greece the worshipers of Apollo emphasized order and calm in their celebrations. In contrast, the worshipers of Dionysus, the god of wine, emphasized wildness, abandon, and letting go, like Native American groups living on the Great Plains. She described in detail the contrasts between rituals, beliefs, and personal preferences among people of diverse cultures to show how each culture had a &quot;personality&quot;, which was encouraged in each individual.

Other anthropologists of the culture and personality school also developed those ideas, notably Margaret Mead in her &quot;Coming of Age in Samoa&quot; (published before &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot;) and &quot;Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies&quot; (published just after Benedict&#x27;s book came out). Benedict was a senior student of Franz Boas when Mead began to study with them, and they had extensive and reciprocal influence on each other&#x27;s work. Abram Kardiner was also affected by these ideas, and in time, the concept of &quot;modal personality&quot; was born: the cluster of traits most commonly thought to be observed in people of any given culture.

Benedict in &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot;, expresses her belief in cultural relativism. She desired to show that each culture has its own moral imperatives that can be understood only if one studies that culture as a whole. It was wrong, she felt, to disparage the customs or values of a culture different from one&#x27;s own. Those customs had a meaning to the people who lived them that should not be dismissed or trivialized. Others should not try to evaluate people by their standards alone. Morality, she argued, was &quot;relative&quot; to the values of the culture in which one operated.

As she described the Kwakiutl of the Pacific Northwest (based on the fieldwork of her mentor Boas), the Pueblo of New Mexico (among whom she had direct experience), the nations of the Great Plains, and the Dobu culture of New Guinea (regarding whom she relied upon Mead and Reo Fortune&#x27;s fieldwork), she gave evidence that their values, even where they may seem strange, are intelligible in terms of their own coherent cultural systems and should be understood and respected. That also formed a central argument in her later work on the Japanese following World War II.

Critics have objected to the degree of abstraction and generalization inherent in the &quot;culture and personality&quot; approach. Some have argued that particular patterns that she found may be only a part or a subset of the whole cultures. For example, David Friend Aberle writes that the Pueblo people may be calm, gentle, and much given to ritual in one mood or set of circumstances, but they may be suspicious, retaliatory, and warlike in other circumstances.

In 1936, she was appointed an associate professor at Columbia University. However, Benedict had already assisted in the training and guidance of several Columbia students of anthropology including Margaret Mead and Ruth Landes.

Benedict was among the leading cultural anthropologists who were recruited by the US government for war-related research and consultation after the US entered World War II.

===&quot;The Races of Mankind&quot;===
One of Benedict&#x27;s lesser-known works was a pamphlet &quot;The Races of Mankind,&quot; which she wrote with her colleague at the Columbia University Department of Anthropology, Gene Weltfish. The pamphlet was intended for American troops and set forth in simple language with cartoon illustrations the scientific case against racist beliefs.

&quot;The world is shrinking,&quot; begin Benedict and Weltfish. &quot;Thirty-four nations are now united in a common cause—victory over Axis aggression, the military destruction of fascism.&quot;

The nations united against fascism, they continue, include &quot;the most different physical types of men.&quot;

The writers explicate, in section after section, their best evidence for human equality. They want to encourage all types of people to join and not fight among themselves. &quot;[A]ll the peoples of the earth,&quot; they point out, &quot;are a single family and have a common origin.&quot; We all have just so many teeth, so many molars, just so many little bones and muscles, and so we can have come from only one set of ancestors, no matter what our color, the shape of our head, the texture of our hair. &quot;The races of mankind are what the Bible says they are—brothers. In their bodies is the record of their brotherhood.&quot;

===&quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;===
Benedict is known not only for her earlier &quot;Patterns of Culture&quot; but also for her later book &quot;The Chrysanthemum and the Sword&quot;, the study of the society and culture of Japan that she published in 1946, incorporating results of her wartime research.

This book is an instance of &quot;anthropology at a distance&quot;. The study of a culture through its literature, newspaper clippings, films and recordings, etc. was necessary when anthropologists aided the United States and its allies during World War II. Unable to visit Nazi Germany or Japan under Hirohito, anthropologists used the cultural materials to produce studies at a distance. They attempted to understand the cultural patterns that might be driving their aggression and hoped to find possible weaknesses or means of persuasion that had been missed.

Benedict&#x27;s war work included a major study, largely completed in 1944, aimed at understanding Japanese culture, which had matters that Americans found themselves unable to comprehend. For instance, Americans considered it quite natural for American prisoners-of-war to want their families to know they were alive and to keep quiet when asked for information about troop movements, etc. However, Japanese prisoners-of-war apparently gave information freely and did not try to contact their families. Why was that? Why, too, did Asian peoples neither treat the Japanese as their liberators from Western colonialism nor accept their own supposedly-just place in a hierarchy that had Japanese at the top?

Benedict played a major role in grasping the place of the Emperor of Japan in Japanese popular culture, and formulating the recommendation to US President Franklin Roosevelt that permitting continuation of the Emperor&#x27;s reign had to be part of the eventual surrender offer.

Japanese who read this work, according to Margaret Mead, found it on the whole accurate but somewhat &quot;moralistic.&quot; Sections of the book were mentioned in Takeo Doi&#x27;s book, &quot;The Anatomy of Dependence&quot;, but Doi is highly critical of Benedict&#x27;s concept that Japan has a &quot;shame&quot; culture, whose emphasis is on how one&#x27;s moral conduct appears to outsiders in contradistinction to the Christian American &quot;guilt&quot; culture in which the emphasis is on the individual&#x27;s internal conscience. Doi considered that claim to imply clearly that the former value system is inferior to the latter one.

==Legacy==
The American Anthropology Association awards an annual prize named after Benedict. The Ruth Benedict Prize has two categories, one for monographs by one writer and one for edited volumes. The prize recognizes &quot;excellence in a scholarly book written from an anthropological perspective about a lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender topic.&quot;

A 46¢ Great Americans series postage stamp in her honor was issued on October 20, 1995.

Benedict College in Stony Brook University is named after her.

In 2005, Benedict was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

<doc id="26546" wikidata="Q537251" url="?curid=26546" title="Ruslan Khasbulatov">
<text>Ruslan Imranovich Khasbulatov (, ; 22 November 1942 – 3 January 2023) was a Russian economist and politician and the former chairman of Parliament of Russia of Chechen descent who played a central role in the events leading to the 1993 constitutional crisis in the Russian Federation.

==Early life==
Khasbulatov was born in Tolstoy-Yurt, a village near Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, on 22 November 1942. In February 1944, he was deported to Central Asia during the Chechen deportations.

After studying in Almaty, Khasbulatov moved to Moscow in 1962, where he studied law at the prestigious Moscow State University. After graduating in 1966, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He continued his studies, focusing on the political, social and economic development of capitalist countries, and received several higher degrees between 1970 and 1980. During the 1970s and 1980s, he published a number of books on international economics and trade.

== Political career ==
=== Entry into political life ===
In the late 1980s, Khasbulatov began to work closely with rising maverick in the Communist Party Boris Yeltsin. He was elected to the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies of the Russian SFSR in 1990. He followed Yeltsin in the successful resistance to the putsch attempt in 1991. He quit the Communist Party in August 1991, and on 29 October 1991, he was elected speaker of the Supreme Soviet of RSFSR.

=== 1993 Constitutional Crisis ===
Khasbulatov had been an ally of Yeltsin in this period, and played a key role in leading the resistance to the 1991 coup attempt. However, he and Yeltsin drifted apart following the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991.

After the collapse of the USSR, Khasbulatov consolidated his control over the Russian parliament and became the second most powerful man in Russia after Yeltsin himself. Among other factors, the escalating clash of egos between Khasbulatov and Yeltsin led to the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993, in which Khasbulatov (along with Vice-President Alexander Rutskoy) led the Supreme Soviet of Russia in its power struggle with the president, which ended with Yeltsin&#x27;s violent assault on and subsequent dissolution of the parliament in October 1993.

Khasbulatov was arrested along with the other leaders of the parliament. In 1994, the newly elected Duma pardoned him along with other key leaders of the anti-Yeltsin resistance.

=== &quot;Professor Khasbulatov&#x27;s peacekeeping mission&quot; ===
In 1994, he organized the so-called &quot;Peacekeeping Mission of Professor Khasbulatov&quot;. He traveled to Chechnya, trying to organize negotiations between the separatist leader, Ichkerian president Dzhokhar Dudayev and the anti-Dudayev opposition, as well as the Russian authorities. However, the mission was unsuccessful, the parties were not ready to make any compromises, in addition to the popularity of Dzhokhar Dudayev at the time in Chechnya being extremely high, and Khasbulatov himself essentially joined the anti-Dudayev opposition.

A few months before Russian troops entered Chechnya, on August 20, 1994, Ruslan Khasbulatov at a rally in the town of Shali in Chechnya called for the creation of a reconciliation commission and the signing of an agreement on the non-use of weapons by armed groups against each other.

On August 21 of the same year, a radio station of Khasbulatov&#x27;s supporters began operating in the village of Tolstoy-Yurt. Thanks to its appearance, people started talking about &quot;Professor Khasbulatov&#x27;s peacekeeping mission&quot;. Seven armed groups joined the mission.

On August 25, Dzhokhar Dudayev speaks at a rally of his supporters and, among other things, states:

On August 26, news agencies reported that 20 armed groups had already joined Khasbulatov&#x27;s peacekeeping mission. Umar Avturkhanov, leader of the anti-Dudayev opposition and chairman of the Provisional Council, and Ruslan Khasbulatov meet in the village of Znamenskoye in the Nadterechny district and agree on joint actions against the Dudayev regime.

On August 29, at a meeting of leaders of opposition groups (Umar Avturkhanov, Ruslan Khasbulatov, Ruslan Labazanov, Bislan Gantamirov) in the Nadterechny district, it was decided to unite the actions of opponents of the regime under the aegis of the Temporary Council of the Chechen Republic.

On September 7, representatives of the mission arrived at the headquarters of the anti-Dudayev opposition, the Temporary Council of the Chechen Republic, to work out a strategy for further joint actions.

With the outbreak of hostilities at the end of the year, Khasbulatov returned to Moscow, where he continued to work at his department at the institute.

In 1995, when the active stage of the military conflict was unfolding in Chechnya, Khasbulatov, who, according to the newspaper Vremya Novostei, had influence in the Chechen diaspora, again offered to act as a mediator. However, the Russian authorities refused his services. In 2005, Khasbulatov claimed that Dudayev had plotted with Yeltsin when he wanted to deprive him (Khasbulatov) of his deputy position.

=== Chechen politics ===
Khasbulatov considered running as a candidate in the 2003 election for President of the Chechen Republic, following the Second Chechen War, but ultimately chose not to run. In the 2021 Chechen head election, he endorsed incumbent Ramzan Kadyrov.

== Later life==
Following the end of his political career, Khasbulatov returned to his earlier profession as a teacher of economics as founder and head of the Department of International Economy at the Plekhanov Russian Academy of Economics (REA). He continued to comment on political developments in Russia. His death was reported on 3 January 2023.

<doc id="26547" wikidata="Q16642" url="?curid=26547" title="Six Nations Championship">
<text>The Six Nations Championship (known as the Six Nations, branded as Guinness M6N) is an annual international rugby union competition between the teams of England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. It is the oldest sports tournament contested by the Home Nations. The championship holders are Ireland, who won the 2024 tournament.

The tournament is organised by the unions of the six participating nations under the banner of Six Nations Rugby, which is responsible for the promotion and operation of the men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and under-20s tournaments, and the Autumn International Series, as well as the negotiation and management of their centralised commercial rights.

The Six Nations is the successor to the Home Nations Championship (1883–1909 and 1932–39), played between teams from England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, which was the first international rugby union tournament. With the addition of France, this became the Five Nations Championship (1910–31 and 1947–99), which in turn became the Six Nations Championship with the addition of Italy in 2000.

England and Wales have won the championship the most times, both with 39 titles, but England have won the most outright titles with 29 (28 for Wales). Since the Six Nations era started in 2000, only Italy and Scotland have failed to win the Six Nations title.

The women&#x27;s tournament started as the Women&#x27;s Home Nations in the 1996 season. The men&#x27;s Six Nations Under 20s Championship is the successor to the Under 21s tournament which began in 2004.

==History and expansion==
The tournament was first played in 1883 as the Home Nations Championship among the then four Home Nations of the United Kingdom – England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. However, England was excluded from the 1888 and 1889 tournaments due to their refusal to join the International Rugby Football Board. The tournament then became the Five Nations Championship in 1910 with the addition of France. The tournament was expanded in 2000 to become the Six Nations Championship with the addition of Italy.

Following the relative success of the Tier 2 nations in the 2015 Rugby World Cup, there were calls by Octavian Morariu, the president of Rugby Europe, to let Georgia and Romania join the Six Nations due to their consistent success in the European Nations Cup and ability to compete in the Rugby World Cup.

== Format ==

The tournament begins on the first weekend in February and culminates on the second or third Saturday in March. Each team plays every other team once (a total of 15 matches), with home ground advantage alternating from one year to the next. Before the 2017 tournament, two points were awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss. Unlike many other rugby union competitions, a bonus point system had not previously been used.

A bonus point system was first used in the 2017 Championship. The system is similar to the one used in most rugby championships (0 points for a loss, 2 for a draw, 4 for a win, 1 for scoring four or more tries in a match, and 1 for losing by 7 points or fewer). The only difference is that a team that wins all their games (a Grand Slam) are automatically awarded 3 extra points - to ensure they cannot be overtaken by a defeated team on bonus points.

Before 1994, teams equal on match points shared the championship. Since then, ties have been broken by considering the points difference (total points scored minus total points conceded) of the teams. The rules of the championship further provide that if teams tie on both match points and points difference, the team that scored the most tries wins the championship. Were this decider to be a tie, the tying teams would share the championship. To date, however, match points and points difference have been sufficient to decide the championship.

The Wooden Spoon is a metaphorical award given to the team that finishes in last place; a team which loses all their matches is said to have been &quot;whitewashed&quot;. Since the inaugural Six Nations tournament in 2000, only England and Ireland have avoided finishing last. Italy have finished last 18 times in the Six Nations era, and have lost all their matches in 12 tournaments.
== Trophies ==
=== Championship Trophy ===

The winners of the Six Nations are presented with the Championship Trophy. This was originally conceived by the Earl of Westmorland, and was first presented to the winners of the 1993 Five Nations Championship; France. It was a sterling silver trophy, designed by James Brent-Ward and made by a team of eight silversmiths from the London firm William Comyns. The current championship trophy for the Six Nations Championship was designed and made in 2015 by Thomas Lyte, London silversmiths and Royal Warrant holders to His Majesty the King.

The old trophy had 15 side panels representing the 15 members of the team and with three handles to represent the three officials (referee and two touch judges). The cup has a capacity of 3.75 litres – sufficient for five bottles of champagne. Within the mahogany base is a concealed drawer which contains six alternative finials, each a silver replica of one of the team emblems, which can be screwed on the detachable lid.

A new trophy was introduced for the 2015 Championship. 
Designed and handcrafted over 200 hours by Thomas Lyte silversmiths in the company&#x27;s London workshop, it replaced the old Five Nations Trophy which had been awarded to the winners since 1993. The trophy was hand spun from a single sheet of 925 sterling silver and contains over fifty individual pieces. It stands at a height of 75cm and has a distinctive six-sided design; each face representing the nations that compete annually for European rugby’s most prestigious prize. Ireland were the last team to win the old trophy and the first team to win the new one.

=== Grand Slam and Triple Crown ===
A team that wins all its games wins the &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27;.

The Triple Crown may only be won by one of the Home Nations of England, Ireland, Scotland or Wales, when one nation wins all three of their matches against the others. The Triple Crown dates back to the original Home Nations Championship, but the physical Triple Crown Trophy has been awarded only since 2006, when the Royal Bank of Scotland (the primary sponsor of the competition) commissioned Hamilton &amp; Inches to design and create a dedicated Triple Crown Trophy. It has since been won four times by Ireland and Wales, and three times by England.

=== Rivalry trophies ===
Several individual competitions take place under the umbrella of the tournament. Some of these trophies are also awarded for other matches between the two teams outside the Six Nations. Only Scotland play for a &#x27;rivalry&#x27; or challenge trophy in every Six Nations match, as well as for the oldest such trophy, the Calcutta Cup. Wales became the last nation to contest such a trophy, the Doddie Weir Cup in 2018, while the newest such trophy is the Cuttitta Cup introduced between Scotland and Italy in 2022.

Games which form part of the Triple Crown are marked TC.

Currently the following matches have no additional trophy contested:
* England–France
* England–Italy
* England–WalesTC
* France–Ireland

== Venues ==
As of the 2025 tournament, Six Nations matches are held in the following stadiums:

The opening of Aviva Stadium in May 2010 ended the arrangement with the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) that allowed the all-Ireland governing body for rugby union, the Irish Rugby Football Union, to use the GAA&#x27;s flagship stadium, Croke Park, for its international matches. This arrangement was made necessary by the 2007 closure and subsequent demolition of Ireland&#x27;s traditional home at Lansdowne Road; Aviva Stadium was built on the former Lansdowne Road site. During this construction, Croke Park was the largest of the Six Nations grounds, with a capacity of 82,300.

In 2012 Italy moved their home games from the 32,000 seat Stadio Flaminio, to Stadio Olimpico, also in Rome, with a capacity of 72,000.

The French Rugby Federation (FFR) had planned to build a new stadium of its own, seating 82,000 in the southern suburbs of Paris, because of frustrations with their tenancy of Stade de France. However the project was cancelled in December 2016. France played their 2018 match against Italy at Stade Vélodrome in Marseille.

In 2020, Wales played their final game at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli due to the Principality Stadium being used as Dragon&#x27;s Heart Hospital in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2024, France was unable to use the Stade de France for their Six Nations home games due to ongoing preparations for its use in the 2024 Summer Olympics. Instead they played their three home matches at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille, and Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Lyon.

Wales hold the record for the longest time without conceding a try, at 358 minutes in the 2013 tournament.

== Administration ==
The Championship is run from headquarters in Dublin, Ireland by Six Nations Rugby Ltd. 

Former England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) CEO, Tom Harrison, was appointed the CEO of Six Nations Rugby in January 2023 following the resignation of Benjamin Morel in November 2022. Morel had held the position of CEO since November 2018, replacing John Feehan, who stepped down after sixteen years as CEO in April 2018. Harrison&#x27;s tenure as CEO commenced from April. 2023. 

Ronan Dunne was appointed as the Chairman for Six Nations Rugby in November 2021 with his tenure commencing from January 2022. Dunne has responsibility for the commercial and marketing operations for both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Six Nations tournaments.

==Marketing==
===Broadcasting rights===
One of the most important rugby union tournaments in the world, the Six Nations Championship is broadcast in various countries in addition to the six participating nations. 

In the United Kingdom, the BBC has long covered the tournament, broadcasting all matches (apart from England home matches between 1997 and 2002, which were shown live by Sky Sports with highlights on the BBC) until 2015. In addition, Welsh language coverage of broadcasts matches featuring the Welsh team shown by the BBC are shown on S4C in Wales in the United Kingdom. Between 2003 and 2015, the BBC covered every match live on BBC Sport either on BBC One or BBC Two with highlights also on the BBC Sport website and either on the BBC Red Button or late at night on BBC Two.

On 9 July 2015, in reaction to bids by Sky for the rights beginning in 2018, the BBC ended its contract two seasons early, and renegotiated a joint contract with ITV Sport for rights to the Six Nations from 2016 through 2021. ITV acquired rights to England, Ireland and Italy home matches, while the BBC retained rights to France, Scotland and Wales home matches. By ending its contract early, the BBC saved around £30 million, while the new contract generated £20 million in additional revenue for the Six Nations.

With the end of the contract nearing, speculation once again emerged in 2020 that Sky was pursuing rights to the Six Nations from 2022 onward; under the Ofcom &quot;listed events&quot; rules, rights to the tournament can be held by a pay television channel if delayed broadcasts or highlights are made available on free-to-air television. It was reported that the bid for CVC Equity Partners to purchase a stake in the Six Nations was being hindered by a desire for a more lucrative broadcast contract; a call for the Six Nations to be moved to Category A (which requires live coverage to air free-to-air) was rejected. In May 2021, the BBC and ITV renewed their contracts through 2025. The BBC will continue to broadcast home matches from Scotland and Wales and all women&#x27;s and under-20s matches, with ITV airing England, France, Ireland and Italy home matches.

France, Ireland, and Italy listed the Six Nations as a major event with cultural significance and enacted national and EU laws to ensure coverage would be available on free-to-air channels.

In Ireland, each of Ireland&#x27;s games in the Six Nations may be held by a pay television channel, if the match is delayed broadcast and in full on free-to-air television. RTÉ have broadcast the championship since RTÉ&#x27;s inception and continued to do so until 2017, while TG4 televised highlights. However, in late 2015 RTÉ&#x27;s free-to-air rival TV3 was awarded the rights for every game from the Six Nations on Irish television from 2018 to 2021. In 2022 it was announced that RTÉ and Virgin Media would share broadcasting rights.

In France, the entire Six Nations rugby tournament must appear on free-to-air television. France Télévisions has covered the competition in France.

In Italy, Six Nations rugby matches involving the Italian national team must be broadcast on free-to-air television. Sky Italia broadcasts all matches while free-to-air TV8 only covers Italy fixtures.

In the United States, NBC Sports broadcasts matches in English. The tournament is also broadcast on DAZN in Canada, Premier Sports Asia in East and Southeast Asia, Sky Sport in New Zealand, Stan Sport in Australia and SuperSport in South Africa.

In 2024 the Six Nations teams featured in a Netflix documentary Six Nations: Full Contact. In February 2024, the show was green lit for a second season. In January 2025, the tournament organisers confirmed that Netflix would not be taking up the option to produce a third series.

===Sponsorship===
Until 1998, the competition had no title sponsor. Sponsorship rights were sold to Lloyds TSB Group for the 1999 tournament and the competition was titled the Lloyds TSB 5 Nations and Lloyds TSB 6 Nations until 2002.

The Royal Bank of Scotland Group took over sponsorship from 2003 until 2017, with the competition being branded the RBS 6 Nations. A new title sponsor was sought for the 2018 tournament and beyond. However, after struggling to find a new sponsor, organisers agreed a one-year extension at a reduced rate. As the RBS brand was being phased out, the tournament was named after the NatWest banking subsidiary, becoming the NatWest 6 Nations.

On 7 December 2018, Guinness was announced as the Championship&#x27;s new title sponsor, with the competition to be named the Guinness Six Nations from 2019 to 2024. Due to the &quot;Loi Évin&quot; laws which prohibit alcohol sponsorship in sport, &quot;Guinness&quot; cannot be used as part of the branding of the tournament in France. The French-language logo for the tournament replaces the Guinness logo with the word &quot;Greatness&quot; in the same colour and typeface as the Guinness wordmark.

<doc id="26550" wikidata="Q79791" url="?curid=26550" title="Reconquista">
<text>The Reconquista (Spanish and Portuguese for ) or the reconquest of [[al-Andalus]] was a series of military and cultural campaigns that European Christian kingdoms waged against the Muslim kingdoms following the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula by the Umayyad Caliphate, culminating in the reign of the Catholic Monarchs of Spain. The beginning of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; is traditionally dated to the Battle of Covadonga ( or 722), in which an Asturian army achieved the first Christian victory over the forces of the Umayyad Caliphate since the beginning of the military invasion. The &quot;Reconquista&quot; ended in 1492 with the fall of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada to the Catholic Monarchs.

In the late 10th century, the Umayyad vizier Almanzor waged a series of military campaigns for 30 years in order to subjugate the northern Christian kingdoms. When the Caliphate of Córdoba disintegrated in the early 11th century, a series of petty successor states known as &quot;taifas&quot; emerged. The northern kingdoms took advantage of this situation and struck deep into al-Andalus; they fostered civil war, intimidated the weakened &quot;taifas&quot;, and made them pay large tributes (&quot;parias&quot;) for &quot;protection&quot;.

In the 12th century, the &quot;Reconquista&quot; was above all a political action to develop the kingdoms of Portugal, León-Castile and Aragon. The king&#x27;s action took precedence over that of the local lords, with the help of the military orders and also supported by repopulation. Following a Muslim resurgence under the Almohads in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds fell to Christian forces in the 13th century, after the decisive Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212), the Siege of Córdoba (1236) and the Siege of Seville (1248)—leaving only the Muslim enclave of Granada as a tributary state in the south. After the surrender of Granada in January 1492, the entire Iberian peninsula was controlled by Christian rulers. On 30 July 1492, as a result of the Alhambra Decree, the Jewish communities in Castile and Aragon—some 200,000 people—were forcibly expelled. The conquest was followed by a series of edicts (1499–1526) which forced the conversions of Muslims in Castile, Navarre, and Aragon, who were later expelled from the Iberian realms of the Spanish Crown by a series of decrees starting in 1609. Approximately three million Muslims emigrated or were driven out of Spain between 1492 and 1610.

Beginning in the 19th century, traditional historiography has used the term &quot;Reconquista&quot; for what was earlier thought of as a restoration of the Visigothic Kingdom over conquered territories. The concept of &quot;Reconquista&quot;, consolidated in Spanish historiography in the second half of the 19th century, was associated with the development of a Spanish national identity, emphasizing Spanish nationalist and romantic aspects. It is rememorated in the &quot;Moros y Cristianos&quot; festival, very popular in parts of Southeastern Spain, and which can also be found in a few places in former Spanish colonies. Pursuant to an Islamophobic worldview, the concept is a symbol of significance for the 21st century European far-right.

==Concept and duration==

The term &quot;Reconquista&quot;, used to describe the struggle between Christians and Muslims in the Iberian peninsula during the Middle Ages, was not used by writers of the period. Since its development as a term in medieval historiography occurred centuries after the events it references, it has acquired various meanings. Its meaning as an actual reconquest has been subject to the particular concerns or prejudices of scholars, who have sometimes wielded it as a weapon in ideological disputes.

A discernible irredentist ideology that would later become part of the concept of &quot;Reconquista&quot;, a Christian reconquest of the peninsula, appeared in writings by the end of the 9th century. For example, the anonymous Christian chronicle &quot;Chronica Prophetica&quot; (883–884) claimed a historical connection between the Visigothic Kingdom conquered by the Muslims in 711 and the Kingdom of Asturias in which the document was produced, and stressed a Christian and Muslim cultural and religious divide in Hispania, and a necessity to drive out the Muslims and restore conquered territories. In fact, in the writings of both sides, there was a sense of divide based on ethnicity and culture between the inhabitants of the small Christian kingdoms in the north and the dominant elite in the Muslim-ruled south.

The linear approach to the origins of a &quot;Reconquista&quot; taken in early twentieth-century historiography is complicated by a number of issues. For example, periods of peaceful coexistence, or at least of limited and localised skirmishes on the frontiers, were more prevalent over the 781 years of Muslim rule in Iberia than periods of military conflict between the Christian kingdoms and al-Andalus. Additionally, both Christian and Muslim rulers fought other Christians and Muslims, and cooperation and alliances between Muslims and Christians were not uncommon, such as between the Arista dynasty and Banu Qasi as early as the 9th century. Blurring distinctions even further were the mercenaries from both sides who simply fought for whoever paid the most. The period is seen today to have had long episodes of relative religious coexistence and tolerance. The idea of a continuous &quot;Reconquista&quot; has been challenged by modern scholars.

The Crusades, which started late in the 11th century, bred the religious ideology of a Christian reconquest. In the years just before the Council of Clermont took place, Spanish kings used religious differences as a reason to fight against Muslims, although this argument was not extensively used beforehand. In al-Andalus at that time, the Christian states were confronted by the Almoravids, and to an even greater degree, they were confronted by the Almohads, who espoused a similarly staunch Muslim Jihad ideology. In fact, previous documents which date from the 10th and 11th centuries are mute on any idea of &quot;reconquest&quot;. Propaganda accounts of Muslim-Christian hostility came into being to support that idea, most notably the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;, an 11th-century French &quot;chanson de geste&quot; that offers a fictionalised retelling of the Battle of Roncevaux Pass dealing with the Iberian &quot;Saracens&quot; (&quot;Moors&quot;), and centuries later introduced in the French school system with a view to instilling moral and national values in the population following the 1870 defeat of the French in the Franco-Prussian War, regardless of the actual events.

The consolidation of the modern idea of a &quot;Reconquista&quot; is inextricably linked to the foundational myths of Spanish nationalism in the 19th century, associated with the development of a Centralist, Castilian, and staunchly Catholic brand of nationalism, evoking nationalistic, romantic and sometimes colonialist themes. The concept gained further track in the 20th century during the Francoist dictatorship. It thus became one of the key tenets of the historiographical discourse of National Catholicism, the mythological and ideological identity of the regime. The discourse was underpinned in its most traditional version by an avowed historical illegitimacy of al-Andalus and the subsequent glorification of the Christian conquest.

The idea of a &quot;liberation war&quot; of &quot;reconquest&quot; against the Muslims, who were viewed as foreigners, suited the anti-Republican rebels during the Spanish Civil War, the rebels agitated for the banner of a Spanish fatherland, a fatherland which, according to them, was being threatened by regional nationalisms and communism. Their rebellious pursuit was thus a crusade for the restoration of the Church&#x27;s unity, where Franco stood for both Pelagius of Asturias and El Cid. The &quot;Reconquista&quot; has become a rallying call for right and far-right parties in Spain to expel from office incumbent progressive or peripheral nationalist options, as well as their values, in different political contexts as of 2018.

The same kind of propaganda was circulated during the Spanish Civil War by the Republicans, who wanted to portray their enemies as foreign invaders, especially given the prominence of the Army of Africa among Franco&#x27;s troops, an army which was made up of native North African soldiers.

Some contemporary authors consider the &quot;Reconquista&quot; proof that the process of Christian state-building in Iberia was frequently defined by the reclamation of lands that had been lost to the Moors in generations past. In this way, state-building might be characterised—at least in ideological, if not practical, terms—as a process by which Iberian states were being &quot;rebuilt&quot;. In turn, other recent historians dispute the whole concept of &quot;&quot;Reconquista&quot; as a concept created &quot;a posteriori&quot; in the service of later political goals. A few historians point out that Spain and Portugal did not previously exist as nations, and therefore the heirs of the Christian Visigothic Kingdom were not technically &quot;re&quot;conquering them, as the name suggests. One of the first Spanish intellectuals to question the idea of a &quot;reconquest&quot; that lasted for eight centuries was José Ortega y Gasset, writing in the first half of the 20th century. However, the term &quot;Reconquista&quot; is still widely in use.

== History and military campaigns==

=== Background ===
====Landing in Visigothic Hispania and initial expansion====
In 711, North African Berber soldiers with some Arabs commanded by Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, engaging a Visigothic force led by King Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete (July 19–26) in a moment of severe in-fighting and division across the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania. Many of Roderic&#x27;s troops deserted, leading to his defeat. He drowned while crossing the Guadalquivir River.

After Roderic&#x27;s defeat, the Umayyad governor of Ifrikiya Musa ibn-Nusayr joined Tariq, directing a campaign against different towns and strongholds in Hispania. Some, like Mérida, Cordova, or Zaragoza in 712, probably Toledo, were taken, but many agreed to a treaty in exchange for maintaining autonomy, in Theodemir&#x27;s dominion (region of Tudmir), or Pamplona, for example. The invading Islamic armies did not exceed 60,000 men.

====Islamic rule====
After the establishment of a local Emirate, Caliph Al-Walid I, ruler of the Umayyad Caliphate, removed many of the successful Muslim commanders. Tariq ibn Ziyad was recalled to Damascus and replaced with Musa ibn-Nusayr, who had been his former superior. Musa&#x27;s son, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa, apparently married Egilona, Roderic&#x27;s widow, and established his regional government in Seville. He was suspected of being under the influence of his wife and was accused of wanting to convert to Christianity and of planning a secessionist rebellion. Apparently a concerned Al-Walid I ordered Abd al-Aziz&#x27;s assassination. Caliph Al-Walid I died in 715 and was succeeded by his brother Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. Sulayman seems to have punished the surviving Musa ibn-Nusayr, who very soon died during a pilgrimage in 716. In the end, Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa&#x27;s cousin, Ayyub ibn Habib al-Lakhmi became the &quot;wali&quot; (governor) of al-Andalus.

A serious weakness amongst the Muslim conquerors was the ethnic tension between Berbers and Arabs. The Berbers were indigenous inhabitants of North Africa who had only recently converted to Islam; they provided most of the soldiery of the invading Islamic armies but sensed Arab discrimination against them. This latent internal conflict jeopardised Umayyad unity. The Umayyad forces arrived and crossed the Pyrenees by 719. The last Visigothic king Ardo resisted them in Septimania, where he fended off the Berber-Arab armies until 720.

After the Islamic Moorish conquest of most of the Iberian Peninsula in 711–718 and the establishment of the emirate of al-Andalus, an Umayyad expedition suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Toulouse and was halted for a while on its way north. Odo of Aquitaine had married his daughter to Uthman ibn Naissa, a rebel Berber and lord of Cerdanya, in an attempt to secure his southern borders in order to fend off Charles Martel&#x27;s attacks on the north. However, a major punitive expedition led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, the latest emir of al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman, and the Muslim governor mustered an expedition north across the western Pyrenees, looted areas up to Bordeaux, and defeated Odo in the Battle of the River Garonne in 732.

A desperate Odo turned to his archrival Charles Martel for help, who led the Frankish and remaining Aquitanian armies against the Umayyad armies and defeated them at the Battle of Poitiers in 732, killing Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi. While Moorish rule began to recede in what is today France, it would remain in parts of the Iberian peninsula for another 760 years.

===Early Reconquista===
==== Beginning of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; ====

A drastic increase of taxes on Christians by the emir Anbasa ibn Suhaym Al-Kalbi provoked several rebellions in al-Andalus, which a series of succeeding weak emirs were unable to suppress. Around 722, a Muslim military expedition was sent into the north in late summer to suppress a rebellion led by Pelagius of Asturias (Pelayo in Spanish, Pelayu in Asturian). Traditional historiography has hailed Pelagius&#x27;s victory at Covadonga as the beginning of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;.

Two northern realms, Navarre and Asturias, despite their small size, demonstrated an ability to maintain their independence. Because the Umayyad rulers based in Córdoba were unable to extend their power over the Pyrenees, they decided to consolidate their power within the Iberian peninsula. Arab-Berber forces made periodic incursions deep into Asturias, but this area was a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot; on the fringes of the Islamic world fraught with inconveniences during campaigns and of little interest.

It comes then as no surprise that, besides focusing on raiding the Arab-Berber strongholds of the Meseta, Alfonso I of Asturias centred on expanding his domains at the expense of the neighbouring Galicians and Basques at either side of his realm just as much. During the first decades, Asturian control over part of the kingdom was weak, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances and war with other peoples from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. After Pelayo&#x27;s death in 737, his son Favila of Asturias was elected king. Favila, according to the chronicles, was killed by a bear during a trial of courage. Pelayo&#x27;s dynasty in Asturias survived and gradually expanded the kingdom&#x27;s boundaries until all of northwest Hispania was included by roughly 775. However, credit is due to him and to his successors, the &quot;Banu Alfons&quot; from the Arab chronicles. Further expansion of the northwestern kingdom towards the south occurred during the reign of Alfonso II of Asturias (from 791 to 842). A king&#x27;s expedition arrived in and pillaged Lisbon in 798, probably concerted with the Carolingians.

The Asturian kingdom became firmly established with the recognition of Alfonso II as king of Asturias by Charlemagne and the Pope. During his reign, the bones of St. James the Great were declared to have been found in Galicia, at Santiago de Compostela. Pilgrims from all over Europe opened a channel of communication between the isolated Asturias and the Carolingian lands and beyond, centuries later.

====Frankish invasions====
After the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian heartland of the Visigothic kingdom, the Muslims crossed the Pyrenees and gradually took control of Septimania, starting in 719 with the conquest of Narbonne through 725 when Carcassonne and Nîmes were secured. From the stronghold of Narbonne, they tried to conquer Aquitaine but suffered a major defeat at the Battle of Toulouse (721).

Ten years after halting their advance north, Odo of Aquitaine married his daughter to Uthman ibn Naissa, a rebel Berber and lord of Cerdanya (perhaps all of contemporary Catalonia as well), in an attempt to secure his southern borders to fend off Charles Martel&#x27;s attacks on the north. However, a major punitive expedition led by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, the latest emir of al-Andalus, defeated and killed Uthman.

After expelling the Muslims from Narbonne in 759 and driving their forces back over the Pyrenees, the Carolingian king Pepin the Short conquered Aquitaine in a ruthless eight-year war. Charlemagne followed his father by subduing Aquitaine by creating counties, taking the Church as his ally and appointing counts of Frankish or Burgundian stock, like his loyal William of Gellone, making Toulouse his base for expeditions against al-Andalus. Charlemagne decided to organize a regional subkingdom, the Spanish March, which included part of contemporary Catalonia, in order to keep the Aquitanians in check and to secure the southern border of the Carolingian Empire against Muslim incursions. In 781, his three-year-old son Louis was crowned king of Aquitaine, under the supervision of Charlemagne&#x27;s trustee William of Gellone, and was nominally in charge of the incipient Spanish March.

Meanwhile, the takeover of the southern fringes of al-Andalus by Abd ar-Rahman I in 756 was opposed by Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman, autonomous governor (&quot;wāli&quot;) or king (&quot;malik&quot;) of al-Andalus. Abd ar-Rahman I expelled Yusuf from Cordova, but it took still decades for him to expand to the north-western Andalusian districts. He was also opposed externally by the Abbasids of Baghdad who failed in their attempts to overthrow him. In 778, Abd al-Rahman closed in on the Ebro valley. Regional lords saw the Umayyad emir at the gates and decided to enlist the nearby Christian Franks. According to Ali ibn al-Athir, a Kurdish historian of the 12th century, Charlemagne received the envoys of Sulayman al-Arabi, Husayn, and Abu Taur at the Diet of Paderborn in 777. These rulers of Zaragoza, Girona, Barcelona, and Huesca were enemies of Abd ar-Rahman I, and in return for Frankish military aid against him offered their homage and allegiance.
Charlemagne, seeing an opportunity, agreed upon an expedition and crossed the Pyrenees in 778. Near the city of Zaragoza Charlemagne received the homage of Sulayman al-Arabi. However the city, under the leadership of Husayn, closed its gates and refused to submit. Unable to conquer the city by force, Charlemagne decided to retreat. On the way home the rearguard of the army was ambushed and destroyed by Basque forces at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;, a highly romanticised account of this battle, would later become one of the most famous of the Middle Ages. Around 788 Abd ar-Rahman I died and was succeeded by Hisham I. In 792 Hisham proclaimed a jihad, advancing in 793 against the Kingdom of Asturias and Carolingian Septimania (Gothia). They defeated William of Gellone, Count of Toulouse, in battle, but William led an expedition the following year across the eastern Pyrenees. Barcelona, a major city, became a potential target for the Franks in 797, as its governor Zeid rebelled against the Umayyad emir of Córdoba. An army of the emir managed to recapture it in 799, but Louis, at the head of an army, crossed the Pyrenees and besieged the city for seven months until it finally capitulated in 801.

The main passes in the Pyrenees were Roncesvalles, Somport and La Jonquera. Charlemagne established across them the vassal regions of Pamplona, Aragon, and Catalonia respectively. Catalonia was itself formed from a number of small counties, including Pallars, Girona, and Urgell; it was called the &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot; by the late 8th century. They protected the eastern Pyrenees passes and shores and were under the direct control of the Frankish kings. Pamplona&#x27;s first king was Iñigo Arista, who allied with his Muslim kinsmen the Banu Qasi and rebelled against Frankish overlordship and overcame a Carolingian expedition in 824 that led to the setup of the Kingdom of Pamplona. Aragon, founded in 809 by Aznar Galíndez, grew around Jaca and the high valleys of the Aragon River, protecting the old Roman road. By the end of the 10th century, Aragon, which then was just a county, was annexed by Navarre. Sobrarbe and Ribagorza were small counties and had little significance to the progress of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;.

In the late 9th century under Count Wilfred, Barcelona became the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the region. It controlled the other counties&#x27; policies in a union, which led in 948 to the independence of Barcelona under Count Borrel II, who declared that the new dynasty in France (the Capets) were not the legitimate rulers of France nor, as a result, of his county. These states were small and, with the exception of Navarre, did not have the capacity for attacking the Muslims in the way that Asturias did, but their mountainous geography rendered them relatively safe from being conquered, and their borders remained stable for two centuries.

===Northern Christian realms===

The northern principalities and kingdoms survived in their mountainous strongholds (see above). However, they started a definite territorial expansion south at the turn of the 10th century (Leon, Najera). The fall of the Caliphate of Cordova (1031) heralded a period of military expansion for the northern kingdoms, now divided into several mighty regional powers after the division of the Kingdom of Navarre (1035). Myriad autonomous Christian kingdoms emerged thereafter.

====Kingdom of Asturias (718–924)====
The Kingdom of Asturias was located in the Cantabrian Mountains, a wet and mountainous region in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. It was the first Christian power to emerge. The kingdom was established by a Visigothic nobleman, named Pelagius (&quot;Pelayo&quot;), who had possibly returned after the Battle of Guadalete in 711 and was elected leader of the Asturians, and the remnants of the &quot;gens Gothorum&quot; (the Hispano-Gothic aristocracy and the Hispano-Visigothic population who took refuge in the North). Historian Joseph F. O&#x27;Callaghan says an unknown number of them fled and took refuge in Asturias or Septimania. In Asturias they supported Pelagius&#x27;s uprising, and joining with the indigenous leaders, formed a new aristocracy. 

The population of the mountain region consisted of native Astures, Galicians, Cantabri, Basques and other groups unassimilated into Hispano-Gothic society, laying the foundations for the Kingdom of Asturias and starting the Astur-Leonese dynasty that spanned from 718 to 1037 and led the initial efforts in the Iberian peninsula to take back the territories then ruled by the Moors. Although the new dynasty first ruled in the mountains of Asturias, with the capital of the kingdom established initially in Cangas de Onís, and was in its dawn mostly concerned with securing the territory and settling the monarchy, the latest kings (particularly Alfonso III of Asturias) emphasised the nature of the new kingdom as heir of that in Toledo and the restoration of the Visigothic nation in order to vindicate the expansion to the south. However, such claims have been overall dismissed by modern historiography, emphasizing the distinct, autochthonous nature of the Cantabro-Asturian and Vasconic domains with no continuation to the Gothic Kingdom of Toledo.

Pelagius&#x27;s kingdom initially was little more than a gathering point for the existing guerrilla forces. During the first decades, the Asturian dominion over the different areas of the kingdom was still lax, and for this reason it had to be continually strengthened through matrimonial alliances with other powerful families from the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus, Ermesinda, Pelagius&#x27;s daughter, was married to Alfonso, Dux Peter of Cantabria&#x27;s son. Alfonso&#x27;s son Fruela married Munia, a Basque from Álava, after crushing a Basque uprising (probably resistance). Their son is reported to be Alfonso II, while Alfonso I&#x27;s daughter Adosinda married Silo, a local chief from the area of Flavionavia, Pravia.

Alfonso&#x27;s military strategy was typical of Iberian warfare at the time. Lacking the means needed for wholesale conquest of large territories, his tactics consisted of raids in the border regions of Vardulia. With the plunder he gained further military forces could be paid, enabling him to raid the Muslim cities of Lisbon, Zamora, and Coimbra. Alfonso I also expanded his realm westwards conquering Galicia.

During the reign of King Alfonso II (791–842), the kingdom was firmly established, and a series of Muslim raids caused the transfer of the Asturian capital to Oviedo. The king is believed to have initiated diplomatic contacts with the kings of Pamplona and the Carolingians, thereby gaining official recognition for his kingdom and his crown from the Pope and Charlemagne.

The bones of St. James the Great were proclaimed to have been found in Iria Flavia (present day Padrón) in 813 or probably two or three decades later. The cult of the saint was transferred later to Compostela (from Latin &quot;campus stellae&quot;, literally &quot;the star field&quot;), possibly in the early 10th century when the focus of Asturian power moved from the mountains over to Leon, to become the Kingdom of León or Galicia-Leon. Santiago&#x27;s were among many saint relics proclaimed to have been found across north-western Hispania. Pilgrims started to flow in from other Iberian Christian realms, sowing the seeds of the later Way of Saint James (11–12th century) that sparked the enthusiasm and religious zeal of continental Christian Europe for centuries.

Despite numerous battles, neither the Umayyads nor the Asturians had sufficient forces to secure control over these northern territories. Under the reign of Ramiro, famed for the highly legendary Battle of Clavijo, the border began to slowly move southward and Asturian holdings in Castile, Galicia, and Leon were fortified, and an intensive program of re-population of the countryside began in those territories. In 924 the Kingdom of Asturias became the Kingdom of León, when Leon became the seat of the royal court (it didn&#x27;t bear any official name).

====Kingdom of León (910–1230)====

Alfonso III of Asturias repopulated the strategically important city Leon and established it as his capital. King Alfonso began a series of campaigns to establish control over all the lands north of the Douro river. He reorganised his territories into the major duchies (Galicia and Portugal) and major counties (Saldaña and Castile), and fortified the borders with many castles. At his death in 910 the shift in regional power was completed as the kingdom became the Kingdom of León. From this power base, his heir Ordoño II was able to organize attacks against Toledo and even Seville.

The Caliphate of Córdoba was gaining power, and began to attack Leon. King Ordoño allied with Navarre against Abd-al-Rahman, but they were defeated in Valdejunquera in 920. For the next 80 years, the Kingdom of León suffered civil wars, Moorish attack, internal intrigues and assassinations, and the partial independence of Galicia and Castile, thus delaying the reconquest and weakening the Christian forces. It was not until the following century that the Christians started to see their conquests as part of a long-term effort to restore the unity of the Visigothic kingdom.

The only point during this period when the situation became hopeful for Leon was the reign of Ramiro II. King Ramiro, in alliance with Fernán González of Castile and his retinue of &quot;caballeros villanos&quot;, defeated the Caliph in Simancas in 939. After this battle, when the Caliph barely escaped with his guard and the rest of the army was destroyed, King Ramiro obtained 12 years of peace, but he had to give González the independence of Castile as payment for his help in the battle. After this defeat, Moorish attacks abated until Almanzor began his campaigns. Alfonso V finally regained control over his domains in 1002. Navarre, though attacked by Almanzor, remained intact.

The conquest of Leon did not include Galicia which was left to temporary independence after the withdrawal of the Leonese king. Galicia was conquered soon after (by Ferdinand, son of Sancho the Great, around 1038). Subsequent kings titled themselves kings of Galicia and Leon, instead of merely king of Leon as the two were in a personal union.

At the end of the 11th century, King Afonso VI of León reached the Tagus (1085), repeating the same policy of alliances and developing collaboration with Frankish knights. The original &quot;repoblación&quot; was then complete. His aim was to create a Hispanic empire like the Visigothic Kingdom (418–720) to reclaim his hegemony over the entire Iberian Peninsula. Within this context, the territory between the Douro and the Tagus was repopulated and a western nucleus was formed in Portugal that wanted independence. This marks the beginning of the Portuguese &quot;Repovoação&quot; ou &quot;Repovoamento&quot; occurred during the reigns of the House of Burgundy up to the middle of the thirteenth century when the Portuguese Reconquista was also brought to an end with the ultimate conquering of Gharb al-Andalus when in March 1249 the city of Faro was conquered by Afonso III of Portugal.

====Kingdom of Castile (1037–1230)====
Ferdinand I of Leon was the leading king of the mid-11th century. He conquered Coimbra and attacked the taifa kingdoms, often demanding the tributes known as parias. Ferdinand&#x27;s strategy was to continue to demand parias until the taifa was greatly weakened both militarily and financially. He also repopulated the Borders with numerous &quot;fueros&quot;. Following the Navarrese tradition, on his death in 1064 he divided his kingdom between his sons. His son Sancho II of Castile wanted to reunite the kingdom of his father and attacked his brothers, with a young noble at his side: Rodrigo Díaz, later known as El Cid Campeador. Sancho was killed in the siege of Zamora by the traitor Bellido Dolfos (also known as Vellido Adolfo) in 1072. His brother Alfonso VI took over Leon, Castile and Galicia.

Alfonso VI the Brave gave more power to the &quot;fueros&quot; and repopulated Segovia, Ávila and Salamanca. Once he had secured the Borders, King Alfonso conquered the powerful Taifa kingdom of Toledo in 1085. Toledo, which was the former capital of the Visigoths, was a very important landmark, and the conquest made Alfonso renowned throughout the Christian world. However, this &quot;conquest&quot; was conducted rather gradually, and mostly peacefully, during the course of several decades. However, Toledo was not fully secured and integrated into Alfonso&#x27;s kingdom until after a period of gradual resettlement and consolidation, during which Christian settlers were encouraged to move into the area.

Alfonso VI was first and foremost a tactful monarch who chose to understand the kings of taifa and employed unprecedented diplomatic measures to attain political feats before considering the use of force. He adopted the title &quot;Imperator totius Hispaniae&quot; (&quot;Emperor of all Hispania&quot;, referring to all the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, and not just the modern country of Spain). Alfonso&#x27;s more aggressive policy towards the taifas worried the rulers of those kingdoms, who called on the African Almoravids for help.

==== Kingdom of Navarre (824–1620) ====

The Kingdom of Pamplona primarily extended along either side of the Pyrenees on the Atlantic Ocean. The kingdom was formed when local leader Íñigo Arista led a revolt against the regional Frankish authority and was elected or declared King in Pamplona (traditionally in 824), establishing a kingdom inextricably linked at this stage to their kinsmen, the muwallad Banu Qasi of Tudela.

Although relatively weak until the early 11th century, Pamplona took a more active role after the accession of Sancho the Great (1004–1035). The kingdom expanded greatly under his reign, as it absorbed Castile, Leon, and what was to be Aragon, in addition to other small counties that would unite and become the Principality of Catalonia. This expansion also led to the independence of Galicia, as well as gaining overlordship over Gascony.

In the 12th century, however, the kingdom contracted to its core, and in 1162 King Sancho VI declared himself king of Navarre. Throughout its early history, the Navarrese kingdom engaged in frequent skirmishes with the Carolingian Empire, from which it maintained its independence, a key feature of its history until 1513.

====Kingdom and Crown of Aragon (1035–1706)====

The Kingdom of Aragon started off as an offshoot of the Kingdom of Navarre. It was formed when Sancho III of Navarre decided to divide his large realm among all his sons. Aragon was the portion of the realm which passed to Ramiro I of Aragon, an illegitimate son of Sancho III. The kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre were several times united in personal union until the death of Alfonso the Battler in 1135.

In 1137, the heiress of the kingdom married the count of Barcelona, and their son Alfonso II ruled from 1162 the combined possessions of his parents, resulting in the composite monarchy that modern historians call the Crown of Aragon. Alfonso successfully reincorporated the Principality of Tarragona into their realm, expelling the Norman d&#x27;Aguiló family.

In the following centuries, the Crown of Aragon conquered a number of territories in the Iberian peninsula and the Mediterranean, including the kingdom of Valencia and the kingdom of Mallorca. James I of Aragon, also known as James the Conqueror, expanded his territories to the north, south and east. James also signed the Treaty of Corbeil (1258), in which the French king renounced to any feudal claim over Catalonia.

Early in his reign, James attempted to reunite the Aragonese and Navarrese crowns through a treaty with the childless Sancho VII of Navarre. But the Navarrese nobles rejected him, and chose Theobald IV of Champagne in his stead.

Later on, Ferdinand II of Aragon, married Isabella of Castile, leading to a dynastic union which eventually gave birth to modern Spain, after the conquest of Upper Navarre (Navarre south of the Pyrenees) and the Emirate of Granada.

====Kingdom of Portugal (1139–1249)====

In 1139, after an overwhelming victory in the Battle of Ourique against the Almoravids, Afonso Henriques was proclaimed the first King of Portugal by his troops. According to the legend, Christ announced from heaven Afonso&#x27;s great deeds, whereby he would establish the first Portuguese Cortes at Lamego and be crowned by the Primate Archbishop of Braga. In 1142 a group of Anglo-Norman crusaders on their way to the Holy Land helped King Afonso Henriques in a failed Siege of Lisbon (1142). In the Treaty of Zamora in 1143, Alfonso VII of Leon and Castile recognized Portuguese independence from the Kingdom of León.

In 1147, Portugal captured Santarém, and seven months later the city of Lisbon was also brought under Portuguese control after the Siege of Lisbon. By the papal bull Manifestis Probatum, Pope Alexander III recognized Afonso Henriques as King of Portugal in 1179.

With Portugal finally recognized as an independent kingdom by its neighbors, Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by Crusaders and the military monastic orders the Knights Templar, the Order of Aviz or the Order of Saint James, pushed the Moors to the Algarve on the southern coast of Portugal. After several campaigns, the Portuguese part in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; came to an end with the definitive capture of the Algarve in 1249. With all of Portugal now under the control of Afonso III of Portugal, religious, cultural and ethnic groups became gradually homogenized.

After the completion of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, the Portuguese territory was a Roman Catholic realm. Nonetheless, Denis of Portugal carried out a short war with Castile for possession of the towns of Serpa and Moura. After this, Denis avoided war. In 1297, he signed the Treaty of Alcanizes with Ferdinand IV of Castile, establishing a permanent border between the two kingdoms.

During the suppression of the Knights Templar all over Europe, under the influence of Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V requesting its annihilation by 1312, King Denis reinstituted the Templars of Tomar as the Order of Christ in 1319. Denis believed that the Order&#x27;s assets should by their nature stay in any given Order instead of being taken by the King, largely for the Templars&#x27; contribution to the &quot;Reconquista&quot; and the reconstruction of Portugal after the wars.

The experience gained during the battles of the &quot;Reconquista&quot; was fundamental to Conquest of Ceuta, the first step to the establishment of the Portuguese Empire. Likewise, the contact with Muslim&#x27;s navigation techniques and sciences enabled the creation of Portuguese nautical innovations such as the caravel – the principal Portuguese ship during their voyages of exploration in the Age of Discovery.

==== Minor Christian realms ====
Minor Christian realms were the Kingdom of Viguera (970–1005), the Lordship of Albarracín (1167–1300), the Principality of Tarragona (1129–1173), and the Principality of Valencia (1094–1102).

=== Southern Islamic realms ===
==== Umayyads ====

During the 9th century the Berbers returned to North Africa in the aftermath of revolts. Many governors of large cities distant from the capital, Córdoba, had planned to establish their independence. Then, in 929, the Emir of Córdoba (Abd-ar-Rahman III), the leader of the Umayyad dynasty, declared himself Caliph, independent from the Abbasids in Baghdad. He took all the military, religious, and political power and reorganised the army and the bureaucracy.

After regaining control over the dissident governors, Abd-ar-Rahman III tried to conquer the remaining Christian kingdoms of the Iberian peninsula, attacking them several times and forcing them back beyond the Cantabrian Mountains. Abd-ar-Rahman&#x27;s grandson later became a puppet in the hands of the great Vizier Almanzor (&quot;al-Mansur&quot;, &quot;the victorious&quot;). Almanzor waged several campaigns attacking and sacking Burgos, Leon, Pamplona, Barcelona, and Santiago de Compostela before his death in 1002.

==== &quot;Taifas&quot; ====

Between Almanzor&#x27;s death and 1031, al-Andalus suffered many civil wars, which ended in the division into the Taifa kingdoms. The taifas were small kingdoms, established by the city governors. The result was many (up to 34) small kingdoms, each centered upon its capital. Their governors had no larger-scale vision of the Moorish presence in the Iberian peninsula and had no qualms about attacking their neighbouring kingdoms whenever they could gain advantage by doing so.

The split into the taifa states weakened the Islamic presence, and the Christian kingdoms further advanced as Alfonso VI of Leon and Castile conquered Toledo in 1085. Surrounded by enemies, taifa rulers sent a desperate appeal to the Berber chieftain Yusuf ibn Tashfin, leader of the Almoravids. &quot;Taifas&quot; reemerged when the Almoravid dynasty collapsed in the 1140s, and again when the Almohad Caliphate declined in the 1220s.

====Almoravids====

The Almoravids were a Muslim militia composed of Berbers, and unlike previous Muslim rulers, they were not so tolerant towards Christians and Jews. Their armies entered the Iberian peninsula on several occasions (1086, 1088, 1093) and defeated King Alfonso at the Battle of Sagrajas in 1086, but initially their purpose was to unite all the taifas into a single Almoravid Caliphate. Their actions halted the southward expansion of the Christian kingdoms. Their only defeat came at Valencia in 1094, due to the actions of El Cid.

Meanwhile, Navarre lost all importance under King Sancho IV, for he lost Rioja to Sancho II of Castile, and nearly became the vassal of Aragon. At his death, the Navarrese chose as their king Sancho Ramírez, King of Aragon, who thus became Sancho V of Navarre and I of Aragon. Sancho Ramírez gained international recognition for Aragon, uniting it with Navarre and expanding the borders south, conquering &quot;Wasqat&quot; Huesca deep in the valleys in 1096 and building a fort, El Castellar, 25 km from &quot;Saraqustat&quot; Zaragoza.

Catalonia came under intense pressure from the taifas of Zaragoza and Lérida, as well as from internal disputes, as Barcelona suffered a dynastic crisis that led to open war among the smaller counties. But by the 1080s, the situation had calmed down, and the dominion of Barcelona over the smaller counties was restored.

====Almohads====
After a brief period of disintegration (the second Taifa period), the Almohads, the rising power in North Africa, took over most of &quot;al-Andalus&quot;. However they were decisively defeated at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa (1212) by a Christian coalition, losing almost all the remaining lands of &quot;al-Andalus&quot; in the following decades. By 1252 only the Emirate of Granada remained intact but as a vassal state of Castile.

==== Granada War and the end of Muslim rule ====

Ferdinand and Isabella completed the &quot;Reconquista&quot; with a war against the Emirate of Granada that started in 1482 and ended with Granada&#x27;s surrender on 2 January 1492. The Moors in Castile previously numbered &quot;half a million within the realm&quot;. By 1492 some 100,000 had died or been enslaved, 200,000 had emigrated, and 200,000 remained in Castile. Many of the Muslim elite, including Granada&#x27;s former Emir Muhammad XII, who had been given the area of the Alpujarras mountains as a principality, found life under Christian rule intolerable and emigrated to Fez in North Africa.

In 1497, Spanish forces took Melilla, west of Oran, and the island of Djerba, south of Tunis, and went on to more important gains, with the bloody seizure of Oran in 1509, and the capture of Bougie and Tripoli in 1510. The Spanish capture of Tripoli cost them some 300 men, while the inhabitants suffered between 3,000 and 5,000 killed and another 5,000–6,000 carried off as slaves. Soon thereafter, however, they faced competition from the rapidly expanding Ottoman Empire in the east and were pushed back.

== Infighting ==
=== Christian infighting ===
Clashes and raids on bordering Andalusian lands did not keep the Christian kingdoms from battling among themselves or allying with Muslim kings. Some Muslim kings had Christian-born wives or mothers. Some Christian mercenaries, like El Cid, were contracted by taifa kings to fight against their neighbours. Indeed, El Cid&#x27;s first battle experience was gained fighting for a Muslim state against a Christian state. At the Battle of Graus in 1063, he and other Castilians fought on the side of al-Muqtadir, Muslim sultan of Zaragoza, against the forces of Ramiro I of Aragon. There is even an instance of a crusade being declared against another Christian king in Hispania. Although Christian rulers Fernán González of Castile and Ramiro II of León had cooperated to defeat the Muslims at the Battle of Simancas (939), Fernán attacked Ramiro soon after and the Leonese–Castilian war that followed lasted until Ramiro&#x27;s victory in 944. Ramiro II&#x27;s death caused the war of the Leonese succession (951–956) between his sons, and the winner Ordoño III of León concluded peace with caliph Abd al-Rahman III of Córdoba.

After the defeat of Alfonso VIII, King of Castile, at Alarcos, Kings Alfonso IX of Leon and Sancho VII of Navarre entered an alliance with the Almohads and invaded Castile in 1196. By the end of the year Sancho VII had dropped out of the war under Papal pressure. Early in 1197, at the request of Sancho I, King of Portugal, Pope Celestine III declared a crusade against Alfonso IX and released his subjects from their responsibilities to the king, declaring that &quot;the men of his realm shall be absolved from their fidelity and his dominion by authority of the apostolic see.&quot; Together the Kings of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon invaded Leon. In the face of this onslaught combined with pressure from the Pope, Alfonso IX was finally forced to sue for peace in October 1197.

In the late years of &quot;al-Andalus&quot;, Castile had the might to conquer the remnants of the kingdom of Granada, but the kings preferred to wait and claim the tribute of the Muslim &quot;parias&quot;. The trade of Granadan goods and the parias were a major means by which African gold entered medieval Europe.

=== Muslim infighting ===
Similarly, there was frequent Muslim infighting throughout the existence of al-Andalus. The Abbasid Revolution (747–750) divided Muslim rulers in Iberia into the pro-Abbasid Caliphate faction (based in Baghdad) and the pro-Umayyad faction (reconstituted as the Emirate of Córdoba). Charlemagne&#x27;s failed 778 campaign into Iberia was prompted by the invitation of the pro-Abbasid governor of Barcelona, Sulayman al-Arabi, which led to a brief Abbasid-Carolingian Alliance against the Umayyads. During the Fitna of al-Andalus (1009–1031), the Umayyad-run Caliphate of Córdoba fell apart into rival taifas headed by Islamic emirs warring each other. After the Christian king of Castile and León conquered Toledo in 1085, the emirs requested Yusuf ibn Tashfin, leader of the strict Islamic Almoravid sect, to come to their defence, which he did at the Battle of Sagrajas (1086). However, Yusuf soon turned on the Muslim emirs of Spain, defeating them all and conquering their lands by 1091. A similar scenario occurred in 1147–1157, when the Almoravid dynasty fell, a Second Taifas period happened, and the Muslim-controlled cities of al-Andalus were conquered by the new Almohad Caliphate. The War of the Granada succession (1482–1492) took place after the deposition of emir Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Ali of Granada by his son Muhammad XII of Granada; the deposed emir&#x27;s brother Muhammad XIII of Granada also joined the fight. This succession conflict took place simultaneously with the Granada War, and was ended only by the Castilian conquest in 1492.

==Christian repopulation==

The &quot;Reconquista&quot; was a process not only of war and conquest, but also of repopulation. Christian kings moved their own people to locations abandoned by Muslims in order to have a population capable of defending the borders. The main repopulation areas were the Douro Basin (the northern plateau), the high Ebro valley (La Rioja) and central Catalonia. The repopulation of the Douro Basin took place in two distinct phases. North of the river, between the 9th and 10th centuries, the &quot;pressure&quot; (or &quot;presura&quot;) system was employed. South of the Douro, in the 10th and 11th centuries, the &quot;presura&quot; led to the &quot;charters&quot; (&quot;forais&quot; or &quot;fueros&quot;). &quot;Fueros&quot; were used even south of the Central Range.

The &quot;presura&quot; referred to a group of peasants who crossed the mountains and settled in the abandoned lands of the Douro Basin. Asturian laws promoted this system, for instance granting a peasant all the land he was able to work and defend as his own property. Of course, Asturian and Galician minor nobles and clergymen sent their own expeditions with the peasants they maintained. This led to very feudalised areas, such as Leon and Portugal, whereas Castile, an arid land with vast plains and harsh climate, only attracted peasants with no hope in Biscay. As a consequence, Castile was governed by a single count, but had a largely non-feudal territory with many peasants. &quot;Presuras&quot; also appear in Catalonia, when the count of Barcelona ordered the Bishop of Urgell and the count of Gerona to repopulate the plains of Vic.

During the 10th century and onwards, cities and towns gained more importance and power, as commerce reappeared and the population kept growing. &quot;Fueros&quot; were charters documenting the privileges and usages given to all the people repopulating a town. The &quot;fueros&quot; provided a means of escape from the feudal system, as &quot;fueros&quot; were only granted by the monarch. As a result, the town council was dependent on the monarch alone and, in turn, was required to provide &quot;auxilium&quot;—aid or troops—for their monarch. The military force of the towns became the &quot;caballeros villanos&quot;. The first &quot;fuero&quot; was given by count Fernán González to the inhabitants of Castrojeriz in the 940&#x27;s. The most important towns of medieval Hispania had &quot;fueros&quot;, or &quot;forais&quot;. In Navarre, &quot;fueros&quot; were the main repopulating system. Later on, in the 12th century, Aragon also employed the system; for example, the &quot;fuero&quot; of Teruel, which was one of the last fueros, in the early 13th century.

From the mid-13th century on, no more charters were granted, as the demographic pressure had disappeared and other means of re-population were created. &quot;Fueros&quot; remained as city charters until the 18th century in Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia and until the 19th century in Castile and Navarre. &quot;Fueros&quot; had an immense importance for those living under them, who were prepared to go to war to defend their rights under the charter. In the 19th century, the abolition of the &quot;fueros&quot; in Navarre would be one of the causes of the Carlist Wars. In Castile, disputes over the system contributed to the war against Charles I (Castilian War of the Communities).

== Christian military culture ==
===Reconquista as Crusade===
At the First Council of the Lateran, Pope Callixtus II declared the Reconquista as 
part of Crusades and its participants as Crusaders having an equal spiritual standing with those in the east.

In the 13th century, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade and persuaded warriors from many parts of Europe in and outside the Iberian peninsula to assist the Iberians against the Almohad Caliphate army. The Almohads then advanced into Europe with the intent of undoing the previous achievements of the Reconquista and marching on Rome itself. The crusading campaign culminated in a resounding Crusader victory at the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, effectively turning the tide of war in favour of the Christians.
=== Other Motivations ===

Jim Bradbury (2004) noted that the Christian belligerents in the &quot;Reconquista&quot; were not all equally motivated by religion, and that a distinction should be made between &#x27;secular rulers&#x27; on the one hand, and on the other hand Christian military orders which came from elsewhere (including the three main orders of Knights Templar, Knights Hospitaller and Teutonic Knights), or were established inside Iberia (such as those of Santiago, Alcántara and Calatrava). &#x27;[The Knights] were more committed to religious war than some of their secular counterparts, were opposed to treating with Muslims and carried out raids and even atrocities, such as decapitating Muslim prisoners.&#x27;

On the other hand, Christian armies sometimes forged temporary alliances with Islamic emirs, and Christian mercenaries were quite willing to fight for Arab and Berber rulers if the price was right. El Cid is a well-known example of a Christian mercenary leader who was in paid military service of the Islamic kings of Zaragoza for years. Mercenaries were an important factor, as many kings did not have enough soldiers available. Norsemen, Flemish spearmen, Frankish knights, Moorish mounted archers (archers who travelled on horseback), and Berber light cavalry were the main types of mercenaries available and used in the conflict.

=== Christian cavalry and infantry ===

Medieval Christian armies mainly comprised two types of forces: the cavalry (mostly nobles, but including commoner knights from the 10th century on) and the infantry, or &quot;peones&quot; (peasants). Infantry only went to war if needed, which was not frequent. In an atmosphere of constant conflict, warfare and daily life were strongly intertwined during this period. These armies reflected the need for society to be on constant alert during the first chapters of the Reconquista. These forces were capable of moving long distances in short times.

Cavalry tactics in Hispania involved knights approaching the enemy, throwing javelins, then withdrawing to a safe distance before commencing another assault. Once the enemy formation was sufficiently weakened, the knights charged with thrusting spears (lances did not arrive in Hispania until the 11th century). There were three types of knights (&quot;caballeros&quot;): royal knights, noble knights (&quot;caballeros hidalgos&quot;), and commoner knights (&quot;caballeros villanos&quot;, or &quot;mounted soldier from a villa&quot;). Royal knights were mainly nobles with a close relationship with the king, and thus claimed a direct Gothic inheritance.

Royal knights in the early stages of the Reconquista were equipped with mail hauberk, kite shield, a long sword (designed to fight from the horse), javelins, spears and an axe. Noble knights came from the ranks of the &quot;infanzones&quot; or lower nobles, whereas the commoner knights were not noble but were wealthy enough to afford a horse. Uniquely in Europe, these horsemen comprised a militia cavalry force with no feudal links, being under the sole control of the king or the count of Castile because of &quot;fueros&quot; (charters) with the crown. Both noble and common knights wore padded armour and carried javelins, spears and round-tasselled shield (influenced by Moorish shields), as well as a sword.

The &quot;peones&quot; were peasants who went to battle in service of their feudal lord. Poorly equipped, with bows and arrows, spears and short swords, they were mainly used as auxiliary troops. Their function in battle was to contain the enemy troops until the cavalry arrived and to block the enemy infantry from charging the knights. The longbow, the composite bow, and the crossbow were the basic types of bows and were especially popular in the infantry.

=== Equipment ===
In the early Middle Ages in Hispania, armour was typically made of leather, with iron scales. Head protections consisted of a round helmet with nose protector (influenced by the designs used by Vikings, who attacked during the 8th and 9th centuries) and a chain mail headpiece. Shields were often round or kidney-shaped, except for the kite-shaped designs used by the royal knights. Usually adorned with geometric designs, crosses or tassels, shields were made out of wood and had a leather cover.

Steel swords were the most common weapon. The cavalry used long double-edged swords and the infantry short, single-edged ones. Guards were either semicircular or straight, but always highly ornamented with geometrical patterns. Spears and javelins were up to 1.5 metres long and had an iron tip. The double-axe—made of iron, 30 cm long, and possessing an extremely sharp edge—was designed to be equally useful as a thrown weapon or in close combat. Maces and hammers were not common, but some specimens have remained and are thought to have been used by members of the cavalry.

=== Technological changes ===

This style of warfare remained dominant in the Iberian Peninsula until the late 11th century, when lance tactics entered from France, although the traditional horse javelin-shot techniques continued to be used. In the 12th and 13th centuries, soldiers typically carried a sword, a lance, a javelin, and either bow and arrows or crossbow and darts/bolts. Armor consisted of a coat of mail over a quilted jacket, extending at least to the knees, a helmet or iron cap, and bracers protecting the arms and thighs, either metal or leather.

Shields were round or triangular, made of wood, covered with leather, and protected by an iron band; the shields of knights and nobles would bear the family&#x27;s coat of arms. Knights rode in both the Muslim style, &quot;a la jineta&quot; (i.e. the equivalent of a modern jockey&#x27;s seat), a short stirrup strap and bended knees allowed for better control and speed, or in the French style, &quot;a la brida&quot;, a long stirrup strap allowed for more security in the saddle (i.e. the equivalent of the modern cavalry seat, which is more secure) when acting as heavy cavalry. Horses were occasionally fitted with a coat of mail as well.

Around the 14th and 15th centuries heavy cavalry gained a predominant role, including knights wearing full plate armor.

==Conversions and expulsions==

The new Christian hierarchy demanded heavy taxes from non-Christians and gave them rights, such as in the Treaty of Granada (1491) only for Moors in recently Islamic Granada. On 30 July 1492, all the Jewish community—some 200,000 people—were forcibly expelled. The next year, the Alhambra decree ordered the expulsion of practicing Jews, leading many of them to convert to Catholicism. In 1502, Queen Isabella I declared that conversion to Catholicism was compulsory within the Kingdom of Castile. Holy Roman Emperor Charles V imposed the same religious requirement on Moors in the Kingdom of Aragon in 1526, forcing its Muslim population to convert during the Revolt of the Germanies.

=== Spanish Inquisition ===
Making things more complex were the many former Muslims and Jews known as &quot;Moriscos&quot;, &quot;Marranos&quot;, and &quot;Conversos&quot;, who shared ancestors in common with many Christians, especially among the aristocracy, causing much concern over loyalty and attempts by the aristocracy to hide their non-Christian ancestry. Some—the numbers are debated—continued to secretly practice their religions and use their languages well into the sixteenth century. Those that the Spanish Inquisition found to be secretly practicing Islam or Judaism were executed, imprisoned, or exiled.

Nevertheless, all those deemed to be &quot;New Christians&quot; were repeatedly suspected of illegally continuing in secret to practice their religions. Various crimes against the Spanish state including continued practice of Islam or Judaism. New Christians were subject to many discriminatory practices starting in the sixteenth century.

==Classifications and later consequences==

The many advances and retreats created several social types:
* The &quot;Muwallad&quot;: native Iberians under Islamic rule who converted to Islam after the arrival of the Muslim Arabs and Berbers.
* The &quot;Mozarabs&quot;: Christians in Muslim-held lands. Some of them migrated to the north of the peninsula in times of persecution bringing elements of the styles, food and agricultural practices learned from the Andalusians, while they continued practicing their Christianity with older forms of Catholic worship and their own versions of the Latin language.
* &quot;New Christians&quot;: Jews converting to Christianity called &quot;conversos&quot;, or pejoratively &quot;Marranos&quot;. Jews converted to Christianity voluntarily or through force. Some were Crypto-Jews who continued practicing Judaism secretly. All remaining Jews were expelled from Spain as a consequence of the 1492 Alhambra Decree, and from Portugal in 1497. Former Jews were subject to the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, established to enforce Christian faith and practice, which often resulted in secret investigations and public punishments of &quot;conversos&quot; in autos-da-fé (&quot;acts of faith&quot;), often public executions by burning the victim alive.
* The &quot;Mudéjar&quot;: Muslims in Christian-held lands.
* &quot;Moriscos&quot;: Muslim &quot;conversos&quot;. Muslims who converted to Catholicism. A significant number were Crypto-Muslims who continued practicing Islam secretly. They ranged from successful skilled artisans, valued and protected in Aragon, to impoverished peasants in Castile. After the Alhambra Decree the entire Islamic population was forced to convert or leave, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century a significant number were expelled in the expulsion of the Moriscos.

==Legacy==
Since the 19th century, traditional Western and especially Iberian historiography has stressed the existence of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, a continual phenomenon by which the Christian Iberian kingdoms opposed and conquered the Muslim kingdoms, understood as a common enemy who had militarily seized territory from native Iberian Christians. However, modern scholarship has challenged this concept of a &quot;reconquista&quot; as a national myth tied to Spanish nationalism. The concept has served the idea &quot;that Spain is a nation shaped against Islam&quot;, contributing to &quot;a largely biased and distorted vision of the Iberian medieval past, aimed at delegitimizing the Islamic presence (al-Andalus) and therefore at legitimizing the Christian conquest of the Muslim territory.&quot; Among other arguments, one of those advanced by scholars is that &quot;no military campaign lasts eight centuries.&quot; The term &quot;reconquista&quot; in this sense first appeared in the 19th century, and only entered the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy in 1936, with the rise of Francisco Franco. The concept of the reconquista continues to have significance and has even experienced a resurgence in modern politics—especially for the extreme right Spanish party Vox, but also more broadly among xenophobic and especially Islamophobic conservatives in the West, with the influence of the doctrine of a &quot;Clash of Civilizations&quot;.

Real, legendary, and fictional episodes from the &quot;Reconquista&quot; are the subject of much of medieval Galician-Portuguese, Spanish, and Catalan literature such as the &quot;cantar de gesta&quot;.

Some noble genealogies show the close, though not numerous, relations between Muslims and Christians. For example, Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir, whose rule is considered to have marked the peak of power for Moorish &quot;al-Andalus&quot; Hispania, married Abda, daughter of Sancho Garcés II of Navarra, who bore him a son, named Abd al-Rahman and commonly known in a pejorative sense as Sanchuelo (&quot;Little Sancho&quot;; in Arabic: &quot;Shanjoul&quot;).

After his father&#x27;s death, Sanchuelo/Abd al-Rahman, as a son of a Christian princess, was a strong contender to take over the ultimate power in Muslim al-Andalus. A hundred years later, King Alfonso VI of Castile, regarded as one of the greatest medieval Spanish kings, designated his son (also named Sancho) by the Muslim princess refugee Zaida of Seville, as his heir.

The &quot;Reconquista&quot; was a war with long periods of respite between the adversaries, partly for pragmatic reasons and also due to infighting among the Christian kingdoms of the North spanning over seven centuries. Some populations practiced Islam or Christianity as their own religion during these centuries, so the identity of contenders changed over time.

It is noteworthy that the popular hero El Cid, whose name is very much associated with the Reconquista, had at one part of his career actually fought for the Muslim rulers of Zaragoza, whom he defended from its traditional enemy, the Christian Aragon. The most important achievement of El Cid&#x27;s career, the conquest of the kingdom-city of Valencia, was actually achieved in close alliance with the Banu Hud and other Muslim dynasties opposed to the Almoravids.

===French emulation===

In 1558, the armies of King Henry II of France managed to conquer the city of Calais, which had been under English rule for centuries. Queen Mary I of England considered the loss of Calais as the greatest disaster of her reign The region around Calais, then-known as the &quot;Calaisis&quot;, was renamed the &quot;Pays Reconquis&quot; (&quot;Reconquered Country&quot;) in commemoration of its recovery by the French. The French were certainly aware of the Spanish Reconquista, and since at the time Philip II of Spain was Queen Mary&#x27;s consort, use of this term might have been intended as a deliberate snub to him.

===Festivals in modern Spain and Portugal===

Currently, festivals called &quot;moros y cristianos&quot; (Spanish), &quot;moros i cristians&quot; (Catalan), &quot;mouros e cristãos&quot; (Portuguese) and &quot;mouros e cristiáns&quot; (Galician), which all mean &quot;Moors and Christians&quot;, recreate the fights as colorful parades with elaborate garments and many fireworks, especially on the central and southern towns of the Land of Valencia, like Alcoi, Ontinyent or Villena.

=== Persistent effects ===
A 2016 study found that the &quot;rate of Reconquest&quot;—how rapidly the Christian frontier was expanded—has persistent effects on the Spanish economy to this day. After an initial phase of military conquest, Christians states incorporated the conquered land. When large frontier regions were incorporated at once, the land was mostly given to the nobility and the military orders, with negative effects on long-term development. The incorporation of small regions, on the other hand, generally allowed for the participation of individual settlers and was more likely to fall under the auspices of the crown. This led to a more equitable distribution of land and greater social equality, with positive effects on long-term development.

===Reverberations===

As the Christian kingdoms completed their conquest of territory on the Iberian Peninsula, they shifted their impetus elsewhere, even to the Maghreb, which is located across the Strait of Gibraltar. A Castilian Crown-sanctioned punitive expedition against Tetouan, a corsair stronghold, was launched as early as 1399–1400. The conquest of Ceuta in 1415 marked the beginning of Portuguese expansion in Africa. Thereby, it allowed Portugal to exert control over Castilian and Aragonese trade through the Strait, and it also allowed Portugal to establish a powerbase for the launching of raid expeditions in Muslim-ruled lands. Some 15th-century political writers promoted the idea of a &quot;Gothic Monarchy&quot;, an heir to Rome, that included territory across the Strait. 

The African enterprise which was undertaken during the rule of the Catholic Monarchs was nominally endorsed by papal bulls and it was also financed with donations which were used to pay the crusade tax, even if it was viewed with some suspicion by the Papacy. Conquest efforts in Africa on the part of the Catholic Monarchy by and large stalled following the death of Ferdinand II of Aragon. The model of conquest and repopulation by Christian powers in the Peninsula was however never reproduced in Northern Africa, and with the conquered territory—a fortified mark with very few fortresses scattered along an extensive coastline—merely adopting a defensive role, it allowed for Ottoman expansion in the region.

The Portuguese warred with the Ottoman Caliphate in the Mediterranean, Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia as the Portuguese conquered the Ottomans&#x27; allies: the Sultanate of Adal in East Africa, the Sultanate of Delhi in South Asia and the Sultanate of Malacca in Southeast Asia.

Christopher Columbus&#x27;s initial 1492 voyage to the Americas was predicated on the completion of the Granada War, with the Spanish monarchy only able to assent to his overseas journeys once it had completed the process of defeating the Moors. Columbus&#x27;s views of the New World and the Christian convictions that shaped his actions there were influenced by historical European anti-Muslim ideas that had underpinned the Reconquista itself; he believed that by his voyaging, he would be able to reach the Grand Khan of Asia and create a coalition that could attack the Middle East from both sides and thus bring Jerusalem back under Christian rule.

=== Far-right motif ===

Along with the rhetoric of the crusades, the rhetoric of the &#x27;Reconquista&#x27; serves as a rallying point in the political discourse of the contemporary far-right in Spain, Portugal and, more broadly, it also serves as a rallying point in the political discourse of the far-right in Europe. Frequently, references to the Reconquista and the crusades are allegorically played as internet meme by 21st-century online far-right groups which seek to convey anti-Muslim sentiments. The theme has also been used as a major rallying point by identitarian groups in France and Italy.

The annual commemoration of the surrender of Sultan Boabdil in Granada on 2 January acquired a markedly nationalistic undertone during the early years of the Francoist regime and, since the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975, it has served as glue for extreme right groups by facilitating their open-air physical gatherings and providing them with an occasion which they can use to explicitly state their political demands. A Spanish Legion unit usually parades and sings &quot;El novio de la muerte&quot; (&quot;Boyfriend of death&quot;). The far right has also waged a culture war by claiming dates in the history of the Reconquista, such as the aforementioned 2 January or 2 February, regional festivities for the related autonomous communities (Andalusia and Murcia).

<doc id="26551" wikidata="Q648899" url="?curid=26551" title="Raku ware">
<text>is a type of Japanese pottery traditionally used in Japanese tea ceremonies, most often in the form of &quot;chawan&quot; tea bowls. It is traditionally characterised by being hand-shaped rather than thrown, fairly porous vessels, which result from low firing temperatures, lead glazes and the removal of pieces from the kiln while still glowing hot. In the traditional Japanese process, the fired raku piece is removed from the hot kiln and is allowed to cool in the open air. 

The Western version of raku was developed in the 20th century by studio potters. Typically wares are fired at a high temperature, and after removing pieces from the kiln, the wares are placed in an open-air container filled with combustible material, which is not a traditional Raku practice in Japan. The Western process can give a great variety of colors and surface effects, making it very popular with studio and amateur potters.

==History==
In the 16th century, Sen no Rikyū, the Japanese tea master, was involved with the construction of the Jurakudai and had a tile-maker, named Chōjirō, produce hand-moulded tea bowls for use in the wabi-styled tea ceremony that was Rikyū&#x27;s ideal. The resulting tea bowls made by Chōjirō were initially referred to as &quot;ima-yaki&quot; (&quot;contemporary ware&quot;) and were also distinguished as Juraku-yaki, from the red clay (Juraku) that they employed. Toyotomi Hideyoshi presented Jokei, Chōjirō&#x27;s son, with a seal that bore the Chinese character for &quot;raku&quot; (&quot;Enjoyment&quot;). Raku then became the name of the family that produced the wares. Both the name and the ceramic style have been passed down through the family (sometimes by adoption) to the present 16th generation (Raku Kichizaemon XVI). The name and the style of ware has become influential in both Japanese culture and literature.

In Japan, there are &quot;branch kilns&quot; (&quot;wakigama&quot;), in the raku-ware tradition, that have been founded by Raku-family members or potters who apprenticed at the head family&#x27;s studio. One of the most well-known of these is Ōhi-yaki (Ōhi ware).

After the publication of a manual in the 18th century, raku ware was also made in numerous workshops by amateur potters and tea practitioners in Kyoto, and by professional and amateur potters around Japan.

Raku ware marked an important point in the historical development of Japanese ceramics, as it was the first ware to use a seal mark and the first to focus on close collaboration between potter and patron. Other famous Japanese clay artists of this period include Dōnyū (grandson of Chōjirō, also known as Nonkō; 1574–1656), Hon&#x27;ami Kōetsu (1556–1637) and Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743).

It influenced Hōraku ware from Nagoya, Owari province in the later Edo period.

==Western raku ==

Bernard Leach is credited with bringing Raku to the west. In 1911 he attended a party where he witnessed raku firing. This was his first experience of ceramics. Although he continued to experiment with raku firing for a few years following his return to England in 1920, the technique was largely forgotten after the 1930s. 

Raku became popular with American potters in the late 1950s with the help of Paul Soldner. Americans kept the general firing process, that is, heating the pottery quickly to high temperatures and cooling it quickly, but continued to form their own unique style of raku.

Raku&#x27;s unpredictable results and intense color attracts modern potters. These patterns and color result from the harsh cooling process and the amount of oxygen that is allowed to reach the pottery. Depending on what effect the artist wants, the pottery is either instantly cooled in water, cooled slowly in the open air, or placed in a barrel filled with combustible material, such as newspaper, covered, and allowed to smoke. Water immediately cools the pottery, stopping the chemical reactions of the glaze and fixing the colors. The combustible material produces smoke, which stains the unglazed portions of the pottery black. The amount of oxygen that is allowed during the firing and cooling process affects the color of the resultant glaze and the amount of crackle.

Unlike traditional Japanese raku, which is mainly hand-built bowls of modest design, western raku tends to be vibrant in color, and comes in many shapes and sizes. Western raku can be anything from an elegant vase to an eccentric abstract sculpture. Although some do hand build, most western potters use throwing wheels while creating their raku piece. Western culture has even created a new sub-branch of raku called horse hair raku, pieces that are often white with squiggly black lines and smoke-like smudges. These effects are created by placing horse hair, feathers, or even sugar on the pottery as it is removed from the kiln and still extremely hot.

Western raku artists include the French ceramist Claude Champy, who received the Suntory Museum Grand Prix; Jane Malvisi, a British artist making raku figurines, Alicja Buławka-Fankidejska at the Academy of Fine Arts in Gdańsk; artist Eva Díaz Torres introduced the practice to Uruguay.
==Kilns and firing==
The type and the size of kilns that are used in raku are crucial in the outcome. One aspect that can affect the results is the use of electric versus gas kilns. Electric kilns allow easy temperature control. Gas kilns, which comprise brick or ceramic fibers, can be used in either oxidation or reduction firing and use propane or natural gas. Gas kilns also heat more quickly than electric kilns, but it is more difficult to maintain temperature control. There is a noteworthy difference when using an updraft kiln rather than a downdraft kiln. An updraft kiln has shelves that trap heat. This effect creates uneven temperatures throughout the kiln. Conversely, a downdraft kiln pulls air down a separate stack on the side and allows a more even temperature throughout and allows the work to be layered on shelves.

It is important for a kiln to have a door that is easily opened and closed, because, when the artwork in the kiln has reached the right temperature (over 1000 degrees Celsius), it must be quickly removed and put in a metal or tin container with combustible material, which reduces the pot and leaves certain colors and patterns.

The use of a reduction chamber at the end of the raku firing was introduced by the American potter Paul Soldner in the 1960s to compensate for the difference in atmosphere between wood-fired Japanese raku kilns and gas-fired American kilns. Typically, pieces removed from the hot kiln are placed in masses of combustible material (e.g., straw, sawdust, or newspaper) to provide a reducing atmosphere for the glaze and to stain the exposed body surface with carbon. The first Japanese-style kiln in the west was built by Tsuronosuke Matsubayashi at Leach Pottery, St Ives in 1922.

Western raku potters rarely use lead as a glaze ingredient, due to its serious level of toxicity, but may use other metals as glaze ingredients. Japanese potters substitute a non-lead frit. Although almost any low-fire glaze can be used, potters often use specially formulated glaze recipes that &quot;crackle&quot; or craze (present a cracked appearance), because the crazing lines take on a dark color from the carbon.

Western raku is typically made from a stoneware clay body, bisque fired at and glost or glaze fired (the final firing) between , which falls into the cone 06 firing temperature range. The process is known for its unpredictability, particularly when reduction is forced, and pieces may crack or even explode due to thermal shock. Pots may be returned to the kiln to re-oxidize if firing results do not meet the potter&#x27;s expectations, although each successive firing has a high chance of weakening the overall structural integrity of the pot. Pots that are exposed to thermal shock multiple times can break apart in the kiln, as they are removed from the kiln, or when they are in the reduction chamber.

The glaze firing times for raku ware are short: an hour or two as opposed to up to 16 hours for high-temperature cone 10 stoneware firings. This is due to several factors: raku glazes mature at a much lower temperature (under , as opposed to almost for high-fire stoneware); kiln temperatures can be raised rapidly; and the kiln is loaded and unloaded while hot and can be kept hot between firings.

Because temperature changes are rapid during the raku process, clay bodies used for raku ware must be able to cope with significant thermal stress. The usual way to add strength to the clay body and to reduce thermal expansion is to incorporate a high percentage of quartz, grog, or kyanite into the body before the pot is formed. At high additions, quartz can increase the risk of dunting or shivering. Therefore, kyanite is often the preferred material, as it contributes both mechanical strength and, in amounts up to 20%, significantly reduces thermal expansion. Although any clay body can be used, white stoneware clay bodies are unsuitable for the western raku process unless some material is added to deal with thermal shock. Porcelain, however, is often used but it must be thinly thrown.

Aesthetic considerations include clay color and fired surface texture, as well as the clay&#x27;s chemical interaction with raku glazes.

In a craft conference in Kyoto in 1979, a heated debate sprang up between Western raku artists Paul Soldner and the youngest in the dynastic raku succession, Kichiemon (of the fourteenth generation of the &quot;Raku&quot; family of potters), concerning the right to use the title &quot;raku&quot;. The Japanese artists maintain that any work by other craftspeople should take their own name, (i.e., Soldner-ware, Hirsh-ware), as that was how &quot;raku&quot; was intended.

Raku in the west has been abstracted and is now a more philosophical approach with the emphasis on the spontaneity of surface pattern creation rather than purely a firing technique. Consequently, this has expanded its application from pots to sculptural ceramics.

==Reduction process ==
Reduction firing is when the kiln atmosphere, which is full of combustible material, is heated up. &quot;Reduction is incomplete combustion of fuel, caused by a shortage of oxygen, which produces carbon monoxide&quot; (Arbuckle, 4). Eventually, all of the available oxygen is used. This then draws oxygen from the glaze and the clay to allow the reaction to continue. Oxygen serves as the limiting reactant in this scenario because the reaction that creates fire needs a constant supply of it to continue; when the glaze and the clay come out hardened, this means that the oxygen was subtracted from the glaze and the clay to accommodate the lack of oxygen in the atmosphere. Consequently, the Raku piece appears black or white, depending on the amount of oxygen that was lost from each area of the piece. The empty spaces that occur from the reduction of oxygen are filled in by carbon molecules in the atmosphere of the container, which makes the piece blacker in spots where more oxygen was retracted.

==Raku reduction ==

In the western style of raku firing, the aluminium container acts as a reduction chamber, which is a container that allows the carbon dioxide to pass through a small hole. A reduction atmosphere is created by closing the container. A reduction atmosphere induces a reaction between oxygen and the clay minerals, which affects the color. It also affects the metal elements of the glaze. Reduction is a decrease in oxidation number. Closing the can reduces the oxygen content after the combustible materials such as sawdust catch fire and forces the reaction to pull oxygen from the glazes and the clay minerals. For example, luster gets its color from deprivation of oxygen. The reduction agent is a substance from which electrons are being taken by another substance. The reaction uses oxygen from the atmosphere within the reduction tube and, to continue, it receives the rest of the oxygen from the glazes. This leaves ions and iridescent luster behind, creating a metallic effect. Pieces with no glaze have nowhere to get the oxygen from, so they take it from clay minerals. This atmosphere will turn clay black, producing a matte color.

==Design considerations==
Raku is a unique form of pottery making; what makes it unique is the range of designs that can be created by simply altering certain variables. These variables—which include wax resist, glazes, slips, temperature, and timing—ultimately determine the outcome when firing a piece of clay.

Wax resist, which is painted over the bare clay, is a suspension of wax in water; the glaze does not cover the area where the wax resist was applied, thus creating a design. When in the kiln, the wax melts off and the carbon that results from oxygen reduction replaces it. Raku glazes contain alumina, which has a very high melting point, so that they remain in place and are not replaced by carbon as the wax is. Any unglazed areas turn black due to the carbon given off from the reduction of oxygen. Next, the clay is moved from the kiln to a container, typically a trashcan, which contains combustible organic materials such as leaves, sawdust, or paper.

Obvara is a raku form that uses a yeast solution that creates an earthy tone on secondary firing. The obvara mixture, made from yeast, flour, sugar, and water, is usually opaque cream in color. The temperature at which the pottery piece is lowered into the obvara solution is usually 800 degrees Celsius. After dipping the piece into the obvara solution, it is removed and dipped into water to &quot;seal&quot; the design via rapid cooling. 

Crackle glazes contain metallic compounds including metals such as copper, iron, and cobalt. After the glaze has reached a certain temperature, the metal in the glaze reacts taking on a specific color. For example, cobalt produces dark blue, and copper usually produces green, but can also produce a red when the oxygen in the glaze is completely gone. The change in temperature and in the reduction oxidation (redox) process sometimes cause cracking or crazing. Crazing is a pattern of surface cracking in the glaze of a piece. The timing of removal and placement in water directly affects the shades of each color.

Copper glazes are unlike crackle glazes. While the latter are deliberately subjected to cooling and the oxidation process between the kiln and the reduction chamber so the glaze will crackle, the copper glazed pieces are transferred from the kiln to the reduction chamber as quickly as possible. This causes the glaze to have as much reduction as possible and can pull out vibrant flashes of color from the glaze and end with either a matte or glossy finish depending on the type of glaze used.

Naked Raku is done by coating a section of the exterior of the piece with slip, taping off portions of the piece to leave parts of the body exposed to the firing; these areas will turn black after reduction. The piece is then fired in the kiln at lower temperatures until the slip has dried, and then further fired to . At this point, the piece is removed from the kiln and placed into the reduction chamber. In reduction the carbon will soak into the clay where the slip has cracked and turn black, but where the slip is stuck on the clay will keep its natural color. The slip can be easily removed by hand from the cooled piece to reveal the design.

Horse hair: Horse hair decoration is a process where the piece remains unglazed; when it reaches temperature in the kiln it is placed in the open air rather than the reduction chamber, and horse hair is strategically arranged on the piece. The horse hair immediately burns and leaves thin linear markings on the pottery.

==In literature==
Hiroshi Teshigahara made the film &quot;Rikyu&quot;, which is a nearly documentary story showing how Sen no Rikyu met Chojiro, who made the first genuine Raku tea bowl (chawan) and how Rikyu trained the shogun Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the tea ceremony with Raku chawans.(Ashton D 1997).

<doc id="26552" wikidata="Q188426" url="?curid=26552" title="Roy Orbison">
<text>Roy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist known for his distinctive and powerful voice, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. Orbison&#x27;s music is mostly in the rock music genre and his most successful periods were in the early 1960s and the late 1980s. He was nicknamed &quot;The Caruso of Rock&quot; and &quot;The Big O&quot;. Many of Orbison&#x27;s songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers projected strength. He performed with minimal motion and in black clothes, matching his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.

Born in Texas, Orbison began singing in a country-and-western band as a teenager. He was signed by Sam Phillips of Sun Records in 1956 after being urged by 
Johnny Cash. Elvis was leaving Sun and Phillips was looking to replace him. His first Sun recording, &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;, was a direct musical sound-a-like of Elvis&#x27;s early Sun recordings. He had some success at Sun but enjoyed his greatest success with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison&#x27;s singles reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40. He wrote or almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1960), &quot;Running Scared&quot; (1961), &quot;Crying&quot; (1961), &quot;In Dreams&quot; (1963) and &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; (1964).

After the mid-1960s Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies, and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s, following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he the Traveling Wilburys supergroup with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne. Orbison died of a heart attack that December at age 52. One month later, his song &quot;You Got It&quot; (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach both the US and UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.

Orbison&#x27;s honors include inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989 and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2014. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and five other Grammy Awards. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed him at number 37 on its list of the &quot;Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; and number 13 on its list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.
==Early life==
Orbison was born on April 23, 1936, in Vernon, Texas. He was the second of three sons born to Orbie Lee Orbison (1913–1984) and Nadine Vesta Shults (1914–1992). His father was an oil-field driller who struggled to find work after the Great Depression, and his mother enjoyed painting and writing poetry. Orbison’s direct paternal ancestry was traced to Thomas Orbison (born 1715) from Lurgan, Ireland, who settled in the Province of Pennsylvania in the middle of the 18th century. According to &quot;The Authorized Roy Orbison&quot;, a biography written by Orbison&#x27;s son Alex, the family moved to Fort Worth in 1942 to find work in the aircraft factories. Due to eyesight problems, Orbison wore thick glasses from the age of four.

Orbison&#x27;s father gave him a guitar on his sixth birthday and he was taught how to play it by his father and older brother. Orbison recalled, &quot;I was finished, you know, for anything else&quot; by the time he was 7, and music became the focus of his life. His major musical influence as a youth was country and western swing music. He was particularly moved by Lefty Frizzell&#x27;s singing, with its slurred syllables, leading Orbison to adopt the stage name &quot;Lefty Wilbury&quot; during his time with the Traveling Wilburys. He also enjoyed Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Moon Mullican and Jimmie Rodgers. One of the first musicians that he heard in person was Ernest Tubb, playing on the back of a truck in Fort Worth. Orbison also said that a formative experience was the regular singing sessions at Fort Worth, where he was surrounded by soldiers who were intensely emotional because they were about to be sent to the front line in World War II. In West Texas, he was exposed to rhythm and blues, western swing, Tex-Mex, the orchestral arrangements of Mantovani and Cajun music. The cajun favorite &quot;Jole Blon&quot; was one of the first songs that he sang in public. He began singing on a local radio show at age 8, and he became the show&#x27;s host by the late 1940s. At the age of 9, Orbison won a contest on radio station KVWC, which led to his own radio show where he sang the same songs every week. He attended Denver Avenue Elementary School in Fort Worth until a polio scare in 1944 prompted his parents to send Orbison (then aged 8) and his brother Grady Lee to Vernon to live with their grandmother. As World War II wound down, Roy&#x27;s parents returned to Vernon.

The Orbison family moved again in 1946, to Wink, Texas in search of employment. Orbison described life in Wink as &quot;football, oil fields, oil, grease, and sand&quot; and expressed relief that he was able to leave the desolate town. Orbison was self-conscious about his appearance and began dyeing his nearly-white hair black when he was still young. He was quiet, self-effacing, polite and obliging. During recess at school, he played guitar by himself while the other kids were playing physical games. As a teenager, Orbison&#x27;s lack of sporting ability left him with shyness and low self-esteem. He was always keen to sing, however, and considered his voice memorable, but not great.

==Career==
===1949–1955: &quot;Wink Westerners&quot;===
In 1949, Orbison (then 13 years old) formed the band &quot;Wink Westerners&quot; with school friends Billy Pat Ellis on drums, Slob Evans on bass fiddle, Richard West on piano and James Morrow on electric mandolin. They played country and western swing standards and Glenn Miller jazz swing songs at local honky-tonk bars and had a weekly morning radio show on KERB in Kermit, Texas. Their first performance was at a school assembly in 1953. They were offered $400 to play at a dance, and Orbison realized that he could make a living in music. Orbison was also part of a marching band and singing octet. At the age of 15, Orbison decided that instead of becoming a guitar player, he would use the guitar as an accompaniment to his singing.

In 1953 the Wink Westerners entered a talent contest on KMID-TV in Midland, Texas. The group won the contest, resulting in a 30-minute spot on a local television show. After the show, Orbison asked the owner of the company sponsoring the show if he could sponsor the group for ongoing shows, which led to the Wink Westerners playing weekly shows on KMID-TV on Friday nights and on Odessa television station KOSA-TV on Saturday nights. It was around this time that Orbison began dyeing his hair (naturally a &quot;dishwater grey color&quot;) to jet black.

After graduating from high school in 1954, Orbison enrolled at North Texas State College in Denton. His plan was to study geology so that he could secure work in the oil fields if music did not pay; however, he became bored with the course in its first year and switched to history and English. Orbison preferred to play music with fellow students Billy Pat Ellis, Dick Penner and Wade Moore. Penner and Moore had written a simple, catchy rockabilly song, &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;, which impressed Orbison and he started looking into how he could make a recording of it. Orbison continued performing with the Wink Westerners after his first year. He then heard that his schoolmate Pat Boone had signed a record deal, and it further strengthened his resolve to become a professional musician. At a New Year&#x27;s Eve dance in 1954, the Wink Westerners had mostly played country and western swing music throughout the night, but ended the night by playing Bill Haley &amp; the Comets’ hit song &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; repeatedly, which became the catalyst for the band switching to rock and roll music. Also, Orbison had seen Elvis Presley perform back during his days at North Texas State College in 1954 and was impressed by the shocking gyrations that Elvis exhibited on stage.

===1955–1956: The Teen Kings===

At the end of the spring semester of 1955, Orbison dropped out of North Texas State College, switching to Odessa Junior College. The Wink Westerners were disbanded in the fall of 1955 and Orbison formed a new band called The Teen Kings. The band was made of Orbison, Billy Pat Ellis and James Morrow from the Wink Westerners, plus Jack Kennelly on bass and Johnny Wilson. It was at a dance event where The Teen Kings performed that Orbison met his future wife Claudette Frady. Claudette was fourteen at the time, five years younger than Orbison.

The Teen Kings&#x27;s first recording was the song &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;, which was recorded at Norman Petty&#x27;s studio in Clovis, New Mexico in March 1956. It was published by Odessa-based start-up label Je–Wel as the B-side of the &quot;JE-WEL 101&quot; single. The A-side of the single was &quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get to You&quot;, a song previously recorded by Elvis Presley.

After &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; was published by Je-Wel Records, Orbison became convinced that a larger record company would be able to sell more copies of the record, and he spoke to a lawyer about breaking the contract with Je-Wel. Initially, Orbison obtained an injunction to prevent Je-Wel from distributing the record, before they reached an agreement that the band would pay back the label the costs of producing the records. Orbison was now free to find a new label to market Ooby Dooby; however, a further setback was that he cut a demo of the song for Columbia Records which they turned down but had one of their contract artists (Sid King) release a recording of &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; before Orbison could offer the tape to another record company.

Eventually, Sun Records would sign up to record &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;, but the events that led to this are disputed. Some claim that Johnny Cash toured the Odessa area in 1955 and 1956, appearing on the same local TV show as the Wink Westerners, Cash stated that &quot;in late &#x27;55 or early &#x27;56, I was touring with Elvis when I met Roy in Texas... I told him to get in touch with Sun Records if he wanted to be a recording artist&quot;. Orbison has said that when he did this, Sam Phillips (the owner of Sun Records) told him &quot;Johnny Cash doesn&#x27;t run my record company!&quot;. However, both Sam Philips and Billy Pat Ellis (the band&#x27;s drummer) have disputed that Johnny Cash was involved. Three of The Teen Kings&#x27;s band members have said that their relationship with Sun Records began when Odessa record store owner Poppa Holifield played it over the telephone for Sam Phillips in April 1956, and Phillips offered the Teen Kings a contract.

The Teen Kings went to Sun Studio in Memphis, to re-record &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; for publication by Sun Records. After an audition of the song, Sam Phillips signed the band up for &quot;a year or two&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s career soon slumped, since Orbison wanted to record emotional ballads rather than the rockabilly songs demanded by Sam Phillips, and Phillips&#x27;s goal for a successor to Elvis Presley had moved on from Orbison to Carl Perkins. The Teen Kings were granted a reprieve when Carl Perkins was badly injured in a car crash, resulting in &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; being released (along with &quot;Go Go Go&quot;) as Sun Single 242 in May 1956. The Teen Kings began an experimental tour of drive-in theaters in the southern U.S. states (playing on top of projection house roofs between drive-in film showings) with Sonny James, Johnny Horton, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Much influenced by Elvis Presley, Orbison performed frenetically, doing &quot;everything we could to get applause because we had only one hit record&quot;. Orbison also began writing songs in a rockabilly style, including &quot;Go! Go! Go!&quot; and &quot;Rockhouse&quot;. In June 1956, &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; peaked at number 59 in the Billboard charts and sold 200,000 copies, however the follow-up singles didn&#x27;t reach the charts.

The Teen Kings played alongside Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, Warren Smith and Eddie Bond at the Overton Park Shell on June 1, 1956, but Orbison&#x27;s relationship with the rest of the band was deteriorating at this stage. Elvis Presley was in the audience for this show and Orbison claimed that Elvis praised Orbison, but another band member says that it was actually Jack Kennelly (the band&#x27;s bass player) that Presley praised. Kennelly said that &quot;Roy&#x27;s dream was to be a star, and once Sam (Phillips) inflated his ego he couldn&#x27;t be a part of a unit. Roy became egomaniacal&quot;. In the summer of 1956, Orbison purchased a brand-new purple Cadillac and a diamond ring with his first royalty cheque from &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot;; however, the band soon found out that their pay cheques from the concerts were not covering their costs and that life as a touring band was a demoralizing experience. The band&#x27;s contract didn&#x27;t include any royalty payments (&quot;BMI&quot;) when their songs were played on the radio and Orbison had run out of money by late 1956. Orbison was encouraged by Norman Petty to record a single without The Teen Kings and the rest of the band walked on Roy during a recording session when told of a plan to rename the band &quot;Roy Orbison and The Teen Kings&quot;. The band broke up in December 1956 and Sam Phillips said they were arguing about money but the basic problem was that Orbison was too much of a loner and driven egoist. The lack of a band was a serious problem for Orbison&#x27;s contract at Sun Records, since the label had no use for a singer who didn&#x27;t have a band.

===1956–1959: Solo work and Acuff-Rose Music===
After The Teen Kings split, Orbison stayed in Memphis with his girlfriend Claudette. They stayed in Phillips&#x27; home, and Phillips stated that they didn&#x27;t sleep together in his house. However, Orbison was broke and realized that he couldn&#x27;t survive as a recording artist, so after several weeks he returned to the road. He toured with Johnny Cash, Sonny Burgess, Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, playing mostly songs from other artists before finishing the set with a song of his own. At the time, Orbison was addicted to sleeping pills and speed. Orbison was introduced to Elvis Presley&#x27;s social circle, and at some stage picked up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac.

In August 1957, Orbison returned to the Sun Recording Studio and recorded several new songs with just his acoustic guitar instead of a backing band. However, none were successful and Roy gave up on becoming a recording artist. Sam Phillips remembered being much more impressed with Orbison&#x27;s mastery of the guitar than with his voice. Orbison returned to Odessa, Texas in the fall of 1957 to be together with his sixteen-year-old girlfriend, Claudette. The two began to talk about getting married. On a professional level, Orbison met singer Joe Melson while in Memphis, who would collaborate with Orbison on his biggest hit songs in the early 1960s.

A ballad Orbison wrote, &quot;The Clown&quot;, met with a lukewarm response; after hearing it, Sun Records producer Jack Clement told Orbison that he would never make it as a ballad singer. Nonetheless, he continued to pitch his ballad &quot;Claudette&quot; (which he began working on in early 1956) to singers he met on tour and in April 1958 The Everly Brothers recorded it as the B-side of their hit &quot;All I Have to Do Is Dream&quot;. &quot;Claudette&quot; reached number 30 in the charts in March 1959. Orbison then left Sun Records, due to a dispute about royalties from &quot;Claudette&quot; (which was recorded by Nashville Records). Orbison and Claudette had married in 1957 and their first child was born on September 16, 1958. Using the royalty payments from The Everly Brothers hit &quot;Claudette&quot;, Orbison bought the most expensive new pink Cadillac available. However, Roy and Claudette spent the money lavishly and were soon broke and living with Roy&#x27;s parents in Wink.

Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas and then quit performing for seven months in 1958.

During the period of 1958–1959, Orbison made his living at Acuff-Rose Music, a songwriting firm concentrating mainly on country music. After spending an entire day writing a song, he would make several demonstration tapes at a time and send them to Wesley Rose, who would try to find musical acts to record them. Orbison then worked with, and was in awe of, Chet Atkins (who had played guitar with Presley) and attempted to sell his recordings of songs by other writers to the RCA Victor record label. One of these songs was &quot;Seems to Me&quot;, by Boudleaux Bryant. Bryant&#x27;s impression of Orbison was of &quot;a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene. I remember the way he sang then—softly, prettily but almost bashfully, as if someone might be disturbed by his efforts and reprimand him.&quot;

Playing shows at night and living with his wife and young child in a tiny apartment, Orbison often took his guitar to his car to write songs. The songwriter Joe Melson, an acquaintance of Orbison&#x27;s, tapped on his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to write some songs together. In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison recorded seven songs for RCA Victor at their Nashville studios; only two singles (&quot;Paper Boy&quot; and &quot;With the Bug&quot;) were judged worthy of release by the label. Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of the producer Fred Foster at Monument Records, the record label that Orbison would soon switch to.

=== 1960–1964: Monument Records and stardom ===
====Early singles====
In his first session for Monument in Nashville, Orbison recorded a song that RCA Victor had refused, &quot;Paper Boy&quot;. It was accompanied by the B-side sing &quot;With the Bug&quot;, but neither song charted.

Orbison&#x27;s own style, the sound created at RCA Victor Studio B in Nashville with pioneer engineer Bill Porter, the production by Foster, and the accompanying musicians gave Orbison&#x27;s music a &quot;polished, professional sound... finally allowing Orbison&#x27;s stylistic inclinations free rein&quot;. Orbison requested to use string instruments instead of fiddles, which was unusual for the time. He recorded three new songs, the most notable of which was &quot;Uptown&quot;, written with Joe Melson and released in late 1959. Impressed with the results, Melson later recalled, &quot;We stood in the studio, listening to the playbacks, and thought it was the most beautiful sound in the world.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll&quot; states that the music Orbison made in Nashville &quot;brought a new splendour to rock&quot;, and compared the melodramatic effects of the orchestral accompaniment to the musical productions of Phil Spector.

&quot;Uptown&quot; was a modest hit and the first song by Orbison and Melson to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100. His initial success came just as the 1950s rock-and-roll era was winding down. Starting in 1960, the charts in the United States came to be dominated by teen idols, novelty acts, and Motown girl groups.

====&quot;Only the Lonely&quot;====
Experimenting with a new sound, Orbison and Joe Melson wrote a song in early 1960 which, using elements from &quot;Uptown&quot;, and another song they had written called &quot;Come Back to Me (My Love)&quot;, employed strings and the Anita Kerr doo-wop backing singers. It also featured a note hit by Orbison in falsetto that showcased a powerful voice which, according to biographer Clayson, &quot;came not from his throat but deeper within&quot;. The song was &quot;Only the Lonely (Know the Way I Feel)&quot;. Orbison was passing through Memphis when he tried to pitch the song to Elvis Presley (along with several other songs) in order to make some money quickly, but it was early in the morning and Presley did not want to see Orbison at that time. Orbison and Melson instead recorded the song at RCA Victor&#x27;s Nashville studio, with sound engineer Bill Porter trying a completely new strategy, building the mix from the top down rather than from the bottom up, beginning with close-miked backing vocals in the foreground, and ending with the rhythm section soft in the background. This combination became Orbison&#x27;s trademark sound.

&quot;Only the Lonely&quot; shot to number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and hit number one in the UK and Australia. According to Orbison, the subsequent songs he wrote with Melson during this period were constructed with his voice in mind, specifically to showcase its range and power. He told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1988, &quot;I liked the sound of [my voice]. I liked making it sing, making the voice ring, and I just kept doing it. And I think that somewhere between the time of &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; and &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;, it kind of turned into a good voice.&quot; But at the time of its recording, Orbison was struggling to earn a living, because he was only working as a singer at local dances. Also the days of his working with Melson were numbered, due to disagreements such as who came up with the title for &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;. The success of &quot;Only The Lonely&quot; transformed Orbison into an overnight star and he appeared on Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Beechnut Show&quot; out of New York City. When Presley heard &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; for the first time, he bought a box of copies to pass to his friends.

====Move to Nashville====
Soon after recording an early version of his next hit &quot;Blue Angel&quot;, Orbison and his wife and son (Roy DeWayne, born in 1958) moved from Wink to the suburb of Hendersonville in Nashville. Orbison&#x27;s second son, Anthony King, would follow in 1962. Melson also moved to Hendersonville soon after, and began working on &quot;Blue Angel&quot; together, which was recorded in August 1960. This hit was a more complex song, yet it still peaked at number nine in the USA. The follow-up single &quot;I&#x27;m Hurtin&#x27;&quot; (with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot; as the B-side) rose to number 27 in the US, but failed to chart in the UK. After the success of &quot;Blue Angel&quot;, Orbison undertook a hectic touring schedule, often performing with his neighbor Patsy Cline. During this time, Claudette was lonely and unhappy, and some people said that Orbison was unfaithful to her while he was on tour.

Back in the studio, seeking a change from the pop sound of &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;, &quot;Blue Angel&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Hurtin&#x27;&quot;, Orbison worked on a new song, &quot;Running Scared&quot;, about a man worried that his girlfriend is about to leave him for another man. Orbison encountered difficulty when he found himself unable to hit the song&#x27;s highest note without his voice breaking. He was backed by an orchestra in the studio, and Porter told him he would have to sing louder than his accompaniment because the orchestra was unable to be softer than his voice. Fred Foster then put Orbison in the corner of the studio and surrounded him with coat racks forming an improvised isolation booth to emphasize his voice. Orbison was unhappy with the first two takes. In the third, however, he abandoned the idea of using falsetto and sang the final high &#x27;A&#x27; naturally, so astonishing everyone present that the accompanying musicians stopped playing. On that third take, &quot;Running Scared&quot; was completed. Fred Foster later recalled, &quot;He did it, and everybody looked around in amazement. Nobody had heard anything like it before.&quot; Just weeks later &quot;Running Scared&quot; became Orbison&#x27;s first number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and it reached number 9 in the UK. The composition of Orbison&#x27;s following hits reflected &quot;Running Scared&quot;: a story about an emotionally vulnerable man facing loss or grief, with a crescendo culminating in a surprise climax that employed Orbison&#x27;s dynamic voice.

The B-side &quot;Crying&quot; followed soon after and reached the top 5 singles in August 1961. &quot;Crying&quot; was coupled with an up-tempo R&amp;B song, &quot;Candy Man&quot;, written by Fred Neil and Beverley Ross, which reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 30, staying on the charts for two months. By the end of 1961, Orbison had recorded six hit singles in a row over the past two years. While Orbison was touring Australia in 1962, an Australian DJ referred to him affectionately as &quot;The Big O&quot;, partly based on the big finishes to his dramatic ballads, and the moniker stuck with him thereafter. Orbison&#x27;s second son was born the same year, and Orbison hit number four in the United States and number two in the UK with &quot;Dream Baby (How Long Must I Dream)&quot;, an upbeat song by country songwriter Cindy Walker. Orbison enlisted The Webbs, from Dothan, Alabama, as his backing band. The band changed their names to &quot;The Candy Men&quot; (in reference to Roy&#x27;s hit) and played with Orbison from 1962 to 1967. They later went on to have their own career, releasing a few singles and two albums on their own. Also in 1962, he charted with &quot;The Crowd&quot;, &quot;Leah&quot; and &quot;Workin&#x27; for the Man&quot;, which he wrote about working one summer in the oil fields near Wink. Orbison&#x27;s relationship with Joe Melson, however, was deteriorating, over Melson&#x27;s growing concerns that his own solo career would never get off the ground.

Orbison first met Bob Dylan at Dylan&#x27;s 21st birthday party in May 1962.

From 1959 to 1963, Orbison was the top selling American artist and one of the world’s biggest names in music.

====&quot;In Dreams&quot; and international tours====
Orbison&#x27;s string of top-40 hits continued with &quot;In Dreams&quot; (US number 7 in January 1963, UK number 6), &quot;Falling&quot; (US number 22, UK number 9) and &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot; (US number 5, UK number 3) coupled with &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; (US number 29, UK number 3). According to the discography in &quot;The Authorized Roy Orbison&quot;, a rare alternative version of &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; was released in Italy. Orbison finished 1963 with a Christmas song written by Willie Nelson, &quot;Pretty Paper&quot; (US number 15 in 1963, UK number six in 1964).

As &quot;In Dreams&quot; was released in April 1963, Orbison was asked to replace Duane Eddy on a tour of the UK in top billing with the Beatles. The tour sold out in one afternoon. When Orbison arrived in Britain, however, he realized he was no longer the main draw. He had never heard of the Beatles, and annoyed, asked rhetorically, &quot;What&#x27;s a Beatle, anyway?&quot; to which John Lennon replied, after tapping his shoulder, &quot;I am&quot;. On the opening night, Orbison opted to go onstage first, although he was the more established act. The Beatles stood dumbfounded backstage as Orbison simply played through 14 encores. Finally, when the audience began chanting &quot;We want Roy!&quot; again, Lennon and Paul McCartney physically held Orbison back. Ringo Starr later said, &quot;In Glasgow, we were all backstage listening to the tremendous applause he was getting. He was just standing there, not moving or anything.&quot; Through the tour, however, the two acts quickly learned to get along, a process made easier by the fact that the Beatles admired his work. Orbison felt a kinship with Lennon, but it was George Harrison with whom he would later form a strong friendship.

In 1963, touring took a toll on Orbison&#x27;s personal life. After discovering a letter from one of Orbison&#x27;s secret girlfriends, his wife Claudette had an affair with the builder of their home in Tennessee. Billy Pat Ellis said &quot;Claudette had the affair because Roy was gone a lot and she got lonely and wanted to prove she was attractive again&quot;. When Orbison toured Britain again in the autumn of 1963, she joined him. 

Later in 1963, Orbison toured England, Ireland and Canada. In 1964, he toured Australia and New Zealand with the Beach Boys and returned again to Britain and Ireland, where he was so besieged by teenaged girls that the Irish police had to halt his performances to pull the girls off him. He traveled to Australia again in 1965, this time with the Rolling Stones. Mick Jagger later remarked, referring to a snapshot he took of Orbison in New Zealand, &quot;a fine figure of a man in the hot springs, he was.&quot;

====&quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;====
Orbison also began collaborating with Bill Dees, whom he had known in Texas. With Dees, he wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, a number-one hit in the UK and Orbison&#x27;s most successful song. When Claudette walked in the room where Dees and Orbison were writing to say she was heading for Nashville, Orbison asked if she had any money. Dees said, &quot;A pretty woman never needs any money&quot;. Just 40 minutes later, &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; was completed. A riff-laden masterpiece that employed a playful growl he got from a Bob Hope movie, the epithet &quot;mercy&quot; Orbison uttered when he was unable to hit a note, it rose to number one in the autumn of 1964 in the United States and stayed on the charts for 14 weeks. It rose to number one in the UK, as well, spending a total of 18 weeks on the charts. The single sold over seven million copies. Orbison&#x27;s success was greater in Britain; as &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine noted, &quot;In a 68-week period that began on August 8, 1963, Roy Orbison was the &quot;only&quot; American artist to have a number-one single in Britain. He did it twice, with &#x27;It&#x27;s Over&#x27; on June 25, 1964, and &#x27;Oh, Pretty Woman&#x27; on October 8, 1964. The latter song also went to number one in America, making Orbison impervious to the current chart dominance of British artists on both sides of the Atlantic.&quot;

===1965–1969: Career decline and tragedies===

By late 1964, Orbison had &quot;occasionally treated himself to a groupie&quot; and his wife Claudette had had an affair with the builder Braxton Dixon, who had built Orbison&#x27;s house. After Roy became aware of the affair, he fired Dixon and finished building the house himself (with the help of a hired carpenter). In early 1965, Roy confirmed that he and Claudette were divorced. Later in 1965, Claudette gave birth to Roy&#x27;s third child, and Roy and Claudette re-united several months later.

Orbison&#x27;s singles in early 1965 had been unsuccessful and his contract with Monument was expiring soon. Wesley Rose, at this time acting as Orbison&#x27;s agent, moved him from Monument Records to MGM Records (though in Europe he remained with Decca&#x27;s London Records) for $1 million and with the understanding that he would expand into television and films, as Elvis Presley had done. Orbison was a film enthusiast, and when not touring, writing, or recording, he dedicated time to seeing up to three films a day. The move was described as Orbison &quot;joining the ranks of fading rock stars fleeing to MGM&quot;.

Rose also became Orbison&#x27;s producer. Fred Foster later suggested that Rose&#x27;s takeover was responsible for the commercial failure of Orbison&#x27;s work at MGM. Engineer Bill Porter agreed that Orbison&#x27;s best work could only be achieved with RCA Victor&#x27;s A-Team in Nashville. Orbison&#x27;s first collection at MGM, an album titled &quot;There Is Only One Roy Orbison&quot;, sold fewer than 200,000 copies. With the onset of the British Invasion in 1964–65, the direction of popular music shifted dramatically, and most performers of Orbison&#x27;s generation (Orbison was 28 in 1964) were driven from the charts. The contractual requirement to release a certain amount of singles and albums per year for MGM also took its toll on the quality of Orbison&#x27;s songs.

Orbison was fascinated with machines. He was known to follow a car that he liked and make the driver an offer on the spot. While on tour again in the UK in 1966, Orbison broke his foot falling off a motorcycle in front of thousands of screaming fans at a race track; he performed his show that evening in a cast. Claudette traveled to Britain to accompany Roy for the remainder of the tour. It was now made public that the couple had happily remarried and were back together (they had remarried in December 1965).

Roy and Claudette shared a love for motorcycles after Roy had been introduced to them by Elvis Presley. Orbison was a daredevil driver, blasting around on his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and owning a Ferrari car, which he used to challenge other drivers to race him on the highway. On June 6, 1966, when Orbison and Claudette were both riding their motorcycles home from Bristol, Tennessee, she was struck by a pickup truck in Gallatin, Tennessee and thrown into the air. She was taken by ambulance to hospital, but her liver was seriously injured and she died, aged 25.

A grieving Orbison threw himself into his work, collaborating with Bill Dees to write music for &quot;The Fastest Guitar Alive&quot;, a film that MGM had scheduled for him to star in as well. It was initially planned as a dramatic Western but was rewritten as a comedy. Orbison&#x27;s character was a spy who stole and had to protect and deliver a cache of gold to the Confederate Army during the American Civil War and was supplied with a guitar that turned into a rifle. The prop allowed him to deliver the line &quot;I could kill you with this and play your funeral march at the same time&quot;, with, according to biographer Colin Escott, &quot;zero conviction&quot;. Orbison was pleased with the film, although it proved to be a critical and box-office failure. While MGM had included five films in his contract, no more were made.

He recorded an album dedicated to the songs of Don Gibson and another of Hank Williams covers, but both sold poorly. During the counterculture era, with the charts dominated by artists like Jimi Hendrix, Jefferson Airplane, the Rolling Stones, and the Doors, Orbison lost mainstream appeal, yet seemed confident that this would return, later saying: &quot;[I] didn&#x27;t hear a lot I could relate to, so I kind of stood there like a tree where the winds blow and the seasons change, and you&#x27;re still there and you bloom again.&quot; Orbison&#x27;s single &quot;Cry Softly Lonely One&quot; from March 1967 was his last song to enter the Top 100 until the 1980s.

During a tour of Britain and playing Birmingham on Saturday, September 14, 1968, he received the news that his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, had burned down, and his two eldest sons had died. This occurred two years after the death of his wife Claudette and Orbison&#x27;s grief meant he couldn&#x27;t write songs. Fire officials stated that the cause of the fire may have been an aerosol can, which possibly contained lacquer. The property was sold to Johnny Cash, whose house at the same location also burned down later.

During the 1968 tour of England, Orbison and his childhood friend Bobby Blackburn slept with many girls over the course of two months, and used a calendar on the wall to track when each girl was arriving and leaving their rented apartment in Upper Brook Street in London. During this time, Orbison met the sixteen year-old German girl Barbara Wellhonen, with whom he became fascinated, although Orbison continued to see other girls in the meantime. On May 25, 1969, Orbison and Wellhonen got married. Roy was 33 years old at the time, and sources vary regarding whether Wellhonen was either 17, 18 or 19. Wesley (born 1965), his youngest son with Claudette, was raised by Orbison&#x27;s parents. Orbison and Wellhonen had a son (Roy Kelton) in 1970 and another (Alexander) in 1975.

===1970s: Struggles===
Orbison continued recording albums in the 1970s, but his career stagnated during this decade. In 1974 he switched record labels from MGM to Mercury Records for a one-album deal. Although the peak of his success was over, his single &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was number one in Australia for many weeks and &quot;Too Soon to Know&quot; reached number 3 in England. His fortunes sank so low in America that his concerts were mostly empty, such as the concert at Cincinnati Gardens that he played on his fortieth birthday in April 1976. Peter Lehman observed that Orbison&#x27;s absence was a part of the mystery of his persona: &quot;Since it was never clear where he had come from, no one seemed to pay much mind to where he had gone; he was just gone.&quot; However, several artists released popular covers of his songs. Orbison&#x27;s version of &quot;Love Hurts&quot; was remade by Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris, again by hard rock band Nazareth, and by Jim Capaldi. Sonny James&#x27; version of &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; reached number one on the country music charts. Bruce Springsteen ended his concerts with Orbison songs, and Glen Campbell had a minor hit with a remake of &quot;Dream Baby&quot;.

A compilation of Orbison&#x27;s greatest hits reached number one in the UK in January 1976, and Orbison began to open concerts that year for the Eagles, who had started as Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s backup band. Ronstadt covered &quot;Blue Bayou&quot; in 1977, her version reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and remaining in the charts for 24 weeks. Orbison credited this cover in particular for reviving his memory in the popular mind, if not his career. He signed again with Monument in 1976 and recorded &quot;Regeneration&quot; with Fred Foster, but it proved no more successful than before.

In late 1977, Orbison was not feeling well and decided to spend the winter in Hawaii. He checked in to a hospital there, where testing discovered that he had severely obstructed coronary arteries and was barely alive. Orbison underwent open-heart surgery on January 18, 1978. He had suffered from duodenal ulcers since 1960 and had been a heavy smoker since adolescence. Orbison said he felt rejuvenated after the procedure; however, he continued to smoke cigarettes, despite the advice of his doctor.

=== 1980–1988: Revival and Traveling Wilburys ===

In 1980, Don McLean recorded a cover of Orbison&#x27;s 1961 hit single &quot;Crying&quot; and it went to the top of the charts, first in the Netherlands then reaching number five in the US and staying on the charts for 15 weeks; it was number one in the UK for three weeks and also topped the Irish Charts. In 1981 he performed &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; on an episode of &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;. Orbison was all but forgotten in the US, yet he reached popularity in less likely places such as Bulgaria in 1982. He was astonished to find that he was as popular there as he had been in 1964, and he was forced to stay in his hotel room because he was mobbed on the streets of Sofia. In 1981, he and Emmylou Harris won a Grammy Award for their duet &quot;That Lovin&#x27; You Feelin&#x27; Again&quot; from the comedy film &quot;Roadie&quot; (in which Orbison also played a cameo role), and things were picking up. It was Orbison&#x27;s first Grammy, and he felt hopeful of making a full return to popular music, In the meantime, Van Halen released a hard-rock cover of &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; on their 1982 album &quot;Diver Down&quot;, further exposing a younger generation to Orbison&#x27;s music.

Orbison, his wife and two oldest children moved from Nashville to Malibu in 1986. Following the move, Orbison&#x27;s involvement with the Los Angeles creative community proved to be very important for him.

It has been alleged that Orbison originally declined David Lynch&#x27;s request to allow the use of &quot;In Dreams&quot; for the film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; (1986), although Lynch has stated to the contrary that he and his producers obtained permission to use the song without speaking to Orbison in the first place. Lynch&#x27;s first choice for a song had actually been &quot;Crying&quot;; the song served as one of several obsessions of psychopath Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). It was lip-synched by Ben (Dean Stockwell), Booth&#x27;s drug dealer boss, using an industrial work light as a pretend microphone, lighting his face. In later scenes, Booth demands the song be played repeatedly; also wanting the song while beating the protagonist. During filming, Lynch would also sit his cast down every few hours and ask them to listen to the song. Orbison was initially shocked at its use: he saw the film in a theater in Malibu and later said, &quot;I was mortified because they were talking about the &#x27;candy-colored clown&#x27; in relation to a dope deal ... I thought, &#x27;What in the world ...?&#x27; But later, when I was touring, we got the video out and I really got to appreciate what David gave to the song, and what the song gave to the movie—how it achieved this otherworldly quality that added a whole new dimension to &#x27;In Dreams&#x27;.&quot; The use of &quot;In Dreams&quot; in the film greatly helped Orbison&#x27;s comeback.

In 1987, Orbison released an album of re-recorded hits titled &quot;In Dreams: The Greatest Hits&quot;. &quot;Life Fades Away&quot;, a song he co-wrote with his friend Glenn Danzig and recorded, was featured in the film &quot;Less than Zero&quot; (1987). He and k.d. lang performed a duet of &quot;Crying&quot; for inclusion on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Hiding Out&quot; (1987); the pair received a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals after Orbison&#x27;s death.

Also in 1987, Orbison was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and was initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album &quot;Born to Run&quot;: &quot;I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison.&quot; In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt &quot;validated&quot; by the honor. After the awards, Orbison signed with Virgin Records, who immediately released a &quot;greatest hits&quot; album and began preparing for an album of new songs.

A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, JD Souther, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: &quot;Roy looked at all of us and said, &#x27;If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me&#x27;. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional.&quot; The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night&quot;; it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies. The concert is considered a landmark in Orbison&#x27;s career.

The creation of the world&#x27;s most recognized supergroup, Traveling Wilburys began in 1987 when Orbison began collaborating seriously with Electric Light Orchestra bandleader Jeff Lynne on a new album. Lynne had just completed production work on George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; album, and all three ate lunch together one day when Orbison accepted an invitation to sing on Harrison&#x27;s new single. They subsequently contacted Bob Dylan, who, in turn, allowed them to use a recording studio in his home. Along the way, Harrison made a quick visit to Tom Petty&#x27;s residence to obtain his guitar; Petty and his band had backed Dylan on his last tour. By that evening, the group had written &quot;Handle with Care&quot;, which led to the concept of recording an entire album. They called themselves the Traveling Wilburys, representing themselves as half-brothers with the same father. They gave themselves stage names; Orbison chose his from his musical hero, calling himself &quot;Lefty Wilbury&quot; after Lefty Frizzell. Expanding on the concept of a traveling band of raucous musicians, Orbison offered a quote about the group&#x27;s foundation in honor: &quot;Some people say Daddy was a cad and a bounder. I remember him as a Baptist minister.&quot;

Lynne later spoke of the recording sessions: &quot;Everybody just sat there going, &#x27;Wow, it&#x27;s Roy Orbison!&#x27; ... Even though he&#x27;s become your pal and you&#x27;re hanging out and having a laugh and going to dinner, as soon as he gets behind that [mic] and he&#x27;s doing his business, suddenly it&#x27;s shudder time.&quot; The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot; (1988), was released on October 25, 1988. Orbison was given one solo track, &quot;Not Alone Any More&quot;, on the album. His contributions were highly praised by the press.
Orbison determinedly pursued his second chance at stardom, but he expressed amazement at his success: &quot;It&#x27;s very nice to be wanted again, but I still can&#x27;t quite believe it.&quot; He lost some weight to fit his new image and the constant demand of touring, as well as the newer demands of making videos. In the final three months of his life, he gave &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine extensive access to his daily activities; he intended to write an autobiography and wanted Martin Sheen to play him in a biopic.

Orbison completed a solo comeback album, &quot;Mystery Girl&quot;, in November 1988. &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was co-produced by Jeff Lynne. Orbison considered Lynne to be the best producer with whom he had ever collaborated. Elvis Costello, Bono, Orbison&#x27;s son Wesley and others offered their songs to him.

Around November 1988, Orbison confided in Johnny Cash that he was having chest pains. Orbison traveled to Europe and received an award at the Diamond Awards festival in Antwerp, where footage for the video for &quot;You Got It&quot; was filmed. He gave several interviews a day in a hectic schedule and became ill with a blinding headache during the final interview. A few days later, a manager at a club in Boston was concerned that he looked ill, but Orbison played the show to a standing ovation.

==Death==
Orbison performed at the Front Row Theater in Highland Heights, Ohio, on December 4, 1988. Exhausted, he returned to his home in Hendersonville to rest for several days before flying again to London to film two more videos for the Traveling Wilburys. He was also booked in to tour the U.S. and Europe in the following year.

On December 6, 1988, he spent the day buying parts for model airplanes with his bus driver and friend Benny Birchfield and ate supper at Birchfield&#x27;s home in Hendersonville (Birchfield was married to country star Jean Shepard). After the meal, Orbison went to his mother&#x27;s house and chatted with his son Wesley. He went to the bathroom, but did not return for 30 minutes. He was found collapsed on the bathroom floor and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance, where he died of a heart attack at the age of 52.

A public memorial attended by friends, family and fans was organized by friend Jean Shepard and held at the College Heights Baptist Church in Gallatin, Tennessee on December 11. In Los Angeles, Barbara Orbison organized a &quot;Celebration of Life&quot; attended by friends and celebrities at the Wiltern Theatre on December 13. Orbison&#x27;s body was buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in an unmarked grave.

==Posthumous career==
Orbison&#x27;s posthumous album &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was released by Virgin Records on January 31, 1989 and became the highest selling album of his career. The biggest hit from &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was &quot;You Got It&quot;, written with Lynne and Tom Petty. &quot;You Got It&quot; rose to No. 9 in the US and No. 3 in the UK. The song earned Orbison a posthumous Grammy Award nomination. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Mystery Girl cloaks the epic sweep and grandeur of his classic sound in meticulous, modern production—the album encapsulates everything that made Orbison great, and for that reason it makes a fitting valedictory&quot;.

&quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot; spent 53 weeks on the US charts, peaking at number three. It reached No. 1 in Australia and No. 16 in the UK. The album won a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in the top 100 albums of the decade.

On April 8, 1989, Orbison became the first deceased musician since Elvis Presley to have two albums in the US Top Five at the same time, with &quot;Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1&quot; at number 4 and his own &quot;Mystery Girl&quot; at number 5. In the United Kingdom, he achieved even greater posthumous success, with two solo albums in the Top 3 on February 11, 1989 (&quot;Mystery Girl&quot; was number 2 and the compilation &quot;The Legendary Roy Orbison&quot; was number 3).

Although the video for the Traveling Wilburys&#x27; &quot;Handle with Care&quot; was filmed with Orbison, the video for &quot;End of the Line&quot; was filmed and released posthumously. During Orbison&#x27;s vocal solo parts in &quot;End of the Line&quot;, the video shows Orbison&#x27;s guitar in a rocking chair next to Orbison&#x27;s framed photo.

On October 20, 1992, &quot;King of Hearts&quot;—another album of Orbison songs—was released. In 1996 the album &quot;The Very Best of Roy Orbison&quot; documented his entire career. Roy&#x27;s wife Barbara managed his estate and released albums through the &quot;Roy Orbison Enterprises&quot; company. Following Barbara&#x27;s death in December 2011, the company management was taken over by Roy&#x27;s sons Alex and Roy Kelton Jr.

In 2014, a demo of Orbison&#x27;s &quot;The Way Is Love&quot; was released as part of the 25th-anniversary deluxe edition of &quot;Mystery Girl&quot;. The song was originally recorded on a stereo cassette player around 1986. Orbison&#x27;s sons contributed instrumentation on the track along with Orbison&#x27;s vocals; it was produced by John Carter Cash.

==Public image==

Orbison eventually developed an image that did not reflect his personality. He had no publicist in the early 1960s, and therefore had little presence in fan magazines, and his single sleeves did not feature his picture. &quot;Life&quot; called him an &quot;anonymous celebrity&quot;. After leaving his thick eyeglasses on an airplane in 1963, Orbison was forced to wear his prescription Faosa sunglasses on stage and found that he preferred them. The sunglasses led some people to assume he was blind. His black clothes and song lyrics emphasized the image of mystery and introversion. Orbison later recalled that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t trying to be weird ... I didn&#x27;t have a manager who told me to dress or how to present myself or anything, but the image developed of a man of mystery and a quiet man in black somewhat of a recluse, although I never was, really.&quot;

==Style and legacy==
Rock and roll in the 1950s was defined by a driving backbeat, heavy guitars, and lyrical themes that glorified youthful rebellion. Few of Orbison&#x27;s recordings have these characteristics. The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll. Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, &quot;He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.&quot; Orbison was known as &quot;the Caruso of Rock&quot; and &quot;the Big O&quot;.

Roy&#x27;s Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison&#x27;s sons to administer their father&#x27;s catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018, release of &quot;Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra&quot; album as well as an autumn 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called &quot;In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert&quot;.

===Song structures===
Music critic Dave Marsh wrote that Orbison&#x27;s compositions &quot;define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music&quot;. Orbison&#x27;s music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair&#x27;s breadth of being weird. Peter Watrous, writing for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, declared in a concert review, &quot;He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity&quot;.

In the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together. The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard 32-bar form for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like &quot;Ooby Dooby&quot; and &quot;Claudette&quot;. Orbison&#x27;s &quot;In Dreams&quot; was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In &quot;Running Scared&quot;, however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. &quot;Crying&quot; is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B&#x27;-C&#x27;-D&#x27;-E&#x27;-F&#x27;. Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before &quot;Only the Lonely&quot;, he claimed never to have learned how to write them:

Elton John&#x27;s songwriting partner and main lyricist Bernie Taupin wrote that Orbison&#x27;s songs always made &quot;radical left turns&quot;, and k.d. lang declared that good songwriting comes from being constantly surprised, such as how the entirety of &quot;Running Scared&quot; eventually depends on the final note, one word. Some of the musicians who worked with Orbison were confounded by what he asked them to do. The Nashville session guitarist Jerry Kennedy stated, &quot;Roy went against the grain. The first time you&#x27;d hear something, it wouldn&#x27;t sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.&quot;

===Lyrical themes===
Critic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison&#x27;s ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as &quot;Go! Go! Go!&quot; and &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot; that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine braggadocio. In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.

In 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison&#x27;s biography published in a CD box set: &quot;Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that&#x27;s easy—try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.&quot; After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Orbison&#x27;s songs are &quot;dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces&quot;. Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the &quot;apocalyptic romanticism&quot; in Orbison&#x27;s music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was &quot;so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia&quot;, striking &quot;a post-modern nerve&quot;. Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant favored American R&amp;B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: &quot;The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.&quot;

The loneliness in Orbison&#x27;s songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve been any more lonely than anyone else ... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.&quot; His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees stated, &quot;He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things ... Before that no one would do it.&quot; Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: &quot;When [&quot;Crying&quot;] came out I don&#x27;t think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.&quot;

===Voice quality===
Orbison admitted that he did not think his voice was put to appropriate use until &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; in 1960, when it was able, in his words, to allow its &quot;flowering&quot;. Carl Perkins, however, toured with Orbison while they were both signed with Sun Records and recalled a specific concert when Orbison covered the Nelson Eddy and Jeanette MacDonald standard &quot;Indian Love Call&quot;, and had the audience completely silenced, in awe. When compared to The Everly Brothers, who often used the same session musicians, Orbison is credited with &quot;a passionate intensity&quot; that, according to &quot;The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock and Roll&quot;, made &quot;his love, his life, and, indeed, the whole world [seem] to be coming to an end—not with a whimper, but an agonised, beautiful bang&quot;.

Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel both commented on the otherworldly quality of Orbison&#x27;s voice. Dwight Yoakam stated that Orbison&#x27;s voice sounded like &quot;the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window&quot;. Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees went further to say that when he heard &quot;Crying&quot; for the first time, &quot;That was it. To me that was the voice of God.&quot; Elvis Presley stated Orbison&#x27;s voice was the greatest and most distinctive he had ever heard. Orbison&#x27;s music and voice have been compared to opera by Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, and songwriter Will Jennings, among others. Dylan marked Orbison as a specific influence, remarking that there was nothing like him on radio in the early 1960s:

Likewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison&#x27;s voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with &quot;Crying&quot; and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: &quot;The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up. It was an incredible physical sensation.&quot; Bassist Jerry Scheff, who backed Orbison in his &quot;A Black and White Night&quot; concert, wrote about him, &quot;Roy Orbison was like an opera singer. His voice melted out of his mouth into the stratosphere and back. He never seemed like he was trying to sing, he just did it.&quot;

His voice ranged from baritone to tenor, and music scholars have suggested that he had a three- or four-octave range.

Orbison&#x27;s severe stage fright was particularly noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During the first few songs in a concert, the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable. This also happened with age. Orbison noticed that he was unable to control the tremor in the late afternoon and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.

===Live performances===

Orbison often excused his motionless performances by saying that his songs did not allow instrumental sections so he could move or dance on stage, although songs like &quot;Mean Woman Blues&quot; did offer that. He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, &quot;I&#x27;m not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second-rate shows and they&#x27;d still shine through, but not me. I&#x27;d have to be prepared. People come to hear my music, my songs. That&#x27;s what I have to give them.&quot;

k.d. lang compared Orbison to a tree, with passive but solid beauty. This image of Orbison as immovable was so associated with him it was parodied by John Belushi on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, as Belushi dressed as Orbison falls over while singing &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;, and continues to play as his bandmates set him upright again. However, Lang quantified this style by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s so hard to explain what Roy&#x27;s energy was like because he would fill a room with his energy and presence, but not say a word. Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.&quot;

Orbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings playing the driving rhythm of western swing, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily with him. Orbison later reflected, &quot;I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it&#x27;s still there. That sense of &#x27;do it for all it&#x27;s worth and do it now and do it good.&#x27; Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.&quot;

<doc id="26553" wikidata="Q185652" url="?curid=26553" title="Ragtime">
<text>Ragtime, also spelled rag-time or rag time, is a musical style that had its peak from the 1890s to 1910s. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated or &quot;ragged&quot; rhythm. Ragtime was popularized during the early 20th century by composers such as Scott Joplin, James Scott, and Joseph Lamb. Ragtime pieces (often called &quot;rags&quot;) are typically composed for and performed on piano, though the genre has been adapted for a variety of instruments and styles.

Ragtime music originated within African American communities in the late 19th century and became a distinctly American form of popular music. It is closely related to marches. Ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, often arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. Scott Joplin, known as the &quot;King of Ragtime&quot;, gained fame through compositions like &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; and &quot;The Entertainer&quot;. Ragtime influenced early jazz, Harlem stride piano, Piedmont blues, and European classical composers such as Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, and Igor Stravinsky. Despite being overshadowed by jazz in the 1920s, ragtime has experienced several revivals, notably in the 1950s and 1970s (the latter renaissance due in large part to the use of &quot;The Entertainer&quot; in the film &quot;The Sting&quot;). The music was distributed primarily through sheet music and piano rolls, with some compositions adapted for other instruments and ensembles.

==Etymology==
While the word &quot;ragtime&quot; was first known to be used in 1896, the term probably originates in the dance events hosted by plantation slaves known as “rags”. The first recorded use of the term &quot;ragtime&quot; was by vaudeville musician Ben Harney who in 1896 used it to describe the piano music he played (which he had extracted from banjo and fiddle players).

==History==

===Origins===
Ragtime music was developed long before it was printed as sheet music. While its precise origins are unknown, scholars like Terry Waldo believe it to stem from music played by plantation slaves for dance events called “rags” (these were mentioned in newspaper articles as early as the 1820s). The musician ensemble would generally only consist of a banjo player and a fiddle player. They would play dance music like jigs, reels and schottisches, with the way the banjo is played providing the syncopation that ragtime came to be known for.

While no examples of music from this era survives, there are nevertheless some examples from before ragtime’s heyday in the 1890s. Believed to be one of the oldest preserved pieces of ragtime music is &quot;The Dream Rag&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Bull Dyke’s Dream&quot;) by Jessie Pickett. While its year of composition is unknown, Eubie Blake (who Pickett taught it to around 1900), believed it to have been written some time before the American Civil War. Unlike the march-style left hand pattern of many later rags, &quot;The Dream Rag&quot; uses a rhythm more closely related to the habanera, providing a good example of how Spanish music influenced the ragtime genre. Jesse Pickett performed &quot;The Dream Rag&quot; at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, where the greater American public were first introduced to what would become known as ragtime. Others present at the exposition were such names as Scott Joplin, Ben Harney, and Shep Edmonds (referred to by some as the “father of ragtime”).

Another surviving example of early ragtime is the music of Louis Moreau Gottschalk. While not a ragtime composer per se, there are elements in his music that are distinctly reminiscent of ragtime.

The composed ragtime of the 1890s had its origins in African American communities of the Mississippi Valley in general and St. Louis in particular. Most of the early ragtime musicians could not read or notate music, but instead played by ear and improvised. The instrument of choice by ragtime musicians during this time was usually a banjo or a piano. It was performed in brothels, bars, saloons, and informal gatherings at house parties or juke joints. These places were an excellent breeding ground for new music as European classical music was mixed with African-American folk songs.

The first ragtime composition to be published was &quot;La Pas Ma La&quot; in 1895. It was written by minstrel comedian Ernest Hogan. Kentucky native Ben Harney composed the song &quot;You&#x27;ve Been a Good Old Wagon But You Done Broke Down&quot; the following year in 1896. The composition was a hit and helped popularize the genre to the mainstream. Another early ragtime pioneer was comedian and songwriter Irving Jones.
Ragtime was also a modification of the march style popularized by John Philip Sousa. Jazz critic Rudi Blesh thought its polyrhythm may be coming from African music, although no historian or musicologist has made any connection with any music from Africa. Ragtime composer Scott Joplin (&quot;ca.&quot; 1868–1917) from Texas, became famous through the publication of the &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, chord progressions or metric patterns.

In a 1913 interview published in the black newspaper &quot;New York Age&quot;, Scott Joplin asserted that there had been &quot;ragtime music in America ever since the Negro race has been here, but the white people took no notice of it until about twenty years ago [in the 1890s].&quot;

===The heyday of ragtime===
Ragtime quickly established itself as a distinctly American form of popular music. Ragtime became the first African American music to have an impact on mainstream popular culture. Piano &quot;professors&quot; such as Jelly Roll Morton played ragtime in the &quot;sporting houses&quot; (bordellos) of New Orleans. Polite society embraced ragtime as disseminated by brass bands and &quot;society&quot; dance bands. Bands led by W. C. Handy and James R. Europe were among the first to crash the color bar in American music. The new rhythms of ragtime changed the world of dance bands and led to new dance steps, popularized by the show-dancers Vernon and Irene Castle during the 1910s. The growth of dance orchestras in popular entertainment was an outgrowth of ragtime and continued into the 1920s.

Ragtime also made its way to Europe. Shipboard orchestras on transatlantic lines included ragtime music in their repertoire. In 1912, the first public concerts of ragtime were performed in the United Kingdom by the American Ragtime Octette (ARO) at the Hippodrome, London; a group organized by ragtime composer and pianist Lewis F. Muir who toured Europe. Immensely popular with British audiences, the ARO popularized several of Muir&#x27;s rags (such as &quot;Waiting for the Robert E. Lee&quot; and &quot;Hitchy-Koo&quot;) which were credited by historian Ian Whitcomb as the first American popular songs to influence British culture and music. The ARO recorded some of Muir&#x27;s rags with the British record label The Winner Records in 1912; the first ragtime recordings made in Europe. James R. Europe&#x27;s 369th Regiment band generated great enthusiasm during its 1918 tour of France.

Ragtime was an influence on early jazz; the influence of Jelly Roll Morton continued in the Harlem stride piano style of players such as James P. Johnson and Fats Waller. Ragtime was also a major influence on Piedmont blues. Dance orchestras started evolving away from ragtime towards the big band sounds that predominated in the 1920s and 1930s when they adopted smoother rhythmic styles.

===Revivals===
There have been numerous revivals since newer styles supplanted ragtime in the 1920s. First in the early 1940s, many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire and put out ragtime recordings on 78 rpm records. A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s as a wider variety of ragtime genres of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded.

In the 1960s, two major factors brought about a greater public recognition of ragtime. The first was the publication of the book, &quot;They All Played Ragtime&quot;, in 1960, by Harriet Janis and Rudi Blesh. Some historians refer to this book as &quot;The Ragtime Bible&quot;. Regardless, it was the first comprehensive and serious attempt to document the first ragtime era, and its three most important composers, Joplin, Scott, and Lamb. The second major factor was the rise to prominence of Max Morath. Morath created two television series for National Educational Television (now PBS) in 1960 and 1962: &quot;The Ragtime Era&quot;, and &quot;The Turn of the Century&quot;. Morath turned the latter into a one-man-show in 1969, and toured the US with it for five years. Morath subsequently created different one-man-shows which also toured the US, that also educated and entertained audiences about ragtime. New ragtime composers soon followed, including Morath, Donald Ashwander, Trebor Jay Tichenor, John Arpin, William Bolcom, and William Albright.

In 1971, Joshua Rifkin released a compilation of Joplin&#x27;s work which was nominated for a Grammy Award.

In 1973, The New England Ragtime Ensemble (then a student group called The New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble) recorded &quot;The Red Back Book&quot;, a compilation of some of Joplin&#x27;s rags in period orchestrations edited by conservatory president Gunther Schuller. It won a Grammy for Best Chamber Music Performance of the year and was named Top Classical Album of 1974 by &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. The film &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973) brought ragtime to a wide audience with its soundtrack of Joplin tunes. The film&#x27;s rendering of &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, adapted and orchestrated by Marvin Hamlisch, was a Top 5 hit in 1975.

Ragtime – with Joplin&#x27;s work at the forefront – has been cited as an American equivalent of the minuets of Mozart, the mazurkas of Chopin, or the waltzes of Brahms. Ragtime also influenced classical composers including Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, and Igor Stravinsky.

Ragtime originated in African American music in the late 19th century and descended from the jigs and march music played by African American bands, referred to as &quot;jig piano&quot; or &quot;piano thumping&quot;.

By the start of the 20th century, it became widely popular throughout North America and was listened and danced to, performed, and written by people of many different subcultures. A distinctly American musical style, ragtime may be considered a synthesis of African syncopation and European classical music, especially the marches made popular by John Philip Sousa.

Some early piano rags were classified as &quot;jig&quot;, &quot;rag&quot;, and &quot;coon songs&quot;. These labels were sometimes used interchangeably in the mid-1890s, 1900s, and 1910s. Ragtime was also preceded by its close relative the cakewalk. In 1895, black entertainer Ernest Hogan released the earliest ragtime composition, called &quot;La Pas Ma La&quot;. The following year he released another composition called &quot;All Coons Look Alike to Me&quot;, which eventually sold a million copies.

Tom Fletcher, a vaudeville entertainer and the author of &quot;100 Years of the Negro in Show Business&quot;, has stated that &quot;Hogan was the first to put on paper the kind of rhythm that was being played by non-reading musicians.&quot; While the success of &quot;All Coons Look Alike to Me&quot; helped popularize the country to ragtime rhythms, its use of racial slurs created a number of derogatory imitation tunes, known as &quot;coon songs&quot; because of their use of racist and stereotypical images of black people. In Hogan&#x27;s later years, he admitted shame and a sense of &quot;race betrayal&quot; from the song, while also expressing pride in helping bring ragtime to a larger audience.

The emergence of mature ragtime is usually dated to 1897, the year in which several important early rags were published. &quot;Harlem Rag&quot; by Tom Turpin and &quot;Mississippi Rag&quot; by William Krell were both release that year. In 1899, Scott Joplin&#x27;s &quot;Maple Leaf Rag&quot; was published and became a great hit and demonstrated more depth and sophistication than earlier ragtime.

Ragtime was one of the main influences on the early development of jazz (along with the blues). Some artists, such as Jelly Roll Morton, were present and performed both ragtime and jazz styles during the period the two styles overlapped. He also incorporated the Spanish tinge in his performances, which gave a habanera or tango rhythm to his music. Jazz largely surpassed ragtime in mainstream popularity in the early 1920s, although ragtime compositions continue to be written up to the present, and periodic revivals of popular interest in ragtime occurred in the 1950s and the 1970s.

The heyday of ragtime occurred before sound recording was widely available. Like European classical music, classical ragtime has primarily been a written tradition distributed though sheet music. But sheet music sales ultimately depended on the skill of amateur pianists, which limited classical ragtime&#x27;s complexity and proliferation. A folk ragtime tradition also existed before and during the period of classical ragtime (a designation largely created by Scott Joplin&#x27;s publisher John Stillwell Stark), manifesting itself mostly through string bands, banjo and mandolin clubs (which experienced a burst of popularity during the early 20th century) and the like. Ragtime was also distributed via piano rolls for mechanical player pianos. While the traditional rag was fading in popularity, a genre called novelty piano (or novelty ragtime) emerged that took advantage of new advances in piano roll technology and the phonograph record to permit a more complex, pyrotechnic, performance-oriented style of rag to be heard. Chief among the novelty rag composers is Zez Confrey, whose &quot;Kitten on the Keys&quot; popularized the style in 1921.

Ragtime also served as the roots for stride piano, a more improvisational piano style popular in the 1920s and 1930s. Elements of ragtime found their way into much of the American popular music of the early 20th century. It also played a central role in the development of the musical style later referred to as Piedmont blues; indeed, much of the music played by such artists of the style as Reverend Gary Davis, Blind Boy Fuller, Elizabeth Cotten, and Etta Baker could be referred to as &quot;ragtime guitar.&quot;

Although most ragtime was composed for piano, transcriptions for other instruments and ensembles are common, notably including Gunther Schuller&#x27;s arrangements of Joplin&#x27;s rags. Ragtime guitar continued to be popular into the 1930s, usually in the form of songs accompanied by skilled guitar work. Numerous records emanated from several labels, performed by Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and others. Occasionally, ragtime was scored for ensembles (particularly dance bands and brass bands) similar to those of James Reese Europe or as songs like those written by Irving Berlin. Joplin had long-standing ambitions of synthesizing the worlds of ragtime and opera, to which end the opera &quot;Treemonisha&quot; was written. However, its first performance, poorly staged with Joplin accompanying on the piano, was &quot;disastrous&quot; and was never performed again in Joplin&#x27;s lifetime. The score was lost for decades, then rediscovered in 1970, and a fully orchestrated and staged performance took place in 1972. An earlier opera by Joplin, &quot;A Guest of Honor&quot;, has been lost.

==Musical form==
The rag was a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. It was usually written in or time with a predominant left-hand pattern of bass notes on strong beats (beats 1 and 3) and chords on weak beats (beat 2 and 4) accompanying a syncopated melody in the right hand. According to some sources the name &quot;ragtime&quot; may come from the &quot;ragged or syncopated rhythm&quot; of the right hand. A rag written in time is a &quot;ragtime waltz&quot;.

Ragtime is not a meter in the same way that marches are in duple meter and waltzes are in triple meter; it is rather a musical style that uses an effect that can be applied to any meter. The defining characteristic of ragtime music is a specific type of syncopation in which melodic accents occur between metrical beats. This results in a melody that seems to be avoiding some metrical beats of the accompaniment by emphasizing notes that either anticipate or follow the beat (&quot;a rhythmic base of metric affirmation, and a melody of metric denial&quot;). The ultimate (and intended) effect on the listener is actually to accentuate the beat, thereby inducing the listener to move to the music. Scott Joplin, the composer/pianist known as the &quot;King of Ragtime&quot;, called the effect &quot;weird and intoxicating.&quot; He also used the term &quot;swing&quot; in describing how to play ragtime music: &quot;Play slowly until you catch the swing...&quot;.

The name swing later came to be applied to an early style of jazz that developed from ragtime. Converting a non-ragtime piece of music into ragtime by changing the time values of melody notes is known as &quot;ragging&quot; the piece. Original ragtime pieces usually contain several distinct themes, four being the most common number. These themes were typically 16 bars, each theme divided into periods of four four-bar phrases and arranged in patterns of repeats and reprises. Typical patterns were AABBACCC′, AABBCCDD and AABBCCA, with the first two strains in the tonic key and the following strains in the subdominant. Sometimes rags would include introductions of four bars or bridges, between themes, of anywhere between four and 24 bars.

In a note on the sheet music for the song &quot;Leola&quot; Joplin wrote, &quot;Notice! Don&#x27;t play this piece fast. It is never right to play &#x27;ragtime&#x27; fast.&quot; E. L. Doctorow used the quotation as the epigraph to his novel &quot;Ragtime&quot;.

==Related forms and styles==
Ragtime pieces came in a number of different styles during the years of its popularity and appeared under a number of different descriptive names. It is related to several earlier styles of music, has close ties with later styles of music, and was associated with a few musical fads of the period such as the foxtrot. Many of the terms associated with ragtime have inexact definitions and are defined differently by different experts; the definitions are muddled further by the fact that publishers often labelled pieces for the fad of the moment rather than the true style of the composition. There is even disagreement about the term &quot;ragtime&quot; itself; experts such as David Jasen and Trebor Tichenor choose to exclude ragtime songs from the definition but include novelty piano and stride piano (a modern perspective), while Edward A. Berlin includes ragtime songs and excludes the later styles (which is closer to how ragtime was viewed originally). The terms below should not be considered exact, but merely an attempt to pin down the general meaning of the concept.

* Cakewalk – a pre-ragtime dance form popular until about 1904. The music is intended to be representative of an African American dance contest in which the prize is a cake. Many early rags are cakewalks.
* Characteristic march – a march incorporating idiomatic touches (such as syncopation) supposedly characteristic of the race of their subject, which is usually African Americans. Many early rags are characteristic marches.
* Two-step – a pre-ragtime dance form popular until about 1911. A large number of rags are two-steps.
* Slow drag – another dance form associated with early ragtime. A modest number of rags are slow drags.
* Coon song – a pre-ragtime vocal form popular until about 1901. A song with crude, racist lyrics often sung by white performers in blackface. Gradually died out in favor of the ragtime song. It was strongly associated with ragtime in its day.
* Ragtime song – the vocal form of ragtime, more generic in theme than the coon song. Though this was the form of music most commonly considered &quot;ragtime&quot; in its day, many people today prefer to put it in the &quot;popular music&quot; category. Irving Berlin was the most commercially successful composer of ragtime songs, and his &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot; (1911) was the single most widely performed and recorded piece of this sort, even though it contains virtually no ragtime syncopation. Gene Greene was a famous singer in this style.
* Folk ragtime – ragtime that originated from small towns or assembled from folk strains, or at least sounded as if they did. Folk rags often have unusual chromatic features typical of composers with non-standard training.
* Classic rag – the Missouri-style ragtime popularized by Scott Joplin, James Scott, and others.
* Foxtrot – a dance fad that began in 1913. Fox-trots contain a dotted-note rhythm different from that of ragtime, but which nonetheless was incorporated into many late rags.
* Novelty piano – a piano composition emphasizing speed and complexity, which emerged after World War I. It is almost exclusively the domain of white composers.
* Stride piano – a style of piano that emerged after World War I, developed by and dominated by black East-coast pianists (James P. Johnson, Fats Waller, and Willie &#x27;The Lion&#x27; Smith). Together with novelty piano, it may be considered a successor to ragtime, but is not considered by all to be &quot;genuine&quot; ragtime. Johnson composed the song that is arguably most associated with the Roaring Twenties, &quot;Charleston.&quot; A recording of Johnson playing the song appears on the compact disc &quot;James P. Johnson: Harlem Stride Piano&quot; (Jazz Archives No. 111, EPM, Paris, 1997). Johnson&#x27;s recorded version has a ragtime flavor.

==American ragtime composers==
==Influence on European composers==
European Classical composers were influenced by the form. The first contact with ragtime was probably at the Paris Exposition in 1900, one of the stages of the European tour of John Philip Sousa. The first notable classical composer to take a serious interest in ragtime was Antonín Dvořák. French composer Claude Debussy emulated ragtime in three pieces for piano. The best-known remains the &quot;Golliwog&#x27;s Cake Walk&quot; (from the 1908 Piano Suite &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot;). He later returned to the style with two preludes for piano: &quot;Minstrels&quot;, (1910) and &quot;General Lavine-excentric&quot; (from his 1913 Préludes), which was inspired by a Médrano circus clown.

Erik Satie, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, and the other members of Les Six in Paris never made any secret of their sympathy for ragtime, which is sometimes evident in their works. Consider, in particular, the ballet of Satie, &quot;Parade (Ragtime du Paquebot),&quot; (1917) and &quot;La Mort de Monsieur Mouche&quot;, an overture for piano for a drama in three acts, composed in the early 1900s in memory of his friend J. P. Contamine de Latour. In 1902 the American cakewalk was very popular in Paris and Satie two years later wrote two rags, &quot;La Diva de l&#x27;empire&quot; and &quot;Piccadilly&quot;. Despite the two Anglo-Saxon settings, the tracks appear American-inspired. &quot;La Diva de l&#x27;empire&quot;, a march for piano soloist, was written for Paulette Darty and initially bore the title &quot;Stand-Walk Marche&quot;; it was later subtitled &quot;Intermezzo Americain&quot; when Rouarts-Lerolle reprinted it in 1919. &quot;Piccadilly&quot;, another march, was initially titled &quot;The Transatlantique&quot;; it presented a stereotypical wealthy American heir sailing on an ocean liner on the New York–Europe route, going to trade his fortune for an aristocratic title in Europe. There is a similar influence in Milhaud&#x27;s ballets &quot;Le boeuf sur le toite&quot; and &quot;Creation du Monde&quot;, which he wrote after a visit to Harlem during his trip in 1922. Even the Swiss composer Honegger wrote works in which the influence of African American music is pretty obvious. Examples include &quot;Pacific 231&quot;, &quot;Prélude et Blues&quot; and especially the &quot;Concertino&quot; for piano and orchestra.

Igor Stravinsky wrote a solo piano work called &quot;Piano-Rag-Music&quot; in 1919 and also included a rag in his theater piece &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du soldat&quot; (1918).

==Revivals==
In the early 1940s, many jazz bands began to include ragtime in their repertoire, and as early as 1936 78 rpm records of Joplin&#x27;s compositions were produced. Old numbers written for piano were rescored for jazz instruments by jazz musicians, which gave the old style a new sound. The most famous recording of this period is Pee Wee Hunt&#x27;s version of Euday L. Bowman&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Street Rag.&quot;

A more significant revival occurred in the 1950s. A wider variety of ragtime styles of the past were made available on records, and new rags were composed, published, and recorded. Much of the ragtime recorded in this period is presented in a light-hearted novelty style, looked to with nostalgia as the product of a supposedly more innocent time. A number of popular recordings featured &quot;prepared pianos&quot;, playing rags on pianos with tacks on the hammers and the instrument deliberately somewhat out of tune, supposedly to simulate the sound of a piano in an old honky tonk.

Four events brought forward a different kind of ragtime revival in the 1970s. First, pianist Joshua Rifkin released a compilation of Scott Joplin&#x27;s work, &quot;Scott Joplin: Piano Rags&quot;, on Nonesuch Records, which was nominated in 1971 for a Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance – Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (without orchestra) category. This recording reintroduced Joplin&#x27;s music to the public in the manner the composer had intended, not as a nostalgic stereotype but as serious, respectable music. Second, the New York Public Library released a two-volume set of &quot;The Collected Works of Scott Joplin&quot; which renewed interest in Joplin among musicians and prompted new stagings of Joplin&#x27;s opera &quot;Treemonisha&quot;. Next came the release and Grammy Award for The New England Ragtime Ensemble&#x27;s recording of &quot;The Red Back Book,&quot; Joplin tunes edited by Gunther Schuller. Finally, with the release of the film &quot;The Sting&quot; in 1973, which had a Marvin Hamlisch soundtrack of Joplin rags, ragtime was brought to a wide audience. Hamlisch&#x27;s rendering of Joplin&#x27;s 1902 rag &quot;The Entertainer&quot; won an Academy Award, and was an American Top 40 hit in 1974, reaching No. 3 on May 18. Ragtime news and reviews publications during this period included &quot;The Ragtime Review&quot; (1962–1966), &quot;The Rag Times&quot; (bimonthly/sporadic, 1962–2003), and &quot;The Mississippi Rag&quot; (monthly, 1973–2009).

In 1980, an adaption of E. L. Doctorow&#x27;s historical novel &quot;Ragtime&quot; was released on screen. Randy Newman composed its music score, which was all original. In 1998, a stage version of &quot;Ragtime&quot; was produced on Broadway. With music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, the show featured several rags as well as songs in other musical styles.

<text>Shlomo Yitzchaki (; ; ; 13 July 1105) was a French rabbi who authored comprehensive commentaries on the Talmud and Hebrew Bible. He is commonly known by the Rabbinic acronym Rashi ().

Born in Troyes, Rashi studied Torah studies in Worms under German rabbi Yaakov ben Yakar and French rabbi Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, both of whom were pupils of the famed scholar Gershom ben Judah. After returning to Troyes, Rashi joined the , began answering halakhic questions and later served as the &#x27;s head after the death of Zerach ben Abraham.

Rashi is generally considered a leading biblical exegete in the Middle Ages. Acclaimed for his ability to present the basic meaning of the text in a concise and lucid fashion, Rashi&#x27;s commentaries appeal to both learned scholars and beginning students, and his works remain a centerpiece of contemporary Torah study. A large fraction of rabbinic literature published since the Middle Ages discusses Rashi, either using his view as supporting evidence or debating against it. His commentary on the Talmud, which covers nearly all of the Babylonian Talmud, has been included in every edition of the Talmud since its first printing by Daniel Bomberg in the 1520s. His commentaries on the Tanakh—especially his commentary on the Chumash (the &quot;Five Books of Moses&quot;)—serves as the basis of more than 300 &quot;supercommentaries&quot; which analyze Rashi&#x27;s choice of language and citations, penned by some of the greatest names in rabbinic literature.

==Name==
Rashi&#x27;s surname, Yitzhaki, derives from his father&#x27;s name, Yitzhak. The acronym &quot;Rashi&quot; stands for Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki, but is sometimes fancifully expanded as Rabban Shel YIsrael which means the &quot;Rabbi of Israel&quot;, or as Rabbenu SheYichyeh (Our Rabbi, may he live). He may be cited in Hebrew and Aramaic texts as (1) &quot;Shlomo son of Rabbi Yitzhak&quot;, (2) &quot;Shlomo son of Yitzhak&quot;, (3) &quot;Shlomo Yitzhaki&quot;, and myriad similar highly respectful derivatives.

In older literature, Rashi is sometimes referred to as &quot;Jarchi&quot; or &quot;Yarhi&quot; (), his abbreviated name being interpreted as Rabbi Shlomo Yarhi. This was understood to refer to the Hebrew name of Lunel in Provence, popularly derived from the occitan &quot;luna&quot; &quot;moon&quot;, in Hebrew , in which Rashi was assumed to have lived at some time or to have been born, or where his ancestors were supposed to have originated. Later Christian writers Richard Simon and Johann Christoph Wolf claimed that only Christian scholars referred to Rashi as Jarchi, and that this epithet was unknown to the Jews. Bernardo de Rossi, however, demonstrated that Hebrew scholars also referred to Rashi as Yarhi. In 1839, Leopold Zunz showed that the Hebrew usage of Jarchi was an erroneous propagation of the error by Christian writers, instead he interpreted the abbreviation as: Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki. The evolution of this term has been thoroughly traced.

==Biography==
===Birth and early life===
Rashi was an only child born at Troyes, Champagne, in northern France. His mother&#x27;s brother was Simeon bar Isaac, rabbi of Mainz. Simon was a disciple of Gershom ben Judah, who died that same year. On his father&#x27;s side, Rashi has been claimed to be a 33rd-generation descendant of Johanan HaSandlar, who was a fourth-generation descendant of Gamaliel, who was reputedly descended from the Davidic line. In his voluminous writings, Rashi himself made no such claim at all. The main early rabbinical source about his ancestry, Responsum No. 29 by Solomon Luria, makes no such claim either.

===Legends===
His fame later made him the subject of many legends. One tradition contends that his parents were childless for many years. Rashi&#x27;s father, Yitzhak, a poor winemaker, once found a precious jewel and was approached by non-Jews who wished to buy it to adorn their idol. Yitzhak agreed to travel with them to their land, but en route, he cast the gem into the sea. Afterwards he was visited by either the Voice of God or the prophet Elijah, who told him that he would be rewarded with the birth of a noble son &quot;who would illuminate the world with his Torah knowledge.&quot;

Another legend also states that Rashi&#x27;s parents moved to Worms, Germany while Rashi&#x27;s mother was pregnant. As she walked down one of the narrow streets in the Jewish quarter, she was imperiled by two oncoming carriages. She turned and pressed herself against a wall, which opened to receive her. This miraculous niche is still visible in the wall of the Worms Synagogue.

Additional legends, particularly in Hasidic literature, postulate that Rashi&#x27;s tremendous works and accomplishments were inspired by the Holy Spirit, the &quot;Shekhinah,&quot; as no mere human could produce such immense works. One text goes so far as to claim that Rashi was beyond human; the author proposes that he never died a natural death, but rather ascended to Heaven alive like the immortal prophet Elijah.

===Yeshiva studies===

According to tradition, Rashi was first brought to learn Torah by his father on Shavuot day at the age of five. His father was his main Torah teacher until his death when Rashi was still a youth. At the age of 17 he married and soon after went to learn in the yeshiva of Yaakov ben Yakar in Worms, returning to his wife three times yearly, for the Days of Awe, Passover and Shavuot. When Yaakov died in 1064, Rashi continued learning in Worms for another year in the yeshiva of his relative, Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, who was also chief rabbi of Worms. Then he moved to Mainz, where he studied under another of his relatives, Isaac ben Judah, the rabbinic head of Mainz and one of the leading sages of the Lorraine region straddling France and Germany.

Rashi&#x27;s teachers were students of Rabbeinu Gershom and Eliezer Hagadol, leading Talmudists of the previous generation. From his teachers, Rashi imbibed the oral traditions pertaining to the Talmud as they had been passed down for centuries, as well as an understanding of the Talmud&#x27;s logic and forms of argument. Rashi took concise, copious notes from what he learned in yeshiva, incorporating this material in his commentaries. He was also greatly influenced by the exegetical principles of Menahem Kara.

===Career===
He returned to Troyes at the age of 25, after which time his mother died, and he was asked to join the Troyes &quot;Beth din&quot; (rabbinical court). He also began answering halakhic questions. Upon the death of the head of the &quot;Bet din&quot;, Zerach ben Abraham, Rashi assumed the court&#x27;s leadership and answered hundreds of halakhic queries.
At some time around 1070 he founded a yeshiva, which attracted many disciples. Jewish oral tradition contends that he was a vintner. There is no evidence for this, although Rashi shows an extensive knowledge of winemaking utensils and process. One responsum from his school refers to a barrel of wine marked with Rashi&#x27;s import seal. The soil around Troyes is not suited to growing grapes, but some vineyards are known to have existed anyway, due to the great local demand for wine.

Although there are many legends about his travels, Rashi likely never went further than from the Seine to the Rhine; his furthest destinations were the yeshivas of Lorraine.

In 1096, the People&#x27;s Crusade swept through the Lorraine, murdering 12,000 Jews and uprooting whole communities. Among those murdered in Worms were the three sons of Isaac ben Eliezer Halevi, Rashi&#x27;s teacher. Rashi wrote several &quot;Selichot&quot; (penitential poems) mourning the slaughter and the destruction of the region&#x27;s great yeshivot. Seven of Rashi&#x27;s &quot;Selichot&quot; still exist, including &quot;Adonai Elohei Hatz&#x27;vaot&quot;, which is recited on the eve of Rosh Hashanah, and &quot;Az Terem Nimtehu&quot;, which is recited on the Fast of Gedalia.

===Death and burial site===
Rashi died on July 13, 1105 (Tammuz 29, 4865) at the age of 65. He was buried in Troyes. The approximate location of the cemetery in which he was buried was recorded in &quot;Seder ha-Dorot&quot;, but over time the location of the cemetery was forgotten. A number of years ago, a Sorbonne professor discovered an ancient map depicting the site of the cemetery, which lay under an open square in the city of Troyes. After this discovery, French Jews erected a large monument in the center of the square—a large, black and white globe featuring the three Hebrew letters of רשי artfully arranged counterclockwise in negative space, evoking the style of Hebrew microcalligraphy. The granite base of the monument is engraved: &quot;Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki — Commentator and Guide&quot;.

In 2005, Yisroel Meir Gabbai erected an additional plaque at this site marking the square as a burial ground. The plaque reads: &quot;The place you are standing on is the cemetery of the town of Troyes. Many Rishonim are buried here, among them Rabbi Shlomo, known as Rashi the holy, may his merit protect us&quot;.

===Descendants===
Rashi had no sons. All of his three children were girls, named Yocheved, Miriam and Rachel. He invested himself in their education; his writings and the legends which surround him suggest that his daughters were well-versed in the Torah and the Talmud (at a time when women were not expected to study) and would help him when he was too weak to write. His daughters married his disciples; most present-day Ashkenazi rabbinical dynasties can trace their lineage back to his daughters Miriam or Yocheved.

A late-20th century legend claims that Rashi&#x27;s daughters wore tefillin. While a few women in medieval Ashkenaz did wear tefillin, there is no evidence that Rashi&#x27;s daughters did.

* Rashi&#x27;s oldest daughter, Yocheved, married Meir ben Samuel; their four sons were Shmuel (Rashbam; born 1080), Yitzchak (Rivam; born 1090), Jacob (Rabbeinu Tam; born 1100), and Shlomo the Grammarian, all of whom were among the most prolific Tosafists. Yocheved&#x27;s daughter, Channah, is reputed to have instructed the local women to recite the blessing after candle lighting (instead of before).
* Rashi&#x27;s middle daughter, Miriam, married Judah ben Nathan, who completed the commentary on the Talmud Makkot. Their daughter Alvina was a learned woman whose customs served as the basis for later halakhic decisions. Their son Yom Tov later moved to Paris and headed a yeshiva there, together with his brothers Shimshon and Eliezer.
* Rashi&#x27;s youngest daughter, Rachel, married (and divorced) Eliezer ben Shemiah. Little else is known about her.
It is reputed that the famous Polish Talmudist Moses Isserles (1530–1572) was a descendant of Rashi.

Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Tanakh—and especially his commentary on the Chumash—is the essential companion for any study of the Bible among Orthodox Jews. Drawing on the breadth of Midrashic, Talmudic and Aggadic literature (including literature that is no longer extant), as well as his knowledge of Hebrew grammar and halakhah, Rashi clarifies the &quot;simple&quot; meaning of the text so that a bright child of five could understand it. At the same time, his commentary forms the foundation for some of the most profound legal analysis and mystical discourses that came after it. Scholars debate why Rashi chose a particular Midrash to illustrate a point, or why he used certain words and phrases and not others. Shneur Zalman of Liadi wrote that &quot;Rashi&#x27;s commentary on Torah is the &#x27;wine of Torah&#x27;. It opens the heart and uncovers one&#x27;s essential love and fear of G-d.&quot;

Scholars believe that Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Torah grew out of the lectures he gave to his students in his yeshiva, and evolved with the questions and answers they raised on it. Rashi completed this commentary only in the last years of his life. It was immediately accepted as authoritative by all Jewish communities, Ashkenazi and Sephardi alike.

The first dated Hebrew printed book was Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Chumash, printed by Abraham ben Garton in Reggio di Calabria, Italy, 18 February 1475. (This version did not include the text of the Chumash itself.)

Rashi wrote commentaries on all the books of Tanakh except Chronicles I &amp; II, and Ezra–Nehemiah. His commentary to Job is incomplete, ending at 40:25.

A main characteristic of Rashi&#x27;s writing was his focus on grammar and syntax. His primary focus was on word choice, and &quot;essentially [he acts] as a dictionary where he defines unusual Hebrew words.&quot; He searches for things that may not be clear to the reader and offers clarification on the inconsistency that may be present. Rashi does so by &quot;filling in missing information that [helps] lead to a more complete understanding&quot; of the Torah. A portion of his writing is dedicated to making distinctions between the &quot;peshat&quot;, or plain and literal meaning of the text, and the &quot;aggadah&quot; or rabbinic interpretation. Rashbam, one of Rashi&#x27;s grandchildren, heavily critiqued his response on his &quot;commentary on the Torah [being] based primarily on the classic midrashim (rabbinic homilies).&quot;

Rashi himself explained his method as utilizing both &quot;peshat&quot; and &quot;derash&quot;: &quot;I, however, am only concerned with the plain sense of Scripture (&quot;peshuto shel mikra&quot;) and with such Agadoth that explain the words of Scripture in a manner that fits in with them.&quot; In one place, he quotes a midrash and then states &quot;But this midrash cannot be reconciled with Scripture for several reasons... Therefore I say: let scripture be reconciled according to its simple meaning, clearly, and the midrash may also be expounded, as is said: &#x27;Is not My word... like a hammer which shatters the rock?&#x27; - it is divided into many fragments.&quot;

===Commentary on the Talmud===
An early printing of the Talmud ([[Ta&#x27;anit]] 9b); Rashi&#x27;s commentary is at the bottom of the right column, continuing for a few lines into the left column. [Note: According to [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes|R&#x27; Zvi Chajes]], the &quot;Rashi&quot; commentary on Ta&#x27;anit was not written by Rashi]

Rashi wrote the first comprehensive commentary on the Talmud, covering nearly all of the Babylonian Talmud (a total of 30 out of 39 tractates, due to his death). The commentary, drawing on his knowledge of the entire contents of the Talmud, attempts to provide a full explanation of the words and of the logical structure of each Talmudic passage. Unlike other commentators, Rashi does not paraphrase or exclude any part of the text, but elucidates phrase by phrase. Often he provides punctuation in the unpunctuated text, explaining, for example, &quot;This is a question&quot;; &quot;He says this in surprise&quot;, &quot;He repeats this in agreement&quot;, etc.

As in his commentary on the Tanakh, Rashi frequently illustrates the meaning of the text using analogies to the professions, crafts, and sports of his day. He also translates difficult Hebrew or Aramaic words into the spoken French language of his day, giving latter-day scholars a window into the vocabulary and pronunciation of Old French.

Rashi&#x27;s Talmud commentary spread quickly, reaching Jews as far as Yemen by mid-12th century. It has been included in every version of the Talmud since its first printing in the fifteenth century. It is always situated towards the middle of the opened book display; i.e., on the side of the page closest to the binding.

Some of the other printed commentaries which are attributed to Rashi were composed by others, primarily his students. Akiva Eger stated that the commentary on Nazir was not in fact by Rashi, while Zvi Hirsch Chajes stated that the commentary on Taanit was not by Rashi. In some editions of the Talmud, the text indicates that Rashi died before completing the tractate, and that it was completed by a student. This is true of Makkot (the end of which was composed by his son-in-law, Judah ben Nathan), and of Bava Batra (finished, in a more detailed style, by his grandson the Rashbam). The commentary attributed to Rashi on Horayot was thought by some to have been written by Judah ben Nathan, but evidence was uncovered indicating that the commentary on Horayot was from the school of Gershom ben Judah. There is a legend that the commentary on Nedarim, which is clearly not his, was actually composed by his daughters. Another legend states that Rashi died while writing a commentary on Talmud, and that the very last word he wrote was &#x27;tahor,&#x27; which means pure in Hebrew - indicating that his soul was pure as it left his body.

===Responsa===
About 300 of Rashi&#x27;s responsa and halakhic decisions are extant. Although some may find contradictory to Rashi&#x27;s intended purpose for his writings, these responsa were copied, preserved, and published by his students, grandchildren, and other future scholars. &quot;Siddur Rashi&quot;, compiled by an unknown student, also contains Rashi&#x27;s responsa on prayer. Many other rulings and responsa are recorded in Mahzor Vitry. Other compilations include &quot;Sefer Hapardes&quot;, probably edited by Shemaiah of Troyes, Rashi&#x27;s student, and &quot;Sefer Haorah&quot;, prepared by Nathan Hamachiri.

Rashi&#x27;s writing is placed under the category of post-Talmudic, for its explanation and elaboration on the Talmud; however, he not only wrote about the meaning of Biblical and Talmudic passages, but also on liturgical texts, syntax rules, and cases regarding new religions emerging. Some say that his responsa allows people to obtain &quot;clear pictures of his personality,&quot; and shows Rashi as a kind, gentle, humble, and liberal man. They also illustrate his intelligence and common sense.

Rashi&#x27;s responsa not only addressed some of the different cases and questions regarding Jewish life and law, but it shed light into the historical and social conditions which the Jews were under during the First Crusade. He covered the following topics and themes in his responsa: linguistic focus on texts, law related to prayer, food, and the Sabbath, wine produced by non-Jews, oaths and excommunications, sales, partnerships, loans and interest, bails, communal affairs, and civil law. Rashi&#x27;s responsa can be broken down into three genres: questions by contemporary sages and students regarding the Torah, the law, and other compilations.

For example, in his writing regarding relations with the Christians, he provides a guide for how one should behave when dealing with martyrs and converts, as well as the &quot;insults and terms of [disgrace] aimed at the Jews.&quot; Stemming from the aftermath of the Crusades, Rashi wrote concerning those who were forced to convert, and the rights women had when their husbands were killed.

Rashi focused the majority of his responsa, if not all, on a &quot;meticulous analysis of the language of the text&quot;.

=== Poetry ===
Rashi wrote several selichot (penitential prayers), some of which are still recited today as part of the Jewish liturgy. These include:

* &quot;Nora va&#x27;Elyonim&quot;, which is recited by Ashkenazi Jews on the eve of Rosh Hashanah. Historically it was also recited on the eve of Yom Kippur.
* &quot;Ophan Echad ba&#x27;Aretz&quot;
* &quot;Az Terem Nimtechu&quot;, which is recited by Ashkenazim on the Fast of Gedaliah.
* &quot;Akh Leilohim Nafshi Domi&quot;
* &quot;Apekha Hashev&quot;
* &quot;Torah haTemimah&quot;, apparently about the Rhineland massacres.
* &quot;Tefillah l&#x27;Kademkha&quot;, which was included in the 1613 prayerbook of the Old Synagogue of Prague.

Other poems are sometimes falsely attributed to Rashi. The above list is probably not exhaustive, but no evidence exists to connect Rashi to other poems.

==Assessment and legacy==
Rashi was one of the first authors to write in Old French (the language he spoke in everyday life, which he used alongside Hebrew), as most contemporary French authors instead wrote in Latin. As a consequence, besides its religious value, his work is valued for the insight it gives into the language and culture of Northern France in the 11th century. His commentaries on the Tanakh—especially his commentary on the Chumash (the &quot;Five Books of Moses&quot;)—serves as the basis of more than 300 &quot;supercommentaries&quot; which analyze Rashi&#x27;s choice of language and citations, penned by some of the greatest names in rabbinic literature.

===Commentary on the Tanakh===

Tens of thousands of men, women and children study &quot;Chumash with Rashi&quot; as they review the Torah portion to be read in synagogue on the upcoming Shabbat. According to halakha, a man may even fulfill of the requirement of Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum by reading Rashi&#x27;s commentary rather than the standard Targum Onkelos. Since its publication, Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Torah is standard in almost all Chumashim produced within the Orthodox Jewish community. Many people who study Rashi along with Tanakh use the term &quot;Chumash with Rashi&quot;.

Mordechai Leifer of Nadvorna said that anyone who learns the weekly Parsha together with the commentary by Rashi every week is guaranteed to sit in the Yeshiva (school) of Rashi in the Afterlife.

Voluminous supercommentaries have been published on Rashi&#x27;s Bible commentaries, including &quot;Gur Aryeh&quot; by Judah Loew (the Maharal), &quot;Sefer ha-Mizrachi&quot; by Elijah Mizrachi (the Re&#x27;em), and &quot;Yeri&#x27;ot Shlomo&quot; by Solomon Luria (the Maharshal). Menachem Mendel Schneerson, in his &quot;Rashi Sichos&quot;, often addresses several of these commentaries at once.

Rashi&#x27;s influence grew the most in the 15th century; from the 17th century onwards, his commentaries were translated into many other languages. Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Pentateuch was known as the first printed Hebrew work. English translations include those of Rosenbaum and Silbermann and ArtScroll.

===Commentary on the Talmud===

Rashi&#x27;s commentary on the Talmud continues to be a key basis for contemporary rabbinic scholarship and interpretation. Without Rashi&#x27;s commentary, the Talmud would have remained a closed book.

Rashi&#x27;s commentary had a profound influence on subsequent Talmud study and scholarship:
The presence of Rashi&#x27;s commentary also changed the nature of subsequent Talmud commentaries:
In general, Rashi&#x27;s commentary provides the &quot;peshat&quot; or literal meaning of the Talmud, while subsequent commentaries such as the Tosafot often go beyond the passage itself in terms of arguments, parallels, and distinctions that could be drawn out. This addition to Jewish texts was seen as causing a &quot;major cultural product&quot; which became an important part of Torah study.
In the standard printed Talmud, the Tosafot&#x27;s commentaries can be found in the Talmud opposite Rashi&#x27;s commentary. The Tosafot also added comments and criticism in places where Rashi had not added comments.

Rashi also exerted a decisive influence on establishing the correct text of the Talmud. Up to and including his age, texts of each Talmudic tractate were copied by hand and circulated in yeshivas. Errors often crept in: sometimes a copyist would switch words around, and other times incorporate a student&#x27;s marginal notes into the main text. Because of the large number of merchant-scholars who came from throughout the Jewish world to attend the great fairs in Troyes, Rashi was able to compare different manuscripts and readings in Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, Midrash, Targum, and the writings of the Geonim, and determine which readings should be preferred. However, in his humility, he deferred to scholars who disagreed with him. For example, in Chulin 4a, he comments about a phrase, &quot;We do not read this. But as for those who do, this is the explanation...&quot;

===Influence in non-Jewish circles===
Rashi&#x27;s commentaries on the Bible, especially those on the Pentateuch, circulated in many different communities. In the 12th–17th centuries, Rashi&#x27;s influence spread from French and German provinces to Spain and the east. He had a tremendous influence on Christian scholars. The French monk Nicholas de Lyra, who was known as the &quot;ape of Rashi&quot;, relied on Rashi&#x27;s commentary when writing his &quot;Postillae Perpetuate&quot;, one of the primary sources used in Luther&#x27;s translation of the Bible. He believed that Rashi&#x27;s commentaries were the &quot;official repository of Rabbinical tradition&quot; and significant to understanding the Bible. Rashi&#x27;s commentaries became significant to humanists at this time who studied grammar and exegesis. Christian Hebraists studied Rashi&#x27;s commentaries as important interpretations &quot;authorized by the Synagogue&quot;.

Although Rashi had an influence on communities outside of Judaism, his lack of connection to science prevented him from entering the general domain, and he remained more popular among the Jewish community.

In his book &quot;Demystifying Islam&quot;, Muslim apologist Harris Zafar cites Rashi for the view that the Song of Songs is not an erotic poem narrated by a man about a woman, but is instead a poem narrated by God about the people of Israel, a point of importance to Muslims because of their belief, which Zafar summarizes, that the Song of Songs, at Chapter 5, Verse 16, mentions Muhammad by name, a supposition that might be problematic if the mention were in an erotic context.

==&quot;Rashi script&quot;==


The semi-cursive typeface in which Rashi&#x27;s commentaries are printed both in the Talmud and Tanakh is often referred to as &quot;Rashi script.&quot; Despite the name, Rashi himself did not use such a script: the typeface is based on a 15th-century Sephardic semi-cursive hand, postdating Rashi&#x27;s death by several hundred years. Early Hebrew typographers such as the Soncino family and Daniel Bomberg employed in their editions of commented texts (such as the Mikraot Gedolot and the Talmud, in which Rashi&#x27;s commentaries prominently figure) what would become called &quot;Rashi script&quot; to distinguish the rabbinic commentary from the primary text proper, for which they used a square typeface.

<text>Redmond is a city in King County, Washington, United States, located east of Seattle. The population was 73,256 at the 2020 census.

Redmond is best known as the home of Microsoft and Nintendo of America. The city has a large technology industry in addition to being a bedroom community for Seattle, which lies across Lake Washington on State Route 520.

With an annual bike race on city streets and the state&#x27;s only velodrome, Redmond is also known as the &quot;Bicycle Capital of the Northwest&quot;.

==History==
Native Americans have lived in the Redmond area for about 10,000 years, based on artifacts discovered at the Redmond Town Center archaeological site and Marymoor Prehistoric Indian Site. The first European settlers arrived in the 1870s. Luke McRedmond filed a Homestead Act claim for land next to the Sammamish Slough on September 9, 1870, and the following year Warren Perrigo took up land adjacent to him. The rivers and streams had so many salmon that the settlement was initially named Salmonberg. More settlers came, and with the establishment of the first post office in 1881, the name of the community was changed to Melrose. The new name was derived from the Perrigos&#x27; successful inn, Melrose House, which upset McRedmond. After becoming postmaster, he successfully petitioned to have the name changed to Redmond in 1883.

The abundant forests and fish of Redmond provided jobs for loggers and fishermen, and with those jobs came demand for goods and services, bringing in merchants. The logging industry expanded significantly in 1889 when the Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway built a station in the center of town. The first plat for Redmond was filed on May 11, 1891, encompassing much of the area now known as downtown. After reaching the necessary population of 300, Redmond was incorporated on December 31, 1912.

Redmond experienced an economic downturn in the 1920s. Prohibition forced saloons to close, cutting off a large portion of the city&#x27;s tax base. The forests were declining after heavy logging, causing lumber mills to shut down. The deforested land was suitable for farming. Agriculture became Redmond&#x27;s primary business, keeping residents fed during the Great Depression. When the U.S. entered World War II, shipyard jobs and other wartime work came to Redmond.

After the war, Redmond&#x27;s expansion began in earnest. The city expanded over thirty times larger in area through annexations between 1951 and 1967. From 1956 to 1965, Redmond was bordered by the town of East Redmond, which was formed by rural homeowners and later dissolved by the Washington Supreme Court. The completion of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge across Lake Washington in 1963 allowed Redmond to flourish as a suburb of Seattle. In 1978, the U.S. Census Bureau proclaimed Redmond the fastest growing city in the state. Many technology companies made the city their home, and the increasing population demanded more retail shops. By the late 1980s, Downtown Redmond had become &quot;a series of strip centers surrounded by parking lots&quot;, sparking plans for a mixed-use revitalized downtown.

Redmond underwent a commercial boom during the 1990s, primarily due to Nintendo of America and Microsoft establishing their respective headquarters within the city in 1984 and 1986 respectively, culminating in 1997 with the opening of Redmond Town Center, a major regional shopping center on the site of a long-defunct golf course. In recent years the city has seen rising traffic congestion as a result of its rapid expansion, particularly in areas of urban sprawl. To address these issues, SR 520 is undergoing expansion. Light rail service connecting Downtown Redmond to Seattle via Sound Transit&#x27;s 2 Line is scheduled to begin on May 10, 2025. A shorter section connecting Overlake to Bellevue opened in April 2024.

==Geography==

Redmond is bordered by Kirkland to the west, Bellevue to the southwest, and Sammamish to the southeast. Unincorporated King County lies to the north (with Woodinville a short distance beyond) and east.

The city is divided into several neighborhoods that form a ring around downtown Redmond. The Overlake neighborhood, which also encompasses part of Bellevue, lies southwest of downtown and includes the Microsoft headquarters campus and other office complexes as well as residential areas. The predominantly residential neighborhood of Education Hill lies north of downtown and was named for the five schools in the area, including Redmond High School; it was previously known as Poverty Hill until the 1950s, when it was annexed into Redmond.

The secular Overlake School has over 550 students at its Novelty Hill campus, which was established in 1972, and operates a branch school in Pailin, Cambodia.

DigiPen Institute of Technology, a for-profit university that focuses on video game development, moved from Vancouver to Redmond in 1998. A local community college, the Lake Washington Institute of Technology, built its Redmond campus near Marymoor Park in 2005. Since 2018, it has leased a portion of its building to the Redmond city government for use as a community center.

The city is home to Redmond Regional Library, the second-largest branch in the King County Library System. The building opened on November 20, 1999, and replaced a smaller building that opened in 1975 and was deemed too small for the growing community. Redmond had been annexed into the King County Library System in 1947 shortly after the system was created through a county referendum.

<text>Rise of the Triad: Dark War is a first-person shooter video game, developed and published by Apogee Software (now 3D Realms) in 1995. The player can choose to play as one of five different characters, each bearing unique attributes such as speed and endurance. The game&#x27;s story follows these five characters who have been sent to investigate a deadly cult, and soon become aware of a deadly plot to destroy a nearby city. A remake was designed by Interceptor Entertainment and released by Apogee Games in 2013. The shareware version of the game is titled Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins.

The game began as a follow-up game to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, but was soon altered and became a stand-alone game. It includes both single-player and multi-player functions, allowing individuals to connect with other gamers and tackle missions as a team. It is powered by a modified version of the &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; engine and it was supposed to be called &quot;Wolfenstein 3D II: the Rise of the Triad&quot;. The idea was scrapped by id Software and Apogee Software bought the license of that game.

==Gameplay==
Like most early first-person shooter games, the single-player mode&#x27;s objective is to collect keys in order to proceed through the levels. Occasionally, special tactics and simple problem-solving skills are required to reach locations. Although most levels are fairly linear, there are some maps which have multiple exits.

The player chooses between five characters: Taradino Cassatt, Thi Barrett, Lorelei Ni, Doug Wendt, and Ian Paul Freeley. The characters differ in three characteristics: hit points, speed, and accuracy. Taradino Cassatt is the only character available in the shareware version of the game and has average statistics: average hit points, average speed, average accuracy.

Certain enemies can beg for their life if they take enough damage, or fake their death. Some enemies dodge the player&#x27;s attacks, while others lie on the ground to ambush the player. Other enemies can shoot nets to restrain the player, or steal and use weapons from the player. There are also four bosses. All enemies are digitized actors, mostly played by Apogee employees and their friends and family.

On random occasions, there are an especially large amount of gibs produced when an enemy is killed, presenting the player with a &quot;Ludicrous Gibs!&quot; message. The amount of gibs can be controlled through the options menu, which allows the player to set the graphics to various levels of goriness, from completely bloodless to extreme.

There are 13 weapons in the game, divided into three groups: bullet weapons (using infinite ammunition), missile weapons (using limited ammunition), and magic weapons. The missile weapons constitute the bulk of the arsenal, and usually have a wide area of effect. Magic weapons, like missile weapons, hold limited ammunition. Players can carry a total of four weapons at once: all three bullet weapons (a single pistol, dual pistols, and a submachine gun) and either a missile or a magic weapon.

Only one power-up can be active at once, and power-up effects last for a limited time.

Jump pads catapult a player in the air. By stepping onto one, the player character is propelled straight up, while by running up to it the player character can make long jumps. Jump pads are often required for getting past certain obstacles or reaching a ledge to retrieve a key. They can also be used for collecting powerups and bonuses.

Destructible objects such as ornaments or plants may block secret doors. If light poles and firepots are shot, the area dims. Glass can be shattered by shooting or running through it.

Bonuses are awarded for various achievements whenever a level is completed. Examples are picking up all the missile weapons in a level, using all the healing items, or ending a level with minimal hit points remaining.

The multiplayer mode (called COMM-BAT in the game) allows up to eleven players simultaneously. Each can have separate uniform colors, but in team mode, teams are defined by uniform color.

There are nine multiplayer modes. These include a standard deathmatch mode, and the similar &quot;Score More&quot;, which assigns different points depending on the weapon and way that a kill was done. Other modes consist of collecting or destroying as many triad symbols as possible. There are a few &quot;tag&quot; multiplayer modes, similar to the children&#x27;s game, where a player must tag another player or moving symbols. There is also a &quot;Hunter&quot; mode, in which a &quot;prey&quot; player with no weapons has to be hunted by the rest, and a capture the flag mode. Options that can be set for a multiplayer game include player attributes, and whether or not health refills, missile weapons, or traps are spawned.

==Plot==
A team of special operatives known as the HUNT (High-risk United Nations Task-force) is sent to San Nicolas Island to investigate deadly cult activity taking place in an ancient monastery. Their boat, the only way back, is destroyed by patrols, and the team soon learns that the cult plans to systematically destroy nearby Los Angeles. The operatives, now unable to return whence they came, are then left to fight their way into the monastery on the island and eventually put a stop to the cult&#x27;s activities.

During its early stages of development, &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; was initially meant to serve as the sequel to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, titled &quot;Wolfenstein 3D II: Rise of the Triad&quot;. The presence of the Walther PP pistol, the MP 40 submachine gun, the bazooka, and the outfits worn by the enemies allude to Nazi Germany and imply the original aforementioned intent for the development of &quot;RotT&quot;.

==Development history==
===Original concept===
&quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; began its life as a follow-up to &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; (though it reportedly shares some similarities with director Tom Hall&#x27;s &quot;Doom Bible&quot;, which laid out Hall&#x27;s conception of the video game &quot;Doom&quot; and even shares the name of one of the protagonists). The working titles of the game were &quot;Wolfenstein II&quot; and &quot;Wolfenstein 3D: Rise of the Triad&quot;. It was to use the same game engine code as &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, and have new levels, art, and characters. The artwork took around six months to do. As the game was getting into deeper development, project leader Scott Miller was contacted by John Romero, informing Miller that the project had been cancelled. Miller suspected that this was because id Software did not want to draw the spotlight away from the upcoming &quot;Doom&quot;. In order to keep as many of the numerous game assets the team had already created from going to waste, Tom Hall came up with a new storyline which still incorporated the Nazi themes seen in the Wolfenstein series, however they would ultimately depart from plotlines involving Nazis, with the final narrative concerning a cult apparently inspired by the Californian folk legend of the Dark Watchers or &#x27;los vigilantes oscuros&#x27;.

According to the Apogee website, the original storyline was the following: After the fall of Hitler, the true powers behind him have drawn into seclusion, planning their next strategy for world domination. Three large corporations guided Hitler as a puppet, and now plan the subjugation of the planet to their organization, the Triad. Their new plan: having developed nuclear weapons and new V-3 rockets to carry them, they plan to get a stranglehold on the world with the threat of Armageddon.

===Engine===
The engine is an enhanced variant of the Wolfenstein 3D engine. The level design uses 90-degree walls and unvarying floor and ceiling heights in individual maps, limitations that are vestiges of the Wolfenstein 3D engine. However, the &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; engine also includes features not possible with the original Wolfenstein 3D engine, such as elevation, panoramic skies, simulated dynamic lighting, fog, bullet holes, breakable glass walls, and level-over-level environments (made possible by &quot;gravitational anomaly disks&quot;, suspended objects that collectively form stairs, floors, etc.). The level layouts were created with Tile Editor version 5 (TED5), which was also released with &quot;Extreme Rise of the Triad&quot; for users to customize their own maps.

===Developers of Incredible Power===
The team behind &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; called itself The Developers of Incredible Power (DIP). Its name was created by Tom Hall, the lead designer of &quot;RotT&quot;. Other members of DIP included Mark Dochtermann, Jim Dosé, Steve Hornback, Chuck Jones, Nolan Martin, Tim Neveu, William Scarboro, Joseph Selinske, Susan Singer, and Marianna Vayntrub. &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; was the only game released by DIP. A second game that was planned, &quot;Prey&quot;, never took off, but its title and parts of the original design were eventually recycled by Human Head Studios. The team was disbanded, and some of the members worked on the bestseller &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. Others started their own companies or left the computer games business. Scarboro died from an asthma attack in 2002.

===Cut elements===
Several planned elements were cut from the game, including female versions of certain enemies, like Low Guards, Strike Force soldiers, and the Overpatrol. Originally the game was going to load both sets of guards into memory, then determine randomly which to place at each appropriate point. This had the side effect of making memory requirements much higher than normal for the time, so in order to conserve performance, the alternate versions of the enemies were removed. Stills of the alternate enemies can be seen during the credits, as &quot;actors who were cut from the game&quot;. Other cuts survived, like the ROTT Reject Level Pack (stages that were cut) and some artwork (some can be found on the CD). There is a motion capture session that was not used in the final game, but can be found online.

==Release==
===Game releases===
As with most Apogee games, the game was distributed as shareware, with the first episode released for free. The shareware episode, which contains ten original levels, is titled &quot;Rise of the Triad: The HUNT Begins&quot;. This version has some limitations, including the ability to play only as Taradino Cassatt, and the availability of only four of the multiplayer modes. A &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; of the shareware version, marketed in retail by LaserSoft, contains three extra levels, and three extra multiplayer levels that are not available on any other version.

There are several versions of the full or paid game, which includes three new episodes. The floppy disk and CD versions both contain 32 game levels for the three new episodes, with the CD version containing more multiplayer levels. The Site License version contains several multiplayer levels, and allows the game to be played in multiplayer mode in up to 11 different computers in a single network, without each requiring a different copy of the game.

In 2009, &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; was released on GOG.com through DOSBox, making it compatible with Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS.

===Expansion packs===
On July 25, 1995, Apogee released a &quot;Reject Level Pack&quot; as freeware online. This pack is a collection of multiplayer maps deemed unsuitable for the original release. Some of these were serious attempts at levels (one even attempted to recreate a popular deathmatch level ((1-5) from &quot;Doom&quot;), and some were not (like one played inside the popular character Dopefish). The final level of the pack causes the game to crash intentionally.

An official retail add-on level pack was released by Apogee for &quot;ROTT&quot; entitled &quot;Extreme Rise of the Triad&quot;, also in 1995. The add-on was produced by two key members from the original team, Tom Hall and Joe Siegler. Generally the maps produced in this add-on are considerably harder than the original game&#x27;s maps due to tricks that Hall and Siegler had learned in the editor since the release of the original. It also includes some user made level editors, a random level generator from Apogee, maps, and sound files. The levels were released as freeware on September 1, 2000. The remaining materials on the &quot;Extreme ROTT&quot; CD were released as freeware online as part of a &quot;ROTT Goodies Pack&quot; on February 15, 2005.

There are a few other level packs released from Apogee, including &quot;Lasersoft Deluxe Shareware Maps&quot;. They are identical to the released shareware packs, except that they include six exclusive levels. After Lasersoft went out of business, Apogee released these levels in October 1999.

Another is a level called &quot;Wolf3D&quot;, which was done by Siegler as an exercise to see if he could replicate the level geography from &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; in &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot;, as &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; uses the same basic game engine. The level copies the complete level geography from Episode 1 Level 1 of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. Some of the adjoining levels were added, but not completely.

The final release from Hall and Siegler was the &quot;Ohio RTC&quot; pack. This is a four level multiplayer pack which was designed for a group in Ohio that was holding a game tournament called &#x27;BloodFest 96&#x27;. After the tournament was over, the pack was released online for everyone.

The final level to be released by anyone from the original team was one level done by Siegler called &quot;You &amp; Spray&quot; (Spray was an internal nickname given to the NME boss character by the developers). This was done by Siegler as a gag in 1998, mostly as a personal exercise to see if he could remember how to still use the level editor. After mentioning its existence online, Siegler was cajoled into releasing it in November 2000. It was posted for download at the &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; page on the Apogee website.

===Source code===
The source code to &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; was released under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later on 20 December 2002. Fans of the game ported it to AmigaOS, Linux, Mac OS, Xbox, Dreamcast, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS (homebrew) and 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows. This has led to the game being included in the Fedora software repository, which downloads the free source port engine used as well as a free installer which downloads the shareware version&#x27;s data.

=== Remaster ===
On September 6, 2020, during 3D Realms&#x27; &quot;Realms Deep 2020&quot; livestream, the game was shown running on Nintendo Switch and confirmed for modern platforms (Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One) for a 2021 release. At Realms Deep 2022, this was re-announced as &quot;Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition&quot;, developed by Nightdive Studios and co-published by Apogee Entertainment and New Blood Interactive. It will be released on the aforementioned platforms, as well as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A demo was released on June 19, 2023. It was released on July 31, 2023 (September 29, 2023 for consoles), coinciding with the tenth anniversary of the 2013 remake. It features the option to toggle between the OPL and MIDI versions of the original soundtrack and the 2013 remake&#x27;s soundtrack by Andrew Hulshult.

==Reception==

Scott Miller estimates that the game eventually sold around 110,000 copies.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; assessed that &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; is an entertaining but ultimately undistinguished &quot;Doom&quot; replica which fails to rank with the best of the genre. Remarking that the game &quot;has its own style but never strays far enough from the &quot;Doom&quot; herd to fully break free&quot;, he gave it three out of five stars.

The iOS version was not very well received and has Metacritic and GameRankings scores of respectively 49/100 and 49.00%.

==Remake==
In 2009, Scott Miller said that &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; would be remade. Gameplay footage of the new &quot;Rise of the Triad&quot; was revealed at QuakeCon 2012. The game was designed by Frederik Schreiber and his company Interceptor Entertainment and was released on July 31, 2013, through Steam and GOG.com.

<doc id="26560" wikidata="Q7990" url="?curid=26560" title="Rurik">
<text>Rurik (also spelled Rorik, Riurik or Ryurik; ; ; died 879) was a Varangian chieftain of the Rus&#x27; who, according to tradition, was invited to reign in Novgorod in the year 862. The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; states that Rurik was succeeded by his kinsman Oleg who was regent for his infant son Igor.
Traditionally, Rurik has been considered the founder of the Rurik dynasty, which was the ruling dynasty of Kievan Rus&#x27; and its principalities, and ultimately the Tsardom of Russia, until the death of Feodor I in 1598.

== Life ==
The earliest mention of Rurik is contained in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, traditionally ascribed to Nestor and compiled in , which states that East Slavic and Finnic tribes in 860–862 (including the Chuds, Slovenes, Krivichs, Meryans and Ves) &quot;drove the Varangians back beyond the sea, refused to pay them tribute, and set out to govern themselves&quot;. Afterwards the tribes started fighting each other and decided to invite the Varangians, led by Rurik, to reestablish order. Rurik came along with his younger brothers Sineus and Truvor and a large retinue.

According to the chronicle, Rurik was one of the Rus&#x27;, a Varangian tribe. Most historians believe that the Rus&#x27; were of Scandinavian origin, more specifically from what is currently coastal eastern Sweden around the eighth century. According to the prevalent theory, the name &quot;Rus&quot;″ is derived from an Old Norse term for &quot;the men who row&quot;, from an older name for the Swedish coastal area of Roslagen.

Sineus established himself at Beloozero, and Truvor at the town of Izborsk. Truvor and Sineus died shortly after the establishment of their territories, and Rurik consolidated these lands into his own territory, extending his rule in northern Russia. Askold and Dir, followers of Rurik who were sent to Constantinople, seized Kiev before launching an attack recorded in Byzantine sources for the year 860.

The Laurentian Codex of 1377, which contains the oldest surviving version of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, states that Rurik first settled in Novgorod (&quot;newtown&quot;), while the Hypatian Codex of the 1420s states that Rurik first settled in Ladoga, before moving his seat of power to the newly founded city of Novgorod, a fort built not far from the source of the Volkhov River, where he stayed until his death.

Rurik is said to have remained in power until his death some time in the 870s. On his deathbed, Rurik bequeathed his realm to Oleg, who belonged to his kin, and entrusted to Oleg&#x27;s hands his son Igor, for he was very young. Oleg moved the capital to Kiev (by murdering the then-rulers and taking the city) and founded the state of Kievan Rus&#x27;, which was ruled by Rurik&#x27;s successors (his son Igor and Igor&#x27;s descendants). The state persisted until the Mongol invasion in 1240.

==Legacy==
Rurik does not appear in the regnal list in the opening section of the &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; (compiled 1425); the list of &quot;knyazi&quot; (&quot;princes&quot;) of Kiev starts with &quot;Dir and Askold&quot;, followed by &quot;Oleg&quot;, and then &quot;Igor&quot;.

The Rurikids were the ruling dynasty of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and ultimately the Tsardom of Russia, until 1598, and numerous noble families claim male-line descent from Rurik. The last Rurikid to rule Russia as tsar was Vasily IV, who reigned until 1610 and was from the House of Shuysky. The Romanovs were also related to the descendants of Rurik through marriage. The descendants of the princely families allegedly inherited from Rurik are still living.

The king Michał Korybut Wiśniowiecki reigned in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth until 1673; a member of the House of Wiśniowiecki, who traditionally traced their descent to the Gediminids, recent studies side with a Rurikid origin of the House of Zbaraski and its cadet branches including the House of Wiśniowiecki.

==Alternative theories==

The name &quot;Rurik&quot; is a form of the Old Norse name &quot;Hrœrekr&quot;. Rorik of Dorestad was a member of one of two competing families reported by the Frankish chroniclers as having ruled the nascent Danish kingdom at Hedeby. He may have been a nephew of king Harald Klak. He is mentioned as receiving lands in Friesland from Emperor Louis I. He plundered neighbouring lands: he took Dorestad in 850, attacked Hedeby in 857, and looted Bremen in 859, while his own lands were ravaged in his absence. The Emperor was enraged and stripped him of all his possessions in 860. After that, Rorik disappears from western sources for a considerable period of time. In 862, according to Russian sources, Rurik arrived in the eastern Baltic and built the fortress of Ladoga. Later he moved to Novgorod.

Rorik of Dorestad reappeared in Frankish chronicles in 870, when his Friesland demesne was returned to him by Charles the Bald. In 882, Rorik is mentioned as dead (without a specific date of death). The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; places the death of Rurik of Novgorod in 879, three years earlier than the Frankish chronicles. According to western sources, the ruler of Friesland was converted to Christianity by the Franks.

The idea of identifying Rurik of Rus&#x27; with Rorik of Dorestad was revived by the anti-Normanists Boris Rybakov and Anatoly H. Kirpichnikov in the mid-20th century, but Alexander Nazarenko and other scholars have objected to it.

<text>In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated (or spanned) by its columns. This corresponds to the maximal number of linearly independent columns of . This, in turn, is identical to the dimension of the vector space spanned by its rows. Rank is thus a measure of the &quot;nondegenerateness&quot; of the system of linear equations and linear transformation encoded by . There are multiple equivalent definitions of rank. A matrix&#x27;s rank is one of its most fundamental characteristics.

The rank is commonly denoted by or ; sometimes the parentheses are not written, as in .

== Main definitions ==

In this section, we give some definitions of the rank of a matrix. Many definitions are possible; see Alternative definitions for several of these.

The column rank of is the dimension of the column space of , while the row rank of is the dimension of the row space of .

A fundamental result in linear algebra is that the column rank and the row rank are always equal. (Three proofs of this result are given in , below.) This number (i.e., the number of linearly independent rows or columns) is simply called the rank of .

A matrix is said to have full rank if its rank equals the largest possible for a matrix of the same dimensions, which is the lesser of the number of rows and columns. A matrix is said to be rank-deficient if it does not have full rank. The rank deficiency of a matrix is the difference between the lesser of the number of rows and columns, and the rank.

The rank of a linear map or operator formula_1 is defined as the dimension of its image:formula_2where formula_3 is the dimension of a vector space, and formula_4 is the image of a map.

== Examples ==
The matrix
formula_5
has rank 2: the first two columns are linearly independent, so the rank is at least 2, but since the third is a linear combination of the first two (the first column plus the second), the three columns are linearly dependent so the rank must be less than 3.

The matrix
formula_6
has rank 1: there are nonzero columns, so the rank is positive, but any pair of columns is linearly dependent. Similarly, the transpose
formula_7
of has rank 1. Indeed, since the column vectors of are the row vectors of the transpose of , the statement that the column rank of a matrix equals its row rank is equivalent to the statement that the rank of a matrix is equal to the rank of its transpose, i.e., .

==Computing the rank of a matrix==

=== Rank from row echelon forms ===

A common approach to finding the rank of a matrix is to reduce it to a simpler form, generally row echelon form, by elementary row operations. Row operations do not change the row space (hence do not change the row rank), and, being invertible, map the column space to an isomorphic space (hence do not change the column rank). Once in row echelon form, the rank is clearly the same for both row rank and column rank, and equals the number of pivots (or basic columns) and also the number of non-zero rows.

For example, the matrix given by
formula_8
can be put in reduced row-echelon form by using the following elementary row operations:
formula_9
The final matrix (in reduced row echelon form) has two non-zero rows and thus the rank of matrix is 2.

=== Computation ===
When applied to floating point computations on computers, basic Gaussian elimination (LU decomposition) can be unreliable, and a rank-revealing decomposition should be used instead. An effective alternative is the singular value decomposition (SVD), but there are other less computationally expensive choices, such as QR decomposition with pivoting (so-called rank-revealing QR factorization), which are still more numerically robust than Gaussian elimination. Numerical determination of rank requires a criterion for deciding when a value, such as a singular value from the SVD, should be treated as zero, a practical choice which depends on both the matrix and the application.

== Proofs that column rank = row rank ==

===Proof using row reduction===
The fact that the column and row ranks of any matrix are equal forms is fundamental in linear algebra. Many proofs have been given. One of the most elementary ones has been sketched in . Here is a variant of this proof:

It is straightforward to show that neither the row rank nor the column rank are changed by an elementary row operation. As Gaussian elimination proceeds by elementary row operations, the reduced row echelon form of a matrix has the same row rank and the same column rank as the original matrix. Further elementary column operations allow putting the matrix in the form of an identity matrix possibly bordered by rows and columns of zeros. Again, this changes neither the row rank nor the column rank. It is immediate that both the row and column ranks of this resulting matrix is the number of its nonzero entries.

We present two other proofs of this result. The first uses only basic properties of linear combinations of vectors, and is valid over any field. The proof is based upon Wardlaw (2005). The second uses orthogonality and is valid for matrices over the real numbers; it is based upon Mackiw (1995). Both proofs can be found in the book by Banerjee and Roy (2014).

===Proof using linear combinations===
Let be an matrix. Let the column rank of be , and let be any basis for the column space of . Place these as the columns of an matrix . Every column of can be expressed as a linear combination of the columns in . This means that there is an matrix such that . is the matrix whose th column is formed from the coefficients giving the th column of as a linear combination of the columns of . In other words, is the matrix which contains the multiples for the bases of the column space of (which is ), which are then used to form as a whole. Now, each row of is given by a linear combination of the rows of . Therefore, the rows of form a spanning set of the row space of and, by the Steinitz exchange lemma, the row rank of cannot exceed . This proves that the row rank of is less than or equal to the column rank of . This result can be applied to any matrix, so apply the result to the transpose of . Since the row rank of the transpose of is the column rank of and the column rank of the transpose of is the row rank of , this establishes the reverse inequality and we obtain the equality of the row rank and the column rank of . (Also see Rank factorization.)

===Proof using orthogonality===
Let be an matrix with entries in the real numbers whose row rank is . Therefore, the dimension of the row space of is . Let be a basis of the row space of . We claim that the vectors are linearly independent. To see why, consider a linear homogeneous relation involving these vectors with scalar coefficients :
formula_10
where . We make two observations: (a) is a linear combination of vectors in the row space of , which implies that belongs to the row space of , and (b) since , the vector is orthogonal to every row vector of and, hence, is orthogonal to every vector in the row space of . The facts (a) and (b) together imply that is orthogonal to itself, which proves that or, by the definition of ,
formula_11
But recall that the were chosen as a basis of the row space of and so are linearly independent. This implies that . It follows that are linearly independent.

Now, each is obviously a vector in the column space of . So, is a set of linearly independent vectors in the column space of and, hence, the dimension of the column space of (i.e., the column rank of ) must be at least as big as . This proves that row rank of is no larger than the column rank of . Now apply this result to the transpose of to get the reverse inequality and conclude as in the previous proof.

== Alternative definitions ==
In all the definitions in this section, the matrix is taken to be an matrix over an arbitrary field .

=== Dimension of image ===
Given the matrix formula_12, there is an associated linear mapping
formula_13
defined by
formula_14
The rank of formula_12 is the dimension of the image of formula_16. This definition has the advantage that it can be applied to any linear map without need for a specific matrix.

=== Rank in terms of nullity ===
Given the same linear mapping as above, the rank is minus the dimension of the kernel of . The rank–nullity theorem states that this definition is equivalent to the preceding one.

=== Column rank – dimension of column space ===
The rank of is the maximal number of linearly independent columns formula_17 of ; this is the dimension of the column space of (the column space being the subspace of generated by the columns of , which is in fact just the image of the linear map associated to ).

=== Row rank – dimension of row space ===
The rank of is the maximal number of linearly independent rows of ; this is the dimension of the row space of .

=== Decomposition rank ===
The rank of is the smallest integer such that can be factored as formula_18, where is an matrix and is a matrix. In fact, for all integers , the following are equivalent:

# the column rank of is less than or equal to ,
# there exist columns formula_19 of size such that every column of is a linear combination of formula_19,
# there exist an formula_21 matrix and a formula_22 matrix such that formula_18 (when is the rank, this is a rank factorization of ),
# there exist rows formula_24 of size such that every row of is a linear combination of formula_24,
# the row rank of is less than or equal to .

Indeed, the following equivalences are obvious: formula_26.
For example, to prove (3) from (2), take to be the matrix whose columns are formula_19 from (2).
To prove (2) from (3), take formula_19 to be the columns of .

It follows from the equivalence formula_29 that the row rank is equal to the column rank.

As in the case of the &quot;dimension of image&quot; characterization, this can be generalized to a definition of the rank of any linear map: the rank of a linear map is the minimal dimension of an intermediate space such that can be written as the composition of a map and a map . Unfortunately, this definition does not suggest an efficient manner to compute the rank (for which it is better to use one of the alternative definitions). See rank factorization for details.

=== Rank in terms of singular values ===
The rank of equals the number of non-zero singular values, which is the same as the number of non-zero diagonal elements in Σ in the singular value decomposition 

=== Determinantal rank – size of largest non-vanishing minor ===
The rank of is the largest order of any non-zero minor in . (The order of a minor is the side-length of the square sub-matrix of which it is the determinant.) Like the decomposition rank characterization, this does not give an efficient way of computing the rank, but it is useful theoretically: a single non-zero minor witnesses a lower bound (namely its order) for the rank of the matrix, which can be useful (for example) to prove that certain operations do not lower the rank of a matrix.

A non-vanishing -minor ( submatrix with non-zero determinant) shows that the rows and columns of that submatrix are linearly independent, and thus those rows and columns of the full matrix are linearly independent (in the full matrix), so the row and column rank are at least as large as the determinantal rank; however, the converse is less straightforward. The equivalence of determinantal rank and column rank is a strengthening of the statement that if the span of vectors has dimension , then of those vectors span the space (equivalently, that one can choose a spanning set that is a &quot;subset&quot; of the vectors): the equivalence implies that a subset of the rows and a subset of the columns simultaneously define an invertible submatrix (equivalently, if the span of vectors has dimension , then of these vectors span the space &quot;and&quot; there is a set of coordinates on which they are linearly independent).

=== Tensor rank – minimum number of simple tensors ===
The rank of is the smallest number such that can be written as a sum of rank 1 matrices, where a matrix is defined to have rank 1 if and only if it can be written as a nonzero product formula_30 of a column vector and a row vector . This notion of rank is called tensor rank; it can be generalized in the separable models interpretation of the singular value decomposition.

== Properties ==
We assume that is an matrix, and we define the linear map by as above.

* The rank of an matrix is a nonnegative integer and cannot be greater than either or . That is, formula_31 A matrix that has rank is said to have &quot;full rank&quot;; otherwise, the matrix is &quot;rank deficient&quot;.
* Only a zero matrix has rank zero.
* is injective (or &quot;one-to-one&quot;) if and only if has rank (in this case, we say that has &quot;full column rank&quot;).
* is surjective (or &quot;onto&quot;) if and only if has rank (in this case, we say that has &quot;full row rank&quot;).
* If is a square matrix (i.e., ), then is invertible if and only if has rank (that is, has full rank).
* If is any matrix, then formula_32
* If is an matrix of rank , then formula_33
* If is an matrix of rank , then formula_34
* The rank of is equal to if and only if there exists an invertible matrix and an invertible matrix such that formula_35 where denotes the identity matrix and the three zero matrices have the sizes , and .
* Sylvester’s rank inequality: if is an matrix and is , then formula_36 This is a special case of the next inequality.
* The inequality due to Frobenius: if , and are defined, then formula_37
* Subadditivity: formula_38 when and are of the same dimension. As a consequence, a rank- matrix can be written as the sum of rank-1 matrices, but not fewer.
* The rank of a matrix plus the nullity of the matrix equals the number of columns of the matrix. (This is the rank–nullity theorem.)
* If is a matrix over the real numbers then the rank of and the rank of its corresponding Gram matrix are equal. Thus, for real matrices formula_39 This can be shown by proving equality of their null spaces. The null space of the Gram matrix is given by vectors for which formula_40 If this condition is fulfilled, we also have formula_41
* If is a matrix over the complex numbers and formula_42 denotes the complex conjugate of and the conjugate transpose of (i.e., the adjoint of ), then formula_43

== Applications ==
One useful application of calculating the rank of a matrix is the computation of the number of solutions of a system of linear equations. According to the Rouché–Capelli theorem, the system is inconsistent if the rank of the augmented matrix is greater than the rank of the coefficient matrix. If on the other hand, the ranks of these two matrices are equal, then the system must have at least one solution. The solution is unique if and only if the rank equals the number of variables. Otherwise the general solution has free parameters where is the difference between the number of variables and the rank. In this case (and assuming the system of equations is in the real or complex numbers) the system of equations has infinitely many solutions.

In control theory, the rank of a matrix can be used to determine whether a linear system is controllable, or observable.

In the field of communication complexity, the rank of the communication matrix of a function gives bounds on the amount of communication needed for two parties to compute the function.

==Generalization==
There are different generalizations of the concept of rank to matrices over arbitrary rings, where column rank, row rank, dimension of column space, and dimension of row space of a matrix may be different from the others or may not exist.

Thinking of matrices as tensors, the tensor rank generalizes to arbitrary tensors; for tensors of order greater than 2 (matrices are order 2 tensors), rank is very hard to compute, unlike for matrices.

There is a notion of rank for smooth maps between smooth manifolds. It is equal to the linear rank of the derivative.

==Matrices as tensors==
Matrix rank should not be confused with tensor order, which is called tensor rank. Tensor order is the number of indices required to write a tensor, and thus matrices all have tensor order 2. More precisely, matrices are tensors of type (1,1), having one row index and one column index, also called covariant order 1 and contravariant order 1; see Tensor (intrinsic definition) for details.

The tensor rank of a matrix can also mean the minimum number of simple tensors necessary to express the matrix as a linear combination, and that this definition does agree with matrix rank as here discussed.

<doc id="26563" wikidata="Q6764271" url="?curid=26563" title="Marine archaeology in the Gulf of Khambhat">
<text>Marine Archeology in the Gulf of Khambhat - earlier known as Gulf of Cambay - centers around controversial findings made in December 2000 by the National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) under the Gulf of Khambhat, a bay on the Arabian Sea on the west coast of India. The structures and artifacts discovered by NIOT are the subject of contention. The major disputes surrounding the Gulf of Khambhat Cultural Complex (GKCC) are claims about the existence of submerged &quot;city-like structures&quot;, the difficulty associating dated artifacts with the site itself, and disputes about whether stone artifacts recovered at the site are actually geofacts or artifacts. One major complaint is that artifacts at the site were recovered by dredging, instead of being recovered during a controlled archeological excavation. This leads archeologists to claim that these artifacts cannot be definitively tied to the site. Because of this problem, prominent archeologists reject a piece of wood that was recovered by dredging and dated to 7500 BC as having any significance in dating the site. The surveys were followed up in the following years and two palaeo channels of old rivers were discovered in the middle of the Khambhat area under water depths, at a distance of about from the present day coast.

==Initial discovery==

On 19 May 2001, India&#x27;s Union Minister for Human Resource Development, Science and Technology division, Murli Manohar Joshi, announced that the ruins of an ancient civilization had been discovered off the coast of Gujarat, in the Gulf of Khambhat. The site was discovered by NIOT while they performed routine pollution studies using sonar, and was described as an area of regularly spaced geometric structures. It is located from the Gujarat coast, spans , and can be found at a depth of . In his announcement, Joshi represented the site as an urban settlement that pre-dates the Indus Valley civilization. Further descriptions of the site by Joshi describe it as containing regularly spaced dwellings, a granary, a bath, a citadel, and a drainage system. However it was later on 22 May, reported that the discovery has not been dated and the discovery (for example, great baths) resembles the Harappan civilization dating 4,000 years ago. Furthermore, the Indus civilization port Lothal is located at the head, Gulf of Khambhat.

==Follow-up excavations==
A follow-up investigation was conducted by NIOT in November 2001, which included dredging to recover artifacts and sonar scans to detect structures. Among the artifacts recovered were a piece of wood, pottery shards, weathered stones initially described as hand tools, fossilized bones, and a tooth. Artifacts were sent to the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) in Hyderabad, India, the Birbal Sahni Institute of Paleobotany (BSIP) in Lucknow, India, and the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India. The piece of wood was carbon dated to an age of 9,500 years old.

NIOT returned for further investigation in the Gulf from October 2002 to January 2003. During these excavations, NIOT reported finding two paleochannels flanked by rectangular and square basement-like features. Artifacts were recovered by means of dredging, including pottery sherds, microliths, wattle and daub remains, and hearth materials. These artifacts were sent for dating at the laboratories of Manipur University and Oxford University. The wattle and daub remains are composed of locally available clay, reed, husk, pottery pieces, and pieces of fresh water shell. The wattle and daub also shows evidence of partial burning.

The most recent work in the Gulf of Khambhat took place from October 2003 to January 2004 and was primarily a geologic study. Techniques used during this investigation include bathymetry survey, sub-bottom survey, side-scan survey, and magnetic survey. One of the major findings from this investigation concerns the orientation of sand ripples at the site. NIOT researchers claim that there are two sets of ripples visible at the site; one set is a natural feature formed by tidal currents, whilst they say the other set has formed in relation to underlying structural features.

===Carbon dates===
One of the main controversies surrounding the GKCC is the dated piece of wood. D. P. Agrawal, chairman of the Paleoclimate Group and founder of Carbon-14 testing facilities in India stated in an article in Frontline Magazine that the piece was dated twice, at separate laboratories. The NGRI in Hyderabad returned a date of 7190 BC and the BSIP in Hannover returned a date of 7545-7490 BC. Some archeologists, Agrawal in particular, contest that the discovery of an ancient piece of wood does not imply the discovery of an ancient civilization. Agrawal argues that the wood piece is a common find, given that 20,000 years ago the Arabian Sea was lower than its current level, and that the gradual sea level rise submerged entire forests.

=== Artifacts ===
Another controversial issue are the artifacts retrieved from the site during the various excavations. It is disputed that many of the items that have been identified as artifacts by the NIOT investigators are actually man-made. Instead their artificial nature is contested and they are argued to be stones of natural origin.

Researchers report finding shards of pottery as indicative of hand-made and wheel-turned pottery traditions. The reported shards have simple rims with small incised lines. All of the pottery fragments found so far are small or miniature shards. Part of the controversy is that some of the &quot;shards&quot; are natural geofacts and others lack any proof of any connections, as with the dated pieces of wood, with the purported &quot;ruins&quot; found by NIOT researchers. In addition, their small size also raises the possibility that the real shards have been transported from elsewhere by local, strong tidal currents. But if the pottery is genuine, researchers say it should show some similarities to Harappan pottery, which is typically red and black and stamped with seals. Based on the current pottery collection, a stylistic continuity of Harappan civilization isn&#x27;t evident. The small size of the artifact collection makes it difficult to analyse the pottery conclusively.

===Geography===
The Gulf of Khambhat was formed by a major rift that resulted in a down sliding of the Khambhat region. The area is very tectonically active today, and several faults can be found in the gulf. Periodic earthquakes also occur here. This knowledge has led several archeologists to state that the site is not in a secure enough context to be reliably dated. Because of the tectonic activity and strong currents, these archeologists claim that there is not sufficient stratification to be sure the recovered artifacts can be associated with the site.

===Collection methods===
Complaints have arisen because NIOT recovered artefacts by dredging the sea floor of the site. This method might allow errant artefacts to be collected along with those that actually correlate with the site. Analysing stratification is virtually impossible with this method as well.
